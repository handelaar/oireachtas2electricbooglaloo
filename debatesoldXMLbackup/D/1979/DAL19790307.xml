      <P>There are two separate issues here&mdash;what is decided at the Summit on broad lines and the specific arrangements that have been under negotiation in respect of the £225 million and the alleged £70 million more in grants to be provided through some sort of consortium.  That matter may not arise at the Summit.  But what I understand Deputy Cluskey to be seeking is a statement which we were promised on those facts when they were established, regardless of whether that is before or after the Summit.  We are entitled to be told when the information will be available and to be assured that it will be forthcoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I wish to raise a matter relating to the removal from the Order Paper of a question in my name.  On Tuesday last I tabled a question concerning ground rents to the Minister for Justice for oral reply.  That question appeared as No. 90 on yesterday's Order Paper but also appearing on that Order Paper as Question No. 188 was a question in similar terms from a Fianna Fáil backbencher, Deputy Killeen.  The result was that, because of the written reply having been given yesterday to Deputy Killean, my question for oral reply has now been removed from the Order Paper on the basis of its being a repeat.  However, I have checked in the Question Office and have found that the question in the name of Deputy Killeen was tabled on Thursday after the 11 o'clock deadline. Therefore, under the rules of our procedure, it should not have been on the Order Paper yesterday, and I am contending that it could only have been put on the Order Paper for yesterday as a result of contact having been made between the Office of the Minister for Justice and the Question Office.  The result is that, as an Opposition Deputy, I am not now in a position to raise the matter in the House by way of oral question today.  This is an abuse of parliamentary democracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy discussed this matter with me before we came in and I pointed out to him that the only approach to any change in what has been a long-standing practice would be to raise the matter at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I understand there is nothing irregular in what <Col N="862" /> has happened, that it is a practice as old as the House itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The only irregularity I should like to emphasise in this case is that the written reply appears, whether prompted or otherwise, to have been brought forward specially by a day for the sole purpose of excluding my oral question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the question was tabled by Deputy Killeen at 12.45 p.m. on Thursday.  That was after the 11 o'clock deadline.  It could not have appeared on yesterday's Order Paper other than as a result of contact having been made between the office of the Minister and the Question Office. That appears to be the glaring irregularity in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice has been always that, if a question is on the Order Paper, a Deputy tabling a similar question is not obliged to comply with the time schedule as laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While a question put down for written answer has always been answered on the first available day, would the Chair accept that the abuse of this practice for the purpose of suppressing oral questions is something new, something that has not occurred until this Dáil, and that the abuse that has now arisen of putting down a question out of time and by arranging with the Minister to have it brought forward to a date earlier than the date on which it should be answered is a further abuse? Can the Chair say what steps will be taken to end these abuses and may I invite the Taoiseach to discuss this practice with his Ministers and to ask them not to seek to suppress in this way discussion in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has announced that Deputy O'Keeffe discussed this matter with the Chair but, obviously, he could not forbear from discussing it publicity here and making allegations about which we know nothing. This is the first I have heard of the suggestion of collusion which has been repeated by Deputy O'Keeffe's leader. Those allegations should not be made in public unless there is some chance of investigating a complaint made directly to me, which has not been done.  This is the first I have heard of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not allege an irregularity in that respect.  I said that the procedure, as I understand it, is that if a question is put down after time it can only appear on the Order Paper a day earlier if there is discussion between the Questions Office and the Minister, a practice which takes place.  As to whether the Minister rang the Questions Office or whether the more normal procedure of the Questions Office ringing the Minister took place, I do not know nor have I alleged that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a procedure that has always applied. Whenever a question is put down for written answer, a question on the same subject on the Order Paper for oral answer is taken off.  That was always the case.  It was not so noticeable at a time when all the questions were cleared on the same day but now, with questions remaining on the Order Paper for weeks, it is more noticeable that, if a question on a certain subject is put down for a written reply, other questions on the same subject disappear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I had suspicions which I was unable to prove and yesterday I made it my business to investigate the situation.  I discovered that the question which was put down for written reply by a Fianna Fáil backbencher was put down after the deadline on Thursday. Therefore, it could not have been on the Order Paper yesterday without contact being made with the office of the Minister for Justice.  On that basis, having investigated the matter fully, I felt it only right to mention the matter in the House this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain what the position is in regard to this matter.  If a question is on the Order Paper a question on the same subject may be put down for written or oral reply without the necessity of complying with the necessary notice.  That has always been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair will appreciate the danger of abuse that this gives rise to, the possibility of abuse, and the fact that in this and in another instance a fortnight earlier affecting the same Deputy, the effect has been to prevent an oral question and supplementaries. In those circumstances I should like to ask that the rule be reconsidered and that consideration be given to a system under which, if an oral question is put down for answer, the question for written reply in relation to it be answered on the same day to prevent the oral question being ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>Since the Taoiseach has intervened in the matter and in view of the fact that the Minister for Justice is involved, it is my view that one of them should make a statement to the House now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has stated that there is no time limit, but there must be one if the Order Paper has to be printed.  Could we be informed of something which we have not been aware of, and which even in a discussion with the Chair I did not become aware of, as to what the deadline is for putting down a written question for the Order Paper?  There must be some deadline. This knowledge should not be the <Col N="866" /> privilege of Members of one side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disorderly to have a discussion on this matter here, but when I was discussing it with Deputies FitzGerald and O'Keeffe I stated that I would make reference to it if it was mentioned now.  This has been the practice down through the years. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges are fully aware of the situation. If the practice of the past is capable of being abused, that Committee should look into it.</P>

      <P>In addition to the point raised, which I agree should be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the Chair raised an issue which was new to me even after our discussion this morning&mdash;that a question for written answer can be put down without any time limit.  My understanding after our discussion was that such a question put down after the time limit could be taken in advance of the normal time that it would appear on the Order Paper by agreement between the Questions Office and the Minister.  That is a different point.  If, as appears to be the case, the Chair is suggesting that there is no time limit for such questions &mdash;I take it that means that they can be put down up to the time the Order Paper goes to print&mdash;we should be told.  I wonder if the Chair intended to convey that fact to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair did not say that there was no time limit for questions for written reply.  The Chair pointed out that it has been the practice that any question for either written or oral reply may be put down if there is a <Col N="867" /> question on the same subject on the Order Paper without the necessary time notice.  Naturally, there must be a time limit before the material goes to print.</P>

      <P>On behalf of many other new Deputies, and myself, I should like to know if I was correct in understanding the Chair to say that a Deputy, if he puts down a question for written reply which is similar to a question already on the Order Paper for oral reply, he can receive, within the due process of time, that written reply and such a reply will remove the oral questions from the Order Paper?  Does that mean that if I put down for written reply every question on the Order Paper I could clean up the Order Paper in one or two days?  I would appreciate if the Chair, now or later today, would make a statement on the matter, because it is of immense importance to all Members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The only substantive provision in the Bill provides that gaming by means of a slot-machine is &ldquo;unlawful gaming&rdquo; within the meaning of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts.  That is the only object of the Bill, which is being proposed to close off what is, in effect, a loophole in the Acts which arises following a recent Supreme Court decision.  The effect of that decision is that the type of slot-machine which delivers prizes direct to the person who operates it successfully, that is the kind which is popularly known as the &ldquo;one-armed bandit&rdquo;, may be operated without restriction anywhere, with the sole proviso that, in common with all other kinds of gaming, as defined in the Acts, such machines may not be operated in premises licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of the Oireachtas when the Principal Act, that is the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, was being amended in 1970, was that such machines should be subject to very strict control and it was very much to my surprise that the Supreme Court decided that they were not subject to such control. Before I go on to explain the sequence of events which led to the Supreme Court decision, I should like to draw attention to the fact that other <Col N="869" /> forms of slot-machines, that is, those that do not deliver when successfully operated a prize direct to the player, are subject to strict controls and have been since 1956.  Thus the machines which traditionally have been regarded as being potentially most socially harmful are at present virtually free from controls while those considered less harmful are subject to restrictions.  This anomalous situation needs to be rectified and, in my opinion, the way to do so is what is proposed in this Bill, namely, the reimposition of controls on the &ldquo;one-armed bandit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The history of the relevant provisions in the Acts is briefly as follows.  The 1956 Act outlawed the &ldquo;one-armed bandit&rdquo; completely.  This was done by section 10.  Another section, section 4, defined certain forms of gaming as &ldquo;unlawful gaming&rdquo; but other sections of the Act permitted &ldquo;unlawful gaming&rdquo; in certain very restricted circumstances. One of the kinds of gaming defined as &ldquo;unlawful gaming&rdquo; in section 4 was &ldquo;gaming by means of any slot-machine not prohibited by section 10&rdquo;.  The Acts as I have said, allow &ldquo;unlawful gaming&rdquo; in certain circumstances.  Thus such gaming may be carried on in an amusement hall or funfair licensed as such under the Acts but subject to certain strict limitations on the stake and the prize money and on the ages of those who may take part.</P>
    <P>In 1968 a Supreme Court decision declared the law in regard to slot-machines to be other than all concerned, including the gardaí and amusement caterers, had always thought it to be. The court declared that even those slot-machines which did not deliver prizes direct to the winner were subject to the total prohibition in section 10.  The Government decided to introduce legislation to restore the position to what it had been thought to be.  The Bill was modified in its passage through the Dáil and, as enacted, is the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1970.  It repealed section 10 <i>in toto.</i>  The position was then thought to be that all slot-machines whose operation came within the definition of gaming in the 1956 Act were subject to the controls on &ldquo;unlawful gaming&rdquo; provided in that Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" /> The Supreme Court, as I have said, has now declared that that is not the case.  The basis for the decision is as follows. A reference to the repealed section 10 of the 1956 Act in section 4 of that Act was not repealed by the 1970 Act and the Court concluded from that fact that section 4 did not apply to those machines which were formerly prohibited by section 10.  In consequence, the position now is that their operation does not come within the definition of &ldquo;unlawful gaming&rdquo; in section 4.  May I say that the Parliamentary Draftsman was fully satisfied in 1970 that there was no need to repeal the reference to the repealed section 10 and he believed that those machines which had been subject to the prohibition in that section would for the future be caught by section 4.  That view was not accepted by the Supreme Court, though it was by the High Court Judge who considered the case before it was appealed.</P>
    <P>The Bill in section 1 (a) proposes to restore the position to what it was thought to have been up to the recent Supreme Court decision.  The proposed deletions from sections 37 and 42 of the 1956 Act, in section 1 (b), of the Bill are purely drafting ones and cannot affect the sense of those sections.</P>
    <P>I am very much aware that there are demands from various quarters for farreaching changes in the Gaming and Lotteries Acts.  I am considering the various proposals that have been made from time to time.  This is a very complex and delicate area, however, and pressures on my Department have not so far permitted the kind of analysis that I would regard as appropriate before any important proposals for change are formulated.  In so far as pressure for an easing up on the restrictions on gambling are concerned may I say that my inclination is not to hasten to accept the proposals.</P>
    <P>This is purely a measure intended to meet what I consider to be a potentially very harmful development.  The unrestricted operation of slot-machines could have very unfortunate consequences, not only in that it would pander in a very positive way to the gambling instinct but because it is a development <Col N="871" /> that could attract the attention of very dubious if not down-right criminal elements.</P>
    <P>I have received representations from the Amusement Caterers Association of Ireland asking that legislation on the lines of this Bill be enacted.  That is not to say that they, and others, have not both now and in the past advocated further changes.  For the reasons I have already mentioned it is not my intention at this stage at any rate to propose any further changes.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I am glad the Minister has taken speedy action to close what was a dangerous loophole.  I raised this matter with him by way of parliamentary question on 14 February and it is heartening to see that this dangerous loophole is being sealed off quickly.</P>
      <P>In regard to slot machines generally, I do not believe the type of society we would wish to create and develop here should be one where slot machines of the type mentioned in the Bill should play a large part.  Everybody is aware of the family problems which have arisen in other countries because of unrestricted gambling.  Anybody who has been to America and seen the type of operations carried on in Las Vegas and similar gambling towns will appreciate the enormous profits to be made from this type of operation, but on delving further will also appreciate the very serious effects this has on society in general and on many individuals in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the overall question of a restriction on slot machines I am in agreement with the Minister.  The Supreme Court decision opened floodgates as far as slot machines were concerned.  My information is that following the decision in the Flanagan case, hundreds of slot machines have flooded into the country in the intervening period.  From that point of view we are facing a situation where very undesirable consequences could ensue.  The effect would be that slot machines could be put anywhere other than in a public house.  Unless action were taken, we could end up with a <Col N="872" /> situation such as that which obtains in Las Vegas where the craze for slot machines has gone so far that they even have them in hotel lifts.</P>
    <P>In regard to this Bill, I am glad to see it being produced quickly, but I should sound a warning note.  There are some dangers in rushing legislation through this House; I do not know if it is the Minister's intention to ask for all stages today but from the point of view of agreeing with the principle I would find it very difficult, to resist such a request. From a general point of view, rushed legislation which is not subject to careful and detailed scrutiny can result in anomalous situations being created and can result in consequences which are not foreseen at the time.  In regard to this provision, I do not see anything in this Bill which could have that result but when the short Bill was introduced in 1970, I imagine it was put through very quickly and a loophole was subsequently discovered.</P>
    <P>If the Minister needs this legislation very quickly I would have to give it to him without abandoning the point that rushed legislation is not the best from the point of view of parliamentary democracy.  I appreciate that the Minister has produced a Bill to deal with a specific situation.  I am somewhat disappointed at the indications in the Minister's speech that the overall review of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts is not making much progress.  Such a review of these Acts is necessary.  They contain some ridiculous anomalies and we have had difficulties in regard to charitable raffles and items of that nature.  I appreciate that an overall review would take some time and in that situation this very glaring loophole must be closed quickly.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and support the Minister in the action he is taking to close this loophole.  We do not want the country to be flooded with one-armed bandits and slot machines and accordingly the Minister will have my co-operation in putting this Bill through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1970 I welcomed in this House the introduction of the <Col N="873" /> controls then enacted in regard to one-armed bandits.  My view at that time was that not only should controls be introduced but if we wanted to have a better kind of society in which we did not encourage people to indulge in that form of gambling we should go the full distance and outlaw one-armed bandits.  I have been in the Dáil since 1970 and in travelling around the country I have had no reason to change my mind in regard to this matter.  Irrespective of the loss of income which would be suffered by some members of the Amusement Caterers' Association, I believe it would be entirely healthy and desirable not only to reimpose controls but to prohibit one-armed bandits.  I do not want to sound unduly moralistic, but I regard them as a temptation, particularly for young people.</P>
      <P>We have a large variety of gambling opportunities for people who want to indulge in that partime.  Bingo is played everywhere and millions are spend on race tracks and greyhound tracks.  People cannot say they are being cut off from an opportunity to gamble.  In 1970 I had some very irate letters and telephone calls from members of the Amusement Caterers' Association.  I do not believe this House should licence people to print money and that is, in effect, what a slot machine is.  There have been some very interesting reports on these machines, including one in <i>Which</i> magazine and another in a serious British newspaper.  They have dealt with the cost of the machines, the probability of winning and the kind of society associated with the operation of such machines.  One can only come to the conclusion that not only are these machines socially harmful but socially undesirable.  We could well do without that kind of rip-off.  Tourists from the UK, which has a large population of one-armed bandits, are welcome to come here but we would hope to provide them with a different form of social entertainment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the re-imposition of the controls such as they are and I hope that some time in the future some Minister for Justice will take on the vested interests. It is very difficult for any Minister to take on people who have a <Col N="874" /> fair amount of money to throw around and who, at election time in particular, bring pressure to bear on politicians to promise they will introduce amending legislation.  That kind of system should be abolished.  I welcome the statement by the Minister that it is not his intention to liberalise in any way the existing restrictions, and I am glad the Bill is being brought in expendtiously.  I am aware of a number of people, including shopkeepers, who have gone out and bought these machines.  I know of one shopkeeper who handed over a machine to someone who said he had been sent to repair it and he never saw the machine again.  The speedy enactment of this Bill is necessary and I agree to taking all Stages today.  I know that Deputy O'Keeffe has entered some reservations in that regard because in 1970 we thought we had plugged all the loopholes; then the Supreme Court took a decision and we must now plug another loophole.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill now appears fairly watertight.  I am prepared to agree to all Stages of the Bill today.  I do not know if Deputy O'Keeffe agrees with me.  I am expressing purely personal views&mdash;I am not talking for all the Deputies in my party.  I live in a constituency which adjoins an area where many people are employed in the amusement and catering trade.  The reservations I have expressed apply possibly to the future rather than to the present situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputies O'Keeffe and Desmond in welcoming the Bill.  I believe that most public representatives have had representations for and against this legislation.  Many people are interested in participating in this type of profit-making enterprise and there are a great number against it.  I am sorry the Minister has not gone further in the Bill.  I appreciate the urgency of amending legislation because I believe one-armed bandits are nothing short of what I would describe as a rip off.  The amount of money leaving the pockets of the poor and going to the wealthy through these machines is sizeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many married women who go out to shop on Fridays with their husbands' wages in their purses, because of price <Col N="875" /> increases and other pressures are anxious to increase that money and they try to do it by playing these machines.  The result is that they lose most if not all the money in their purses and indeed families have been left starving because of it.  I agree that most people are sufficiently sensible to avoid such temptation but there are many weaker people under the impression that they can make a profit.</P>
    <P>It is a horrifying sight in grocery shops in Ireland to see one-armed bandits and people putting money into them. Housewives who go to such shops have to pass these machines and many of them succumb.  Therefore, I am glad to see any legislation which curtails these activities.  If I had my way I would impose much harsher limitations on the scope of this gambling outlet.  I agree it would not be right to try to ban these machines altogether because we would then have them operating in the back rooms and other such unlikely places.</P>
    <P>I will urge on the Minister a number of remedies.  I suggest that there should be a minimum payout of 80 per cent from all these machines.  That would still leave a sizeable amount of money in the hands of the operators.  I suggest that a notice should be displayed on all such machines to this effect.  I suggest that all such machines should be specially designed with this end in view and that manufacturers&mdash;I understand these machines are being manufactured in Dublin&mdash;would be required to alter the machines to provide for such a minimum payout, that they should contain meters showing the throughput of each machine.  It should be a simple process.</P>
    <P>The manufacturers should be required to furnish the plans and specifications of all such machines and these documents should be in the hands of the proprietor for examination by Departmental inspectors. I suggest that the Minister should appoint at least one inspector in each customs and excise area in Ireland and that such inspectors would have power to inspect all gaming rooms and to examine the documents attached to these machines to ensure that the <Col N="876" /> prescribed minimum is being paid out from each machine.</P>
    <P>There would be few difficulties with the machines.  The Minister should consider this fully.  At present there is no stipulation about the amount of money to be paid out by these one-armed bandits. Normally it is something between 12.5 and 20 per cent and that is the reason that so many people are anxious to cash in on this.  We will have to have a stipulation about the minimum to be paid out and this amount should be displayed on each machines.  The Minister should also consider appointing inspectors to look after this aspect.</P>
    <P>The stamp duty on a gaming arcade at present is about £16 and the proprietor pays £1 per week for each machine installed there and £100 to the Revenue Commissioners for the licence. If a stipulation is made about the amount to be paid out, a gaming arcade should be able to pay its way and the Minister would not have to be employing additional staff at a total loss.  As far as I am aware, the machines being made in Ireland can be adapted, but machines are being imported from Britain and Europe into Ireland which are designed in such a way as to ensure that there is a rip-off, and people are being black-guarded in regard to the money they put into the slots and what they may expect to get back.  Some machines are designed to take 50p Pieces, and 50p is far too much to put in at the one time.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another point.  The Minister should consider slight amendments to some sections in the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  I refer to section 6 (1) (c) and (e), section 7 (1) (d) and section 14 (b) and (d), each of which deals with cash values in old money. There should be a regulation to stipulate that the maximum amount permitted to be paid into any machine is 10p, and indeed a person should be entitled to two plays for the one 10p.  There appears to be no real effort at present to control this situation and when I see 50p slot machines I am alarmed.  I have not seen these in the licensed gaming places but I have seen them in unlicensed premises. An effort must be made to control the situation.</P>
    <P>For a 1p play the maximum jackpot <Col N="877" /> should be £1; for a 5p play the maximum jackpot should be £5 and for a 10p it should be £10.  Some limit on those lines would be a help in curtailing this exploitation.  The Minister should consider investigating the cash values under the 1956 Act with a view to making arrangements of the type I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is taking action on this because the owners of these unlicensed machines are avoiding completely VAT, income tax and any other tax, and the money is flowing out of the country.  This legislation will help to plug that loophole.  I am glad of the restriction that local authorities have to sanction the designation of towns and areas for gambling purposes.  We will try to get the established gaming places to work within the law, and we should have legislation which makes it possible for people to work within the law so that people using these machines will know what they are paying and what they can expect to get back.  The regulations are reasonable and most of the local authorities are shying away from allowing additional arcades to be opened up.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope that the Minister will consider seriously bringing in the further restrictions that I have outlined. This is a short Bill but it is meeting a big demand.  These gaming machines have no social value.  Bingo has a social value; at least it represents a night out for people who indulge in it, but there is no social outlet in going into some of these arcades and throwing away money.  We must impose as much restriction as we can here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies from the Fine Gael and Labour Parties for their general welcome of the Bill.  I thank them for the comments they have made on what is in the Bill and for the advice which is accepted in the way in which it was given, for improvements in the overall legislation to deal with gambling.  We are all aware that no Government, Minister for Justice, or legislator would be able to stop gambling.  Since time immemorial man has been able to bet on two flies going up a wall, and the game of pitch and toss is as old as many of the old instituations <Col N="878" /> of the world.  The one thing that as a Government and a Parliament we can do is make gambling less profitable for those who promote it, and I think we are in agreement today as to that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill proper and what is in the Bill, I am glad that the need for it is clearly seen by the Oireachtas.  On 19 January we had a court case which brought about the situation which we now have, and that situation was the opening of the floodgates for a certain element in our society to let loose slot machines, not in the numbers mentioned by Deputy O'Keeffe, hundreds, but I would say by the thousand in a short period of five or six weeks.  I am told by people I meet that it is their view that many thousands of these slot machines have flooded into the country.  We are all aware that there has been a series of advertisements in the daily newspapers offering these machines at give-away prices to interested persons, urging that they be installed and using the large profit which can be got from these machines as the motive for buying, renting or leasing such machines.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general question of an overall review, which was raised by the Deputies who participated in the debate, I am very conscious that there is need for an overall review of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  I believe there is room for modernising it to deal with today's situation.  The question of reviewing legislation like this is a very big one.  We have learned from our near neighbours in the UK that when they had to tackle a problem similar to this they established a royal commission which reported last year.  This commission have produced two huge volumes of reports.  We are at present trying to wade our way through them to see what we can learn from their experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputies that the review which I believe is necessary&mdash;this view is shared by the Deputies in the House who spoke&mdash;will be undertaken as quickly as possible.  If I had to wait until I dealt with the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, in the way the House would wish it to be dealt with, before bringing in the amendment to close the loophole <Col N="879" /> as a result of the Supreme Court decision, then I am afraid many thousands more slot machines would be evident throughout the country.  That is why, within a few weeks of the Supreme Court decision, I have come into the House with this amendment.  I accept Deputy O'Keeffe's very valid point that rushed legislation is not always good legislation.  I am very satisfied that the amendment which I am now asking the House to accept is one which will successfully close the loophole.</P>
    <P>With regard to a couple of points made by Deputy Enright I am told by people who are operating slot machines since the Supreme Court decision&mdash;they know they are not breaking the law because of that decision&mdash;that the pay out would not be even up to 20 per cent of the intake.  One person told me that he would be more than willing to close his small supermarket if he could have the income from the two one-armed bandits which he has as his profit.  This profit, as Deputy Enright said, is not taxable.  I also note his suggestion that any new legislation on the examination of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 will have a section in it which will stipulate that the pay out should be 80 per cent. This suggestion has been put to me by people who are operating amusement arcades legitimately, as provided for under the existing legislation.  This will have to be considered when an overall review of the legislation is being undertaken.</P>
    <P>With regard to the 50p machines mentioned by Deputy Enright these machines are not illegal now but had been illegal before the Supreme Court met on 19 January and decided the issue before them.  The maximum stake allowed under the then existing legislation is the old sixpence, that is 2½p.  That will also have to be looked at in the course of an overall review.  Most Members of the House of all parties were disturbed by the tendency prior to the Supreme Court decision whereby slot machines were finding their way into public houses.  The publicans who were foolish enough to believe that this would be allowed saw the light.  The Garda Síochána were quite firm in dealing with the matter and I hope they will continue to do so.  I am <Col N="880" /> satisfied that the amendment before the House will successfully seal the loophole which is in the legislation as a result of the Supreme Court decision and I recommend it to the House.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 27, to delete &ldquo;footpath,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Stage of this Bill I complained about the lack of information on the purpose of the Bill and the lack of a comprehensive introductory speech.  As I did not receive such information in the Minister's closing speech it is necessary to go into the Bill fairly carefully in Committee and to try to ensure that it cannot be used in future for purposes for which it was never intended.  We have had examples in the recent past of a proposal to use a Bill for an entirely different purpose from the one for which it was introduced.  That is the reason I have put down those amendments to section 1, which is the definition section.  A public road is given a very wide definition.  It is wide enough to cover practically any thoroughfare, lane or way that may be travelled by the public.  I assume it is not the intention of the Government to impose tolls on pedestrians, to charge people for walking on the roads although if the amendment was accepted it would be possible to charge pedestrians tolls unless a subsequent amendment which I have put down is also accepted.  I would not like to think there was ever any intention of charging pedestrians tolls for using footpaths.  I would hate to see the day when people would be charged for walking on the footpaths in rural towns <Col N="881" /> or in places like Grafton Street.  If the Minister says I am being unnecessarily fearful I should like to ask him what the object is of including &ldquo;footpath&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;public road&rdquo;.  As long as a footpath comes within the definition of a public road it follows that it can be subjected to tolls in a later section of the Bill.  If it is not proposed to charge tolls now or in the future on footpaths, they should be removed from the definition of public road.  I should like to know what the Minister's attitude is on this.</P>
    <P>It is clear that if the definition of public road remains as it is and includes footpaths it will be legal for local authorities, with the permission of the Minister, to impose a toll on them.  If the Minister says this is a matter for the local authorities, I would say that the Bill could be amended to provide that the making of a toll scheme would no longer be a reserved function but could become a purely administrative matter between the chief executive of the local authority and the Minister's Department.  I am against giving the local authorities or the Minister authority which is unnececessary and absurd.  It would be absurd to impose tolls on pedestrians for using footpaths whether in a country village or on a prestigious thoroughfare such as Grafton Street.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister agrees to amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  Amendment No. 2 seeks to delete &ldquo;footpath&rdquo; while amendment No. 3 deals with that part of the definition of public road which includes &ldquo;cycle track&rdquo;.  I imagine the number of cycle tracks we have are limited.  It is not reasonable to seek to impose tolls on cycle tracks.  Another amendment which I have put down seeks to exclude pedal cyclists from tolls altogether.  In order that amendments Nos. 3 and 5 would not be conflicting, it is necessary that the definition section be amended to exclude cycle track.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties we have about the Bill is that we do not know what it is about or when, or to what extent, it will be used.  Its immediate use is probably to provide for tolls in respect of a bridge which is to be built over the Liffey.  As I said on Second Stage, if that is what the Bill is for it would have been a simple matter to give the Bill the title of the surname <Col N="882" /> of the man who proposes to build the bridge.  We would know then what it was all about.  However, we are introducing a comprehensive measure which will provide for everything from Mizen Head to Fair Head.  I am against that because the Minister does not seem to be clear in his own mind about the situation.  He has not studied the position of tolls on motorways or thoroughfares. We should be very careful not to give a blank cheque when, comparatively speaking, a few pence would meet the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is expressing unnecessary concern.  What he proposes&mdash;the deletion of the words &ldquo;footpath&rdquo; and &ldquo;cycle track&rdquo; from the definition of &ldquo;public roads&rdquo;&mdash;would mean that road authorities proposing to provide toll roads could not provide such facilities as part of the road.  They would be excluded from such a proposal. The Bill enables all possible facilities to be provided for the benefit of pedestrians and cyclists as the road authorities may see fit.</P>
      <P>Under section 3 (3) the road authority can decide that pedestrians and cyclists may not be charged tolls for the use of that road.  Under section 3 (3) (a) the road authority can decide that the toll road would be intended for use by pedestrians, other road users and cyclists while under section 3 (3) (b) they could indicate by exclusion of these types of road users that tolls would not be charged.  The definition of &ldquo;public road&rdquo; in this Bill is the same as that included in the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974 and includes every conceivable type of road facility and appurtenances.  To exclude any such facilities would limit the discretion of the road authorities as to whether they would wish to provide footpaths and cycle tracks or not.  If the Deputy's amendment were accepted by me there would be no facilities for cyclists and pedestrians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's statement that the Bill was introduced because of one proposal by one person, that is not so.  The Bill provides for toll schemes in any part of the country.  Without it we <Col N="883" /> would not consider any such schemes.  It is not to facilitate any one person.</P>

      <P>It is good legislative practice to have the same definition of &ldquo;public road&rdquo; in the various pieces of legislation.  To that extent I accept what the Minister said as being the correct procedure.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is displaying very little trust in his Fine Gael colleagues in Cavan County Council or elsewhere when he suggests that they would propose to subject footpaths to tolls.  I know he is expressing the fear that this Bill would enable certain local authorities to impose a toll.  We must recognise that if certain responsibilities are devolved to local authorities they must be given the right to make stupid decisions as well as good decisions and hope that the electorate will exercise their judgment in subsequent local elections. My concept of devolped local democracy is that people should have the right to make mistakes and should be accountable for their mistakes.

      <P>I support Deputy Fitzpatrick's misgivings because this year the Minister, in his wisdom or otherwise, has limited local authorities to a 10 per cent increase.  Everybody knows that there will be a shortage of cash for necessary works such as footpaths and rights-of-way.  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked if the floodgates would be open to private people to provide the necessary amenities for local authorities when local authorities have not got the cash to do the jobs.  We would be naïve to believe that local authorities have sufficient money to carry out necessary works.  In Kerry, where we had an increase of 10 per cent, the county manager said he was allowed 6.5 per cent in his estimate for a wage increase.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to hear the two Deputies.  On the one hand, Deputy Fitzpatrick is trying to restrict further the power of local authorities.  On the other hand, Deputy Begley blames me for having already restricted them. Surely they are at variance with each other.  If what Deputy Begley says is true, the local authority in Kerry must be different from other local authorities. If what he says is true, he should look at the structure of the local authority. There are two other reasons why the interests of the people for whom Deputy Fitzpatrick expressed concern are safeguarded in the Bill.  There is necessary provision for a public inquiry in regard to any toll proposal.  Furthermore, any such proposal has to be approved by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The House should indicate how any legislation passed by it is used and the extent to which it should be used.  If the House believes that <Col N="885" /> pedestrians should be charged for using the roads or any part thereof now or in the future, it should say so.  If the House believes, as I believe, that pedestrians should not be subjected to tolls, it should say so.  As the Bill stands we are indicating that we do not object to pedestrians being tolled.  We are saying that, as far as this Legislature is concerned, we do not object to footpaths being subjected to tolls.  I object to that. We should spell out that we, the supreme authority, do not believe that people should be charged for using footpaths and we should put that into this Bill in black and white so that there will be no tinkering with it at a later date.  The Minister said that if my amendment were to stand it would not be possible for a road authority to provide footpaths. I do not accept that and any reasonable interpretation of the definition without the word &ldquo;footpath&rdquo; could not mean what the Minister says it means.  If the word &ldquo;footpath&rdquo; is removed from the definition, a public road would not mean a footpath and there would be nothing to prevent local authorities and the Department from building a toll road or using an existing road as a toll road.  There would be nothing to prevent them building a footpath alongside it.  However, it would be illegal for them to do so and they would not have the authority to impose a toll on it.  That is the reality of the situation and there is no point in the Minister trying to say otherwise.  A public road may be subjected to a toll.  Any thing that is defined as a public road may be subjected to a toll.  Any thing that does not come within the definition of a public road cannot be subjected to a toll.  That is why I want to remove &ldquo;footpaths&rdquo; from the definition of &ldquo;public roads&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says, and I agree with him, that a local authority or he may decide that tolls will not be imposed on footpaths and on pedestrians.  When passing this enabling legislation we should preserve the rights of pedestrians to use roads and footpaths in towns and cities without payment.  It is the duty of this House to put it beyond doubt.  When we are changing the approach to road finance and maintenance and payment of the cost of roads we should ensure <Col N="886" /> that our citizens will not be charged for using the roads and footpaths.</P>
    <P>Later on in the Bill the Minister is very keen to preserve the rights of the State, the rights of the Garda Síochána, of the Army and of the ambulance service, all of whom are State agents, but he is not prepared to preserve the rights of ordinary John Citizen, a humble man who does not own a car.  He is prepared to leave him to the mercy of people whom he states will act with great wisdom.  However, he is not prepared to leave to the tender mercies of local authorities or anybody else the cars owned or operated by the Garda Síochána, the defence forces, fire brigades or ambulances.  Why the distinction? If he is prepared to leave one class of people to the discretion of those who are prepared to introduce and operate the tolls, why not do so in the case of other people?  It is just as likely that these people would behave reasonably towards one section as they would towards another section.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot have it both ways.  If he is satisfied that pedestrians will be looked after, why is he not prepared to adopt the same line with the other vehicles of State agencies that I have mentioned?  We should spell it out that irrespective of what proposals other people may have we have no proposals, now or in the future, to impose tolls on the ordinary private citizens, the pedestrians.  I am only asking the Minister to exclude them from the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have had many examples of Acts being used for purposes for which they were never intended.  If I were to develop that argument I would be ruled out of order but I mention now the imposition of duties legislation.  This was introduced for the purpose of altering existing duties, either customs or excise, but it was used to impose totally new legislation which has split this country from head to foot.  It has split the urban and rural people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The point I am making is that it is necessary when we send a Bill out of this House that we should state the purposes for which it should be used and for which it should not be used.  I have given a clear example of the gross abuse of a blank cheque given by this House on a former occasion.  I think that is a reasonable comparison to draw and a reasonable and valid argument to make within the rules of this House.  All I am is asking is that we put it beyond doubt that pedestrians be put in the same category as Garda cars, fire brigades, Army vehicles and ambulances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The elected members of the local authority are the people who are involved.  In addition, there will be a public inquiry but the final approval must come from the Minister.  Without including this in the definition of a road in the definitions section the local authority could agree to a scheme without the inclusion of these facilities for people, who could finish up without the facilities.  The Deputy knows that a local authority will not want to charge tolls on pedestrians, no matter how much he says so in this House.  To use the words of Deputy Quinn, if a silly decision is made by the elected members of a local authority the Minister can ensure that it is not put into practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the argument put forward by Deputy Fitzpatrick and I fully support it in principle. However, I dislike the idea of having two separate legal definitions of a public road.  The Deputy is a lawyer and perhaps he sees greater merit in that than I do.  In view of the principle put forward by the Deputy, with which I concur, I ask the Minister to consider accepting an amendment under section 6, which section I believe it should be in, to include pedestrians in the categories of exemption.  For example, for design reasons I can foresee that it might be <Col N="888" /> necessary to include footpath facilities of one kind or another.</P>
      <P>If one looks at the series of definitions that constitutes a public road, one sees there are all kinds of other things and I do not think they are there by accident.  I can see all kinds of legal reasons related to accident claims and so on.  In the definitions section there is reference to such matters as a roundabout, pole, bollard, wire, cable, sign, signal and so on.  I think the word &ldquo;footpath&rdquo; should be included in that section.  That is not to contradict in any way or to oppose the principle established by Deputy Fitzpatrick. The Minister has not responded to the fair criticism made by the Deputy.  The principle established by Deputy Fitzpatrick should be established by this House.  Personally, I should like to hear the Deputy elaborate as to why it should be established in the definitions section and not in the section dealing with exemptions. I agree it is a legal matter but my layman's guess is that the definitions section is not the place to include it.  It should be included in the section dealing with specific exemptions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan Monaghan</i>): With regard to Deputy Quinn's difficulty about the definition of a public road being different in this Bill from some of the other Acts or Bills mentioned by the Minister, I respectfully submit that there is no necessity for any difficulty there.  There may be different definitions of a road.  The definition we are giving to a public road here is for the purpose of tolls.  This is a definition of a public road for a new purpose and for a purpose of tolls.  This is a definition of a public road for a new purpose and for a purpose for which it was not necessary to define a road heretofore.  If I had time to research I am sure there are various definitions of different words for different purposes.  We are defining a road here for the purposes of this Bill and for no other purpose.  There will be a definition of a road for maintenance and for various other purposes that do not occur to me at the moment but here we are dealing with a definition for the purpose of tolls and for the purpose of this Bill.  I see nothing objectionable in having a definition here that meets the requirements of this Bill.  When we define a public road here it can be made subject <Col N="889" /> to tolls later on.  The neatest way of excluding pedestrians from this is to amend the title as well as accepting the amendment which I have later on in regard to the pedestrians.  I feel pretty strongly about this because when the courts are interpreting this they will be guided by what we write into it not by what we say.</P>
      <P>I do not accuse the Minister who must take responsibility for drafting the Bill, of this but there is a dangerous tendency when seeking the definition of anything to look back and get a definition somewhere else and put it in a current Bill.  There are endless examples of that and while precedents are useful they are often a lazy man's way of doing a job.  In my profession when I was active precedents were being used and extended from generation to generation where they were not necessary.  Once in regard to a sale I remember getting requisitions on title, questions that the investigating solicitor puts to the vendor's solicitor about anything that might affect the property, and I was asked if there were any railway lines running over the property.  Of course there was no railway line within 50 miles of the place, but this was following a precedent in some other requisition.  That often happens.  As Deputy Quinn said we look back and find a precedent or a previous definition and take it and write it into a current Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A definition of a public road in some previous Bill is not relevant here where we are discussing the definition of a public road for the purpose of imposing tolls.  The Minister during his contribution seemed to say that if we do not include &ldquo;footpath&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;public road&rdquo;, then the local authority could not construct a footpath along a public road.  I do not agree with that.  If Dublin Corporation were mad enough to do so, what is to prevent them from imposing a toll on Grafton Street and leaving the footpaths toll free?  There is nothing.  If we were to remove footpath from the definition of public road, Dublin Corporation could impose a toll on Grafton Street and even if they went overboard they could not impose tolls on the footpaths on either side.  The Minister should be man enough to say <Col N="890" /> that he never intended to put tolls on pedestrians and that if this is causing trouble he will write it into the Bill.  The Minister could not be advised that this would make the Bill any more effective. This definition of &ldquo;public road&rdquo; has crept into this because we are following an old definition that somebody who had a lot of time on his hands thought up a long time ago.  This is a crazy definition of &ldquo;road&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;public road&rdquo; means any road, street, lane, footpath, square, court, alley or passage and any part thereof, the responsibility for the maintenance of which lies on a road authority, and includes any bridge, viaduct, underpass, subway, tunnel, overbridge, fly-over, pipe, arch, gulley, footpath, carriageway (whether single or multiple), pavement, railing, fence, wall, barrier, guardrail, margin, layby, hard shoulder, cycle track, island, median, central reserve, channelliser, roundabout, pole, bollard, wire, cable, sign, signal or lighting forming part of the road.</P>
    <P>That is something that has been transplanted from one Bill to another. All I am asking the Minister to do is to exclude &ldquo;footpath&rdquo; so that the people may, not from any local authority but from the sovereign Parliament, have their right as pedestrians to walk the footpaths without a charge preserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Fitzpatrick is to be consistent in his concern, since we are talking about definitions, by the same token his amendment to section I should also call for the deletion of &ldquo;alley or passage&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I would respectfully agree with Deputy Quinn.  I am putting down this amendment to establish the principle. I have not available to me either the time or the dictionaries that the gentleman who drafted this definition has.  I suggest in my amendment that the thing should be taken back and that the Minister should bring in an amendment to make it clear that footpaths and other parts of roads exclusively used by pedestrians should not be subjected to <Col N="891" /> toll.  Indeed, a subsequent amendment which I have to section 6 will free pedestrians.  In order to be consistent we <Col N="892" /> must amend the definition section as well as section 6.</P>

      <P>The next part of the section deals with the competent authority as distinct from the definition of the &ldquo;road authority&rdquo;, which lists the council of a county, the corporation of a county or other borough or the council of an urban district.  There should be some reference, in whatever from the Minister considers appropriate, to the role of a harbour authority giving a harbour authority such as the Dublin Port and Docks Board a legal say in the person or the organisation who would produce the explanatory statement or participate in defining the take and the split in terms of the tolls, and so on.  I am open to suggestions as to how the harbour authority could be stitched into this definition.</P>
      <P>An independent study of the most likely and opportune locations for toll facilities, including bridges, suggested urban areas where it would take a shorter time to travel from point A to point B.  The four areas I mentioned in my Second Stage speech were Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Dublin.  There are harbour authorities in each of those four urban areas.  In this Bill we are talking about urbanised and built-up areas where the volume of traffic would be sufficient to sustain a return from an investment in toll facilities.  The fear has been expressed, and it was mentioned in the newspapers last week, that because harbour authorities are not included in the definition the Dublin Port and Docks Board will consider <i>in toto</i> their position on the live proposals currently before them.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to raise this matter because the Minister has stated repeatedly that this Bill was introduced in response to a request from the private sector to participate in investment in and the extension of our road system.  If we are to believe the reports in the newspapers&mdash;and they are confirmed by conversations I have had&mdash;the net effect of the definitions in this section is to throw cold water on the only live proposal I am aware of which is before us at the moment and which has come from the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the representations made to his Department and other Departments, in view of the public statements reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week and attributed <Col N="894" /> to the Dublin Port and Docks Board, and in view of the fact that to my knowledge this is the only specific live response from the private sector the Minister wishes to facilitate with this Bill, does the Minister not consider that the definition of a &ldquo;road authority&rdquo; should include something along the following lines: a road authority means the council of a county, the corporation of a county or other borough or the council of an urban district or a harbour authority acting in conjunction with any of the aforementioned bodies?</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting we should establish harbour authorities in their own right as independent road authorities for the purposes of this Bill.  While they may own the land on either side of the river in a built-up area, putting a bridge on it would have an immediate impact on the road system in the surrounding area which would be the responsibility of the local authority and therefore the road authority.  It would be bad practice to set up two road authorities apparently in conflict with each other.</P>
    <P>If the purpose of this Bill is to respond to a request from the private sector, as we have been told repeatedly it is, and if what we read and hear can be assumed to be correct because of the absence of a definition of a harbour authority in this section, could the Minister not get over the difficulty of apparently establishing two conflicting road authorities in the one area by adding to the definition of a &ldquo;road authority&rdquo; a harbour authority acting in conjunction with any of the aforementioned bodies?  I would leave the precise wording to the legal experts. Not including a harbour authority in the definition is counter-productive to the specific concrete response from the private sector the Minister appears to want to facilitate.</P>

But in so far as they will have some role in this, <Col N="895" /> and taking into account the benefits of a toll bridge shortcutting a long distance from one side of the river to the other, it will affect their traffic within their harbour area.  Would the Minister consider that the definition of road authority should be extended to include a harbour authority acting in conjunction with any of the aforementioned bodies, but not independently&mdash;not simply adding on harbour authority to that list of bodies, but acting in conjunction with them?</P>

      <P>First of all, with regard to protecting their rights, under the procedures for a bridge order, we would have to consult the Department of Tourism and Transport, which is the Department responsible for the harbour authority because of their rights within that harbour.  Secondly, there is nothing to stop them being a party to an agreement&mdash;even the one to which the Deputy refers&mdash;which would ensure the protection of their rights.  For instance, if they were to be permitted to charge tolls themselves, the Harbours Acts would have to be amended, and that comes under a different Department.  But they are protected under this Bill in any scheme that might appear to infringe on their rights.  Under the bridge order procedure they are protected in regard to their right to be party to whatever agreement would be reached by different parties&mdash;in this instance, Dublin Corporation and the company promoting this scheme.  They are protected but they have no right, as a harbour authority to charge tolls and they cannot have that right to charge tolls themselves unless the Harbours Acts are amended.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing only with the definitions at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that life were so simple we could confine ourselves to simple definitions.  With due respect to the House and with no wish to delay it unduly, I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that the exclusion by way of definition makes all of the following sections totally meaningless unless the Minister subsequently can come forward and give us indications of what has been the overall response from the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to the Minister's factually correct statement that the board of the harbour authority in question have approved the proposal, I want to say that the proposal was somewhat different from a simple matter of throwing a bridge across the Liffey.  As a member who represents a constituency from <Col N="897" /> which the bridge will spring over to the north side of the Liffey, my knowledge was that there would be a certain take-out, in terms of money, to three separate groups, of which the Dublin Port and Docks Board were one.  If this definition stands, the road authority exclusively will be the body who will draft the explanatory statement, who will decide on the scheme of tolls to be charged, subject to the approval of the Minister, and all of the other provisions of this Bill. Because the harbour authority is in no way mentioned in section 1, as I understand it, it will have no say legally.  The Minister correctly pointed out that there is nothing to prevent it from being a party to such a proposal, but there is absolutely nothing to ensure that it is stitched in, as of right, to be a party to it.</P>
    <P>On either side of the river it is the Dublin Port and Docks Board's land.  It is their thoroughfare.  Under the Harbour Acts, with which the Minister is more than familiar, they have a statutory responsibility to ensure the efficient operation of the port and all that that entails.  This proposal will certainly interrupt traffic in the Dublin port area because there is a fair amount of wharfage west of the proposed alignment of the bridge.  If, on the one hand, this will disrupt port traffic and, at the same time, the Dublin Port and Docks Board have no legal guarantee of getting any return because of exclusion from this definition section&mdash;and it all hangs on the definition&mdash;then obviously what they agreed to before was an agreement on the assumption that there would be a certain percentage take for them.</P>
    <P>By virtue of this definition&mdash;and again I am open to correction on this&mdash;is the Minister saying that the net effect of this will be that the road authority in the area, as defined in this section&mdash;which will be exclusively Dublin Corporation&mdash;will itself decide what the toll balance will be, that that explanatory statement will be published and the normal process followed, as indicated here?  Further, conceivably as a result of this definition, Dublin Corporation will say &ldquo;Fine, thanks very much. We will get a bridge over.  We will decide what the take-out will be.&rdquo;  The Dublin Port and Docks Board will get either <Col N="898" /> nothing at all or a reduced amount relative to what they originally agreed and on which proposal the board took a formal decision in principle in favour.  If that is the effect of this definition I suggest that the basis for the newspaper story last week is their reaction to a similar reading of the definition I am now putting to this House, and that their position is not in any way safeguarded. As the Minister has correctly pointed out, they are certainly not excluded, but that is a kind of double negative&mdash;their role, as such, is not guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The legislation in relation to bridge orders and so on has nothing to do with the question of charging tolls.  The whole purpose of this Bill is the charging of tolls.  The Dublin Port and Docks Board, or any harbour authority for that matter, are a commercially operated authority which must generate sufficient income to maintain their services and so on.  One of the attractions for the Dublin Port and Docks Board&mdash;and there was considerable debate among their staff on this matter&mdash;was the trade-off between the disruption of port river traffic and the revenue return they would get from the bridge.  If, as a result of the definition in this section&mdash;and I am endeavouring to stick very closely to this point because it all hangs on this&mdash;the Dublin Port and Docks Board are excluded, there is absolutely no benefit to a harbour authority to participate in any toll scheme anywhere in the country.  As I said on Second Stage&mdash;and I am sure the research carried out in the Minister's Department will back this up&mdash;this does not necessarily affect only the Dublin Port and Docks Board; it affects the other major harbour authorities who would, in theory, have the potential or possibility to operated a similar facility in conjunction either with the local authority or the private sector, which the Minister wishes to facilitate.  Perhaps the Minister would confirm that my reading of the situation is correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the procedure for making a bridge order I could not make such an order within the area over which a harbour authority has jurisdiction without the consent of the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  The question of <Col N="899" /> a compensatory element for the harbour authority&mdash;whether it is Cork Harbour Authority, Limerick Harbour Authority or any other harbour authority&mdash;was raised.  In the case of the Talbot Bridge there was a compensatory element for the harbour authority and that will have to be applied wherever a bridge is going to be, if it is within the area of a harbour authority.  Furthermore, there is nothing to prevent the local authority and the proposers agreeing, where there is to be an open span on a bridge, that the harbour authority be made the agency responsible for operating that span. There is nothing to prevent the harbour authority being properly protected but I could not make a bridge order without the consent of the Minister for Tourism and Transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can fully see that the Minister cannot make a bridge order but he could amend this legislation in order to ensure that the private sector, which he wishes to facilitate, can actually respond to this invitation to assist in the development of our roads structure. With due respect to the Minister we are not talking about making a harbour authority a road authority but about including them in the definition in such a way or form as the Minister may choose.  Unless any harbour authority have some statutory right to draft the explanatory statement in the scheme of tolls, they are not going to be interested. There will be no incentive for them to facilitate the private sector in building bridges or indeed to facilitate a local authority in an urban area, perhaps Cork or Clare and Limerick City Corporation or Limerick County Council, to build a bridge with an opening span.  So far we can only go on the response of the one harbour authority who are actually faced with the live reality of a proposal. Since this Bill has been published and discussed in this House the harbour authority have expressed considerable reservations and indeed indicated, if the press reports are correct, their unwillingness to proceed.  That is the public surface of the iceberg.  The Minister knows well that in his own Department and in the Department of Tourism and <Col N="900" /> Transport there is a considerable file of representations arguing in very great detail the kind of criticism I make now.  I do not know how many times or in how many different ways I have to phrase the question but the case rests on the basis that this will not facilitate the private sector which the Minister is claiming that he wants to help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The reality of the situation is that we are now discussing the kernel of this Bill.  We are now discussing the sole purpose for which this Bill was in-troduced. That is why I have been saying it is a pity that we did not introduce the Bill for this specific purpose and deal with it then.  It is obvious now that the purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the erection and construction and operation of a bridge by private enterprise on the most profitable site in this island.  That bridge is going to be constructed on land, the property of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, the harbour authority for the city of Dublin.  It is only right that that harbour authority should have certain controls.  This is not really enabling legislation because enabling legislation is to provide for something in the future that has not been foreseen.  But this legislation is to facilitate a project which is fairly far advanced.  That is why this House should be given more information about it.  This Bill is to facilitate this bridge project which is very far advanced and in those circumstances it is a different situation from that which might arise if, for example, a bridge was being built over the Shannon in years to come. Then one would have these discussions and consultations between the Department of the Environment and the Department of Tourism and Transport. But it is different here because we know what it is about; we also know that the Dublin Port and Docks Board are not satisfied with the proposals that are being put to them or with the deal they are getting.  Therefore I agree with Deputy Quinn that this is the place to iron out these difficulties.  It is not every day that Parliament has an opportunity of dealing with real, live burning problems.  We are now enacting a Bill to deal with the problem without dealing with the <Col N="901" /> problem ourselves here.  We should do that.  This is a prestige site.  It is the most profitable site in the whole island that could be offered for bridge construction subject to toll and I believe that the Minister should consult with the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  He should have regard to them.  Earlier he expressed faith in the local authorities to do the right thing; he should on this occasion consult with the port and docks board and write in black and white into this Bill what would satisfy them.</P>

      <P>As far as the Chair is concerned at this stage we can consider the inclusion of harbour authorities in the definition section but we are getting into a specific proposal that is certainly not in this Bill and not before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me repeat that this Bill was not introduced for the specific purpose of facilitating any one proposal. It is to facilitate any proposal throughout the country.  Dublin is not the whole country and the Liffey is not the only river in the country.  This Bill enables any road authority to consider a similar proposal.  The fact that this proposal has been highlighted so much is because it seems to have got publicity. As I already said on Second Stage there are others interested in such proposals. This is not the only one and it is wrong for anyone to suggest that this Bill was introduced in a hurry just to facilitate that one proposal.  A year and a half ago I stated that enabling legislation would be introduced in due course to enable toll schemes to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of consultation which Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned, there have been consultations on a number of occasions between the two Departments, my Department and the Department of Tourism and Transport. With regard to the stand by the port and docks board it might be of interest for the Deputies to know that the Board have not yet considered this Bill and will not consider this Bill until <Col N="902" /> tomorrow, despite the statements that are accredited to officials of that board.</P>

      <P>In view of the inadequate answer to my last question, would the Minister not agree that his refusal to consider any amendment to include a harbour authority can only be interpreted as a way in which the specific <Col N="903" /> live proposal that has been referred to is to be excluded from serious consideration by his Department by virtue of the known response both publicy and, I suggest respectfully, privately to the Minister and to the Department of Tourism and Transport?  Would the Minister not agree that there have been considerable representations and discussions between the Department of Tourism and Transport and the Department of the Environment on the one hand and the Dublin Port and Docks Board and that the matters I am raising are not unknown to the Minister?  Would he not concede that by excluding from the categories of definition the harbour authority, the net effect of this section will be either to kill or to endanger seriously the one live concrete response that the private sector have given to the idea of investing in roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>I accept that fully but I want all harbour authorities included. Should there not be included in this Bill which we are told is enabling legislation a provision to include harbour authorities?  In this way, the Bill could be regarded as enabling legislation.  As the <Col N="904" /> Minister has admitted that there have taken place already representations and consultations on the lines I have suggested, would he not agree that by excluding harbour authorities he is making the legislation less enabling than it would be otherwise?  I remind the Minister that he retains the power of overall approval and that the local authorities by virtue of their reserved function are the final body to make decisions in respect of schemes. I am simply asking the Minister to be consistent with his expressed views of attempting to respond to the private sector and attempting to make of this enabling legislation.  If he refuses to allow the inclusion of the words &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; he is contradicting himself.</P>

That situation is unsatisfactory.  However, it has emerged from what the Minister has said in reply to the point raised by Deputy Quinn that as soon as tomorrow Dublin Port and Docks Board will be meeting to discuss this Bill.  Surely the Minister would like to have their views before concluding the Bill.  If we had failed today to deal with the Bill as fully as it is being dealt with, it is possible that it would be put through all Stages today, although the Dublin Port and Docks <Col N="905" /> Board are meeting tomorrow to consider it and presumably to make representations in regard to it.  I suggest that the Minister withdraw the Bill or adjourn the discussion now until such time as he has the views of the board.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to introduce another element into this debate but I shall endeavour to stay as closely as possible to the word &ldquo;definition&rdquo;.  I invite the Minister to deny or confirm that the reasons why any &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; has been excluded by way of definition in this category concerns engineers.  In each local authority the engineering sec-tion has produced a scheme of road proposals and road developments which have been incorporated in the development plans.  That is the prevailing orthodoxy in terms of the kind of road development plan that is required for those areas.  By definition, because that local authority does not have any role in the harbour area, those engineers at local and at departmental level have excluded from their overall calculations <Col N="906" /> any consideration of a bridge in the heart of the harbour authority area. Consequently, if a harbour authority come up with a proposal for a bridge or toll facility which would plug into the overall road system of that local authority, irrespective of what other effect it may have, it may have the effect of invalidating or in some way significantly altering road proposals and improvements which the engineers would have proposed and sought agreement for from the local authority.  That might make some of the calculations of those engineers redundant.</P>
      <P>Given that background I suggest to the Minister that one of the reasons why the words &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; have been excluded from the definition is because of the success of the professional corps of road engineers in the local authorities, the Custom House and the engineering section in the harbour authorities.  The alliance of those three groups of professional engineers has, wittingly or unwittingly, won a major success in having &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; excluded from this.  If the Minister wishes I will be specific about the instances I am referring to.  I suggest that the reason why &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; was excluded was because of the success and influence of the engineering group as a professional body.  It would have been unknown among all professional groups ever to recant any of their mistakes or proposals.  The exclusion of &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; in this definition is a monument to the power, influence and intransigence of engineers here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Such consultations may not get off the ground if the harbour authority read from this legislation that they do not have a statutory right or guarantee to participate in the scheme of tolls.  Is the Minister telling the House that a harbour authority can be consulted by a road authority and that the latter authority, through generosity, may give to the harbour authority some benefit by way of participation in the toll scheme?  If that is his answer let him say so, but this is a guessing game.  I want to know who drafted this legislation for the Minister who is seeking the approval of the House and who presumably fully understands all its implications.  Am I right in assuming that if the harbour authority is not included in section 1, it will have no statutory right in legal terms to participate in a scheme of tolls?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy is not right.  Under existing local government legislation the road authorities have to consult with the harbour authority.  If that is not a statutory right, what is?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and that that legislation simply covers the procedures with regard to the design, construction, erection and supervision of a bridge, but since there is no legislation covering tolls, obviously those statutory provi-sions cannot in any way extend to the question of tolls that would operate on such a bridge.  My question is exclusively concerned with the definition and preparation of the toll scheme which the Minister referred to in the explanatory statement.  I am aware of the legislation for bridge owners and of the interaction because I was in Dublin Corporation when the Memorial Road bridge was built and have some direct experience of what is involved.  Presumably that still stands because there is no proposal to change it here.  Therefore let us take that as read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> We are introducing a new element of tolls.  I want to know if this legislation will give any harbour authority the statutory right to participate in the definition of the toll scheme.  Either it does or it does not.  In view of the Minister's earlier statement, I suggest that this is the main question that will be asked tomorrow when this matter is discussed in Gandon House.  This is the major question and the Minister knows it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained that the road authority will have to consult with the harbour authority under existing legislation and therefore consultation has to take place.  In other words, there is no way they can be excluded from consultations.  What Deputy Quinn appears to be really getting at on behalf of a person or persons attached to the harbour authority is whether a particular harbour authority should charge tolls. The answer to that question in a nutshell is that they cannot charge tolls without the Harbours Act being amended, which is a matter for another Department.  It appears that they now want the right to charge tolls but they have no legal right to do so.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick on section 1.  We are having a great deal of repetition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Minister told us he cannot make a bridge order without the consent of the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  If that order is obtained, is it necessary to get the consent of the harbour authority?  From what the Minister said I imagine it is not.  If the harbour authority own the land over which it is proposed to build a bridge, I assume they must consent to the building of the bridge, and that if they do not it would be necessary to make a compulsory acquisition order.  Then we have to start all over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are talking about a bridge&mdash;which we are not supposed to know it is proposed to build&mdash;where Dublin Corporation, the Dublin Port and Docks Board, the Minister for the <Col N="910" /> Environment and the Minister for Tourism and Transport could be involved. If the Dublin Port and Docks Board were not agreeable it might not be possible to build the bridge.  If there is, and we know there is, a specific project live and current, this is the place to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said on a few occasions in reply to Deputy Quinn that there is nothing to prevent the Dublin Port and Docks Board becoming a party to a toll scheme agreement.  The only thing to prevent them is if they are not asked to become a party by Dublin Corporation, the road authority.  From what we know Dublin Corporation will be entering into a toll agreement with a private individual. Is that reasonable, seeing Dublin Port and Docks Board are so closely connected with this matter?  It is clear that there is no obligation on the road authority to invite the port and docks authority to become a party to the agreement, and it is obvious that they will not do so.  Therefore, the only part the Dublin Port and Docks Board will be able to play in a scheme for a bridge over the Liffey will be the role any citizen of Dublin will be able to play, that is by making representations or objections in reply to an advertisement which it will be obligatory on the road authority to publish under this Bill.</P>

As far as the Chair is concerned this Bill is not concerned with that issue.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Chair will concede that if the Bill goes through it will be possible to build a bridge over the River Liffey and impose tolls.  If all I have said is true and correct, it is reasonable that the Dublin Port and Docks Board should be given an active role in any proposal to build a bridge over the Liffey.</P>

      <P>A total of 82 farmers retired under the farmers' retirement scheme in 1978.  As I have already announced, <Col N="915" /> I shall be reviewing the entire scheme when certain amendments to Directive 160 proposed by the EEC Commission have been finalised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if the percentage by which farm retirement scheme pensions have been increased since they were introduced, is less than the percentage increase in contributory and noncontributory old age pensions: and if so, by how much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Between the date of the introduction of the farmers' retirement scheme in 1974 and May 1978 the annuities payable under the scheme were increased on three occasions, the aggregate <Col N="916" /> increase amounting to some 66 per cent.  In the same period the aggregate increases in old age pension rates, both contributory and noncontributory, ranged between 86 and 89 per cent.</P>
      <P>Further increases in old age pension rates were, of course, announced in this year's budget and the levels of annuity payable under the retirement scheme are at present being reviewed.  As I said in reply to the previous question the entire scheme will be re-examined in the light of the amendments proposed to Directive 160.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a very serious matter that the annuities under this scheme, under which the State were party to a contractual arrangement, have not been increased by as much as the ordinary old age pension?  Is it not disgraceful that they have dropped to 20 per cent below the old age pension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is necessary to increase the annuities, and an undertaking has been given by the Government that they will be increased in line with the Consumer Price Index.  This had been accepted by the previous Government and that undertaking has been honoured by the present Government. The matter is being reviewed and we hope the annuities will be increased shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are two separate schemes.  The directive is being considered by the EEC Commission and we hope an announcement will be made in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did not the Minister agree that he can increase the pensions without reference to the EEC?  Does he agree such an increase is a budgetary matter requiring Finance approval, and should he not be prepared to make the same arrangements for these farmers as for old age pensioners generally?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy they are two different matters.  Increases in old age pensions are granted normally in the budget.  The scheme we are now talking about is being looked into.  The operation of Directive 160 and its application to this country are being considered by the Commission, and until such time as a decision has been made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The areas designated under Directive 252 will benefit as far as field drainage is concerned.  The Robe, Mask, Boyle and Bonnet will come under arterial drainage.  That work will be carried out by the Office of Public Works.  There is nothing to stop West Cork farmers from carrying out field drainage within the areas designated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It involves individuals of groups of farmers making applications. We have been recommending that groups of farmers would organise and apply for work to be done taking in bigger areas.  That would be more advantageous than to have individual farmers applying, because groups of farmers would be able to make better and more efficient use of machinery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of applications received under the scheme to date is approximately 10,500.  With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate detailed particulars in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The processing of applications is at present being carried out but due to the recent inclement weather the necessary field inspections have been unavoidably delayed.  It is accordingly not possible to give the qualifying percentage requested. However, it is considered that the scheme, which covers drainage and necessary ancillary operations will accommodate the vast majority of land improvement projects being undertaken in the western counties.  Following are the detailed particulars:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>The examination of additional areas, including the Slieve Felim area, for inclusion under the disadvantaged areas scheme has been completed here.  The matter now rests with the EEC Commission and, where a sustainable case is accepted by them, it will have to go to the Council of Ministers for final decision. The procedures involved in Brussels may not be completed until later in the year and in the meantime I do not wish to prejudice the outcome in any way by disclosing details in regard to particular areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of a statement which appeared in the <i>Tipperary Star</i> of 20 January 1979 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs who told the people that the Government had already made a submission to the EEC for inclusion of the Slieve Felim area and that the smallholders of the Slieve Felim area are most disappointed at the out-come? The Minister must be aware that they are thoroughly disappointed that they are not already included, because they were given a solemn undertaking by members of the Fianna Fáil Party before the election that their case would be immediately taken by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the solemn undertaking was given by the Fianna Fáil Party in their pre-election manifesto that the review of the disadvantaged areas would be carried out and this has been done.  As the Deputy knows, that takes considerable time, because every area which made application for an extension of the severly handicapped areas had to be considered and the necessary information had to be compiled and then submitted to the Government. I have myself met a deputation from the Slieve Felim area and had a very useful discussion with them, and I think they fully appreciate the problem that exists in that area.  At this stage I cannot say, nor can anybody else until such time as the case is finalised in Brussels, whether the Slieve Felim or any other area will be included under this scheme.  A review has been carried out, the case has been processed by the Government and duly submitted to Brussels, and that is where it lies at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell the House whether his officials have advised him that the Slieve Felim area in Tipperary meets all the criteria necessary to qualify for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be advisable for me at this stage to say what area is going to be included.  As the Deputy knows, the EEC Commission laid down certain criteria which have to be followed very closely, and we are trying <Col N="923" /> to define from that what areas should be included.  I am hoping that the Slieve Felim area will be one of the areas which will be finally accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that I was advised that the Slieve Felim area did not qualify or meet the criteria and their application could not be submitted because of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this is a question that appears regularly on the Order Paper, does it take two years to submit details and to get a decision from Brussels on any extension to the disadvantaged areas?  I am speaking from the point of view of Cork, in respect of which we have submitted an application at least three times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this is right.  A considerable amount of work is involved in any review.  We gave an undertaking in our election manifesto that a review would be carried out.  The review started in September after the election and, in my opinion, has not taken too long.  It is not just something that you can push a large number of civil servants into and get done overnight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the published accounts of the board.  The capital account shows the total amount of redemptions to date. The charge involved in transfer to reserves in respect of repaid loans and assets written off is shown in note 3 (a) to the account under the title Reserves&mdash;Renewals and development. The procedure adopted by the board is a normal commercial procedure and is equivalent to raising a similar charge elsewhere in the accounts for depreciation reserve.  There is no question of a double charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the percentage of street lighting which remains on during daylight hours is very small.  In the case of lights controlled by photo-cell, which accounts for over 80 per cent of public lighting, the mechanism is arranged so that, for safety reasons, the light remains illuminated rather than extinguished in the case of a breakdown.  Other lights controlled by time switch can have their timing upset by any electricity outage.  In most areas I am informed patrols <Col N="929" /> operate so as to get to each light once in every 14 days.  Nevertheless, I am making arrangements to contact those responsible for street lighting to ensure that street lights are extinguished during daylight hours as quickly as possible while bearing in mind the safety aspect.</P>
      <P>Indeed, I would like to take this opportunity to urge every energy user, whether in the industrial, commercial, domestic, transport or public sector, to eliminate wasteful uses of energy in all its forms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provide grants of up to 33? per cent to manufacturing and service industry towards the cost of engaging consultants to carry out fuel efficiency surveys.  The Industrial Development Authority provide grants towards expenditure on machinery, equipment, instrumentation and modifications in buildings designed to achieve savings in energy.  The authority also provide grants towards the costs of research and development projects by manufacturing firms involving a significant technical input aimed at conserving energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen the report to which the Deputy has referred.  The projects mentioned in the report are being carried out by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards at the request of my Department.  The projects provide for the preparation of educational and energy management manuals for six energy intensive industrial sectors and are directed towards small and mediumsized undertakings in particular. Seminars for the individual sectors were held throughout the country, consisting basically of a series of lectures illustrating <Col N="930" /> the management and technical aspects of energy economy.  The manuals published by the IIRS have been highly praised abroad and I regret the fact that they have received less attention from industrialists in Ireland than they deserve.</P>
    <P>In addition, the institute have carried out a study to assess the relative merits of different options for building construction and space heating systems from an energy conservation viewpoint. The results of this study will be published shortly and should be of particular interest to the building construction industry.</P>
    <P>Additional funds are being provided for energy conservation this year and I hope to announce further initiatives in the promotion of this objective at a later stage.  The importance of energy conservation has already been emphasised in the discussion document on our energy needs which was published last year, and the Deputy may be assured that it will at all times receive full recognition in the formulation of our energy policies.  More immediately, it is my intention in the coming weeks to endeavour to bring home to all consumers of energy, whether industrial, commercial or domestic, the vital need to conserve supplies in order to ensure that no serious disruption of economic activity will be caused by current shortages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the preparation of similar handbooks for normal domestic energy conservation? The ones to which he referred are particularly valuable but they are related specially to industrial sectors.  Is the Minister satisfied that industry is giving sufficiently urgent attention to the task at the present time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A certain amount of information has already been made available in regard to domestic consumers. It was thought appropriate that intensive study of this kind should start with heavy industrial users because, proportionately, they use a great deal of energy.  It is disappointing that the response to this work has been a great deal less than one would have wished.  I can only hope that the sectors concerned, <Col N="931" /> which are food and drink, dairy engineering, textile, chemical, ceramics and clay, would pay more attention to these manuals and to the results of the work which has been done.  I will certainly bear in mind, when this work and the other work which I mentioned in regard to the construction industry and space heating systems have been completed by the IIRS, that they might then approach some different aspects of domestic energy conservation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They will likely be a combination of both.  It is difficult, as the Deputy will appreciate, to bring in, at relatively short notice, initiatives with teeth which will interfer with existing economic activity and perhaps interfere with it seriously.  I have in mind, for instance, ensuring that the IDA would not give grants in future for any new industrial project or a re-equipment grant for an existing one unless the various rules which were laid down by the IIRS in those manuals are complied with.  One of the areas in which one would like, as rapidly as possible, to introduce regulations which would have teeth is in regard to the building construction industry. That is one of the areas where the amount of wastage at the moment is greatest.  These rules alredy exist in respect of publicity erected houses and I understand that the Minister for the Environment has now made similar rules to come into effect from 1 July next in regard to privately built houses.  I had urged that these rules would be brought in at a much earlier date than 1 July next but this was found, unfortunately, not to be feasible because of the time lags that are involved in building and so forth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with that <Col N="932" /> matter already here and it did not purport to contain any such proposals.  It was a matter which, I stated, had to be dealt with and it is in the process of being dealt with now.  There are, as the Deputy will appreciate, numerous regulations that I could make tomorrow morning which would certainly save energy but many members of the public would question whether such regulations should be made in the absence of an absolutely clear need to make them, because they would interfere not alone with economic activity but with general social activity too.</P>

The position is that, unlike the statement by the Deputy, the Russians have been given the requisite information they sought and they accept that until the principals in the zinc smelter project have been selected no decision on Russian involvement is possible because, as I have said, their interests are confined to construction, supply of equipment and training of personnel all of which are questions to be determined by the principals.  In these circumstances the Russians have accepted that there is no point in putting forward detailed proposals at this stage but they have asked to be kept informed of developments.  When principals for the project have been selected the interest of the Russians will be brought to their attention. No further discussions have taken place between the IDA and Russian interests for these reasons since the meeting on 7 April 1978.</P>

      <P>The appropriate State agencies have the situation with regard to the introduction of microelectronic technology in Irish industry under continuous review.  A considerable amount of time is currently being spent in the EEC on studies to determine how microelectronic technology will, or could, change the pattern of industry, communications and employment. However, no convincing conclusions have yet been reached and certainly none that could be applied to Ireland's particular economic position.</P>
      <P>While the new technology may lead to some structural unemployment it should be noted that Ireland is very well placed to take advantage of developments in microelectronic technology.  Microelectronic technology can open up the possibility of new forms of creative work and at the same time assist in the formation of wealth and employment generating industry.  We have a young and adaptable population and good educational facilities.  Moreover we do not have large existing investment in areas of manufacturing which are likely to be adversely affected.  The creation of a healthy industrial sector requires that we keep abreast of constantly changing technology.</P>

      <P>Microelectronics, like electronics generally, can and does create employment as well as rendering certain types of jobs obsolete.  We are very fortunate that in recent years many thousands of new jobs in electronics and <Col N="936" /> microprocessors have been created.  This development is taking place worldwide, and we are in a better position than most if not all other countries to take advantage of this situation.  I am glad that the IDA saw the opportunities available and have grasped them with considerable advantage to us.  It is not universally true to say that the use of advanced electronics and automated equipment and things of that kind necessarily creates unemployment.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he is aware that a firm (details supplied) who recently completed a film in Ireland, have failed to pay a number of Irish creditors; and, since the National Film Studios of Ireland Limited now have the copyright of the film concerned, if he will ensure that all moneys legally due to residents of this country will be paid before any of the money is paid out of the country from the proceeds of the film.</P>

      <P>The National Film Studios of Ireland Limited do not own any part of the copyright of the film in question.  They own the distribution rights of the film in Ireland and most other English-speaking territories ex-cluding the US and Canada and are entitled to a share in the profits from distribution in certain other countries.</P>
      <P>I am aware that certain moneys are due by the production company to Irish creditors.  The NFSI, a large creditor, have instituted legal action to enforce payment of sums due to them.  No money is payable out of this country from the proceeds of the film.  I should perhaps add that there is no legal obligation on the NFSI in regard to payment of debts incurred by the production company.</P>

In fact, the NFSI are themselves the principal creditors of the production company in Ireland.  They are owned over 80 per cent of what this company owe in Ireland.  Fortunately most of the other debts are very small. They have taken legal proceedings.  They have some rights under the financing arrangements for the film in question to a share in the profits in the English-speaking world.

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he will make a statement on the present position and the prospects of the motor assembly industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, on accession to the EEC provision was made for the con-tinuation of the special arrangements then in existence for the motor assembly industry with certain modifications until 1 January 1985.  From that date there will be full free-trade in motor vehicles. The extended transitional period of 12 years was sought to enable the industry to adapt to free-trade conditions, as it was envisaged that not all firms would continue in assembly up to and beyond 1985.</P>
      <P>To date, firms accounting for approximately half the numbers engaged in assembly have provided, or are in the process of providing, long-term employment for their assembly workers either in continued assembly or in alternative industry. As half of the extended transition period has now elapsed, I am most concerned to see that firms which do not propose to continue assembly on a long-term basis take positive steps towards providing long-term employment for their work forces.  I should like to take this opportunity to stress some points I made in a recent public statement on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not regard diversification as a matter solely for the assembly firms.  The unions and the workers should realise that, however difficult the change-over may be, they must not sacrifice long-term <Col N="941" /> employment for apparent short-term gains.  Co-operation by all to ensure a smooth transition is essential if we are not to end up with the worst of all possi-ble situations, namely, firms ceasing assembly without having made arrangements for alternative manufacturing operations.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority are prepared to provide grants for approved diversification projects and may also be in a position to give help in other directions to firms wishing to diversify.  If Irish assemblers feel that official intervention with their foreign principals would be of assistance in pushing forward their plans in Ireland, I can assure them that they will get all possible aid from myself and the agencies associated with my Department.</P>
    <P>It is now a matter for individual firms which have not yet done so, in co-operation with their assembly workers and the trade unions, to make full use of the aids provided and thereby secure without further loss of time the long-term future employment of their assembly work forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister said half the firms involved had provided or were in the course of providing the alternative employment to which the arrangements he mentioned refer.  Would that half of the firms represent about half of the employment involved too? Has the Minister got figures for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say half of the firms.  I said firms accounting for approximately half the numbers engaged in assembly.  The actual number of firms is less than half.  It would relate to about half the assembly workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  Has the Minister any sanction or any scheme up his sleeve for ensuring that the remaining firms discharge their obligations in this regard, although I appreciate the point he made about the burden not lying solely upon them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain circumstances I think I have the right to <Col N="942" /> withdraw FBU importation licences.  Obviously one would not do that unless a very serious view had to be taken of the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in Northern Ireland cars cost £1,000 and sometimes £1,500 less than they cost here?  Is he not concerned in the long-term that, under EEC regulations, the price of our vehicles will have to drop accordingly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>One reason among others why cars here cost more than they do in Northern Ireland is that there is no significant motor assembly there that I am aware of, and no motor manufacture.  There is still considerable assembly here and it is my concern to preserve that assembly, at the same time encouraging those firms who have not already done so to diversify gradually out of assembly and into suitable manufacturing projects.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" /> I understand that electrical contractors may obtain, for completion in respect of wiring installations or repairs undertaken by them, blank forms of certificate from a number of sources including the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The availability, in itself, of blank forms of the certificate referred to cannot be regarded as facilitating substandard work with consequent hazards to life and property.  Alternative forms of certificate can be and are used.  It is the misuse of certificates which creates hazards.</P>
    <P>I understand that for some years past the question of establishing a register of approved electrical contractors has been under consideration.  The maintenance of such a register might provide some protection for the public against substandard electrical work, but I am not convinced that more effective measures could not be adopted to achieve this object.</P>
    <P>In view of the present unsatisfactory situation I intend to start consultations immediately with the relevant interests concerned, including other Ministers, with a view to establishing the best possible procedures to protect the public interest in this area of activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish manufacturers of electrical equipment, including small fittings, come within the scope of the Prices and Charges (Notification of Increases) Order, 1979. Importers and wholesalers are also subject to this order.</P>
      <P>I understand that very few complaints have been received about the price of small electrical fittings.  However, if the Deputy has received any complaint regarding the price of such goods and provides me with the relevant details, I will arrange to have the matter investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in Dublin it is common to find a wide variation in the prices of similar commodities such as plugs and adapters, that in some cases an item of this kind can cost twice as much in one retail outlet as in another?

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the original question in which there was no reference to the aspect of safety.  The question was concerned mainly with the question of whether these items are within the scope of the Prices and Charges (Notification of Increases) Order, 1979.  If the Deputy has specific complaints I shall be glad to have them investigated but I would remind him that any member of the public is entitled to complain to the Priceline offices in any part of the country where they operate.  I am sure he will be glad to hear that of the 4,000 complaints received by the Priceline in 1978 only ten related to the prices of small electrical fittings which included elements, flexes, plugs and rings and that all of these were resolved satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the problems which have arisen regarding the types of trading mentioned by the Deputy.  The Government have already decided to introduce legislation to regulate all forms of casual trading.  However, the drafting <Col N="946" /> of the necessary measures has, for reasons which I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, proved to be particularly difficult and is taking longer to complete than had been anticipated.  In an effort to overcome these difficulties, work is now proceeding on the basis that there will be two Bills.  The first of these will deal with occasional trading from temporary retail outlets, and the second with roadside trading.</P>
      <P>Because of the difficulties that have been encountered, I am somewhat hesitant to make any firm prediction as to when the first of these measures&mdash;that on occasional trading&mdash;will be circulated.

      <P>I am not aware of the projections.  As I have stated both here and in other places the establishment figures have not been realised and the strength in the Naval Service is well short of the establishment.  I have expressed concern in this regard and there is under review the whole question of recruitment to the service.  In a very short while I propose undertaking a special recruiting campaign and I am examining the pay and conditions of those serving in the Naval Service with a view to ascertaining what improvements might be effected.  I am determined to ensure that the number of people serving in the Naval Service is brought up to the increases in establishment for which I have been responsible since becoming Minister.  As I have informed the Deputy already, I hope to be able to increase the figure as time goes on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of soldiers, non-commissioned officers and men, discharged from the Permanent Defence Force on completion of three years service for each year from 1975 to 1978 was as follows: 1975, 308; 1976, 220; 1977, 449; 1978, 904.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures relate to those who have been discharged on completion of three years service.  If the Deputy examines the enlistment of men at the beginning of that three-year period he will find that a large number enlisted in 1975-76.  These are now completing their three-year term of service and as is normal a large proportion of them are not re-enlisting for further service.  At the same time this is not to say that I am not concerned with the situation.  I should have hoped that more of these men would have enlisted for further periods of service but I do not know whether one should be too alarmed at the rate of discharge when one realises that these people are discharging themselves on completion of a three-year period of service and that substantial numbers enlisted in 1975-76.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the progress, if any, which has been made in the matter of issuing driving licences to people who have been trained for and who have passed the Army driving test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Army drivers attending an advanced driving course conducted by the military authorities in January 1979 underwent driving tests, carried out by testers of the Department of the Environment, to qualify for driving licences under the Road Traffic Acts.  As a result of the tests, 11 Army drivers qualified for licences to drive civilian vehicles.</P>
      <P>I intend that all Army drivers who wish to qualify for civilian driving licences will be facilitated in the same manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that they can sit for the Department's driving licence if they wish?  Is he aware that many Army personnel who drive heavy vehicles while in the Army cannot take up employment in civilian life because they do not have a civilian driving licence?  I am sure those people had to undergo a stringent test to qualify for an Army licence.  Is it possible to in-corporate the test for a civilian licence in the test for a licence to drive an Army vehicle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Personnel in the Permanent Defence Forces acting as drivers who wish to take out a civilian driving licence will be facilitated and I advise them to contact their commanding officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it necessary to have two tests?  Such personnel must undergo a stringent test to qualify to drive Army vehicles.  Such personnel are well qualified to drive heavy vehicles and there should be co-operation between the Department and the Army to automatically grant such people a civilian licence when they pass the Army test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That position does not obtain nor is it likely to obtain.  The Defence Act of 1954 excludes the necessity <Col N="951" /> for persons driving Army vehicles to hold the Department of the Environment driving licence.  That is at it should be and it will continue to be so.  On the other hand, it is the Department of the Environment who control the regulations regarding the issue of driving licences and when that legislation was brought before the House and decisions were made with regard to the introduction of driving licences here the Department made it clear that there would not be any exemption from the test for any category.  The Department have maintained that position since.  The Deputy should accept that the steps I have taken were taken with the intention of overcoming that difficulty.  I recognise the good reason behind the decision of the Department of the Environment not to grant exemptions to any particular category.  At the same time, I have taken steps which will overcome that problem. Any Army driver will be facilitated in taking out a civilian driving licence.  All he need do is contact his commanding officer.  There will not be any difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is failing to grasp my point.  Arrangements have been made to do as the Deputy is requesting. When Army personnel are doing the Army test they will simultaneously be tested by a tester from the Department of the Environment.  The person undertaking the test has only to do it once with the two testers present. This is not the big problem in the Defence Forces that some people make it out to be.  We are not flooded with requests <Col N="952" /> to do these driving tests.  We had 11 requests in January and I am inviting other members of the Force who wish to undergo the test to come forward.  The arrangements I have made have overcome this problem once and for all.</P>

      <P>This amendment is consequential on amendment No. 10 which relates to section 19.  I am informed that the amendment of the term &ldquo;mining right&rdquo; which I propose here is not from a strictly legal point of view necessary, but I agree with what Deputy Kelly said the last day that there is some merit in ensuring uniformity of terms in the Bill.  However, his amendment No. 9 is limited to Part III whereas the reference to mining rights occurs also in Part I, section 2.  The various amendments I put down, therefore, provide for amendments to the five sections of the Bill in which the phrase in question is used, namely, sections 2, 19, 20, 21 and 22.</P>

      <P>Here again I propose that the principle of amendment No. 4, which is in the name of Deputy Kelly, be accepted.  The purpose of my amendment, No. 2, is similar.  I am advised that amendment of the section is again, strictly speaking, not necessary and this is clear if subsection (1) of this section is read in conjunction with subsection (5) of section 14. The amendment does, however, make the position somewhat more clear on its face.  I gather that the difference between Deputy Kelly's amendment and mine is one of drafting style and not one of any great substance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister and his advisers thought well enough of the point I made to put down this amendment, but I do not understand why the Minister's amendment takes the shape it does.  If he is going to include a warning in section 13 that it does not stand by itself and that the benefit of the section is dependent on registration, I cannot see why the warning should not refer to the whole of section 14.  I cannot see why it should be restricted to section 14 (5).  It is a small drafting point but I think the section which in its entirely carries the side note &ldquo;Registration of excepted minerals&rdquo; would have been the appropriate thing to refer to, rather than merely one subsection.  It is not a point of any substance.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 46, to delete &ldquo;for the working&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Although this appears to be a very simple amendment it attempts to cover a rather complicated point which has been the subject of critical examination by my Department and the Parliamentary Draftsman both before and since the Bill was circulated.  The point had also been raised with me by representatives of the mining and exploration industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> The purpose of section 13 is quite straightforward.  It is intended to ensure that the vesting provided in section 12 will not apply to minerals which are being mined on the relevant date or where a mine to work the minerals is being developed.  Under subsection (2) of the section, developing a mine is deemed to cover a situation where comprehensive plans have been prepared for a commercial development.  The difficulty arises from the use of the word &ldquo;working&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;working&rdquo;, which is substantially the same as the definition in the Act of 1940, includes certain activities, for example, &ldquo;searching for&rdquo; which would be carried out at the exploration or prospecting stage as well as at the stage when a mine was being developed or in operation.  The possibility exists that, as section 13 is now drafted, somebody who was merely searching for minerals could claim to have the minerals exempted on the grounds that what he was doing constituted working for the purposes of section 13.  There is no real problem as regards operations carried out under prospecting licence, because section 11 of the 1940 Act provides that it is unlawful for the holder of a prospecting licence to work minerals.  It is, however, conceivable that a person might allege that on the relevant date he was engaged in searching for minerals on lands where he was the owner of the mineral rights.  The problem is a rather limited one and is really only of significance from the point of view of exemption under section 13. Nevertheless, I regard it as being a point which if possible should be put right.</P>
    <P>Under the amended section, exemption will apply to minerals where on the specified date a person was lawfully working or developing a mine of such minerals.  The revised wording is intended to emphasise the mine aspect in the case of current working at 15 December 1978.  I readily concede that it is not the most elegant form of wording, but I can assure Deputies that a variety of possible amendments were considered. All of them proved to have some defect or another and the amendment now proposed is the only alternative to a <Col N="970" /> total recasting of the section, which would be likely to have implications running right through the Bill and call for a considerable number of consequential amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I understand it.  Is the Minister saying that because the word &ldquo;working&rdquo; in line 46 has been defined by the 1940 Act in such a way as to include searching, the effect of the subsection as it stands would be to qualify minerals for exception if nothing further was being done in regard to them than searching?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that. Under section 11 of the 1940 Act a prospector under a prospecting licence is precluded from working in the less technical sense of &ldquo;working&rdquo;.  The definition of &ldquo;working&rdquo; in section 2 includes searching for.  The definition of &ldquo;searching for&rdquo; could be extended, arguably, or an attempt made in that direction, to the use of the word &ldquo;working&rdquo; in line 46, section 13 (1).  I want to try to put the matter beyond doubt, even though I am advised by the draftsman that it is not essential. However, I do not want a situation to arise in which somebody who was prospecting on 15 December, and not doing any more than prospecting, would seek to claim that he is entitled to be registered as being concerned with an excepted mineral under this section.</P>
      <P>It would normally only apply in practice where somebody is prospecting for his own minerals, where he is the owner. It is a minor point but it is as well at this stage to put the matter beyond doubt, even though the draftsman assures me he is satisfied that the position is all right under the subsection.</P>

      <P>Of course, I have not been given notice of this amendment and I am afraid I am not able to think about it on my feet here, and therefore I must let it go.  I would have welcomed a chance to think about it, particularly because the Minister has acknowledged that the wording is inelegant.  I have never heard the expression &ldquo;a mine of such minerals&rdquo;.  Indeed, when I saw the <Col N="971" /> Minister's amendment I thought it contained a misprint and that his purpose was to delete the last six words of the subsection.  It is not impossible that my party may seek to improve this section when the Bill reaches the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 20 and 21, to delete &ldquo;in at least one national daily newspaper&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;in all the national daily newspapers.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If the Minister agrees, I would not mind having amendments Nos. 6 and 7 discussed with these two amendments.  The purpose is to try to show the good faith of the State in advertising in the fullest and most detailed way possible rather than by the fairly minimal advertisements which the sections as they stand provide for.  The idea which I advanced in general terms during the Second Stage is based on the point that what the Minister is doing in the Bill is virtually to expropriate, subject to a right to compensation, minerals belonging at the moment to an indeterminate but large number of people&mdash;to expropriate a great amount of property which at the moment does not belong to the Minister. I have said that it is obvious that the way in which the Minister and his advisers approached the problem was designed to avoid explicit expropriation, explicit transference of ownership to the State, and in that way to avoid having to jump a possible constitutional hurdle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I made the point &mdash;and I do not think the Minister has dealt with it&mdash;that what he is doing, namely, trying to think of something which is a substitute for expropriation, will not get him any more easily over the constitutional hurdle, because it <Col N="972" /> amounts to expropriation.  It may have been an unguarded expression by the Minister, but when I asked him towards the end of the Second Stage debate in what respect the conferring on himself of the right to work minerals differs from expropriation in view of the very wide definition given to &ldquo;working&rdquo;, he began his reply along the lines that the residual owner, the person from whom the right to work is now being subtracted, still will have the right to dispose of the minerals. I took the Minister to mean that the person has the right to sell them.</P>
    <P>Of course he has not got that right because the right of sale is in the right to work, expressly by one of the definitions in the Bill.  I do not want to labour the point, but it will be difficult for the Minister to make the case that anything of any possible value would be left behind in the hands of an owner once the Minister's exclusive right to work the minerals had been vested in him.  There is then nothing left to the owner capable of enjoyment by the owner, capable of being sold or otherwise disposed of, or of being appraised in money value once the right of working them has been subtracted from him and conferred on the State.</P>
    <P>Though I am quarrelling with the principle of doing this, I want to emphasise that the Minister has only apparently succeeded in avoiding the difficulty of an explicit expropriation with the involvement of a constitutional hurdle which he may become entangled in. The reality is, in spite of the language used in the Bill, he is expropriating, he is taking away from the owner, subject to the right to compensation, everything that made the ownership of those minerals dear to him.  There is not anything left in the ownership of a mineral once the right of working has been taken away.  Therefore I do not think the Minister has succeeded in avoiding that constitutional hurdle, if it is one&mdash;I do not know if it is.  If he is faced with a possible constitutional challenge, which would run along the lines that in spite of the words used this is expropriation, I think he would be better armoured if he could show that he had endeavoured to put people on notice of <Col N="973" /> their rights.  It is with that in mind that I am suggesting that the provisions in regard to notice in the existing sections 18 and 19 are inadequate.</P>
    <P>In an earlier reply the Minister seized on the perfectly valid point that I had not said in my speech anything about the Minister giving individual notice to people who might appear to be entitled to it.  I had taken it as a starting point that very often such people are unknown, that their might not be any such person or that, even if the Minister knew of such persons who would have an interest, he might not succeed in reaching such a person.  The items referred to were ordinary newspaper advertising and advertising in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  Perhaps I made a meal of the point that notice in the latter publication, in the context in which we are speaking, is not in fact notice at all, that that specific point had been dealt with by the Supreme Court 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>That means, therefore, only the matter of a newspaper advertisement and of trying to reach by individual inquiry as many of the potentially interested parties as possible. The State, spends a good deal of money on advertising budgets in trying to persuade the people that some wretched Irish phrase spoken by everybody's grandmother who could not otherwise speak a word of Irish, made us what we are.  A State which goes in for that kind of campaign can afford to advertise in not one national newspaper but in three.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I admit that the idea I have expressed in amendments Nos. 6 and 8 in regard to giving notice to people who may have acted once upon a time or who may have access to the record of somebody who has acted for a person who might be interested is not elegant draftsmanship.  I am aiming at the concrete situation in the Land Commission where they are in the business of trying to track people through solicitors and where they have the names of owners on record as represented once upon a time by solicitors who no longer exist but whose practices exist.  The Minister knows that in many cases these practices <Col N="974" /> have been taken over by others and even if the name is not there and the incorporation is not visible, the records are not altogether untraceable.</P>
    <P>I do not flatter myself that this is going to open up a wide range of notice parties who under the Minister's Bill as it stands would be left in the dark.  I am looking at it from the point of view of the State, called upon possibly to justify the constitutional validity of an effectively expropriatory measure, to show that it has mitigated that expropriation by every means at its disposal and that it has put every person who possibly could have an interest which might be adversely affected by the operation of either of these two sections on notice that now is the time to come in and make his case. There is nothing more than that in these four amendments, and if the House is willing to take them all together I will let my case in regard to them rest there.</P>

      <P>I was saying that these advertisements constitute a substantial expense for the Department and, accordingly, for the taxpayer.  I understand that the figure this year in my Department for these advertisements, which the taxpayer has to pay, is £160,000.  Cases arising under section 17 of the Bill will, however, be relatively infrequent and the <Col N="976" /> Deputy may take it that in practice notices will be inserted in whatever number of national daily newspapers are published at the time if the existing practice continues.</P>
      <P>I am advised by some lawyers in the public service, who examined this Bill for me with some care, that the notice provisions in this section are such that these lawyers are satisfied that the Bill does all that it might be reasonably expected to do in this regard, and it follows the procedures adopted by the Land Commission concerning land acquisition in so far as is practicable.  From my examination of it, it appears that section 17 does everything that the Land Commission do in practice, and in addition it publishes notices in national daily newspapers. The Land Commission do not publish notices for the acquisition of land in daily newspapers.  They publish them in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and then send them to the interested party, the owner or his agent where appropriate.  Section 17 goes away beyond the hallowed practice of the Land Commission, and of course the section is doing things which are far less drastic than what the Land Commission do.  Section 17 simply gives notice that the Minister proposes to exercise his rights of working.  The Land Commission's normal notices are to say &ldquo;We are taking your land from you whether you like it or not&rdquo;.  That is a more drastic thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy made reference to expropriation. In case anybody should think that this is expropriation, even with compensation, as the Deputy has put it, I should say here and now that it is not expropriation.  It is a regulation, in accordance with the relevant articles of our Constitution, of the exercise of private rights of property in accordance with exigencies of the common good, and that is something which the Constitution envisages. This Bill sets out to do it in the Long Title, which is unusually full and which makes it clear that this is the way it is going about it.  I made the point the last day that there is a very great difference between the State taking a person's house from him and the State saying &ldquo;You own that house.  We are not taking it from you, but we are not going <Col N="977" /> to let you use it for certain purposes and in certain ways&rdquo;.  That is accepted not alone in this country but everywhere else, and this is the point at issue here.</P>
    <P>However, I have followed another of Deputy Kelly's hares.  Perhaps I should not.  This is about newspapers and giving notice to agents, and amendments Nos. 6 and 8 in his name, which were taken with this amendment, relate to the same matter.  The practice with the Land Commission is that, when they know the name and address of an agent they give him notice as well as giving it to the registered owner.  The same practice will be followed here.  We are going beyond the Land Commission practice here because we are giving public newspaper notice of the proposal as well as doing all the things that the Land Commission are doing, although this Bill does not go as far as the normal Land Commission acquisition procedure goes.</P>

      <P>The analogy of the house which the Minister mentioned just now is about as absurd, at least in opposition to the making of his case as could be imagined. Would the Minister put a value on his own house if the right to live in the house, the right to look at the house, the right to invite visitors to the house, the right to let and sell the house were vested in me?  It would be worth nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Long Title of the Bill I told the House the last day that although the courts occasionally look at a Long <Col N="978" /> Title or recite it it is not a suit of armour which will hermetically insulate a Bill against scrutiny unless it is the Long Title adverted to in Article 28.3 of the kind which the Emergency Powers Act, 1976 carries; otherwise the Long Title is only a piece of flummery.  A Bill which is constitutionally objectionable for what it does will not be saved by a Long Title pretending that it is something else.  A Long Title, which is full of flowery language about respect for Article this and Article that, but which goes ahead and puts somebody in prison without trial in a time other than one of emergency, or which purports to tell some couple where to send their children to school against their lawful preference, or whatever else it may be, will be an invalid Act when it is enacted no matter what the Long Title says.  The Minister should not put his faith in Long Titles.</P>
    <P>He raised the matter about the comparison of the Land Commission and he said that this notice goes beyond what the Land Commission do.  I do not suppose that I know more than a fraction of what the Minister and anybody else in his practice would know about this but I imagine that the ownership situation which the Land Commission have to deal with is in most cases a great deal simpler, when we are talking about the surface of the land, than what we are dealing with here, I have always understood that one of the main problems in this area was the impossibility of being sure that one knew who the entitled person was.  The Land Commission practice is not a fair criterion against which to measure this thing.</P>
    <P>The second point the Minister raised in regard to the Land Commission shows that he has not bothered to consider the point I raised about the difference between what this Bill does and expropriation.  Although I know it is the Minister's second nature to be pugnacious&mdash;I suppose he is not alone in that&mdash;I want him to understand that I am not in any way, any more than the rest of my party, against this Bill.  On the contrary, if we are sitting on that side, we would probably be bringing in a similar kind of Bill.  If I were the Minister in charge of his Department I believe I <Col N="979" /> would have produced a Bill approaching this problem by a different technique, as I said here two weeks ago, but I have no doubt it would be much the same kind of Bill in its general effect.  I am only trying to put to the Minister that if he wants to protect himself or his successor in title and the State in the kind of constitutional action which I know he must have apprehended, because I know that council were consulted about it, he ought to keep his hands as clean as he possibly can.  He should bend over backwards in regard to the giving of notice.</P>
    <P>There is no distinction between what the Land Commission do and what this Bill proposes to do.  The Minister says that the Land Commission, in taking over land, expropriated, whereas the powers of this Bill do not amount to that.  They do and the Minister is only deceiving himself if he thinks that only judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court will see the thing any other way.  I have no axe to grind about this.  I am only trying to put it to the Minister that if he leaves himself with as clean hands as he can so that he can go into the witness box or get his counsel to make his case for him in the event of a constitutional challenge he will be able to say: &ldquo;With the intent of regulating the right of private property to meet the exigencies of the common good but leaning over backwards in order not to diminish individual property rights we have gone to the greatest possible lengths to make sure nobody is left out in the cold.&rdquo;  That is the situation I would wish the Minister, or any other Minister, who follows him, to be in.  It is with that in mind and not with trying to pick holes in his Bill or making it difficult for him that I make those points.  That is what is behind my suggestion in regard to notice.  We will obviously not get anywhere today with the Minister but I hope he will look at it again from that point of view between now and the introduction of this Bill in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is in regard to newspapers.  I am surprised that the Minister does not see the somewhat amusing figure he cuts here telling us in one breath that his provisions in regard to notice are adequate <Col N="980" /> but in another breath admitting to us that these old notices about the townlands of Shanvallymore, Aghabeg, Meelagh and so forth nobody bothers to read.  If that is the case&mdash;we have it on record that the Minister admitted this&mdash;then all the business about newspaper advertisements may be dispensed with and we might as well have the Government's intention proclaimed by the town crier in the townland or in the parish to which his intentions relate.  I have no better idea for doing it but by what the Minister has said he is admitting that the notice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That would put a few more thousand on to the figures that are so hard to find.  I am very sorry that my remarks about this the other day have led the Minister to look up his Department's situation in this regard and find that they are over-advertising rather than under-advertising.  I am afraid the Minister will give himself a black eye with the media yet again if the result of this debate is that they will be shorn of a large proportion of the £160,000 worth of advertising which they have been getting up to now.  It will naturally suit me all the better the blacker the Minister's eye is but I advise him for his own sake not to put the apparent intention which he has expressed into practice.</P>

      <P>I am not.  I am suggesting that the Minister should not use the occasion of this particular debate, this particular instance and this particular matter of the mining townland advertisements, which he has adverted to, to make a change which will affect all departmental advertising, some of which I have no doubt fulfils a serious function. I often read those notices myself.  The Minister's profession make a point of going down very carefully through statutory notices in newspapers.  I would not belittle the practice but, quite apart from the irresponsibility of cancelling the departmental practice in this particular instance, which the Minister thinks is futile, which in turn makes nonsense of the case he is making in regard to the advocacy of the provision of the Bill, he should not use this particular case as a pretext for reducing a practice which in the ordinary way is very necessary and beneficial.</P>
      <P>I do not suppose I will cut any ice with the Minister in this instance and I will not hold the House up any further.  I urge him to look at it from the point of view of himself or his successor, who in the future may be faced with a situation his predecessor but one was faced with in the case of Roche and Randals.  In the Roche and Randals case, if I am not mistaken, although the case was decided not so much on purely administrative criteria as on the criterion of the impossibility of the Minister discharging what was the central sense of his duty under the then legislation.  A further point raised by the plaintiffs of those cases related to the constitutionality of the acquisition that was proposed.  The Minister would be well advised, if he has any reason to think he may be faced with litigation of that kind in the future, to leave himself with as seamless a suit of constitutional chain mail as his advisors can devise for him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): On the definition section, Deputy Quinn raised the definition of &ldquo;road authority&rdquo; and made the case that a harbour authority where it existed and where it was relevant should be involved in conjunction with the county council or corporation as the road authority. Deputy Quinn made the case very fully and it appeared from what he said and from what the Minister said that the Dublin Port and Docks Board have a vital interest in a proposal that might be put forward under the Bill.  It also tran-spired from the Minister's intervention that the Dublin Port and Docks Board are meeting tomorrow and that an item on their agenda is a consideration of this Bill.  The Minister and his Department might have received representations from the Minister and the Department of Tourism and Transport and from the chief executive of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  However, as I understand it the ordinary members of the Dublin Port and Docks Board are meeting tomorrow to consider this Bill and will presumably express views on it.  It would be reasonable for the Minister to adjourn consideration of the Bill in the House until the Dublin Port and Docks Board have had an opportunity to consider it and to let their views be known.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that he could not make a bridge order without the consent of his colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  That is quite clear, but I do not think he must get the consent of the harbour authority.  The Minister also said that the road authority could not proceed with the erection of a bridge without consulting the harbour authority and that that is laid down in another statute.  That may be so but many statutes make it obligatory on the performing authority to consult another authority but do not make it obligatory on the performing authority to be guided by the authority they are obliged to consult.  Therefore, his process of consultation has no teeth and has no effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very impressed by the case <Col N="984" /> made by Deputy Quinn that the harbour authority should have some real involvement in a bridge which is to be erected on a river which is of immediate concern to them and is used by them as a harbour authority.</P>

      <P>We have probably exhausted the section but now that we have reconvened after the adjournment the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will recall that on those occasions Deputy Fitzpatrick and I were attempting to establish the rights of harbour authorities under this Bill.  We should have a clear statement on the Minister's interpretation of the role of a harbour authority. He said no harbour authority would be prevented from participating in the formulation of a tolls scheme.  I invite him to deny that, if this section goes through the House unamended, no harbour authority will have the statutory right to participate in the drawing up and designing of the tolls scheme as set out in the Explanatory Memorandum.  It should be clearly understood from what the Minister has said directly or indirectly that no harbour authority will have any statutory role to play by virtue of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister repeatedly refused to accept any amendment which would include a role for the harbour authorities, not as a road authority but as an adjoining or conjoining road authority. Contrary to the assertion that this Bill will enable local authorities to do such <Col N="985" /> things, and contrary to the assertion that it is intended to facilitate the private sector, it does the direct opposite.  The Bill is not what it appears to be.  It does not facilitate the private sector as the Minister would argue.  On the contrary it will kill the one specific, hard-edged proposal from the private sector.  It will also have the conscious effect of burying the one proposal from the private sector to which the Minister appears to be committed. I am asking the Minister to deny formally that this Bill will kill and is designed to kill the response from the private sector with regard to building a specific bridge in a specific area.</P>

If the desired objective of the Bill is not to kill that initiative, can the Minister explain to me why he has not seen fit to include the harbour authorities in the definition section in whatever form of words he chooses to select, in order to allay the known fears of the harbour authorities, the known fears in public print <i>vide The Irish Times</i> of last Friday, and the private fears as expressed in representations to his Department and to the Department of Tourism and Transport?</P>

Because a toll road means a public road, section 2 gives power to impose tolls on footpaths and cycle tracks.  That is what I wanted to avoid this morning.  I know the Minister will say tolls may not be imposed but this Bill gives authority to impose tolls on footpaths and cycle tracks.  I object to that.</P>
      <P>It is a pity the Minister would not come in here with an open mind on these matters and be prepared to accept reasonable arguments and write reasonable safeguards into the Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 is a long section. I should like clarification on how the Minister and his Department envisage this scheme functioning.  Subsection (3) provides a number of specifications of what a toll scheme shall do.  In paragraph (a) it is stated that it shall specify the public road or proposed public road in respect of the use of which the road authority concerned proposes to establish a system of tolls.  Paragraph (b) says that it shall indicate the classes of vehicles and other road users for whose use the toll road is intended.  This would enable a local authority to eliminate pedestrians, cyclists and so on. <Col N="987" /> Paragraph (c) say that a toll scheme shall indicate the classes of vehicles for which the toll will be charged.  Paragraph (d) provides that a toll scheme shall include an estimate of the amounts of tolls, that is, the price.  Paragraph (e) provides that a toll scheme shall specify such other information as the road authority may consider appropriate &ldquo;or the Minister may direct&rdquo;.  Bear in mind the last clause.  The meat is in paragraph (e).</P>
      <P>I should like to know what, by way of example, might the Minister &ldquo;otherwise direct&rdquo;?  He has taken certain powers and the first four provisions in subsection (3) refer to the roads, the classes of vehicles and the tolls.  Presumably the cost of the toll would be some function of the cost of the capital installation of the toll road facilities.  Those first four categories make a certain amount of sense.  They are a rational follow through to the decision to establish toll roads, but there is a fifth clause which provides that a toll scheme shall specify such other information as the road authority may consider appropriate or the Minister may direct.

      <P>We have a proposal here that a local authority draft a toll scheme, designate the roads and designate by whom the roads are likely to be used. Also they are to designate the categories of vehicles that are likely to be used on the roads and the charges.  But I am at a loss to understand paragraph (e) which provides that a toll scheme shall:</P>
      <P>specify such other information as the road authority may consider appropriate or the Minister may direct.</P>
      <P>It might be provided, for example, that driving was prohibited on the road at night in a built-up area or on bank holidays or religious holidays.  That sort of problem would rest with the local road authority in drafting a scheme, but under the draft legislation the Minister will have the power to direct certain other information as being a part of the road scheme.  Presumably in drafting that provision the Minister had regard to one or more than one theoretical possibility whereby he would need to be in a position to direct other information.  I am seeking an example of what other information might be required.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) The making of bye-laws under this section by a road authority shall <Col N="993" /> be a reserved function within the meaning of the Cork City Manage-ment Acts, 1929 to 1971, the Local Government (Dublin) Acts, 1930 to 1971, the Limerick City Management Acts, 1934 to 1971, the Waterford City Management Acts, 1939 to 1971, and the County Management Acts, 1940 to 1972.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the drawing up of by-laws fixing the charge for the amount of tolls is a reserved function.  The Minister told me I need not worry about that because all the County Management Acts make the drawing up of bye-laws a reserved function. These bye-laws fall into that category and will become a reserved function.  Therefore I withdraw my amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>We rushed through section 4 but there was not much of consequence in it.  All it provided was for the public to call for a public inquiry.  The Minister must have regard to any objections raised but since this enabling legislation will never be implemented, this is an Alice-in-Wonderland exercise.</P>
      <P>On section 5 I want to ask a question about the increase in the toll charges.  If a local authority wish to increase their toll charge from 30p to 40p to whom do they apply?  On what basis will the Minister for the day grant that increase?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Unfortunately inflation is not partisan with regard to the Government of the day. Let us live with the reality that inflation will be here for some time.  If a local authority wish to finance a toll facility, borrow and calculate their toll charges to service that loan and then find, because of inflation that they must increase their toll charges, from whom do <Col N="994" /> they get permission?  We have been assured that this is a reserved function. Therefore does the application for an increase in toll charges go before the Minister or his successor or is it referred to the National Prices Commission?  In other words is there any cost control element in this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Prices Commission do not enter into it.  The bye-laws would not take effect until they have been submitted and confirmed by the Minister for the Environment and require a month's notice in the press which allows for an inspection of the bye-laws by the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me construct a hypothetical situation.  A local authority, who have to suffer under the rigours of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, calculate their financial figures for the year, including the revenue from their toll road, and subtract the amount due to the participating component of the private sector.  They come up with an amount which in the view of the county treasurer is necessary to meet their overall requirements, but because of increasing capital interest charges during the year, they are required to raise additional sums of money.  They apply to the Minister to increase the toll charge, they meet all the requirements in terms of notification and so on, but in the event of the Minister of the day saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to an increase, what happens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is saying that every road authority has total autonomy to devise a scheme of toll roads under this legislation but any change or increase in the amount of the toll charge will require the Minister's approval.  Is that right?  If Deputy Fitzpatrick and I were members of the same local authority and applied for an increase in toll charges because the interest charges on our loan increased from 13 per cent to 15 per cent, and that changed the nature of the long-term requirements of the money we borrowed, under subsection (2) we have to come back to the Minister for approval. What guarantee is there that the road authority will get a response within a certain amount of time or what room for <Col N="995" /> manoeuvre do they have in the event of such a thing happening?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>They require my consent to the bye-laws under which they make the changes.  The change in the parking meter charges is a typical example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If at first the authority establish the toll road charge for the Naas by-pass at 40p, and within a certain period they decide that because of X, Y and Z factors the charge should be increased to 60p, 70p or 80p, does the Minister not have any say in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  The Deputy realises that a local authority will not set exorbitant charges which would mean that the toll facilities would not be used by many people.  Any price increase is bound to be reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister's desire to facilitate the private sector, which appears to be contradicted in section 1, his desire to facilitate local authorities to initiate these schemes and at the same time totally abdicating responsibility for any kind of monitoring system in subsequent toll charges.  We could end up with arbitrary increases in tolls which would bear no relation to the cost of servicing the capital and interest. In this legislation there is total absence of any relationship to a national roads plan or of cross subsidisation between one local authority scheme and another. It is so naïve that it is frightening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister is saying is that once a local authority get permission to make a bye-law to administer a toll road he will not have any say in regard to the toll charges.  If that is so, this is enabling legislation of enormous proportions which has no regard to other cost factors within the economy.  For instance, a local authority who get themselves into a traffic jam, like Nass, could find themselves in a bonanza position because of juggernauts, and they could boost their road toll facilities and make more revenue from them than the cost of servicing capital and interest.  This is extraordinary economic philosophy from a <Col N="996" /> Minister who has told us he has been considering this Bill for 18 months.</P>

      <P>No.  That would be an amendment.  In reply to the Deputy's earlier question, section 219 of the 1878 Act provides for the making of by-laws under the common seal of a local authority and for their amendment or repeal by a subsequent bye-law.  It requires that bye-laws shall not be repugnant to the Act under which they are made or to the Constitution of the State. Section 221 requires the submission of the bye-laws to the Minister and their approval by him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 48, after &ldquo;am-bulances&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and pedestrians and pedal cyclists and invalid carriages or vehicles specially constructed or adapted for use by physically handicapped persons and vehicles occupied only by persons entitled to free travel&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section proposes to exempt vehicles belonging to and used for official purposes by the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána and fire brigade vehicles and ambulances.  In drawing up the Bill the Minister went to considerable trouble to ensure that discretion would not lie with local authorities in regard to <Col N="998" /> the charging of tolls on vehicles belonging to and used for official purpose by the Army and Garda or in respect of fire brigade and ambulance vehicles.</P>
    <P>Does that need re-drafting?  It says,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Vehicles belonging to and used for official purposes by the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The vehicles would not belong to the Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána; they would be owned by the Minister's Department or a Department of State. Anyway, the intention of the Minister in drafting the section is to ensure that the Defence Force vehicles, Garda Síochána vehicles and fire brigade vehicles shall not be charged tolls.  I accept that, but I want to provide also that other vehicles shall not be subject to tolls and that it be specifically written into the section that they shall not be charged tolls.  The classes of people I want to exempt are pedestrians, pedal cyclists, invalid carriages, vehicles specially constructed or adapted for use by physically handicapped persons and vehicles occupied only be persons eligible for free travel.  I submit that this last is a reasonable category of people to exclude and it is just as reasonable that we should write their exclusion into the Bill as to write in, as we have done, the exclusion of the Defence Force, Garda Síochána and fire brigade vehicles.</P>
    <P>We have a group known as the Irish Wheelchair Association who are doing very good and charitable work in the interests of a particularly deserving section of the community, and we go to considerable trouble to meet their reasonable demands.  In and around Leinster House certain alterations have been made so that people confined to wheelchairs can drive their wheelchairs into Leinster House without going up steps, and it is accepted policy that public buildings have facilities for wheelchairs and vehicles used by physically handicapped people.  That is as it should be.  Before car tax up to £16 was abolished the Motor Taxation Acts had the provision that vehicles built, altered or adapted for use by physically handicapped people were not charged road tax and I think they also received an allowance of petrol at a reduced <Col N="999" /> charge without the element of tax. Therefore, over the years we have recognised the requirements of physically handicapped people who rely on vehicles in place of their legs and who cannot conveniently, or in some cases at all, get around without the aid of special carriages or specially adapted motor vehicles. I ask the Minister to write into this Bill that invalid carriages and motor vehicles specially constructed, altered or adapted for use by the physically handicapped people are excluded.</P>
    <P>There is an unanswerable argument in favour of that.  It is no good for the Minister to say that the local authorities in drawing up their schemes or in drafting their bye-laws can make provision for this.  That is true, but we here should give the headline.  We should set the example.  When we call on the private sector to make provision in building their places of recreation, shops and places of business, to provide for handicapped people, they will not take us seriously unless we take this golden opportunity of doing something more than paying lip-service to this category of people.  We would be lacking in our duty, and no amount of off-pushing or passing the buck or saying that it can be done by the local authority or somebody else is enough.  The same argument would apply to the Garda Síochána vehicles, the Defence Force vehicles and the ambulances, but the Minister has seen it necessary to put that beyond doubt and to write their exclusion into this section.  I am asking him to write in the same exclusion in respect of invalid carriages and vehicles specially constructed or adapted for use by physically handicapped persons.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to exclude also two other categories.  We have provided free transport under Social Welfare and other Bills for people over 66 years of age.  Indeed, if the Minister's colleague was worth his salt he would have reduced that to 65 years of age in the budget, but he did not do so.  At any rate, people of 66 and over are entitled to free public transport.  Also people in receipt of certain categories of pensions, such as disabled person's allowance and <Col N="1000" /> invalidity pension, are also entitled to free transport.  I am asking the Minister to exclude from tolls vehicles occupied solely by such people and to write that into this Bill.  There would be no difficulty in identifying these people.  They have to be identified if they are availing of public transport, and they are identified by the production of their old age pension book, disabled person's allowance book or whatever other entitlement document they have to the qualifying pension or allowance.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to do something now which he can do without messing around with the whole Act, and that is to exclude pedestrians.  Surely it is not our intention to charge a toll to pedestrians.  If it is not, what is the objection to writing that into the Bill and to indicating that this is a Bill for vehicles, not a Bill for pedestrians?  Not alone do we think in this House that you should not impose a toll on pedestrians but we are not going to give the machinery to impose such a toll.  There is no use in this blank cheque business or buck passing. We should write into the Bill here and now that we are not going to impose a toll on pedestrians either on footpaths or roads.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is not the intention of this House to charge a toll to pedal cyclists.  I have specifically written pedal cyclists into the amendment.  We should not impose a toll on them but we should give the lead.  It is unreasonable that handicapped people in handicapped carriages should be charged a toll and we should say this.  I am sure we think it unreasonable that people who are entitled to free transport and who are driving on a public road should be charged a toll and we should say so.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): No.  I am talking about private cars.  I do not accept that they are not entitled to have private cars. <Col N="1001" /> People who enjoy free transport on a bus from Dublin to Cork may have private cars.  We should write into the Bill that if they are in their own cars they should not be charged a toll.  I am sure we believe that pedestrians should not be charged a toll and we should write it into the Bill.  We should do the same with regard to pedal cyclists.  I would be glad to hear the Minister's view on this.  He has apparently come into the House un-prepared to yield anything.  He is apparently saying: &ldquo;Here is the Bill and as far as we are concerned you can charge handicapped people, pedestrians, old age pensioners and anybody you like a toll.&rdquo; I do not accept that and I do not believe that is in keeping with our social policy. In recent years our social philosophy has been towards providing those people with the little privileges they have and that I am now asking for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is depriving those people of the privileges the Deputy mentioned.  The main point in section 6 is to exempt vehicles which are being used for security purposes and emergencies. It is left to the discretion of the local authorities to make whatever other exemptions they feel they should make.  A circular went out from my Department before this Bill came in here asking local authorities to make provision for invalid people and they have done so.  I have complete confidence in the elected members of local authorities to make those exemptions at their discretion, even those the Deputy has mentioned.  I would not have complete confidence that they would go as far as exempting a person entitled to free public transport when driving a private car because that person could be driving a car belonging to another person.  This is entirely up to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take parking meters, for example. Invalid cars are exempt under the bye-laws because Dublin Corporation thought fit to exempt them.  The same applies to pedestrians.  This section exempts security vehicles and emergency vehicles.  The elected representatives of local authorities have discretion to make whatever other exemptions they think fit. I am confident that they will exempt <Col N="1002" /> people, such as invalids, who are entitled to be exempt.  I leave the matter to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment.  This section highlights the cursory and casual manner in which the Bill was drafted. Any public servant in the Department of the Environment who is handed the brief to get the parliamentary draftsman to draft that particular section would be embarrassed.  It underlines, as well as the amendment tabled by Deputy Fitzpatrick, the fundamental nonsense of this Bill.</P>
      <P>We will now have a situation where the Minister's car will be exempt from paying a toll charge when crossing the bridge, which presumably is to be built by Roadstone.  I presume that Roadstone lorries will get a special exemption as part of the contract they will sign with Dublin Corporation.  Surely we are bordering on the verge of the absurd.  I am a member of Dublin County Council and the chairman of the South County Committee of Dublin County Council. As a member of a local authority I can see the absurd joint meetings we will have between Dún Laoghaire Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation when we face Roadstone across the table and say: &ldquo;What about CIE buses?  Will we charge them a toll to cross the bridge?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>You must be farcical councillors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not.  I do not know about Dublin Corporation but Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation are very responsible. We will say that the Minister's car, Garda cars, health board ambulances from the Eastern Health Board, the Southern Health Board and the Western Health Board which cross this new bridge will be exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The poor toll clerks will have a difficult job.  We will have the Dublin Fire Bridage from Tara Street going across the bridge 30 or 40 times a day and they will be exempt.  Presumably the fire chief's private car will be exempt as he follows the fire brigade across the bridge provided he can be identified in time. <Col N="1003" /> The B+I lorries will have to pay a toll. Aer Lingus vans will have to pay a toll. We give a £40 million subsidy to CIE and then we charge them a toll on each of their major container lorries coming out of the North Wall to cross the Liffey. We pay the money on a contractual basis to a private enterprise company, presumably Roadstone, who have made approaches to the Minister on this matter. He has not disclosed the other interests.</P>
    <P>Let us take the situation where the Minister says that ambulances will be given an exemption.  Will the Gleeson Ambulance Service in Stillorgan, a private enterprise profit-making ambulance service, get an exemption and the Eastern Health Board ambulance have parity with them?  What about the Waverley Ambulance Service, a private ambulance service?  Will there be special exemption for them?  They will then charges patients a high fee to bring them to hospital plus the toll charge.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister has exposed the fundamental inadequacy of this Bill. Once he starts making exemptions and starts building into legislation special exemptions he will never know where he begins and ends.  It is rather like the 2 per cent agricultural levy.  We knock out the pig farmers, the liquid dairy farmers and certain crops and before we know where we are we have a cumbersome system of administration of the 2 per cent levy, which will be impossible to administer. The Minister passes the buck to the local authorities and tells them they will have to add on any additional toll exemption categories that they wish to have.</P>
    <P>I can see a situation where at our first meeting every Dublin Corporation refuse lorry will have to be exempted. Will we have to pay Dublin County Council for picking up refuse?  Will we be paying Roadstone 25p or £1 a go for crossing the river Liffey on a bridge built by them at the expense of the taxpayers, with a nominal contribution by them, and they would rake off a £½ million a year profit for the next 20 years?  Is the Minister out of his mind?  I have no objection to toll bridges as such&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am objecting to the fact that the Minister is giving a ripoff from the ordinary people, including pedestrians, disabled drivers and so on, unless we get special exemption as local authorities, to a private company to build a bridge across the river Liffey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be difficult for Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dublin Corporation jointly to raise from public capital £5 million, £10 million or £15 million and build the bridge employing public contractors and if necessary we could charge a toll.  But Fianna Fáil have agreed to allow a couple of private entrepreneurs with £8 million or £9 million to build the toll bridges.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has been trying to build some sort of safeguard into this ludicrous legislation for disabled persons, pedestrians and a lot of other groups who should get exemption.</P>
      <P>I cannot see this working.  I have been on toll roads in America and on the Continent and I know how they operate. However, in the Irish situation&mdash;particularly in the Dublin traffic situation where there has to be about six rows of traffic lights, and we would spend about 70 per cent of the money collected from tolls trying to administer a very com-plicated system, with traffic backing up on to the quays&mdash;I cannot see a system like that operating.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn has been reasonable and fair in relation to this.  If on an emergency basis we have to build bypasses, river bridges or ferries and have to use a toll system it must be under the rigid control of the local authority and must not be operated on a joint venture arrangement where the public are bled pink by entrepreneurs who have an inordinate say in the provision of the facility and in the arrangements for its operation. The Minister should have another look at this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am tempted to put down an amendment exempting all CIE buses and local <Col N="1005" /> authority transport fleets because we in Dublin County Council will have to spend another note down to the Custom House showing the charge in 1981 for toll purposes. An additional £50,000 subvention from the Department of the Environment will have to be trotted up to us in O'Connell Street because we would have to charge it up.  Fianna Fáil rampaged about this type of circular payments during the term of the last Coalition Government, this system of robbing Peter in one Department to pay Paul in another.  It is ridiculous.  To what extent will there be a degree of exemption?  I can see total chaos in the greater Dublin area with fire brigade crews flashing their exemption passes, Garda drivers and a fleet of Army people coming up to a Special Criminal Court sitting, flashing their exemption passes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>The Deputy must think it is the Chinese army, it is going on so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can add to that. There will have to be an exemption for Dublin Corporation who employ a fleet of 500 or 600 vehicles and Dublin County Council who employ over 2,000 people, many of whom drive trucks, will also have to have an exemption.  Aer Lingus will demand an exemption.  B+I will demand an exemption and CIE will have to get an exemption.  In the end, half of the population of Dublin will be crossing the notorious toll bridges holding up their special exemption passes. That is the kind of lunatic legislation proposed for toll users.  By the time we are finished we will have to give exemptions to blind pedestrians and one-legged pedestrians.  We will have to categorise them too, since we cannot give an exemption to all pedestrians.  I do not know what the Minister will produce by way of toll legislation.  It is blatantly obvious from this section with the exemption from tolls now built in, that the farce is about to explode.  The Minister should certainly have a second look at this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I nearly missed the introduction of this Bill earlier on because the Minister introduced it in one of the most rapid introductions <Col N="1006" /> in the history of ministerial presentations here, in ten minutes flat.  I listened in my room to the debate this morning and the more it progressed the more obvious it became that the Minister has not a clue about the operation of toll roads.  I suggest that the Minister go to France&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to the US to have a look at the way they operate their system and try to translate that to 300 yards below Butt Bridge and try to build a bridge from Ringsend across and see how it operates.  There is only one conclusion to come to, that is that Dublin Corporation and the local authorities should build another bridge without the aid of this outrageous legislation across which we could have free access.</P>
      <P>Dublin traffic is moving slowly enough at present without every unfortunate pedestrian and motorist coming from the north side to the south side having to stop every day and put in his token and his 50p or 20p to get across. The system was envisaged by the Minister and by some of the well-heeled entrepreneurs who have nothing to think about but how to spend the £10 million or £15 million in their pockets.  The Minister has been taken for a bit of a toll ride on this section.  The sooner he realises he is dealing with a farcical Bill the better for the House.</P>

      <P>I hope there are not too many members like Deputy Desmond on Dublin County Council.  He suggested I should have another look at the Bill.  I suggest he should have his first look at it.  Obviously he has no idea whatsoever of what is involved in the Bill.  Otherwise he would not have said some of the things he said.  If the proposed bridge which he mentioned is to be cluttered up with traffic, pedestrians, and other people trying to get across it, we can only assume that the other bridges will fall into the Liffey and disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond made allegations about people who are supposed to be involved <Col N="1007" /> in the proposed bridge.  He said it was a commitment given by Fianna Fáil at election time, or words to that effect. That is not so.  I did not know there was such a proposal anywhere until I became Minister.  This much I do know.  The same people were in consultation on more than one occasion with my predecessor who is a party colleague of his.

      <P>I should imagine that if this thing develops there will be a joint committee in operation between the Dun Laoghaire Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council. My constituency has the highest number of cars in the country <i>per capita.</i> My constituents are enormously interested in this magnificent solution to Dublin's transportation chaos.  Already in the local elections campaign the reaction of the car owning population in Dublin to this toll road proposition is overwhelmingly vicious.  In the local elections the Minister's candidates will have a hard job if they have to say to people: &ldquo;If you want to cross the Liffey it will cost you 20p a time and another 20p to come back again&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister is on a loser in relation to this proposition.  I cannot see Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council or Dún Laoghaire Corporation going ahead with it.  The Minister says it is an enabling proposition but I cannot see them responding to the nonsense proposed in this Bill particularly in relation to the Dublin area.  The Dublin Port and Docks Board have to be sorted out as well and, as the Minister knows, to do that you would want to be up at about 3 o'clock in the morning and not to go to bed until about 2 o'clock the following morning, and you would want to do that for about ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exemptions proposed by Deputy Fitzpatrick are eminently reasonable. They have exposed a fundamental flaw in the Bill which shows up the undesirable nature of this type of legislation <Col N="1010" /> which deserves the most strenuous opposition in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): We are now stuck with the Bill.  We are discussing an amendment in my name to add certain categories to the exclusion provisions in section 6.  I am particularly surprised and saddened that the Minister would not yield even in regard to the carriages and motor cars of physically handicapped people.  It is sickening, I would even say it is nauseating, to hear Members of the Government at every available oppor-tunity making speeches in support of this category of persons and exhorting the private sector to make provision for them in their shops and in their cinemas, in their places of entertainment and their places of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to what the Minister said, it is a bit of make-believe, a bit of window-dressing, to see a couple of steps outside Leinster House changed to accommodate those people.  It was done because we are ashamed when those people come here in vehicles and we would be exposed to the public if we did not make some cosmetic improvement outside this building to facilitate them.  For many years after coming here I advocated that public authorities should facilitate handicapped people by reserving a quota of jobs for them in the public service.  I understand that this is being done now to some small extent but it is not before time.  The people who have to go through life with their handicaps should be able to avail of a charter that would make life easier for them.  We made provision for them in respect of tax on their vehicles.  It was necessary to write that provision into an Act of <Col N="1011" /> Parliament.  We made provision for them, too, in respect of a pay-back of tax on petrol but here we have a golden opportunity of recognising the plight of these people and of giving a lead, of giving an example to other people whom we exhort to facilitate the handicapped.  But the Minister is not prepared to yield one iota in respect of what I am seeking.  I am satisfied that section 6 is another precedent taken from some Bill or perhaps from some British Act and incorporated into this Bill.  This is the lazy way of dealing with it but why can the Minister not open up his mind and listen to reasonable argument?  It is not unreasonable to ask him to exclude this category of people from the tolls.  By not doing so he has illustrated a miserable approach.  Without wishing to be emotive I re-echo what Deputy Tully said&mdash;that the Minister excludes his car but will not exclude the cripple's carriage. I am sorry to have to say that but that is the situation.  We know that ministerial cars are Garda cars on duty and these are exempt but the unfortunate person in a three-wheeled car will have to pay the toll.  That is not the sort of example that we should be giving either to the private sector or to the public authorities to whom we are appealing to cater for the mentally handicapped.  The Minister should be man enough to accept the amendment.  Perhaps the exclusion of this category in the first place was an oversight but the Minister now has the opportunity of putting the matter right.  It is not as if there were some vast principle involved.  It is merely a question of decency, of recognising that these people are not as fortunate as the rest of us.</P>
    <P>I have received a good deal of correspondence from people representing the wheelchair category and I have always promised them that if the opportunity arose I would ventilate their grievances here.  The Minister has nothing to lose by accepting the amendment and the Bill would be all the better for its inclusion.  In addition, the Minister would be giving concrete evidence of the concern of himself and of the Government for the less fortunate among us.  I <Col N="1012" /> have no objection whatever to the exclusions specified in the Bill.  The Minister seemed to think that ambulances were confined to health board or State ambulances but the reference is to ambulances. I do not object to that but I object to the Minister coming in here with a closed, selfish mind, not being prepared to yield or to say he will look at this matter with a view to dealing with it before the Bill is passed.  There is more involved here than ensuring that the physically handicapped are exempted from the provisions of the Bill.  There is involved the question of establishing that our Parliament recognises the handicaps of these people and is prepared to write into every Act of Parliament possible a direction to the general public to have regard to the shortcomings of the handicapped. This Bill affords the perfect opportunity for such a display of concern. I expect that the general public would be astonished and shocked to know the length of time we have had to spend discussing a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>All I am asking is that in addition to excluding Garda vehicles, defence force vehicles and ambulances, there are excluded also carriages or motor cars that have been adapted specially for use by the physically handicapped.  I am sure that any rational section of the community would agree with me.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am sure that the Minister would consider a local authority to be irrational if they did not exclude from the tolls provision Defence Force vehicles, yet this category is written into the Bill. In other words, the Minister is not prepared to rely on the rational approach or on the common sense of local authorities in this instance.  The Minister for Defence, the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and the health boards are well able to fight their own corners. They are well able to pay for the services but the unfortunate handicapped person who may be poor as well as handicapped has not that power.  He is not in a position, as is a Minister, to walk across the corridor to the Minister for the Environment <Col N="1013" /> asking that certain vehicles be excluded.  The Minister for Defence, for example, only has to lift the intercom and talk with the Minister for the Environment, telling him that Defence Force vehicles should be excluded specifically from the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister for Justice can do likewise in respect of Garda cars and the same applies to the Minister for Health is respect of ambulances.  It is not good enough to leave those who are least well able to protect themselves to the mercy of other people.  Though local authorities could be expected to be charitable and humane and to protect the physically handicapped, we should have a written declaration of our concern for those people. It is not enough for Ministers and politicians on suitable occasions to exhort other people to make provision for the physically handicapped in public buildings and other places.  When an opportunity occurs to write a mini-charter on their behalf into an Act of Parliament it should be done.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Fitzpatrick in challenging a division on this section because I can see many complications arising in relation to it. We have not received any answers to the questions we put to the Minister.  We wanted to know whether the Minister would favour excluding certain categories.  Local authorities are not given any guidance with the exception of being told that they can categorise certain exemptions if they wish.  A person amusingly said to me recently that it was good to die on the south side of Dublin because when one went on one's last journey to Dean's Grange it was not necessary to pay 50p in toll charges to cross the Liffey in a hearse for the last time.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister favour exempting vehicles of disabled drivers?  What will local authorities do when every category imaginable approach them for exemptions? Every undertaker in Dublin will want his fleet exempt on the grounds that if they are not they will have to increase their charges.  What is the position in relation to CIE vehicles?  If they are not exempt bus fares will rise.</P>

      <P>What is the position in relation to the enormous fleet of vehicles of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs?  This must be one of the biggest public service fleets operating and I should like to know why they are not worthy of an exemption when Garda vehicles are.  Whether it is an undertaker's hearse, or vehicles of disabled drivers, gardaí, the Defence Forces, CIE, Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council, Dublin Fire Brigade, Eastern Health Board or the Rotunda Hospital they will all have to be given an exemp-tion from this notorious toll charge.  We will also have to exempt vehicles of the Office of Public Works bringing material and other objects to this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister is proposing something ludicrous which does not deserve support. He has only had the gumption to exempt the Army and Garda but left it to local authorities to add on the 30 or 40 exemptions which will have to be given.  The question then arises: &ldquo;Why a toll charge in the first instance and why this kind of proposition which people find so objectionable?&rdquo;  In the election campaign literature we will be circulating in the Greater Dublin area we intend stating that we are totally opposed to any toll bridge being erected in Dublin.  The ordinary people driving cars are entitled to cross the River Liffey without having to pay Roadstone or any other private entrepreneur 20p or 50p for the privilege of travelling across their own river.  Local authorities have the money, the expertise and the competence to build such bridges.  If they have to charge a toll they may do so, but we will not give so-called private entrepreneurs a handy rake-off like the Fianna Fáil Party are doing as part of their ideological nonsense about the role of private enterprise.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I suggest that subsection (1) needs redrafting: It states:</P>
      <P>Vehicles belonging to and used for official purposes by the Defence Forces and the Garda Siochána, and fire brigade vehicles and ambulances shall be exempt from payment of tolls.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces and the Garda, as such, do not own the motor vehicles referred to.  The vehicles used by them are the property of the Minister.  Under the 1961 Road Traffic Act, if a person is injured by one of those vehicles it is either the Minister in charge of the Department or the Minister for Finance who is sued.  It is only a drafting matter and I suggest it be looked at.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister clearly un-derstands that he is exempting all ambulances. I do not object to that, but I wish to point out that earlier the Minister told Deputy Desmond to read the Bill so that he would know what he was talking about.  There is nothing in subsection (2) to identify health board ambulances from private ambulances.  It states that &ldquo;ambulance&rdquo; means a mechanically propelled vehicle which is outwardly identifiable as and is used exclusively for the carriage of sick, injured or disabled persons.  &ldquo;Fire brigade vehicle&rdquo; has a funny definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;fire brigade vehicle&rdquo; means a mechanically propelled vehicle used for the purpose of fire-fighting or rescuing persons or property from danger or for both such purposes.</P>
      <P>A vehicle not necessarily having anything to do with a fire brigade could fall within that definition.</P>
      <P>In my opinion the section as it will leave the House is a bad one.  It contains very few exclusions.  It does not exclude a number of deserving categories, those set out in my amendment.  Local authorities may be so afraid of opening the floodgates, mentioned by Deputy Desmond, of applications for exclusions that they will simply rely on the statutory definitions of &ldquo;Garda,&rdquo;&ldquo;fire brigade&rdquo; and ambulances in general.  If that is so, as a country we will suffer and as a people we will appear callous, hard and cruel.</P>
      <P>I do not like to draw comparisons between Ministers, but it is a pity all Ministers do not come in here prepared at least to listen to argument in support of amendments that do not propose to do violence to the principles or the machinery of Bills.  Who am I to be giving lectures to Ministers?  On their heads be it if they come in here unprepared to listen to reasonable argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The section enables the Minister to make regulations as follows:</P>
      <P>(a) for the purposes of this Act and for enabling this Act and any scheme under section 3, or agreement under section 9, of this Act to have full effect, and</P>
      <P>(b) providing for the application of any moneys accruing to a road authority from the operation and management of a toll road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us his thinking behind this.  If tolls are going to private individuals who construct roads or bridges or who operate them under agreements, I presume the agreements will decide where the tolls will go.  But if such structures are operated by local <Col N="1019" /> authorities will the local authorities collect the tolls and apply them as they do any other income such as house rents, weighbridge charges and revenue from other services, or does the Minister intend that this money will go to him just as the Road Fund revenue did?</P>
    <P>The more one delves into the provisions of this Bill the more they resemble another form of road tax.  Even the very term &ldquo;toll&rdquo;, which is not defined in the Bill, we find defined in Chambers' Dictionary as a tax for use of a road.  This provision is giving the Minister authority to say how the tolls will be disposed of and how they will be applied.  That smacks of a road tax which the local authority collect as agent for the Minister for the Environment and duly remit to him for disposal as he thinks fit.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (2) provides that regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and that is a satisfactory arrangement. I should like to hear the Minister on the other points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 (1) (a) mentions in particular the matters of toll schemes under section 3 and agreements with private persons under section 9.  It may be desirable that the Minister should make regulations in regard to the publication and public display of toll schemes.  This type of scheme is a new field for local authorities and for the Minister.  The intention is that the need for making regulations under this paragraph would be left open for consideration in the light of experience of the application of the provisions of the Bill.  With regard to subsection (1) (b) it is envisaged that any dues collected will go initially towards defraying the cost of construction, maintenance and management of toll roads, the latter function to include expenses and, of course, the collection of tolls.  In the event of a surplus it is desirable that the Minister should have the power to determine how the proceeds might be disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of an agreement with a person under section 9 under which that person might be entitled to retain part of the proceeds of the tolls, the intention is <Col N="1020" /> that the regulation under this Bill would apply only to the net proceeds which would accrue to the road authority after the private entrepreneur had deducted the amounts due to him under the terms of his agreement.  As the Deputy said, subsection (2) of this section provides that the usual safeguard, whereby either House of the Oireachtas can pass a resolution to amend any regulation which the Members consider unacceptable, gives the same right.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Minister says that it is desirable that he should have power to give directions as to disposal of any sur-plus tolls which the local authority might have.  I should like him to say why he thinks it is necessary to have such authority or to vest such authority in the Custom House.  I take it that he does not have the same authority in regard to many other sources of income of the local authorities.  I presume that there is a general statutory obligation on a local authority to account for all income that they receive.  What is the objection to this income falling into that residue and being disposed of in accordance with existing statutes or existing auditing procedures and regulations?</P>

By regulation my predecessor had the power to decide how any surplus would be disposed of.  The same applies to income from housing, and there are a number of headings in the Local Government Acts which ensure that the Minister can decide how surpluses are disposed of to ensure that they will not be disposed of in a way that was never intended.

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) An agreement under this sec-tion shall provide for its termination when the other party has been reasonably remunerated for any capital moneys expended by him on the road.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 authorises a road authority with the consent of the Minister to enter into an agreement with another person, presumably a private individual, under which upon such terms and conditions as may be specified in the agreement the person agrees to do a number of things; to construct or maintain a road or to construct or maintain a bridge.  In return <Col N="1022" /> it is visualised that the person who enters into that agreement with the road authority will collect the tolls and recoup his expenditure in that way.  The section also provides that the agreement may contain a condition providing for its duration and for its termination or suspension and for matters connected with or incidental or ancillary to or consequent upon the expiration of the agreement or such termination or suspension.</P>
    <P>I am not against private enterprise being brought into the operation of toll roads or toll bridges, subject to what I am going to say now.  Private enterprise should not be brought into this activity on a once only basis.  If private enterprise come into this sort of operation it should not be to skim off the cream and leave the skim milk behind.  If private enterprise come into an operation like that they should take some of the rough with the smooth.  For example, they should not come in on a basis that they would lose money, but if private enterprise come in and are given a choice site, the most profitable site in the whole island, then, having entered into that contract, they should enter into another contract perhaps in regard to some other part of the country where a bridge or road would be necessary and where the profit might not be as great but where on the overall they would show a profit.  That is a reasonable proposition but, as far as we know, what will happen here is that private enterprise will be offered a contract to erect a bridge in a position where not alone there cannot be a loss but there will be a very handsome profit.  Since there is nothing in the Bill to ensure that private enterprise will take the rough with the smooth or will do a less profitable job as well as the most profitable job, I want to put a condition into this section that protects the public sector.  The amendment which I propose to write into section 9 is to add a subsection before subsection (3).  The new subsection would read:</P>
    <P>An agreement under this section shall provide for its termination when the other party has been reasonably remunerated for any capital moneys expended by him on the road.</P>
    <P>That is a reasonable amendment and a <Col N="1023" /> reasonable safeguard for the State.  I would prefer if we knew a lot more about this Bill.  I would prefer it if the Minister had come in here and told us that after consultation with the private sector he had quite an elaborate scheme of bridges and roads throughout the country, and while he might not spell out the individuals or companies concerned he would spell out the locations.  That is not the position.  The Minister came into the House either without any information, without any research into his proposal or with the determination that he would not impart this information to the House.  I believe that the Minister has not sufficiently studied this and that while he has some sort of general idea in the back of his head that the Bill will be used for other sites at some indefinite time in the future, its main object is to provide for one operation in this city, which consists of a bridge across the River Liffey in the most profitable site in the whole of the country.</P>
    <P>No risk is being taken by the private sector.  There is no reason why the public sector could not do the work as quickly as the private sector and have the benefit of the profits from it.  If the argument is that the bridge is badly needed and the State has not the funds to do the job and cannot get them without letting other roads run down or neglecting something else, that may be an argument for giving this valuable contract to the private sector. If that is the case the public sector need some protection which should be written into the Bill.  The protection to the public sector should be that the agreement entered into in this once and for all operation should contain the clause which I propose, that is one providing for the termination of the agreement when the other party have been reasonably remunerated for any capital expended by them on the roads.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that that is not elaborate enough, that nobody would enter into that type of agreement, but the House knows what I have in mind.  If that needs improvement the Minister's draftsman could draft a better subsection. We want to make sure that we will not hand over a licence to the private <Col N="1024" /> sector to print money.  If we entered into an agreement with a private individual to build a bridge across the Liffey without a protective clause in it for the public sector we would be issuing a licence to the contractor to print money because he would have a gold mine.  I do not believe that is what we want.</P>
    <P>There could be other instances throughout the country where such an exercise would not be so remunerative but we have not heard of any of them from the Minister.  He has led us to believe that there are soundings but they have not come to fruition.  I do not believe that an agreement should be entered into in a wave of euphoria and enthusiasm for this scheme.  I want to emphasise that I am not against the concept of building a bridge but when we are changing the whole policy in relation to this the public sector need protection as well as the private sector.  I am asking the Minister to write the necessary protection for the State into the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is already written in in subsection (2) (b) where it states that an agreement may provide for its duration and for its termination and a local authority ensures that the public are protected from what Deputy Fitzpatrick is afraid of in any agreement. I would like to emphasise for the umpteenth time that this Bill is not brought in to facilitate any single company, individual or proposal.  It is a proposal which has got a lot of press coverage.  There has been interest in other rivers.  The Liffey is not the only river in Ireland.  We have the upper and lower Shannon, Cork city and many other areas which may lend themselves to this type of proposal.  This should not be confined in the narrow-minded way that has been going on between the two parties in regard to the Liffey.  This enables us to have such a scheme in any part of the country or to entertain a proposal for such a scheme in any part of the country.  It is a matter of conjecture whether this proposal, which has been referred to so often here, will be the licence to print money.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business: - Primary Schools Grant: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy Horgan on Tuesday, 6 March, 1979:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;noting the fact that the present capitation grant for pupils in primary schools is grossly inadequate;</P>
    <P>&mdash;noting that the Government, in spite of their Manifesto commitment to immediately increase the capitation grant, has still not paid any increase in the grant beyond the level determined prior to the 1977 General Election;</P>
    <P>&mdash;conscious of the rapidly escalating cost of heating and cleaning national schools, and the increasing burden being put on local communities in this regard;</P>
    <P>&mdash;alarmed at the deterioration in many school premises because of lack of proper maintenance, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;critical of the failure of the Minister for Education to ensure continued and adequate teacher representation on school management boards;</P>
    <P>calls on the Government immediately to increase the capitation grant for pupils in primary schools to an interim minimum of £15.00 per pupil, together with an appropriate rate of local contribution, in order to ensure that heating and cleaning of national schools reaches an acceptable standard, and in order to ensure that the already marked deterioration in the condition of many schools is halted;</P>
    <P>calls on the Government to introduce a minimum capitation grant payment for all schools of at least £750, regardless of pupil enrolment; and</P>
    <P>calls on the Government to make a positive response to proposals by teachers and others for more appropriate structures for representation and accountability within the school management system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> Debate resumed on the amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;approves of the policy of the Minister for Education in providing increased financial aid for national schools and notes with satisfaction the efforts being made by the Minister to secure agreement from all the parties involved in regard to the revision of the Constitution and Rules of Procedure for Boards of Management of National Schools.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time left to me I will make some comments on the boards of management of national schools and I will express my disappointment at the manner in which this whole matter has been handled by the Minister.  It was clearly understood when the boards of management of national schools were established in 1975 by the former Minister, Deputy R. Burke, that they were established for a three-year period and that after that period a review would take place.  It is plainly obvious now that the review was not undertaken in time to allow for the restructuring of the boards. Do nothing until you are forced to do it is a typical attitude in the Department of Education, but it is a most unsatisfactory manner in which to run such a Department.  The need for the review was obvious and was plainly called for. Nevertheless nothing was done and as a result there has been criticism and severe friction between members of the INTO and the Minister.  There was criticism from parents who felt left out of participation in a real sense on boards of management.  <i>The Irish Times</i> on 23 November 1978, in an article by their education correspondent, clearly pointed out that the parents elected as representatives on national school management boards were very critical of the manner in which they were being excluded from consultations in relation to the review, which commenced at a very late date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of the final position in <Col N="1027" /> relation to the review of the boards of management but we need to evolve a proper democratic board of management. By that I mean fair representation on the school board for all concerned&mdash;&mdash; for parents whose children attend the school, for teachers whose involvement in the school is of primary concern to its prosperity and for the religious order or patron.  At the moment there is a feeling that there are factions on the boards and these factions seem to be tending towards creating friction on the board rather than evolving policy.  Criticisms have been mentioned in this respect, and it is unfortunate and unnecessary in the context of an evolving school system at the primary level.  It may be because we have no legislation governing primary schools.  They are governed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, with very little accountability to this House.  There is gross confusion as to the rights of parents, children and teachers within the system.  It is unfortunate, but it is symptomatic of the whole area of education.</P>
    <P>One would be inclined to say that an easy solution to representation would be a 3:3:3 situation and I would favour that type of structure as being fair.  The really important thing is that the review should cover not only the structure, the numbers involved in boards of management but also the powers of the boards of management in relation to the future direction of the school, the capital expenditure, the expenditure within the school and a greater say in the appointment of teachers.  There has been no agreement in relation to splitting up the board between parents, teachers and patrons and there has been no agreement in relation to finance, which is central to the whole question.  After all, if we are not going to give the schools adequate finance for development, schools will continue to close because of rat and mice infestation and because of lack of expenditure on maintenance, which is what happened in 1978.  That can be avoided only if the boards of management have a commitment to giving proper maintenance grants for schools and to ensuring that money is available for extension to schools where necessary.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, in Fennor, <Col N="1028" /> County Waterford, an extension to a school has been sought since 1975, when the Government I supported were in office. Now, four years later, no decision has been forthcoming.  They still do not know if they can extend the school or if they will have to find a new site.  That is pretty pathetic management which would not be tolerated in business or in private enterprise, and I am sure it would not be tolerated in many State bodies.  Four years after a request based on a sound, obvious need was put in no conclusion has been reached.</P>

      <P>Our system can and will falter unless the structure of the boards of management is seen to be democratic and is acceptable to the parents and the teachers who run the system and to the patrons.  Unless we are committed to proper maintenance grants and proper grants in respect of primary schools we will not be in a position to meet the extreme pressure which will come on primary schools in the coming decade.  There has been no commitment from Fianna Fáil in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Tunney) Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Tunney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity of addressing myself to the amendment which appears before us and of repeating what I have said, since I was honoured with membership of this House, in respect of primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of education generally I have always made the point that, as far as I am concerned, our primary interest and our chief priority must be with our primary and national schools if for no other reason than that the Constitution requires it and because it is the one branch of education that all our students avail of.  I am on record as having said, in respect of the curriculum which then existed, that I thought that it could and should be improved.  To me it seemed to assume that all children were born equal and that all children had equal opportunity. We all know that, depending on their home or social environment, some <Col N="1029" /> children are better placed than others to benefit from primary education according to their parents' ability or disposition to complement what is done in our primary schools.  Sometimes we forget that fact.  Sometimes we overlook the fact that certain children are born with disabilities, impediments and inhibitions which prevent them from benefiting from education.</P>
    <P>In the time available to me I propose to concentrate on that area and, more especially, I propose to concentrate on what is called special education.  I read with interest the contributions made by Deputy Horgan and Deputy Collins.  I noticed that neither made any reference to this very important aspect.  I am not saying that omission is indicative of any lack of interest on their part.  When Deputy Horgan is replying perhaps he will agree that, in the area of special education, he is as happy as I am with its present state.  It is an area in which the Government have plans.  I admit that great improvements are not made overnight. I should not like to dismiss the contributions made by previous Governments to disadvantaged students.</P>
    <P>This year the situation is second to none in this area.  I say that, having had the opportunity of visiting countries abroad and looking at what is happening there in the education of handicapped or disadvantaged children.  Special schools here are regarded as part of the normal national school system.  Expenditure on special education is continuing to improve and to increase.  It is included in the general provisions in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>It is very important that these matters should be recorded in the Official Report so that Members of the House and people in general would be aware of the satisfactory position which obtains. There are now over 100 schools catering for the different forms of handicap with an enrolment of over 8,000 children.  In addition, nearly 150 special schools in ordinary national schools cater for some 2,000 children who are functioning educationally at mild mental handicap level.</P>
    <P>Because of the more favourable <Col N="1030" /> pupil/teacher ratio and the additional resources deployed, the average cost per student in special schools last year was about three times that obtaining in what would be described as ordinary national schools.  The figure is £562 as against £196.  Within the system of national education the special schools and classes provide a programme suited to the needs of the particular handicapped child.  The number of children in each class is very much smaller than in ordinary classes in primary schools.  Free transport is provided for practically all students. That is a record of achievement on the part of the Department of Education and all Ministers for Education who have been associated with it.  It is a record which should not go unnoticed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister is dealing with expenditure <Col N="1031" /> on national schools which would come within the ambit of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no contention about that.  There are one or two developments which I should like to highlight.  This country was one of the first in Europe to undertake the education of the moderately handicapped who, up to about 25 years ago, were regarded at home and abroad as not being capable of being educated.  The target for the provision of places laid down by the Commission on Mental Handicap has been exceeded.  Over 2,000 of these children are now attending school on a day or residential basis.  With the increasing skill of teachers and a wider age range, a somewhat greater degree of handicapped is being catered for than was originally visualised.  That is an achievement of which we can be proud.</P>
      <P>As a result of the experience gained in the development of these schools, a new structured curriculum for the moderately mentally handicapped was introduced in the current school year.  To facilitate the implementation of this curriculum the maximum class size has been reduced to 12 and special arrangements have been made for in-service training of teachers. That is not only a worth-while advance, but it puts us in a position where we compare more than favourably with other countries who are often quoted as setting a headline in this regard.</P>
      <P>It should also be said that vocational training centres, assisted jointly by my Department and the Department of Health, have been established recently in eight areas in which training is provided for moderately mentally handicapped children and some mildly handicapped children and for school leavers in order to prepare them for employment.  This will be mainly in the sheltered workshops, but a number of young people have also found suitable open employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who are not provided with the facilities which are available to Ministers might not have the time to do this&mdash;I know they have the interest&mdash; but I should like to invite Deputy Horgan and Deputy Collins to advise me about a visitation they would like to <Col N="1032" /> make to any of these schools in Blackrock, Cork, or elsewhere, to see for themselves the happiness which radiates from the young students who are being looked after so well.</P>
    <P>As regards the mildly mentally handicapped, 5,700 places have been provided in special schools in special classes attached to ordinary national schools.  That is a development I regret was not introduced ten, 12 or 15 years ago.  It is one I suggested when I first came into this House and reverts to my earlier philosophy&mdash;that putting 35 children in the same class does not allow one to say one is giving the 35 children equal opportunity.  That is a fallacy and a myth.  It is wrong and is not being done in my Department.  It should never have been done because it was being offensive to the true spirit of education and dishonest to the children concerned.  In education&mdash;and this applies to management boards, teaching organisations and applied when I was a teacher as it applies now&mdash;my first aim always is what is best for the child?  When we talk about democratisation, about aspects of management, perhaps all too often we forget that the real reason for our interest is one only, that which is best for the child.  We must never remove that consideration from our deliberations even though it might seem more beneficial to us as politicians&mdash;and here I include myself&mdash;that we should seem to be pandering to people who already have votes, people who might exercise more muscle in respect of the particular exercise.  We who are interested in education must never allow ourselves be drawn from the real purpose, what the French call the <i>raison d'être</i> of the whole educational structure, that is, to provide that which is best for every student, and I venture to say that this applies more particularly to primary students than those in any other branch of education.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, the education of children with multiple handicaps poses a formidable problem.  For a child, blind, deaf and possibly mentally handicapped extreme dedication and very advanced techniques are necessary.  I am glad to say we are now tackling this problem <Col N="1033" /> and have established three schools catering for these children.  A visiting teacher service for blind and deaf children is also being developed.  The experimental school at Monkstown for children with specific learning difficulties has met with considerable success and a second experimental school is being set up on the north side of the city.  That is a factual report of what I know this House recognises as worth-while advance in an aspect of primary education perhaps more important than any other.</P>
    <P>An intensive programme to provide better facilities for travelling children has been mounted in association with the National Council for Travelling People. Our objective continues to be the complete integration of travelling children in ordinary schools.  Great credit is due to schools management and teachers who have co-operated to bring this about in so many areas.  There are 47 special classes up and down the country catering for approximately 500 children who are not yet ready for integration.  Full Departmental recognition has also been given to St. Ciaran's national school at Bray and to a special day centre cum school which was opened in the centre of Dublin last year.  My Department, in association with the national council, is engaged also in the development of a number of training centres for children above primary age.  I am very happy also that these centres will provide a programme of training appropriate to the tradition and needs of these travelling families.  I refer to the new awareness, now acceptable to educationalists and the Department alike, that it is not sufficient&mdash;and here I revert to my original theme&mdash;to say that that which suits one suits everybody. Rather we must retailor our education in a way that will allow every child to benefit from and enjoy it, as is his or her entitlement, in accordance with the opportunities and abilities he or she possesses.</P>
    <P>As was announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech, a special allowance of funds is being made this year for the creation of 70 new posts as child care assistants in special schools for the handicapped.  Because of the <Col N="1034" /> nature of the children's handicap and because of the variety of equipment it is necessary to use in this type of school, a considerable volume of non-teaching duties devolves on the staff.  The new posts will help to relieve teachers of some of the subsidiary duties and enable them to concentrate more on their professional duties and teaching capabilities.</P>
    <P>That is not pie in the sky.  That is not the expression of a wish or a hope.  It is a report of a factual position, on something which has happened in the last 12 months and which I am sure we all accept as being a step in the right direction. I am not so naïve as to think that it is the duty of any Opposition&mdash;certainly I did not regard it as mine&mdash;to praise any sitting Government.  Here I apply the test I apply to myself: when sitting on the far side of the House I never let pass the opportunity of commenting on what I regarded as progress made in any area. It was always my concern perhaps to highlight omissions and inadequacies rather than achievements.  But the record will show that, no matter what Minister was there, whether or not I liked him, if advances were made in his area, I was happy to acknowledge them.  I would hope that in respect of the advances to which I refer here both Deputies Horgan and Collins will accept that it is a progress report.  We are not saying it is everything.  We must continue on these lines, but I think they should accept that in this regard&mdash;again bearing in mind its direct relevance to primary education and national schools&mdash;the Minister is justified in the claim he makes in his amendment to the motion tabled in the names of all the members of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>In that respect I suppose we make a good team.  The capitation grant to cover the maintenance and other operational costs for special schools is paid generally on the same lines as that for ordinary schools but it is scaled upwards to cater for the particular needs of these schools on the basis of the pupil/teacher ratio which operates in them.  These enhanced rates have been increased by 25 per cent in <Col N="1036" /> the current year at an additional cost of £49,500.  That, to me, is progress.</P>
      <P>Special equipment grants are also paid for educational equipment necessary to cater for the pupils in special schools other than that which is covered by the capitation grant.  These include group teaching aids in the schools for the deaf and brailling machines in the schools for the blind.  Provision for this purpose in the current year's budget has been increased to £116,000 as compared with £54,000 in 1977 and £60,000 last year; that, to me, is progress.</P>
      <P>Capital for special school buildings is included in the general capital allocation for primary schools which has been increased by £1.1 million this year to a total of £16.5 million.  Over the past two years new schools have been opened at Islandbridge, Steward's Hospital, Orwell Road and Raheny for mentally handicapped and emotionally disturbed children.  Plans for new schools are in hand.  Plans are also in hand for extensive improvements to the school in Cork for children whose hearing is impaired, Saint Mary's School in Cabra and St. Joseph's school in Cabra, Marino Clinic, Bray, to the schools for the physically handicapped in Clondalkin, Clontarf and Sandymount and to the schools for the mentally handicapped in Tallaght, Cashel, Letterkenny and John's Lane. They are factual reports of proposals that are there in respect of the provision of education in national schools for the mentally or physically handicapped.</P>
      <P>There is another area where both sides of the House share an interest.  This is the question of schools which are classified as special national schools.  As regards the residential homes, the former industrial schools, most of the children now go out to local schools as recommended in the Kennedy report.  Where necessary special provision is made for them by way of remedial teaching. Increased provision of £419,000 has been made for this service in the current year.  That is a fair allocation of money. Again I would hope that when replying Deputy Horgan would acknowledge this and express his reasonable satisfaction with it.  Of course he would exhort that there should be no complacancy but we must strive to improve this special area.</P>

      <P>Residential provision is at present made for slightly over 200 boys in three special residential schools. There is one at Lusk and one at Finglas. I would invite any Deputy who is free to do so to visit these two schools and see what is being done, not by any political party, not because of the fact that a political party is in office but in the name of the community for these unfortunate children.  Far too much is heard and written about allaged inadequacies in this regard and I would hope that people who are so reluctant to give credit where credit is due would go out and examine the situation as they find it and if, having done that, they have some worth-while positive criticism to make then, for my part and as long as I have responsibility in this area, I will be most receptive to any suggestion regarding any improvement which can be made.  In doing this I am not looking for any special credit for it but because, as I said initially, it is the least these children are entitled to.</P>
      <P>I regret I have not sufficient time to include all that I had intended to include in the Official Report.  I had hoped that I might refer especially to our youth encounter projects.  Here again I know that Deputies will agree with me that a need exists in respect of some children who must be catered for in situations and environments which are different from those suitable or applicable to more normal children.  I am watching with much excitement and great anticipation the results of what will be happening in those schools.  I hope that what is happening will explode the proposition which says if one exposes all to the same thing all are getting equal opportunity, and rather must we cater for the real needs of our children.</P>

      <P>I am quite sure that all politicians, particularly Members of this House, if given the opportunity of being Minister for Education or indeed Minister of State, would do the best they could to improve the educational systems here.  What I am going to say is not an attack on individuals but an attack on a system.  First of all, in view of <Col N="1038" /> the shortage of herrings at present I am sure some our our fishermen would have been very glad last night and tonight to have been here to collect the number of red herrings which have been trotted out by the two Government speakers in order to talk about anything except what is involved in the motion.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has been very anxious to tell us that he did not want to say anything in the House which would disturb the calm.  Let me say that in a case like this I have no such inhibitions.  As far as I am concerned, having a Minister and his Minister of State coming into this House with <i>an béal bocht</i> saying that they are only a year-and-a-half in office and that we cannot expect miracles from them makes them seem insincere, in view of the fact that they had a previous uninterrupted 16 years to do all the things which they wanted us to do when they were in opposition.  The Government personnel has changed quite a lot since they were in office before but I believe they have, to use the old expression, a sin to answer for.  They and nobody else are responsible for the terrible state of primary education which they left when they left office.  I am not going to say that no improvement has been made in the last 18 months.  Of course certain things have been improved.  I pay tribute to the officials of the Department because they succeeded in carrying on quite a number of things which were discussed and proposed by the previous Government and they did make some improvement.  The Minister of State tells us here that he always held that it was wrong to have 35 pupils in the same class and that it was not possible to give pupils adequate attention in such circumstances and that he has always held this view.  Yet throughout the country, and particularly in the city, there are many schools where two classes are lumped together making a total of up to 45 pupils.  I wonder if we can believe that <Col N="1039" /> he is sincere in what he is saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not claim that the Minister is one of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who would be inclined to tell lies for political purposes.  If he looks at the record he will find it is utter cod to talk about classes of 35 being too big when two classes are put together, making a total of 45 pupils.  He can check this tomorrow by walking into any primary school.  It is happening in my village and my grandchildren are suffering as a result.  It is all right for the bright child because he or she will be able to pick up the pieces no matter what size of class but the slow or the not-so-quick learner has a poor chance of getting anywhere.  As we saw recently, appeals were made to adults to teach illiterate teenagers who left primary school un-able to read or write but who are anxious now to learn.</P>
      <P>We must face the facts.  The primary education system is not good and the fault lies primarily with Fianna Fáil who were so long in office.  They made no attempt to improve the situation.  There are many people in public life who are aware of what is happening but they are not doing enough to have the matter straightened out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We agreed to set up a committee that we thought would assist in ironing out much of the troubles that are caused at local level between parents, teachers and management.  However, the INTO wisely insisted that written into that should be a review after three years. We were out of office when the three years was up and the present Government were not prepared to honour the three-year proviso.  They had to be pushed, pulled and abused by the people responsible before they could be persuaded to have the review.  Nothing has come out of the review because the Government do not want that committee. It would show up their shortcomings. The committee was not perfect.  I am not giving away Cabinet secrets when I say that many things were included that I did not think were the best way of doing things.  However, that was the decision and as a member of the Cabinet I take responsibility for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the situation now where it does not operate and will not operate and everything the Minister for Education said last night about the efforts he was making to operate it is a lot of cod. Until such time as the INTO and the other people concerned can sit around the table and agree on what is needed to have it settled there will be no committee. It is unbelievable that anyone could suggest that the way to do it was to send out a letter to the INTO after a meeting had taken place and at which agreement <Col N="1041" /> was not reached telling them the way to settle the matter.  That is not the way to settle problems.  Perhaps that is the way Fianna Fáil like to settle problems, although I must point out they do not send out letters in the case of some of the current disputes.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if the Minister of State thinks I am picking on him particularly. He made references here to mentally and physically handicapped people.  We felt just as strongly about this as Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We were prepared to do a lot but we were not given the time.  The electorate decided that Fianna Fáil should run the country.  They have the authority now and we expect them to do what they said should be done and what we thought should be done.  I think that speeches of Opposition Deputies who become Ministers should be required listening for them.  They should be put into a room with a tape recorder and should be compelled to listen to what they said when they were across the floor of the House.  When Fianna Fáil were in opposition there was no problem with primary or any kind of education. According to them they would not take three or four years but would solve the problem immediately.  The words &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; and &ldquo;at once&rdquo; were used so often that they became clichés.  Even the Taoiseach the night before the general election repeated &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; ten times.  He has not done that since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the physically and mentally handicapped and I agree that much more should be done to help schools catering for such people.  The State is not doing its share.  I brought to the notice of the Minister and the Department responsible a school in Navan that was set up by the local clergyman and a number of local people who were interested in the matter.  They converted an old building, they got the school going and it is doing a tremendous job.  The teachers are being paid by <Col N="1042" /> the State but because of a legal quibble the Government are shielding themselves and are hiding behind a legal point to avoid paying a relatively small sum of money.  This sum should be paid to the school so that it may continue.  Local people have to go from door to door trying to raise a few pounds to keep physically and mentally handicapped children at school.  This is just one example of where the State is not doing what it should do.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in the Minister's statement about the increased money he was giving.  He said we did not give anything.  So far the State has not given any increase except the one increase that was promised by the previous Minister for Education.  Deputy Horgan pointed this out.  A sum has been promised with effect from 1 June and we are told we should sing &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo;.  Did the Minister hear about the frost and snow that occurred immediately after Christmas? Does he know that because schools were unoccupied in the Christmas period they had to spend a tremendous amount repairing damage to radiators, furniture and so on?  What do the Department propose to do about it? Will they say to the schools that they are getting an increase of £2 <i>per capita</i> from the State and that should meet their requirements? I suggest they have another look at it because it is not only the PAYE people who will be parading to the gates of Leinster House.  They should realise they cannot slide out of their responsibilities by claiming that something is being done when we know that very little is being done.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Government, if they had the money, would be prepared to spend much more on education.  Any sensible politician must appreciate that more money is required but I fear that the Government&mdash;it is quite obvious they have not got the money&mdash;are attempting to slide out by saying that they are giving substantial percentage increases. As Deputy Collins pointed out, percentage increases do not represent what we think is required in 1979 to ensure that national schools can be kept in a proper state of repair.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> Some years ago the then Fianna Fáil Government tried to do away with small schools and bring children to larger ones.  We had the ridiculous situation throughout the country where schools which were in very good order were being closed.  I am aware of one built only about ten years previously which because it was a small type school was closed down and the children brought to another school which had cost a fortune to repair.  We had this situation and then we had school bus and all the innovations introduced by the late Donogh O'Malley, God rest his soul, and which at present seem to be foundering because the Government are not prepared to ensure that they will be operated properly.</P>
    <P>Apparently, we are slipping back to what was originally considered all right and which many feel was the proper way to do it, that in smaller schools near the children's homes was the place where the children should get their primary education.  There were many schools, including some to which children were brought from other schools because the then Government felt those schools were too small, which are now in a deplorable condition.  We still have many schools depending on old wooden huts added on. I know they were introduced because it was felt they would offer quick relief accommodation for children for a short time.  If my memory is correct, the Nissen huts were given five years' life.  Now, almost 20 years later, many of them are being used as schoolrooms and we are expected to agree that our children at-tend those schools even though they cannot be adequately heated and cannot be considered in any way suitable.</P>
    <P>A few years ago I asked why these huts were being continued.  I never regarded them as a correct place in which to teach children.  I was told that they cost a lot and that the cost of replacing them with the normal school would be colossal but that eventually they would be phased out.  We still find them in use and it is not unusual beside an existing school to have children walking across a plank on concrete blocks in an effort to get in with dry feet. Anybody who tries to defend that kind of primary education facility is not doing <Col N="1044" /> a good job for himself or the country.</P>
    <P>We have many schools without adequate heating and lighting.  Those of us in the upper age bracket can recollect when we had to bring fuel ourselves when going to country schools&mdash;a sod of turf or a stick or one shilling, which was harder to get&mdash;to the teacher every day to ensure some heat.  Unfortunately, the teacher usually used the fire himself more than anybody else.  That was in the early part of this century but, to find in 1979 children who complain about being cold in a primary school because no adequate provision for heat is made and the money made available is not sufficient to provide the necessary maintenance or comfort children require, is just too bad.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the increase in the money given for school books.  This is a bad joke at the expense of the children.  I do not know if he is aware of how school books are given out.  Up to a few years ago the children would have to bring in their parents' medical cards to show that they qualified before they would be given free school books.  Things have changed a little but at present it seems that unless children themselves are able to prove entitlement they cannot get the books. What six or seven year old child wants to prove before his fellow pupils that he is very poor?  They have no hope of getting school books.  I do not blame the teachers who have not sufficient money, not nearly sufficient; I blame the system. Adequate money should be made available and an adequate transfer system arranged by which children from one class could have their books properly cared for and transferred to other members of the family coming along later.  We should not have the old system of changing the books every year in case the next set of children would be able to use them.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education seem to be anxious to ensure that things are done properly but they do not seem to know what this involves.  I would not mind if we had amateurs on the Government benches.  Perhaps they are not very long in their Ministeries but their Government had long periods in office and the experience should be there.  The officials <Col N="1045" /> who work under them know or should know what the Fianna Fáil Government expect of them.  The results coming out are not what they should be from men of experience.  I found the officials in my Department and in others with which I had contact over the years to be excellent, hard-working people and I believe the officials in the Department of Education are no different but they can only do as good a job as those who lead them.  I am not picking out the Minister, Deputy Wilson, and the Minister of State, Deputy Tunney, but I am picking out two members of a Government who before the last election were prepared to tell us that if they were returned to power everything in the garden would be lovely.  Nothing that the primary school children required would be withheld from them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education himself had to admit that in the section of the Fianna Fáil manifesto dealing with education, on page 41, paragraph 6, it is stated:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will immediately increase the capitation grant for primary school pupils.</P>

      <P>However, I am glad of this opportunity to speak, because listening to the Minister one might be forgiven for getting the impression that everything in the garden is rosy in the area of primary education whereas the contrary is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in many of our schools in this city is a disgrace, but the blame does not rest with the teachers.  The Minister knows that it is the system that <Col N="1048" /> is at fault.  He invited both Deputy Horgan and Deputy Collins to see some institutions.  No doubt these were very good institutions, but I should like to take this opportunity of inviting the Minister to a school in my constituency because such a visit might result in a change of attitude on his part.</P>
    <P>In schools of the type I have in mind there are large numbers of children who have reading ages of three years less than children in other schools.  Eighty per cent of the children in one school I am aware of live in apartments where there is overcrowding and 56 per cent of the parents concerned are unemployed. If the Minister is sincere in tailoring education to the needs of the child&mdash;and I believe he is&mdash;he must have regard to schools within the inner city area with a view to reducing the pupil/teacher ratio to 20 or even less.  The children attending these schools are the very ones who do not have a voice in society, whereas children in most other schools are able to take advantage of the system and to continue to second level and, perhaps, third level education.  That is why the Department must do everything possible to ensure that the disadvantaged children are put in the position of being able to derive the benefits of the education system.</P>
    <P>It is time we took the primary education system out of the last century and adapted it to today's needs.  The cost involved would be small because the facilities are available.  We have the classrooms.  We have plenty of space in schools in the inner city area.  But we require more remedial teachers and we require the help that will ensure that these children do not start off at a tremendous disadvantage.  There is a high illiteracy rate among these children but inspectors have the audacity to question the teachers as to why standards are not higher among the children.  These inspectors do not consider the socio-economic circumstances involved in these cases. That is why I am hoping that the Minister will accept my invitation to him to visit the school I have in mind and to talk with the teachers there.</P>
    <P>There is a question in this regard on the Order Paper in my name and after <Col N="1049" /> what I have told the Minister this evening I trust that the answer to that question will indicate his willingness to consider this problem without further delay. Because the schools I am talking of have not sufficient numbers of pupils on their rolls to qualify for grants they are at a further disadvantage but the buildings must be heated.  In one case the church authorities paid £800 for heating this year although the pupils represented only 20 per cent of that parish.</P>
    <P>Primary education has always been treated as the cinderella of the system. We have exploited the religious orders in this area by not facing up to our responsibilities. Admittedly there has been a pilot scheme on the north side of the city but I am talking about the city in general.  Although the results of the various surveys conducted have been sent to the Department of Education we have not had any response so far.  They do not want to know about these areas because they know there will not be too much clamouring from them.  They are aware that parents will not be marching on the Department of Education or Leinster House.  It is a pity that they would not join together and go on such a march because they might get some response.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the people I am concerned about are under-privileged, downtrodden and find it hard to lift themselves up.  We owe it to their children to ensure that they are educated and equipped to face life with the same opportunities as other children.  If we do not give all children the same opportunities we are failing miserably in our duties.  If we looked after the children I am concerned about we would save money because I have no doubt that vandalism and frustration would diminish quickly.  Those children would then see themselves as part of society. At present they see themselves as being rejected, as practically non-citizens. When they get out they want to kick society, and kick it hard.  Special schools and other places of detention are not necessarily the answer.  In my view we must spend more money on this area even if it means getting the ratio down to 15.  We <Col N="1050" /> must ensure that these children can relate their hands to their minds so that when they go out into the world they can adapt themselves to any situation.  We must also ensure that if they must emigrate they are well equipped to work and do not finish up as the hewers of wood and drawers of water for other people.  Under our primary school system that is not happening.</P>
    <P>I hope to get a genuine response from the Department in this area.  I hope the Department will inject vast sums of money to cater for the needs of such children.  We are all aware that the university students took to the streets to highlight their grievances but I am not terribly concerned about them because they are well able to look after themselves.  However, it is possible that because they took to the streets to highlight their grievances they will get response.  The people I am concerned about do not take to the streets because they do not have the will to do so.  The attitude appears to be that as they will not take to the streets they should be left alone.  We should not be influenced by political reasons but if we examine the facts we will see that that is not the case. It is time that the primary education system was given a new look.  We have raised the school leaving age but we have not done much to raise the standards within the primary education system to meet that.  The Minister should respond generously to my plea and I hope he will accept my invitation.  I can show the other side of the coin, that which is not good.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State had the courtesy to say that he presumed that the lack of any reference to special education in speeches made on this side of the House, particularly that made by myself, was not due to any lack of interest by us in this area.  He is correct in assuming that.  The Minister of State went on to give in considerable detail information about the developments in special education during the period of previous administration.  The point was completely missed because, as anyone with two political eyes in his head will understand, the reason why we <Col N="1051" /> put down this motion in the name of the Labour Party was to draw attention to two glaring deficiencies in the activities of the Minister for Education and his Minister of State since they came to office just as the reason the Minister for Education put down his amendment was to broaden the scope of the debate so that he could talk about things he did not wish to talk about in our motion.  In his contribution to the debate the Minister was, if not exactly silent, certainly short of his usual degree of eloquence in dealing with one or two matters which are at the core of our motion.</P>
      <P>Even though procedurally we are discussing the motion and the amendment there is no apology to be made on this side for speaking essentially to our motion. We put that motion down for two reasons.  We wanted to draw attention to a specific commitment that was made by the Government before they came to office, a commitment we feel was not honoured, and not even the Minister for Education has had the nerve to claim boldly that it was honoured by the implementation of the first increase up to £8 in the capitation fee.</P>

      <P>It is a fact, as the motion points out, that not a penny has yet been paid to the primary schools of any increase in the capitation grant decreed solely by Fianna Fáil.  That is what the motion draws attention to.  The second reason we put down the motion was the urgent situation which has been created since the coming into office of the Government by the decision of the INTO to effectively boycott the working of the present boards of management. We devoted a specific part of our motion to that matter.  The Minister of State said&mdash;this is typical of rather meaningless statements which have been made by the Government side during this debate&mdash;that he was always happy to acknowledge advances in education when he was on this side of the House. To take a leaf out of the book opened so frequently by the Minister for Education, one should look at the record of the House since the Minister of State became a Member and during his comparatively brief period in Opposition, but one will not find any motion in his name acknowledging the advances made by the previous Government in the sphere of education.  Anybody who expected it to be there would be politically naïve.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State saying that the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, who are boycotting the boards of management at the present moment, do not have the best interest of the children of this country at heart?  If he is saying that they will be very surprised and alarmed to hear him and if he is not saying that, he should make that clear.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State spoke at considerable length about the question of special education.  There is a large measure of all-party agreement about the special needs of the whole special education centre.  We will never begrudge money spent on special education, even though we may all, on Government and Opposition benches alike, wish for more money to be spent than can be provided at any particular time.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of special education to which I would like to draw the attention of the House, and in doing so, to refer to a quotation from the present Minister of State when he was a backbench Deputy in a previous Fianna Fáil administration.  In Volume 245, column 1600, on 21 April 1970 he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> I am not in complete agreement that its&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;corporal punishment&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;total elimination would be beneficial to education.  I would be prepared to argue that the student welcomes a certain amount of corporal punishment.</P>
    <P>I would not like to ask the Minister for Education, without inviting a reply, if the children, who are in the special schools of which our community is rightly proud, welcome corporal punishment in these schools.  He and his Minister of State have an opportunity to do something about that without costing the taxpayers a penny.</P>

      <P>It is perferctly evident that the financing of this scheme is still woefully inadequate.  Even though we may all, including Deputy Tully, like to plunder what was given back to people in the wealth tax for our own purposes, it is still true to say that the Minister of Education could have given an extra £1 in the year he came into office on the capitation grants.  He could have given free school books to every primary schoolchild and still have had £500,000 change out of what he gave back to people in the wealth tax.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State was unwise enough to refer to the pupil-teacher ratio and to say &ldquo;you did nothing about it when you were in office&rdquo;.  Those were his exact words if I took them down correctly. I am not among those people, and I am sure nobody on these benches would be, who would be happy and prepared to see everything the last Government or any Government did written up in the hall of fame, but it is true and undeniable that when the previous Government were in office not only was the pupil-teacher ratio reduced, but it was reduced at a time when we were putting into training the teachers who are now improving the pupil-teacher ratio under Fianna Fáil.  We were putting in more teachers than ever before in the history of the State, and we were doing it at a time when the length of the teacher training course was being increased from two years to a full university degree in three years.  To say &ldquo;you did nothing about it&rdquo; as the Minister of State did, simply flies in the face of the facts.</P>
      <P>I was about to criticise the Minister for something which he has now clarified, because when he was speaking he did not clarify whether he regarded the first payment under this Administration as the implementation of the Fianna Fáil pledge.  He has now established this precedent and this is useful for the record.</P>

When listening to the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis I was astonished by many things, but what astonished me most was the Minister for Education claiming that the Labour Party had more reason than anybody else to be ashamed of the alleged neglect of education under the Coalition because they more than any other party, should be aware of the function that education plays in social mobility.  The inference that Fianna Fáil is the party of education and social mobility is nothing less than laughable.  Fianna Fáil are concerned about social mobility, yes, but the only social mobility that has taken place under Fianna Fáil is the social mobility across the strip of water that separates this island from the neighbouring island. On the most conservative figures given by the Taoiseach in this House a few days ago we are already exporting more people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am prepared to use my minute-an-a-half to best effect.  On two key issues which our motion brings before this House, the question of money and the question of management structure reforms, nothing meaningful has been said by the other side of the House. Teachers and other representatives on the review body of the boards of management for national schools are looking for more money than the £10. The Minister had no money to promise them.  We have had nothing on this major plank of the Labour Party motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On management, the Minister in his speech of half-an-hour devoted one or <Col N="1058" /> two sentences to saying he would do what he could about it.  On the basis of what he has done up to now about changing the management structures and further developing them in primary schools, we will be waiting a long time before he does anything.  The standing idly by syndrome prevails.  The two things are united.  We believe in the eventual phasing out of the local contribution in return for further democratisation of our primary education system.  That is part of Labour Party policy.  That is behind our motion and it is the uncomfortable facts behind our motion, not the bland assurances, which underlie the amendment, on which we will be voting tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I am raising tonight is of serious concern to the people of Birr and the surrounding areas.  As the Minister is aware from continuous representations by me and, I am sure, by other Deputies from the area, the community school in Birr is now almost completed.  It is envisaged that this school will accommodate approximately 900 pupils and will be ready for opening in September of this year.  The school is built on a new site; there are no recreational facilities there, and no playing fields and so on area ready yet.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken an active interest in sport all his life and I am certain that he will agree that it is absolutely essential to have a sports hall provided in this community school.  The House is aware that the Minister has received a capital allocation this year of £51 million for his Department.  That is a sizeable amount of money.  The Government have been advocating a policy of sport for all and we are all aware of this and we ought to be encouraging people to keep fit.  The cost of providing this sports hall at present values is in the region of £100,000.  I am certain that out of the £51 million that the Minister has at his disposal he will be able to provide the necessary £100,000.</P>
      <P>The Minister is also aware that the number of pupils who will be attending this school will necessitate the employment of at least two and perhaps more physical education teachers.  Without a sports hall these teachers will have no facilities whatsoever for the taking of classes, and many problems will arise. The teachers will perhaps have to bring pupils to some other building in order to take classes and all of this will cause confusion and difficulty in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A healthy mind is a great thing but a healthy body is equally essential, and one goes with the other.  Good health and physical fitness are absolutely necessary for young students attending schools, and so a sports hall must be provided for the pupils of this school.  As well as that, there will be no room in the school large enough to accommodate all the pupils together.  If it should be necessary for any of the staff to address the assembled school there is no hall or room large enough to allow that, and the <Col N="1061" /> envisaged sports hall will be necessary for a meeting place for such an occasion which I am certain will arise.</P>
    <P>As the name implies, a community school is for the benefit of the community. I am speaking of the teachers at the school and the pupils attending there, but I am also referring to the entire community, the men, women, boys and girls, everybody who is part of the community of Birr and all of the surrounding areas and environs.  This hall will be of benefit to each and every member of that community who wishes to become physically fit.  In the winter months sports teams can train in this hall and clubs can have accommodation there.  Overall, this hall will be of immense benefit to the whole community.  As the Government have been advocating a policy of sport for all, the provision of this hall will be a practical demonstration of their sincerity in that I am sure the Minister will ensure that it is provided.  He has received a number of communications from the liaison committee.  Since last November he has received requests from a number of Deputies to receive a deputation to discuss the provision of the sports hall.  I hope the viewpoints I am putting forward tonight are those which the deputation would have put to the Minister.  I hope that he can tell us that the hall will be provided.</P>
    <P>One of my main reasons for speaking on this matter tonight is that there are three schools amalgamating now for the formation of this community school and it is absolutely essential that the school get off to a good start.  This takes a lot of co-operation and goodwill.  The task of the teaching staff and everybody concerned with this school will be much more difficult if this sports hall is not provided.  As the Minister is aware, if the sports hall is built after the school is opened it will cause problems because there will be machinery, equipment and building materials on the site.  I hope the Minister will give the green light to go ahead with the erection of this hall.  If the work commences in the next few weeks the sports hall should be ready for the opening of the community school in September.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to say that I appreciate Deputy Enright's concern about the provision of a sports hall.  I prefer to use the term physical education hall in this context because we have provided at great expense an excellent college in Limerick to train physical education teachers.  I want to get the idea across that physical education is just as much education as physics, history or any other subject.  The term &ldquo;sports hall&rdquo; to some people has a non-educational connotation, so I will talk in terms of physical education halls.</P>
      <P>The Department met a deputation who were pushing the claims of Birr to a physical education hall.  I met a private deputation and Deputies Lalor, Cowan and Connolly have been pushing me as well as Deputy Enright.  There is a question on the Order Paper from Deputy O. J. Flanagan about Birr.  It is a measure of the achievement of the Government that physical education halls should be built because, as the House is aware, the building of physical education halls was suspended by the previous Government in 1976.  I regret, because of the views I have expressed already and the views expressed by Deputy Enright that the physical education facility is just as important as a science laboratory, that the building of those halls was suspended very shortly after the then Minister for Education, Mr. Burke, had announced a programme of building halls and said he had available £500,000 for this.  It met with a sudden death.  This was a retrograde step.</P>
      <P>That kind of step has an effect on the future, because each school built without a hall is a debt we owe and something which has to be remedied.  It is unfortunate that there is such a backlog. There is a very heavy burden on me. This year the capital allowance has been increased substantially.  As I announced, I intend to resume building physical education halls.  I want to assure the House that in the survey I am making scores of applications are in for physical education halls.  With regard to future halls I intend to provide them as a matter of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to costs.  A totally unrealistic figure was mentioned.  The <Col N="1063" /> cost now of a physical education hall is approaching £200,000, which is a substantial sum of money.  The size of the school is one criterion, but not the only one, and I am not saying that it is the most important one.  If I have a commitment to provide physical education halls for all future schools, that in itself is a considerable strain on our finances without talking of trying to make up the backlog.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Enright on the intelligent and reasoned way he presented his arguments for the hall in Birr.  I agree with him that this is very important for our youth.  We are providing highly qualified teachers.  The standard of entry to the college is very <Col N="1064" /> high.  The education they receive there and the pedagogic training they get is something we can be proud of.</P>
    <P>I am glad the word &ldquo;community&rdquo; was mentioned.  The people from Birr I met emphasised very strongly the importance of a physical education hall for community participation in Birr.  I want to tell the House that I will have a programme for this year.  It would be invidious for me to single out any particular school but I hope to be able to make an announcement in the not too distant future.  Birr is one of the many schools from Dublin to Cork that has come up for consideration.</P>

      <P>The arrangements governing the involvement of civil servants in political activity are briefly as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  Civil servants are not permitted to stand for election to either House of the Oireachtas, or to the European Parliament.  This restriction applies to all categories of staff.</P>
      <P>(2)  Civil servants in the industrial categories and in manipulative, sub-clerical and manual grades are free to engage in political activity, subject to the general restriction in relation to parliamentary elections.</P>
      <P>(3)  Members of the clerical classes in the Civil Service, and civil servants in non-manipulative grades with salary maxima equal to or below the Clerical Officer maximum, may apply for permission to engage in politics on the same basis as the staff referred to at (2) but officers employed on par-ticular types of work may have their applications refused.</P>
      <P>(4)  All civil servants above the clerical level are debarred from engaging in politics, with the exception of members of Departmental grades in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  These grades have traditionally been enabled to stand for election, on a non-party basis, to local authorities below county council level.</P>
      <P>As regards the categories indicated at (3) there have to date been no instances where permission to engage in politics was refused because of the type of work performed by the applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards other areas of the public <Col N="954" /> service, the only categories of staff which are subject to general restrictions on involvement in politics are members of the Garda Síochána and of the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the proposals, if any, to amend the Intoxicating Liquor Acts to prohibit the sale of some or all alcoholic beverages to juveniles and persons addicted to alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Various proposals for the amendment of the licensing laws, many of them relating to the problem of under-age drinking, have been received by me and my predecessors over the years.  I am examining all the proposals that have been made but, because of other more pressing matters, I am not yet in a position to say what recommendations, if any, I will make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position is that the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act, 1924, prohibits, in general, the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption &ldquo;on&rdquo; or &ldquo;off&rdquo; licensed premises to persons under the age of eighteen.  Section 11 of the Act prohibits the sale of intoxicating liquor to persons under the age of 18 but subsection (4) allows the sale or delivery of intoxicating liquor to a person over the age of 15 in a corked and sealed vessel containing not less than one reputed pint.  If the exception were removed or modified, young people who may now avail themselves of the provision could <Col N="961" /> find other ways of getting drink, e.g. by getting companions who are over 18 to do the buying.  On the other hand, the provisions seem to serve no good purpose and if the Intoxicating Liquor Acts were being amended serious consideration would be given to proposing its repeal.</P>
    <P>The problem of drinking by young persons is a social one related to the drinking habits of the community generally.  Legislative changes or police action can at best have a marginal effect in dealing with this problem.  The co-operation of the community is essential in bringing to the notice of the Gardai information concerning those who may be deliberately selling intoxicating liquor to underage persons.</P>
    <P>As regards prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages to persons addicted to alcohol, the practical difficulties in even identifying such persons would, of themselves, make a prohibition unenforceable even if it could be defended in principle.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of Ceann Comhairle, to take Question Nos. 121 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 525 of 7 March 1978.</P>
      <P>In regard to the proposed new school the position is that the site offered Mary Street was not regarded as suitable by the Office of Public Works and the offer of an alternative site by the school authorities is awaited.</P>
      <P>No application has been received recently from the school authorities for the carrying out of repairs to the present premises pending the erection of the new school.</P>
