      <P>In opening my Second Reading speech I stressed my support for this Bill but I asked the Minister to consider making additions and extensions to it in order to provide the Constitutional framework for the overall development of our laws in relation to children.  I take the view that the position of the family as the basic unit of our society must be upheld and supported. At the same time a child must be seen as an individual with individual human, constitutional and legal rights.  This requires that our outlook on all matters relative to the child, whether from the <Col N="1078" /> constitutional, legal, social or any other aspect, be more child centred.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I am seeking a new approach and a fresh initiative in this, The International Year of the Child, in all matters relative to children in general and to adoption laws in particular.  By way of background to my approach my researches have lead me to a number of sources that I should like to mention in the course of this debate.  I would urge the Minister strongly to consider the comments made by various people in regard to this problem and to follow the lines of their approach.  Although that might be somewhat tedious the Minister would find material which I am sure would lead him to have second thoughts on this matter and perhaps might tempt him to seize the opportunity on 7 June next to extend the constitutional provision.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion I mentioned the 1916 Proclamation which referred to the cherishing equally of all the children of the nation.  I accept that the reference to children in that document may have had a broader meaning but it includes babies and children in the normal sense. I take the view that all our children are not cherished equally but that we now have an opportunity to lead our constitutional and legal developments in the direction of equality for them.  There is reference also in Article 40 of our Constitution to all citizens, as human persons, being held equally before the law.  This must include children and it should encourage us to look at the position of the individual rights of the child in order to ascertain whether in the context of this Bill we can help to lay the constitutional framework for the development of the individual rights of certain of our children in this State who are not equal before the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his Encyclical <i>Pacem in Terris</i> the late Pope John XXIII referring to this aspect of the rights of children and of man said that we see that every man has the right to life, to bodily integrity and to the means which are necessary and suitable for the proper development of life, that these are primarily food, clothing, shelter, rest, medical care and finally the necessary social services.  I would stress Pope John's reference to <Col N="1079" /> the right to bodily integrity and the means which are necessary and suitable for the proper development of life.  It is accepted by all who have an interest in adoption that this, in many cases, can provide the means for the proper and suitable development of an infant in course of life.  That must lead us to look at the situation in which, in this State, adoption is not possible.  Then, we must look at the Bill and decide whether we can extend its provisions to cover these situations.  I am very mindful of the difficulties involved in any such extension. These were pointed out in the Minister's speech which impressed me very much in terms of the obvious research that had gone into it.  However, if the approach were towards trying to overcome the obstacles those very legal brains who helped the Minister to put the Bill together should be able to help him find a solution to the problems.</P>
    <P>The Irish episcopal conference some years ago had a special sub-committee dealing with family law reform.  The sub-committee was under the chairmanship of the Most Reverend Peter Birch, Bishop of Ossory.  A wide variety of people, including sociologists, a professor of canon law, a member of the society for the prevention of cruelty to children, local government officials and so on, were on the sub-committee.  In studying their report I felt there were a number of matters which would be worthy of mention in a discussion on the adoption situation.</P>
    <P>The chairman, Bishop Birch, in the preface referred to the need for reform:</P>
    <P>The need for examination by such a working party became increasingly obvious at meetings of the Council, as examples were noted of hardship in families where nothing permanent could be done because of defects, inadequacies or anachronisms in the law.</P>
    <P>The more one delves into this subject the more one sees the truth of that comment. It puts the onus on us as legislators to seize any opportunity we can to provide that those very defects, inadequacies and anachronisms highlighted in this report are removed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> On June 7 next we have one of those rare and unique occasions when we have a referendum to amend the Constitution. I am worried that we will not use that opportunity fully, accepting entirely that the referendum will achieve one very necessary job.  Let us apply our minds to see how it could provide a vehicle for a total development in our laws relating to children and adoption in general.</P>
    <P>The report of the episcopal committee is worthy of comment in a number of areas.  In their introduction, they referred to the position of family law in our society.  They said:</P>
    <P>In submitting the document we feel we are supporting the growing awareness in the community that there is a social dimension to our legal system, that Family Law is not solely concerned about rights and obligations, and that the quality of relationships between people, and between them and their environment, require to be taken into consideration when legal decisions are being reached.</P>
    <P>The report highlights the fact that every child is equally entitled to love, care and adequate support and the right to be brought up by his family.  It states, however, that this pre-supposes a variety of care services to support the family in order that breakdowns will be avoided. It mentions that children are primarily dependent on their parents for support but it refers to the position of the abandoned child and states:</P>
    <P>It is a most destructive experience for a child to be abandoned by his parents.  When a child is abandoned, whether by married parents or by single parents, or where they do not make reasonable effort to provide a secure home for him, then the interests of the child demand that an equivalent home environment should be created for him with, or even in extreme cases, without the consent of the parents.</P>
    <P>Here it seems that the thinking of the committee is ahead of the Minister's.  My purpose in highlighting this report is to encourage the Minister to go some way <Col N="1081" /> along the line to meet the problems outlined in the report.</P>
    <P>The report deals with the problem of children left in care until they reach employment age and who are then taken back by their parents for the purpose of putting them to work.  This is a deplorable situation and was quite common in urban areas in the past.  The committee give their own viewpoint as to the position of children and how they stand when any question of their welfare has to be considered.  They state:</P>
    <P>Children should no longer be seen as objects of the law but rather as subjects with rights, and this concept of children's rights should be embodied in the law.  In any conflict situation, the child's welfare should be paramount.</P>
    <P>That is pretty strong beer in the context of the Minister's speech.  On re-reading his speech, it appears to me that he was highlighting the legal difficulties in using the expression &ldquo;paramount&rdquo; when referring to children's welfare.  I appreciate the difficulties that might arise as highlighted by the Minister.  However, if we were of one mind as to what we wanted to achieve, these difficulties could be overcome.  I urge the Minister and his advisers to apply their minds in the coming weeks to this.  If in the light of the defects and inadequacies in our law we feel that a change should be made, surely it is not beyond the bounds of the legal brains of this country to provide the necessary guidance to help us to establish that change.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5.12 of the report states:</P>
    <P>Modern social care thinking advocates that children services should be child centred and that there should be a shift of emphasis from stressing parental rights to giving at least equal stress to the right of the child to love and care and a normal home life.</P>
    <P>That is relevant in the context of the Minister's speech where there was a reference to the rights and duties of parents.  It is not a question of parents having no rights.  It is a question of highlighting and emphasising more the rights of the child where its own future and welfare are at stake.  In any position <Col N="1082" /> where a child is badly treated or abandoned by its parents, we must develop our laws so as to provide the necessary protection for that innocent citizen of the State.</P>
    <P>This report also deals with the position and status of a child born out of wedlock.  This was also dealt with in the Minister's speech.  It is clear that the thinking in this report is towards the concept that all children should be treated equally whether born inside or outside of wedlock.  There are recommendations that there should be no distinctions in the law between children, and suggestions that there should be voluntary acknowledgment of children born outside wedlock and that that voluntary acknowledgment should be extended to the wife who has an extra-marital child. This is possibly of growing importance in the context of another matter to which I will refer later.  As I understand it, there are particular problems relating to that matter with the result that babies are not getting a fair deal.</P>
    <P>That is a general summary of the outlook of the Council for Social Welfare, the committee established by the Catholic Bishops Conference.  It provides food for thought.  Reading it together with this Bill highlights the worry that we are not doing enough in the Bill.  In regard to the suggestion that our laws should be more child centred Father James Good writing in 1971 said:</P>
    <P>... an Adoption Act should be child-centred while not neglecting the rights of other parties like parents, adopters and the community ... adoption is not a technique of getting children for childless marriages, nor for relieving unmarried parents of their responsibility or even for saving the State the cost of keeping children in an orphanage.  Adoption should be primarily and above all else a process for finding a home and family for the homeless and familyless child, but when we look at our Adoption Act... right through the Act the dominant idea is that the child is the property of the mother and that short of killing or physically maltreating it she can do just what she like with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> The law has developed somewhat since 1971 but not sufficiently to justify us in saying that it is child centred, with the child holding, as it were, the centre of the stage.</P>
    <P>This problem is dealt with in a legal text book on family law by Alan Shatter. He refers to the problem of the legitimate child and the fact that, barring exceptional circumstances, the legitimate child cannot be placed for adoption.  The Minister should put his mind to this again, possibly not in the context of providing specifically now for the adoption of legitimate children, but he might wish to look into it further.  In the context of Constitutional referendum let us not close the door on it forever. The suggestion is that the adoption of legitimate children would require a Constitutional change.  This is dealt with in Mr. Shatter's book wherein he quotes the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, speaking in the Dáil on 29 June 1972.  He said:</P>
    <P>The Government are advised that the proposal in section 5 (1) that legitimate children should be capable of being adopted is almost certainly contrary to the Constitution.  This advice was originally given at the time when the 1962 legislation was being prepared.</P>
    <P>There is a further reference later in the paragraph by Mr. Shatter where he states:</P>
    <P>Thus it is possible that section 2 of the 1954 Act permitting the adoption of a legitimated child is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>That is one of the rare situations in which a legitimated child could be adopted.  Let us not close the door on the possibility of the adoption of legitimate children.  It is not necessary at this stage for a decision in principle to be made to permit the adoption of legitimate children but when we are having a constitutional referendum, let us take the opportunity to remove the constitutional obstacle.  This will permit the development of our law as time goes on.  If our society feels legitimate children should be capable of being adopted, the constitutional <Col N="1084" /> obstacle will have been removed.</P>
    <P>There is quite a strong lobby or, to be more correct, a body of opinion which would favour such a development at present, not in the rather emotive way in which it has been presented from time to time.  It is sometimes presented as being a question of whether it would be better for a child to be brought up in a well-off family rather than in a poorer family. That is not the thinking or the intention of anybody advocating permitting the adoption of legitimate children.  In line with the Minister's thinking on this matter I totally agree that any provision which would permit such a course should be legally excluded.</P>
    <P>There are situations in which the choice is between having a child, who in this context is unfortunately legitimate, condemned to institutional care possibly for 15 years instead of being adopted and reared by a loving and caring family.  If an adult were faced with that choice and with that restriction, he would feel his rights were being denied completely from all points of view.  The child is not capable of thinking about that position.  It is up to us to think about it for the child.</P>
    <P>I referred to the legal and human rights of the individual in our society, including children.  My attention was drawn to an article by Professor John McKenna who is Professor of Psychology at the Royal College of Surgeons.  He deals with this in an article in the magazine &ldquo;Children First&rdquo;.  He develops the point that inherent in the concept of democracy is the idea that every citizen in a free country has certain legal rights and that, in addition, there is the different but related concept of human rights.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Human rights are based on universally shared ideas which have the force of laws and are treated as if they were laws.</P>
    <P>He suggested that we should study the ideas in this article.  He points out that children have always been a powerless minority with no voice in decisions with regard to their welfare.  Like all minority groups, their welfare depends on the <Col N="1085" /> responses of decision-makers to the exhortations, prohibitions and demands of the moralist.</P>
    <P>What is really highlighted is the fact that children should have legal rights, constitutional rights and human rights. It is up to us to ensure that these rights are respected.  It is up to us to ensure that our laws are developed so that the human rights of the child are fully respected.</P>
    <P>That leads us to consider what should be done.  What should our approach to adoption be?  I thought it wise to look at the words of the people who are involved in adoption.  Reverend Fr. John O'Mahony, Secretary of St. Anne's Adoption Society, Cork, and Vice-Chairman of the Central Council of Catholic Adoption Societies, writes in <i>Children First</i> on the meaning of adoption and the nature of an adoption service as follows:</P>
    <P>I think adoption is best defined as the provision of permanent substitute family care for familyless children.  It is distinguished from other forms of child care because it involves a complete severance of legal relationship between natural parents and child and the establishment of a complete set of relationships between the child and the adoptive parents.  Adoption focuses primarily on the familyless condition of the child.  As a service, its object must be to ensure that the needs and the rights of a familyless child to an adequate form of family life are met as far as it is possible.  This is the foundation on which we must build our adoption service and all our policies and practices should follow that definition.</P>
    <P>He then deals with the need for adoption and stresses the fact that the needs of the child must be met by his natural parents. He also stresses the support that society should give to assist in this matter. He points out that adoption should only be resorted to where there is no reasonable likelihood of the natural parents, with reasonable support, being able to provide an adequate form of family life for their children.</P>
    <P>Having developed these points, Fr. O'Mahony deals with the need to extend <Col N="1086" /> legal eligibility for adoption.  Here he deals with the position of the child who cannot be adopted under existing law. He makes the point that we must offer these children something better than the insecurity of a foster home or the impersonal atmosphere of an institution.  He highlights the problems in regard to the adoption of legitimate children and goes so far as to suggest that not permitting such children to be eligible for adoption is a discrimination against legitimate children.  Generally, his view and the view of everybody involved in adoption services, everybody who is close to the problem, is that there is a considerable need to extend the legal eligibility for adoptions.</P>
    <P>We must approach the matter with an open mind, with the idea of doing what we can to improve our laws; doing what we can to remove the defects in our laws; principally doing what we can to help the innocent children in our society who are suffering because of the defects in our laws.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters that I want to refer to by way of highlighting some of these specific problems that are in our laws.  One of them relates to the difficulty under section 3 of the 1974 Act and the possibility of it being unconstitutional. The procedure on adoption is that the child can be placed for adoption at any time after birth.  The mother signs the consent to adoption and the child is placed with the adoption society who place it with the adoptive parents.  After six weeks the adoptive parents can apply for an order to the Adoption Board.  The mother signs the consent after the board have received the application from the adoptive parents.  She, however, may withdraw her consent at any time up to the making of the actual adoption order. The position is then governed by section 3 of the 1974 Adoption Act.  This entitles the adoptive parents, on the withdrawal of consent by the mother before the making of the adoption order, to apply to the court for a custodial order.  As I understand it, in that situation the indications are that the adoptive parents would generally use such an application because of the constitutional situation.  That is certainly a worrying factor because it may not be in the best <Col N="1087" /> interests of the child, which should be the primary basis on which the case should be dealt with, to have the child taken from the adoptive parents.  I stress that such an application arises before the making of an adoption order in the intervening period.  I am not talking about a situation that would arise after the making of an adoption order.</P>
    <P>The procedure, as I understand it, is that normally the minimum time for making an adoption order is six months. In between there are visits from the social worker and the Adoption Board.  I understand it is very rarely that the order is made within six months and that very often the period can be much longer thus extending the time during which the child is at risk of being taken away from its new home.  I am advised that during that period the provisions of section 3 of the 1974 Act would apply, that the position of the adoptive parents&mdash;I do not know if it is correct to use that term at that stage; perhaps we should call them prospective adoptive parents; the child has been placed with them but the adoption order has not been made and I am using the term &ldquo;adoptive&rdquo; to cover that situation also&mdash;is that in dealing with this matter before the court on an application under section 3 of the Act of 1974 they may find themselves in the position where the child may be removed from the home which they have given it. It is a rather worrying situation and in this context I would quote from the judgment of the President of the High Court in the case of G v. An Bord Uchtála last September when he said:</P>
    <P>By reason of the principles which I have already set out in this judgment I am forced to the conclusion that I must construe this section as one in which the court should not intervene unless the mother has capriciously or irresponsibly refused or withdrawn her consent or, by her conduct, abandoned or deserted the child or unless she has failed to establish to the court that she is a fit and proper person to have custody of the child or unless the overwhelming interests of the welfare of the child require that it should not be restored to her custody but that, <Col N="1088" /> subject to the approval of the Adoption Board, it should be left in the custody of the prospective adopters.</P>
    <P>I would say that section of that judgment is somewhat worrying for anybody who would seek to have the matter approached on the basis of the welfare of the child&mdash;the reference to the court not intervening unless the mother has capriciously or irresponsibly refused or withdrawn her consent, the reference to the overwhelming interests of the welfare of the child.  When language like that is used it indicates that the proper legal interpretation of the situation is that in applications under section 3 of the 1974 Act the child would probably be restored to the mother in virtually all situations.</P>
    <P>That leads me on to the question of delay between the placing of the child with the adoptive parents, the application to the Adoption Board after the baby is six weeks and the final making of the adoption order.  The procedure was that there would be a delay of six months during which visits would be paid by social workers and so on to the adoptive parents but I understand that this period of six months can be very much extended.  I further understand that the staff of the Adoption Board are doing excellent work but that they are overwhelmed by the amount of work involved and the result of the understaffing leads to delays in the making of adoption orders.  If it is so I urge the Minister to ensure that whatever additional staff is necessary should be provided.  It is not fair to the workers who are doing so much in this field to be left in the position that they cannot cope with the number of visits that have to be made.</P>
    <P>This is a fairly serious matter.  Details given to me indicate that in a survey of the position carried out relatively recently adoption orders had been made in regard to only 10 per cent of children after seven months and in only half the cases after ten months.  If this is so, and I believe the survey was pretty comprehensive, it must lead us to look at the causes of the problem.  I accept that they could be many but in so far as it is within our power to eradicate those causes we should do so.  If one of those causes is the fact that the Adoption <Col N="1089" /> Board have insufficient staff it should be a primary concern of the Minister to ensure that position is remedied straight away.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which I am told is a growing one in our society concerning the position of children born to married women but conceived out of wedlock.  I should like the Minister to deal with this in replying.  I am not sure of the exact situation but I understand that up to relatively recently such children were automatically registered as illegitimate if that was requested by the mother, but that in the past 12 months this procedure has changed and the files are now all sent to the central office in Dublin and that, short of a court decision on the status of the child, it is not registered as illegitimate at the request of the mother and is presumed to be legitimate and so is not available for adoption.  I am told on the strongest authority that this is a serious matter, that in fact about 10 per cent of all children being put into care in this category are now coming from such situations.</P>
    <P>If that is so, and if such children cannot be adopted here in this State, surely we must turn our minds to this problem and find a solution for it.  I am further advised that because of the presumption that these children are legitimate and in that situation they are not adoptable, the solution at present for some adoption societies is to have such children placed with voluntary adoption societies out of this State.  If that is so I do not believe that we as legislators can stand over laws which actually force the adoption of babies out of this State on the basis that they cannot be adopted here.  I am further advised that the percentage of children in this category is increasing. Somebody very closely involved in the adoption service suggested to me that the figure could be of the order of 100 children in a year.  I can go only on the basis of the information given to me, but it was given by somebody who is very involved in the adoption service and who has suggested to me that about 10 per cent of the babies coming into care come from this category and that a large proportion of these are now being dealt with in this manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> I noticed in <i>The Sunday Press</i> last Sunday an article suggesting that as a result of an inquiry it would appear that if this&mdash;what they refer to as a trade&mdash;exists at all it is confined to 10 babies or less a year.  Glory be to God, if only one baby is involved surely that requires our attention.  If a single baby is forced out of this State because our laws do not permit it to be adopted here, surely we cannot just sit back in our comfortable chairs and let that position continue. I am not going to take issue with <i>The Sunday Press</i> or anybody else as to whether the figure involved is 100 babies a year or ten babies a year.  My point is that if it is even one baby a year we must put our minds to ensuring that such babies are not forced out of this State for adoption because of a refusal on our part to amend our laws so as to permit them to be adopted here.  I have no reason to doubt that this is the situation; in fact I would go so far as to say that my investigations have led me to believe that this practice does exist at present in this State and that babies are being sent out of the State for adoption elsewhere because they are not capable of being adopted here.  What sort of rights are we offering to the young citizens of our State in that category, young babies, when all we can suggest for their future welfare for their own benefit is to send them out of the State?  It is a matter on which I feel very strongly and one to which we must apply our minds to find a remedy.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Bill presently before the House does not provide the Constitutional remedy to that situation or to many types of problems which are affecting adoption today.  I understand that the recommendations of the Task Force on Child Care are due in July next.  What will be the position if the task force make a specific suggestion in regard to the adoption of certain categories of legitimate children?  We will have a referendum in June and we will have recommendations coming through in July.  Let me be clear that I have no inside information as to what recommendations will be made, but it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that such a recommendation could be made.  We may have the ridiculous situation <Col N="1091" /> that a month previously we had a referendum and then we will be having a recommendation which in effect will require a further referendum if it has to be implemented.  This brings me back to the point that we should not miss the opportunity, now that we are putting the Bill before the people, to provide the Constitutional framework to enable our laws to develop.  If this opportunity is missed it may be many, many years before this House will have the opportunity again of putting through legislation to remove many of the anomalies and defects in our present laws.</P>
    <P>In general, in regard to the Bill before the House, I am glad that the Minister has taken the initiative to deal with the problem arising from the McL decision and others.  Certainly the point which the Minister is now including will provide considerable security for adoptive parents and adopted children in the country in the light of the many problems that have arisen in our legal system out of Article 37 of our Constitution, but that is another matter.  The proposal of the Minister in the Bill will put to rest many of the fears of adoptive parents on this point.  It is only on this point&mdash;which has been highlighted very much in the last couple of years&mdash;that their fears can be put to rest.  I do not want in any way to suggest that there are further fears which should be plaguing adoptive parents, but let us be clear on what we are doing.  It is only in regard to the fact that we are providing, as it were, Constitutional coverage for the Adoption Board in the making of their decisions that we are taking any action.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the difficulties involved in establishing a time limit.  I presume the Minister has read the joint opinion of eminent counsel, Donal Barrington and Colm Condon, ex-Attorney General, on this matter, where it was recommended that a Constitutional change should be made providing that adoption orders should not be challenged after a certain period unless it was shown that some fraud or irregularity attended the making of such order.  That is a matter that the Minister has dismissed.  While the Minister <Col N="1092" /> pointed out the difficulties of making adoption orders absolutely watertight, surely bearing in mind the advice of people like Donal Barrington and Colm Condon and bearing in mind the legal brain of his Department if there is a will to do that it can be done.  Here is one suggestion in this joint opinion that would provide for making adoption orders watertight unless it is subsequently shown that some fraud attended their making.  I accept that that is the exception, that there is not a 100 per cent guarantee but at least it is almost 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill so far as it goes but I would strongly urge the Minister to rethink his position and to look at the other problems in adoption.  I have highlighted some of them and others have possibly been referred to by other Deputies.  The Minister should look at the problems and should not miss the golden opportunity he is being presented with on 7 June to enable us to have a Constitutional framework which will enable us to develop our laws so as to remove all the defects and anomalies in them so far as they relate to children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In bringing this measure before the House the Minister has set out to effect the minimum reform possible under the circumstances and I submit that he has taken the maximum amount of time for it.  The ruling in the case, on which the fears of adoptive parents were grounded, was given in June 1976 and the legal opinion was given on 8 March 1977, practically two years ago.  It is inconceivable that such limited action as the Minister proposes should have taken two years to prepare and to bring before the House.  There is nothing in what the Minister said in his Second Reading speech to indicate that up to now at any rate, he has given any thought to further reforms in the area of childrens' rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very narrow limited measure but in so far as it is necessary, we welcome it.  The only criticisms we have is that it is not enough.  This measure will no doubt alleviate the terrible anxiety in which adoptive parents have lived for the past two years, and it is welcomed by all sides of the House and all the <Col N="1093" /> organisations concerned with children's rights.  There is no dispute or controversy about that aspect.</P>
    <P>The Minister has chosen a different formula to rectify the matter than that chosen by the Labour Party in their Bill which was before the House last October. Instead of amending Article 37 of the Constitution by writing into the Constitution a provision deeming adoption orders to be limited functions, the Minister has chosen to state that no adoption shall be invalidated by reason only of the fact that the body or the person exercising the function was not a court or a judge.  I have no quarrel with the Minister in relation to the way he has chosen to go about this and I would not for a moment say that his is not a better approach.  The Labour Party Bill was never advanced as the best or the only way of dealing with the matter or of dealing with the other matters which we proposed to deal with in our Bill.  Our only criticism is that it stops there and makes no effort to deal with the other major urgent problems and issues which were covered by the Labour Party Bill which had the full support of all the bodies concerned with children's rights and their position before the law.</P>
    <P>When replying to the debate would the Minister clear my mind with regard to the constitutional validity of the 1974 and 1976 Adoption Acts which put the child's welfare first in cases of custody disputes?  Am I right in suggesting that in a case such as the McL case where the order was not effective, where the natural parents subsequently married, it is possible that Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution give the parents the rights which would make the child's welfare of secondary importance?  Can Articles 41 and 42 be interpreted that way?  It appears to me that counsel's advice to the adoptive parents in March 1977 raises this issue and it also seems that the Bill makes no effort to deal with it.  Is there any danger that these sections of the 1974 and 1976 Acts which place the child's welfare as of paramount importance can fall if tested in the Supreme Court?  The Minister no doubt said in his opening address that he can never guarantee a system that would be totally secure constitutionally.  Is this what he <Col N="1094" /> had in mind?  If it is, this loophole should have been closed and this opportunity should have been availed of to close it.</P>
    <P>It is to be deplored that a Bill of this nature which proposes to put the country to the expense of a referendum is not used to cover the other areas which were covered in the Labour Party Bill which placed emphasis on the welfare of children.  These areas were covered by the provision to abolish the concept of illegitimacy and a provision to extend the facility of adoption to legitimate children in need of stable homes.  The Labour Party Bill in addition to amending Article 37 proposed in section 2 to amend Article 41 and to remove the words &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible&rdquo; as they apply to the rights of parents and to add a new subsection setting out the special rights of children under the Constitution.  Part of this new subsection stated quite clearly that equality of rights under the law shall not be denied to any child on the basis of his status at birth or on the basis of parentage.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party set out to remove legal discrimination against an illegitimate child.  This reform has been made in many countries, including New Zealand, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Iceland. It is strange that we are still provided with the arguments advanced by the Minister.  It should be possible for us to benefit from the experience of other countries and to avoid any pitfalls.</P>
    <P>The concept of illegitimacy is one of the law's most shameful creations.  It victimises children in order to discourage adultry and fornication, though there may be more materialistic reasons for it. There is no evidence whatsoever that the original purpose of discouraging adultry and fornication has been achieved; neither is there justification for using innocent children as tools for this purpose. The practical effect of the reform we sought to implement was to give children born out of wedlock the same rights of succession under the 1965 Succession Act as children born within marriage, provided there was proof of paternity either by admission and acknowledgement by the natural father or else by <Col N="1095" /> court proceedings.  It has been said that because of Article 40 of the Constitution a test case may succeed, but it is most unlikely that such a test case would be brought by the people concerned.  The unmarried mother and the child whom we deem to be illegitimate are the people least equipped to fight such a case and it is our job to cater for their needs.  This was the thinking of the Labour Party in putting forward our Bill last October.</P>
    <P>We also hoped in that Bill to extend the category of children who may be adopted.  We want to extend the facility and benefit of adoption.  At present children born to a married couple may be abandoned or seriously ill-treated and may be the subject of mental and physical violence but they do not qualify for adoption and spend their young lives in institutions or are fostered.  They do not enjoy the comfort, security and love they could be given by adoptive parents. In our efforts to widen the category of children who may be adopted we had the support of all organisations dealing with the care of children.  It is deplorable that the present Bill does not seek to deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the rights of children under the Constitution, Report No. 2 of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties states:</P>
    <P>The proposal to hold a referendum relating to the adoption process provides an opportunity for a more general re-assessment of the approach of the existing Constitution to children's rights.  It is our hope that this paper will provoke a debate on this broader issue and persuade the Government in formulating its referendum proposals not to confine itself to the adoption issue but to consider a number of other possible amendments to the Constitution which would improve and strengthen children's rights under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Consideration of these broader aspects is both appropriate and necessary in the adoption context.  The institution of adoption is one which is designed to promote the welfare of children.  In its ideal, adoption is a <Col N="1096" /> procedure through which a child may be offered the security and protection of family life with persons to whom the child is not necessarily related by blood, where the child's biological parents are unable or unwilling to provide it.  The rights of children and in particular the right to grow up &ldquo;in an atmosphere of affection and moral and material security&rdquo; are therefore central to the adoption process.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>We are concerned that the existing Constitution does not embody a statement of basic rights belonging specifically to children.  We urge the Government to seize the opportunity provided by the forthcoming referendum to remedy this deficiency.</P>
    <P>This Bill falls very far short of what we set out to do.  It represents the minimum the Minister could have done.  It merits from Children First the statement that it is a pathetic contribution to meeting the needs of certain categories of children in the International Year of the Child.  On 30 January 1979 Children First issued the following statement:</P>
    <P>While Children First welcomes the Bill because of the urgency of the issue, it nevertheless considers that it is a pathetic contribution to meeting the needs of certain children in this the International Year of the Child.  Three other very urgent and major issues have been totally ignored.  Firstly the Bill does nothing to alter the position of those legitimate children whose parents are unable to or unwilling to provide them with a stable home background.  Such children are still it appears to be denied the advantages of adoption and are therefore in this respect still being discriminated against.  A second area of discrimination still not rectified is that of the whole concept of illegitimacy.  Why should a child be discriminated against because of the circumstances of his birth?  Thirdly, the Bill neglects to deal with the question of the constitutionality of the principle that the child's welfare should be given priority in all adoption decisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> The Labour Party did not advance their Bill as the last word on this subject but we are firm in what we set out to do. Perhaps the superior resources of the Minister could improve on it.  We are happy that our Bill was approved by all the agencies concerned with the rights of children.  Children First stated:</P>
    <P>Had this Bill been approved by the Dáil, Seanad, and people, it would have met the oft-repeated recommendations of the various child care organisations, and would have made the basic legal document of the State a secure foundation on which to build at last truly child-centred children's laws.  However, the Government refused to accept the Bill, so it was defeated in the Dáil at its second stage on October 25th.  Instead, the Government introduced its much more limited Bill, thereby missing an opportunity to do something really important and far-reaching for our children on the eve of International Year of the Child.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement that this is a limited measure.  It fails to grasp the opportunities presented.  A referendum to amend the Constitution is very rare. Having looked into all the aspects of it, if recommendations for the improvement of the rights of children are forthcoming from the task force and if the Constitution, because we neglected to carry out the changes that would render it possible, is an impediment to the implementation of those reforms, what will be the position?</P>
    <P>This is a small Bill, the minimum the Minister can do in the circumstances, but it was heralded by a major introductory speech.  I thank the Minister for that and for the attention he gave to the provisions put forward in our Bill. However, it is my view that the Minister set out to baffle us in introducing the Second Stage of this Bill with English and Irish case law and some selected judges' rulings.  It baffled those of us who do not have legal training because we were given legalistic arguments of a rare kind. That was not his function in introducing the Second Stage of the Bill; it was more appropriate to Committee Stage of a far-reaching Bill.  It was an excellent defence <Col N="1098" /> of the <i>status quo</i>, a defence for doing nothing about discrimination against illegitimate children, and doing nothing about the denial of a secure home for abandoned, ill-treated and unfortunate legitimate children.</P>
    <P>As politicians it is our duty to decide on the changes we want to make in society and, having decided on the changes, to avail of the legal expertise available to ensure that the laws we pass will bring in those changes as we intend them and avoid the pitfalls that would occur if we did not have expert advice.  It was not good enough for the Minister to put forward means of legal opinion as to why he cannot make the changes we suggested.  It was a waste of his time, that of his officials and, perhaps, of the House.  We never contended that our way was the only way but we wanted the changes made.  Had the Minister the will to make the changes we feel are already necessary, he had the resources at his command to do so.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that this is a very difficult area and it is possible that those with legal training consider it difficult also but it is up to us to decide on the changes necessary.  Lawyers have admitted that this is not their area.  Two eminent lawyers in a joint opinion to adoptive parents stated that they did not have any special competence to advise on the changes desirable in our adoption system.  They said that in so far as questions of social policy were involved they were issues on which they had no special competence to advise.  They were competent to interpret the law as it stood and that was all.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the case of G. <i>v.</i>  An Bord Uchtála on which the five judges of the Supreme Court were divided as to whether the natural mother had constitutional rights or not.  That division of opinion is an indication of the difficulty that exists with regard to the Constitution in relation to this matter.  It is not too much in 1979 to ask the House to end for ever discrimination against children born out of wedlock. The Labour Party are committed to ending the concept of illegitimacy.  We have put forward suggestions for doing so and we told the Minister that we were <Col N="1099" /> prepared to agree to anything, within reason, that the Minister thought necessary to give effect to this change.  We told the Minister that we were prepared to withdraw our Bill in favour of one introduced by the Minister if he gave us a guarantee that he would make a provision for this.  We announced that we would agree to submit the Bill to a Committee of the House.  We were only concerned with removing the concept of illegitimacy in the State.  We are supported by many organisations in our desire to do that.</P>
    <P>Cherish, in their discussion document, <i>Abolishing Illegitimacy</i>, stated:</P>
    <P>About 4 per cent of all babies born are categorised by the law as illegitimate and many will continue to have this status throughout their lives. Cherish considers that the time has come to abolish the legal status of illegitimacy altogether.  It is not sufficient to abolish the word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; but keep the concept by replacing it with such words as &ldquo;extra marital&rdquo;.  The status itself should be abolished, as should all the distinctions between the legitimate and illegitimate now contained in a multitude of statutes and cases.  Of course, such a change in the law will not change public opinion overnight. But it will encourage a slow change by removing legal support for an outdated prejudice.  With more and more children being brought up by single parents, it is essential that the law should no longer perpetuate the unjustifiable status of illegitimacy.</P>
    <P>The Council for Social Welfare, 1976, strongly supports the case of the abolition of the term &ldquo;illegitimacy&rdquo;.  I quoted from that at length when moving the Second Stage of our Bill and I do not wish to repeat the process.  There is general agreement among all organisations concerned with the rights of children that we should ensure that this concept is abolished.  I should like to know if the Minister has had consultations with these organisations about this subject. While such bodies have usefully committed their views to paper, a discussion <Col N="1100" /> with the Minister would convince him of the need for urgent action in this area. While this Bill is vital it is not enough, because it disregards the wider issue of children's rights.  We are signatures to the UN declaration on the rights of the child which was adopted 20 years ago but we have not taken any steps to give effect to what we profess to be our stance in relation to children.  We are perpetuating a concept of legitimacy and illegitimacy in relation to human beings and for that reason there is no such thing as human rights and we cannot purport to uphold human rights in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the need to legislate for illegitimate children.  He expressed sympathy for them but that is not enough.  He is Minister and his job is to legislate.  If there is a constitutional barrier to equality, and there appears to be one, he must accept that it must go. How it goes will require a great deal of teasing out and would be a subject for protracted discussion, possibly by a committee of this House which would be given advice by qualified people.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the promise of a Children's Act by the Minister for Health later this year. Children's rights are a very broad issue. When you talk about children's rights you can mean the hundreds of thousands of children living in poverty in this State, the 30,000 children who are on the waiting list for proper housing, the unequal and inadequate education and health systems which can mitigate very strongly against children and the right of every child to be free from abuse, from violence, at home or at school.</P>
    <P>A case for separate legal representation for children has been made.  The fundamental fact is that a child is a person in his or her own right with rights that are distinct and apart from their membership of the family and are entitled to individual legal representation. This brings us to the broader issue of free legal aid for all persons without means.  May I avail of this opportunity to impress on the Minister the need to do something positive about the system of free legal aid?  It is intolerable that the report has been on his desk since <Col N="1101" /> December 12 months.  I know this is not very relevant and I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will rule me out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the more pressing matters and is fundamental to the whole concept of justice within the State.  The Minister appears to be making the case that the Labour Party want to undermine the family in the State.  There is no question in the minds of the Labour Party of undermining the rights of the family.  What we want to do is to strike a balance between the child's rights and the parents' rights and we understand a constitutional change is necessary to strike that balance.  On page 3 of the Report of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties this issue was referred to.  It says:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Parents' Rights and Children's Interests.</i>
      </P>
      <P>The parent-child relationship is a fundamental one in practically every society.  Nearly everyone has had experience of it, and strong views are held as to what the relationship means, what are its values and what are its limitations.  Extreme opinions are sometimes held.  There are those on the one hand who see the relationship in terms of the rights which belong to the parent&mdash;the right to custody, the right to decide questions about the social, physical, moral, educational and religious upbringing of the child, the right to chastise, <i>et cetera.</i>  On the other hand, there are those who emphasise exclusively the rights of the child&mdash;the right to a stable and loving home, the right to a minimum education <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem for the law and the <Col N="1102" /> Constitution is to find the correct balance between the claims of parents and the interests of children, and to define the conditions under which interference by society is justifiable for the protection of children.  This is not an easy balance to draw.  It is, however, reasonable to suggest that the greater the degree of interference by society the stronger need be the grounds justifying intervention.  The complete removal of a child from his parents against their wishes and the transfer of parental rights to new parents is a drastic form of intervention which can be justified only by the most compelling reasons, that is, clear proof of conduct by the parents demonstrating beyond doubt their unfitness to act as parents.  The temporary removal of a child or counselling without removal from the home are forms of intervention which may be reasonable in less extreme cases.</P>
    <P>That is the balance the Labour Party set out to achieve.  The whole question of the involuntary termination of parental rights raises great difficulty.  We do not have any illusions about this but the overriding principle must be that the welfare of a little vulnerable child must be taken into account and the interests of a child who may have been abused must be looked after.  This is the point of view the Labour Party put forward.</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts that principle and if we all work towards giving it effect, we can have a very useful and perhaps lengthy debate on the most appropriate way to go about it.  As I said, it would be very appropriate to set up a committee of this House which could avail of the expertise of Members and officials. The pros and cons of the matter could be debated to ensure that each approach is evaluated and the best one is adopted.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the Labour Party fully support the family based on marriage. Far from undermining the family what we set out to do is to stress the importance of family life for those children who are denied it and are condemned to spend their young lives in institutions and less secure forms of custody.  We also want to extend adoption to <Col N="1103" /> legitimate children who have been abandoned and so on.  That pinpoints the store we place on family life.  We want to ensure that the Constitution does not raise artificial barriers to this.  For instance, the unmarried mother and her child are not considered a family, or are they?  Here is a case where judges differ. A church annulment and a remarriage is not a family with constitutional rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the attitude of the Irish people to family life, with which I agree, but we want to extend the rights of family life to those units which may not be based on marriage as defined in the Constitution but who are, nevertheless, a family who should have all the moral and legal rights of a family. We all agree that this poses a problem. A child born out of wedlock has human rights and we must transfer those human rights to legal rights.  If we have the will to do that we will find the means to do it. As I said before the Minister's sympathy is not enough.  A solution must be found, difficult though it might be, but if the will is there we will find a way to reconcile the difficulties that arise.</P>
    <P>There are pressures on a single mother about which we talked quite considerably during the course of the debate on the Labour Party Bill last October. The adoption code has swung over very much on the side of the adoptive parents, making it extremely difficult for the unmarried mother to make up her mind.  Indeed the many aspects involved, such as the length of time she is given to make up her mind, should be looked into. Many facilities, such as the support services, should be improved to enable her reach a decision free from the financial and social pressures which are part and parcel of the lot of an unmarried mother in this State.  If, having weighed up the whole question, she decides to keep her child she should feel secure in the knowledge that by so doing she is not discriminating against the child, that the Constitution and laws of the State will provide the same rights for the child under her guardianship as they would were she to give the child up for adoption. This is another very important aspect of what we are seeking in the <Col N="1104" /> abolition of the concept of illegitimacy.</P>
    <P>I agree totally with Deputy O'Keeffe when he talks about the children of extra-martial unions who cannot be adopted.  It matters not whether there are ten or 100; they have rights we should not define.  Certainly it is a disgraceful situation if, because of an over-rigid Constitution, they are forced to leave the country.  That is something about which the Bill does nothing whatsoever.  The Bill does nothing about rendering adoption orders constitutional or rendering them secure under the Constitution.  The whole field of adoption is one needing a lot of consideration and review.  There has been no investigation, updating or proper review carried out of the field of adoption since the enactment of the Adoption Act, 1952.  The case has been made that more resources should be made available to the Adoption Board.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the time is opportune also for a wider review of the whole concept of adoption.  The Minister talking about enacting legislation in regard to the whole question of the rights of illegitimate children and suggesting that the Law Reform Commission may deal with it does not meet the case at all because that commission, if anything, is overloaded with work.  For instance, in this area they have issued a report on the age of majority.  I do not think there has been any action taken nor is any action proposed on that in the near future.  The whole question of nullity has been referred to that Commission also.  There is no doubt but that any aspect of what we seek to do in this Bill if referred to them would take many years before it could be reached by them and perhaps many more years before any legislation could be enacted.  That should not be the approach of the Minister.  Rather there should be a commitment from him to do something about it now.  The case for the abolition of illegitimacy has been made. Surely also there must be a commitment to extending the security and comfort of adoptive homes to those categories of children I have mentioned.  If that commitment is accepted then the framework within which it can be done should be found.</P>
    <P>In her series on adoption in <i>The Irish <Col N="1105" /> Times</i> of 4 to 7 December 1978 Olivia O'Leary quoted an ISPCC worker who obviously was sickened by a lot of the sentimental rubbish she had been reading or hearing about the soft-hearted Irish attitude towards children, their love for children.  She concluded, on the contrary, that the Irish are a very callous race.  I agree that we are not as soft-hearted as we would like to think we are. In a lot of our laws and actions we display a lot of callousness.  But I do not think we are so callous as not to make a genuine effort at achieving justice for children.  For instance, in this International Year of the Child the objectives at which we are aiming in the areas I have mentioned would I believe meet the approval of the Irish people were they advanced by the Minister for Justice, coming from a party with a 20-seat majority. I think the Minister could be assured of the whole-hearted support of our people to proposals for reform in this area.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider the fact that he has omitted so many vital aspects of children's rights from this Bill, that he has lost an opportunity of creating a framework within which that reform could be carried out.  I would appeal to him to bring about the changes we want to see enacted, to bring about a charter for children in this State. I am not telling him to do it our way.  We thought our way was the best way of doing it.  He may be critical of that way and that criticism may or may not be well founded.  However, it is the job of this House to decide on the principles.  If the Minister accepts these principles, the onus is on him, having refused to give our Bill a Second Reading, to introduce an alternative Bill to effect the proposals we have in mind.  I would ask the Minister to consider that very seriously indeed when I believe he will have the support of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of my party to the adoption issue has been put very clearly by Deputy O'Keeffe.  I have nothing to add to what he said on the question of adoption.  Instead I want to speak for a little while on the technique the House is using today, and intends that the people should use, in order to <Col N="1106" /> cure a difficulty which appears either to have arisen or is likely to arise.  I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this is the first occasion in 42 years on which an amendment of the Constitution has been necessary, or appears necessary, as a plugging operation. It is the first occasion on which an <i>ad hoc</i> amendment has been undertaken.</P>
      <P>There have been five constitutional amendments to date.  The first, in 1939, the validity of which I strongly doubt, bore on the attribution of an artificial extended meaning to the expression &ldquo;time of war&rdquo; in Article 28.  The second, in 1941, was a kind of tidying-up operation in which, marginal changes or only verbal changes were made.  The third, fourth and fifth all took place in 1972 and effected, respectively, the excision from Article 44 of the special position of the Catholic Church, the permission to the State to become a member of the European Economic Community and the reduction of the voting age to 18. These were not <i>ad hoc</i> measures; they were all substantive changes of the Constitution for general purposes.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us does not fall into this category; it is in a different category; it is an <i>ad hoc</i> plugging operation. While I sympathise with the Government's anxiety to carry out that plugging operation, and while only the unfortunate accident of the 1977 General Election prevented my Government from doing so, we ought to stop and look carefully at this technique&mdash;perhaps no very serious issue arises on it this time&mdash;and ask ourselves whether this is the right way to go about fixing a problem of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before getting on to that technical matter I want to say this to the Minister in regard to his speech, the material he placed before the House and to which he adverted as the reason for this Bill.  He read an excellent speech here last week.  I hope he will not take it as an impertinence to him personally if I say that he is very well served by whatever official or officials put that speech together.  It is very informative.  Even though I might not agree with some of the points of view contained therein, it is an excellent and very helpful speech.  On the very first <Col N="1107" /> page the Minister refers to the case in which the potential weakness of the adoption procedure first surfaced&mdash;McL. <i>v.</i>  An Bord Uchtála.  That case was decided by the Supreme Court in either April or July of 1976.  I do not know if it will amuse or interest nonlegal Members of the House to know that there is, as yet, no printed report of that case available in the Irish Reports. In fact, there was not even a copy of that case in any shape or form in Leinster House until I asked the Library to get one.  They got one by courtesy of the Chief State Solicitor's Office, who sent it across in a form pretty much like the Minister's speech.  There is no western democracy in which it would be possible to find a Supreme Court decision on a constitutional point still not in print three years later.</P>
    <P>I have often condemned our habit of taking our tone from the British; but at least in the jurisdiction next door to us they have a system whereby a case of this sort would be in print in a week.  If the one I am talking about is printed in any shape or form I have missed it.  So far as I know it is not in the Irish Reports or in the Irish Law Times Reports; I have only a newspaper clipping of it.  If that were an isolated incident it would not be worth mentioning, but it is a bit strange that the House should be asked to approve the draft of a constitutional amendment on the basis of a case which nobody in the House has read or would find it very easy to get a copy of.</P>
    <P>The Minister can go down to the Library of this House and he will find that the last issue of the Irish Reports in the Library bears the superscription 1977 Irish Reports, Part I.  The 1977 Irish Reports Part I arrived in this House in June 1978 and carried decisions which go back to 1975.  That is the last line of the Irish Reports which is available to this Oireachtas, which is one of the other organs of State along with the courts.</P>
    <P>I know all about the difficulties.  The difficulties, which are called &ldquo;budgetary constraints&rdquo;, do not seem to worry semi-State bodies which are able every year to <Col N="1108" /> produce glossy reports designed by tweed tie-ed architects, graphic designers and so forth.  There do not seem to be any budgetary constraints about that, but when it is a case of setting in type 400 or 500 pages of the law then suddenly the &ldquo;budgetary constraints&rdquo; drop on top of us out of the heavens.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that the liaison between the Minister's Department, which provide some money for this, and the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting is not as satisfactory as it might be.  I am not sure about this and I do not want to upset the Minister or his Department by making allegations about something I am not sure about; but I believe I have heard that personnel in that liaison situation have been changed around from time to time and there has not been a continuity of liaison between the Minister and his Department and the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting.  That may be a situation which for Departmental reasons has been unavoidable, but I urge the Minister to see if he can do something about trying to improve the law reporting situation, which is undoubtedly the worst in Western Europe.  It may be the worst in all of Europe, and other parts of the world as well.</P>
    <P>The reason why we are getting this amendment in this form is a technical one.  I hope the House will allow me to try and explain why this amendment takes the shape of adding a new section to Article 37.  Under the 1922 Constitution, from which the 1937 Constitution was very largely copied, except for a certain number of innovations, most of which were detrimental, no problem of this kind would have arisen.  That Constitution contained in its 64th article the same kind of expressions which the present Constitution contains in Article 34, namely, confining exclusively to the courts the administration of justice.  It has always been a difficult matter to decide in any jurisdiction what is a judicial controversy of a type which must fall into the sphere of the courts and what is a controversy of a kind which can validly be decided by an administrative authority.  That has always been a troublesome area, and I do not <Col N="1109" /> believe that anybody will ever draw a satisfactory frontier.  But it was broadly recognised and it was quite a familiar situation, under the old Constitution and in the days of the British, that an increasing range of administrative operations had, and could not but have, judicial-looking outcrops, that there were operations necessarily incidental to the carrying out of administrative policy which meant that a Minister, a Department or a board would have to make up their minds one way or the other about a situation which, potentially, could affect people's rights.</P>
    <P>It was understood that one could not run a modern state otherwise, that one could not be deciding every little dispute, every little issue which arose in administration by running to the courts. That was understood in 1922, in the days when the old Constitution was being drafted and it was well understood all through the 1920's.  In the 1930's in litigation which is reported under the name of <i>Lynham v. Butler (No. 2)</i> in the 1933 Irish Reports, the point was powerfully raised against the Land Commission that in the carrying out of some of their functions, resuming holdings and making ascertainments of one kind or other, which they had to do in order to carry out the purposes of the Land Acts, they were discharging functions which were essentially judicial.  The point was powerfully made that those functions under the Constitution of those days should have been left to a court and only to a court.</P>
    <P>The counsel who most powerfully argued that in <i>Lynham v. Butler</i> was George Gavan Duffy.  He was a signatory of the Treaty who subsequently became a judge about 1935 or 1936. He was one of the greatest judges the State has seen.  I believe that, were it not for him, the whole system of judicial review of legislation here might never have got off the ground.  I believe it is perfectly conceivable that a case like the <i>McGee</i> case, which Deputy Desmond and Deputy O'Keeffe know about&mdash;I mention it because it is a relatively recent topical one&mdash;or a case like <i>Byrne v. Ireland</i>, which established that the State was just as much liable to be sued in tort <Col N="1110" /> as any private citizen, might never have arisen or might never have been so decided had it not been for the judicial adventurousness, very independent and noble mind of Gavan Duffy.  I have a great deal of admiration for him and think he is a very major figure in the history of the Irish Judiciary.</P>
    <P>At the same time he had what I can only call, I hope with no disrespect to his memory, a bee in his bonnet on the subject of the usurpation as he saw it of judicial functions by administrators.  He was the counsel who most powerfully argued against the Land Commission's function in <i>Lynham v. Butler.</i>  In that case it seemed to be settled by the Supreme Court&mdash;by Chief Justice Kennedy, Mr. Justice Johnston and Mr. Justice Meredith&mdash;that it was permissible for administrative authorities to conduct operations, on the periphery of their main work, which were judicial in appearance.</P>
    <P>The best judgment in this regard is the judgment of Mr. Justice Johnston, who said it was unavoidable that in a modern state, in carrying out administrative policy, administrators will have to make decisions.  They will have to come down as to whether the farm should be given to X or to Y and they will have to make decisions as to who is entitled and who is not entitled.  It cannot be otherwise. Anybody would have said after 1932&mdash;it was in that year the Supreme Court gave judgment after reserving their judgment for about 20 months&mdash;that this problem would not arise any more, that it had now been authoritatively settled here, that even a very drastic function, like the functions of the Land Commission, were not necessarily a usurpation of the sphere of the courts even though they were discharged by people who were not judges.</P>
    <P>I strongly suspect that Gavan Duffy's influence on the incoming Government of Mr. de Valera was such that he persuaded them to include in the new Constitution which was drafted in 1936 and early in 1937 a clause which would specifically cover and legitimate something which Gavan Duffy never accepted to be legitimate, namely the discharge of a function of a judicial nature <Col N="1111" /> by a non-court.  So, in order to accommodate the point of view of Gavan Duffy, Mr. de Valera produced in the Dail&mdash;the Seanad, I do not need to remind the House, had been abolished because that was Mr. de Valera's way of dealing with a House which would not do what he wanted&mdash;in June 1937 a draft Constitution which included a brand new article, to which nothing in the old Constitution had corresponded, and it was barely debated in this House. The whole Constitution passed through the House in 11 days&mdash;imagine how long it would take to debate one single contentious subsection in these days, because everyone has become so wordy&mdash; the whole thing went through the House in 11 days.  But Mr. de Valera did say in the Dail debates, Volume 67, column 1511, when explaining about Article 37:</P>
    <P>There were questions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That was a typical de Valera-ism.  The question had been settled by the Supreme Court but to Mr. de Valera it was still a matter of &ldquo;there were questions&rdquo;.  It had been settled so far as any instance in this State could settle such a thing.</P>
    <P>There were questions about the Land Commission, as to whether their functions were of a judicial character or not ... so as not to get tied in the knot&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;the only people being tied in a knot were himself and his party because everybody else was completely in the clear about the powers of the Land Commission and their entitlement to carry out the functions which the Land Acts entrusted to them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>So as not to get tied in the knot that judicial powers or functions could only be exercised by the ordinary courts established here, you have to have a provision of this type.</P>
    <P>I do not know, and I have no direct evidence to prove, that that was Gavan Duffy speaking through him, but I honestly believe it was; and that was the bee in Gavan Duffy's bonnet surfacing <Col N="1112" /> in here via the Constitution draft.  I say that while repeating the enormous respect which anyone who has taken a look at the way law has worked here over the last 50 years must have for the memory of George Gavan Duffy.  This is an instance in which he had a belief which I honestly believe was unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Therefore, that Article became law; and there were several cases in the forties and the fifties in which the Article was mentioned, usually in litigation involving the Land Commission, and the courts never had occasion to rely on that Article.  They were still able to say: &ldquo;There is a visible distinction between, on the one hand, operations of a kind which are only proper and exclusively proper to the courts, and, on the other hand, administrative operations in which the administrator must, as the lawyers say, act judicially&rdquo;; in other words, he is not administering justice, he is not discharging a judicial power or function, but he must act judicially; even though he is only acting as an administrator he must do so with the disposition of a judge; he must be fair, he must hear both sides, he must give a fair opportunity to somebody affected by his operations to make his case and to make sure that his case is understood.  That is acting judicially, but it does not amount to administering justice.  These two categories were well understood before the Constitution. But, in addition to these two categories which were equally understood after the Constitution, there was now apparently a third category, the Article 37 category, where a judicial function is being exercised by somebody who is not a judge, as distinct from an administrative function being exercised judicially by someone who is not a judge.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Desmond was here she would accuse me of being guilty of legal labyrinthism or something of that kind.  I admit that it is a difficult area, and I admit that one cannot draw clear objective boundaries around these categories; but the consequences of Mr. de Valera's Constitution, in Article 37, is that instead of having two categories which are difficult to define and delimit we now <Col N="1113" /> have three categories which are difficult to define and delimit.  Except for the expression in Article 37 which forbids an administrative authority to exercise a jurisdiction of a criminal kind or of a kind that cannot be described as limited it is really hard to see what function Article 37 fulfils at all.</P>
    <P>We are in a situation where we have this Article the only useful effect of which is to forbid the exercise of nonlimited&mdash;and nobody knows what non-limited is&mdash;or criminal functions by an administrative authority.  That is the effect of the Article, but does it really work like that?  The Land Commission is still functioning.  Farms are still being resumed, I suppose, or the power to do so is still there.  I would have said that was a very drastic function; it is not a limited function by any ordinary understanding of the word.  Yet it is still going on.  Article 37 has not stopped it.  What about planning authorities?  What about a local authority who refuse planning permission or grant planning permission only to find that the appeal board shoots it down?  What is to be said of a man who has bought a piece of land or entered into a binding option to buy a piece of land, heavily invested in advice, who in reliance on the planning permission has perhaps entered into contracts of various kinds and finds then that the appeal board give a decision which reduces the land back to its agricultural value?  Surely that is a very drastic and serious thing, and yet it has never been effectively challenged by reference to Article 37.  This Article is a vague sword of Damocles hanging over the head of we do not know who, and we do not know what will cut the thread that will let that sword fall.  Nobody really knows what the exact function of that Article is. Nobody really knows how far it is going to go, how far it can be evoked and, to cut a long story short, I am very far from convinced that it fulfils any function in the Constitution at all, like several of the other innovative Articles put in in 1937.</P>
    <P>What are we doing here?  Let me just read Article 37 because I want the House to know what it is we are adding a new paragraph to.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1114" /> Nothing in this Constitution shall operate to invalidate the exercise of limited functions and powers of a judicial nature, in matters other than criminal matters, by any person or body of persons duly authorised by law to exercise such functions and powers, notwithstanding that such person or body of persons is not a judge or a court appointed or established as such under this Constitution.</P>
    <P>We are now adding:</P>
    <P>No adoption of a person taking effect... by reason only of the fact that such person or body of persons is not a judge or a Court.</P>
    <P>Do not forget that in the editions of the Constitution which will be hereafter printed these two sections will be side by side and of course we will be supposed to administer that Article as one.  The way a lawyer will look at the thing is as follows: he would say, I know there is a certain amount of unreality.  We talk about the people who &ldquo;enacted&rdquo; the Constitution, but the reality is that what people did was to go out and vote for de Valera or vote against de Valera.  I need not say that not 1 per cent of them had even read a single line of the Constitution that they were voting on, any more than that more than 5 per cent of the Deputies in here will have read all of Article 37 by the time this passes.  Perhaps that is an exaggeration.  But certain assumptions of a polite kind have to be made, namely, that the Oireachtas knew what it was about when it was enacting them.  I know that might be a large assumption, but assumptions have to be made, for politeness' sake at least, and the same kind of assumption is made about a Constitution, that the people deliberately &ldquo;enacted&rdquo; it whether originally or by a referendum which inserts a new clause.  That whole Article is going to be read as one piece.  The effect of that is going to be that a court asked to look at Article 37 in order to test the validity of some administrative power that this House is not focusing on at the moment, that nobody has adverted to at this moment, is going to read it like this, and is going to be invited to read it like <Col N="1115" /> this, by a lawyer on one side or the other, and to take a view as follows: that the people of Ireland consider that the function of a legal adoption order is a non-limited function of a judicial kind. The argument will be raised, maybe successfully, that if the making of an adoption order is non-limited and of a judicial nature, <i>a fortiori</i> some other function is non-limited and of a judicial nature.</P>
    <P>What we are implicitly admitting here is that adoption is a non-limited function and that an adoption order cannot be made without exercising a function of a judicial nature.  By admitting that, we may be implicitly pulling the ground from under some other administrative function of which we are totally unaware. That may be a very salutary result.  I cannot predict, I have not any idea; all I am saying is that we are doing more here today than merely validating, or shoring up, or plugging a gap in an adoption system which has been operating here for 27 years.</P>
    <P>That is one implication of what we are doing here today.  I realise that, just because I say so, the Minister will not run off and scrap this Bill and bring in another one.  I just hope the thing does not have any ill effects, but I should like to put on record my suspicion that we will find that argument raised, perhaps effectively, and perhaps raised in a manner which will mean we will be rushing in with another amendment to plug some other gap.  That will be the consequences of relying on an argument like that.  Supposing that by reliance on an argument like that some function, like a planning function or a function of the Land Commission becomes hereafter invalidated, we will be running in here with some other amendment which will say that notwithstanding that the Land Commission are not a court or a judge or that An Bord Pleanala are not a court or a judge, all planning appeals since a relevant date shall be deemed to have been perfectly valid.  We cannot go on like that.</P>
    <P>The other consequences of what we are doing here is that it impliedly rules out, perhaps correctly&mdash;I think it is right&mdash;Indemnity Acts.  Perhaps I am <Col N="1116" /> wrong in this&mdash;there may be indemnity clauses tucked away somewhere in other Acts, but the only full Indemnity Act we have had was the Act passed after the Civil War, in 1923, which effectively prevented actions from being brought in respect of wrongs which were alleged to have been committed on behalf of the Provisional Government or the Free State Government during the currency of the war.  There was ample precedent in the laws of other common law countries for such Indemnity Acts&mdash;indeed they were the rule after wars.</P>
    <P>But of course an Indemnity Act means, if it is law, if it is valid, that somebody who on Monday had a right of action in respect of, say, requisitioning or confiscation or an act of arson or of assault or an act of grievous bodily harm, or whatever it may be, on Tuesday had not any such right because his right had been taken away from him by an Act of Parliament.  That is what the effect of an Indemnity Act must be.</P>
    <P>The situation we are facing up to here is that somebody who&mdash;I do not want to be raising scares&mdash;potentially on Monday might have had a right to have an adoption order invalidated under Article 37, on Tuesday would have no such right because it would have been taken away from him.  The point I am trying to make is that by adopting this technique we implicitly, tacitly, are saying that ordinary Indemnity Acts are no good, that they cannot be effective in this State from now on, and that their purpose can only be achieved <i>via</i> a solemn amendment to the Constitution.  My belief is that that is right: I think that an Indemnity Act should not have any place under our Constitution; I do not think the Constitution allows Parliament arbitrarily to take away people's rights of action in that way.  I am not quarrelling with that: I just want to draw the attention of the House to it, because we should know what we are doing when a Bill like this is going through, a Bill which is aimed only at a very narrow part of the field of law, aimed at plugging only a single gap.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure it might not have been better, in trying to do what the Minister is aiming at, to have put a new</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> Article altogether at the end of the Constitution, quite separate from Article 37, and to have given it some name which would make it clearer that it was intended to contain merely <i>ad hoc</i> plugs.  If I had sat down to think about it I might have thought of a name for such an Article. In my opinion it would have been better to have produced an appendix at the end of the Constitution, a kind of basket into which this provision could have been put, clearly labelled as an <i>ad hoc</i> provision not to be taken as containing any implication in regard to any other part of the Constitution, an implication which will now be there when we build this amendment into Article 37, which will have implications in regard to the interpretation of other parts of Article 37.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say except for a few brief observations in regard to the text of the proposed amendment.  Why was it decided to write the Irish text of the new section according to spelling conventions which have been obsolete for 50 years?  Rannóg an Aistriucháin in this House, which I have praised before for their work in regard to the standardisation of Irish spelling, were set up at the same time as the Oireachtas came into existence and they immediately got down to the business of simplifying and standardising spelling.  They did not finally standardise until 1947, but attempts were made in that direction, as one can see when one opens the statutes of 1922 and 1923.  In 1947, Mr. de Valera, intending to show that he was a more antique Irishman, more primeval than anybody else, went back to a spelling system which had not been used officially since the State had been founded, and the Constitution was not only put in draft in the so-called Gaelic script but in accordance with spelling conventions which had long since gone&mdash;though from which I still suffered as a schoolboy&mdash;which officially had been dropped since 1922.</P>
    <P>At some stage in the fifties, I think, a text of the Constitution was published in which a revision of the Irish text, according to the spelling standardised by Rannóg an Aistriucháin was printed.  I have heard a Supreme Court judge express the view that it is not within the <Col N="1118" /> power of the Taoiseach's Office&mdash;the Taoiseach is in charge of putting out these texts&mdash;to carry out any change at all, even the most minute spelling change, in the Irish text of the Constitution which must stay in the form in which the people adopted it.</P>
    <P>I will not pronounce on this now.  The changes which were made arbitrarily in the Taoiseach's Office consist not merely of spelling changes, there are some slight grammer changes too, all done without any referendum.  My point is that we should keep an eye at what we are at.  Here we have a proposal to insert in the Constitution&mdash;the thing has been done in Roman script&mdash;a clause in which I see the words &ldquo;sainráidhte&rdquo;, &ldquo;dhlighthe&rdquo;, &ldquo;d'achtuigh&rdquo;, &ldquo;sonruighthe&rdquo; and &ldquo;bunuigheadh&rdquo;.  They have been all spelled according to conventions which were officially declared in 1947 to be obsolete, and which have in fact been obsolete since 1922 or 1923.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister serious in putting into the Constitution a version of Irish spelling which is not used in the schools and which has not been used in this House since its foundation?  In the existing Article 37 I find that the word &ldquo;dlí&rdquo; is spelled &ldquo;dlí&rdquo; but I find that in the Minister's amendment the word is spelled &ldquo;dlighidh&rdquo;.  Nothing can surprise me any longer in regard to the brazen and contemptuous indifference of the Irish State towards something it is supposed to love, cherish and revive; but is it not the frozen limit, assuming that this Bill will be enacted, that we are to have section 1 of Article 37 according to the 1947 standards and section 2 of Article 37 in the orthography of 50 years ago?  In other words, we will have a section in which, within a half-an-inch of each other, the same word will be spelled differently. Surely enough insults have been perpetrated, and by Fianna Fáil in particular, to the Irish language without having this one.</P>
    <P>Is it the Minister's intention to display a degree of romantic antiquarianism in tribute to the memory of the late Mr. de Valera?  If, say, the Americans were to amend today their Constitution which was enacted in the 1780s, in the days when admittedly spelling did not differ very much to what was then conventional <Col N="1119" /> English spelling but in which words such as &ldquo;music&rdquo; were spelled with a &ldquo;k&rdquo;, can the Minister visualise the Americans passing an amendment involving the word music and spelling it with a &ldquo;k&rdquo;?  Were they to do so the American Congress would be laughed at, but what the Minister is doing is the equivalent of that.  I trust that in that small respect at least he will think again before going ahead with the Bill.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to thank all those Members who contributed to the debate and who have expressed a welcome for the Bill.  I should like to go further and thank Deputy Kelly for his appreciation of the efforts of the staff of the Department of Justice who were involved in this area.  The Deputy knows it is not often that officials in the Department have such praise showered on them.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should deal first with the last point raised by Deputy Kelly regarding the Irish version of what is in the Bill.  This was prepared by the Translation Branch of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Apparently the spelling was kept in line deliberately with what was in the original version.  The version in the published revised text, when published, will be in the new spelling.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for his welcome of the Bill in general.  He raised <Col N="1120" /> a number of points on matters that are not strictly speaking relevant to the Bill but I shall endeavour to reply to them. In regard to the question of children's rights, the Deputy would not appear to recognise something that is spelled out clearly in Judge Walsh's judgment in the recent case, that is, that children have rights which are recognised and protected by the Constitution.  Those who insist, for example, that a neglected legitimate child has the right to adoption seem to forget that adoption would sever the rights and the duties of the natural parents in a family based on marriage, which the Constitution also expressly protects.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 3 of the 1974 Act, I said earlier that I had misgivings because, taken with other provisions, it could lead to a serious infringement of the rights of the mother.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My misgivings were from a different point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A point raised by Deputy O'Keeffe which, if left un-answered, might lead to concern, is the question of the staffing of the board. Although this is not relevant to the Bill I think I should refer to it.  I assure the Deputy and the House that any request by the board for staff has never been neglected.  I understand that before my time they asked for a number of extra posts and that these were sanctioned very promptly.  Recently they requested additional staff and examination showed there were certain organisational and rationalisation changes that might be possible.  I understand also that two new posts have been created and that a competition to fill these posts has been held. This is an area that we should be clear on.</P>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy O'Keeffe that 10 per cent of all children in care are the illegitimate children of married women is one that has not been raised with me before by anybody.  I do not know what the Deputy suggests should be done.  In any particular case the presumption of legitimacy can be challenged in court and surely the presumption in any case is in the interest of the children generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> Deputy O'Keeffe made a point, too, regarding the Task Force.  I believe that this Force have a sufficiently wide field without going into the constitutional aspects of the adoption law.  It was never intended that they should become involved in this field for the very good reason that this area is extremely specialised.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe made a point also regarding the time limit for the upset of an adoption order.  The courts will have regard to the time that has elapsed before deciding to upset an order.  I am convinced that a rigid time limit could be unjust in some cases.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy Mrs. Desmond's guarded welcome for the Bill and her stance on it.  With regard to the McL case, Articles 41 and 42 appear to make the welfare of the child of secondary importance. She asks, then, are section 2 of the 1974 Act and section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act unconstitutional. I have dealt with this area at length in my opening speech.  In a nutshell, I argued that the provision in the Guardianship of Infants Act was probably constitutional and that, even if it was not, no harm would result because the position would nevertheless be what it was always intended to be, i.e., at common law.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Adoption Act, 1964, I had misgivings, but I did say that I would be looking at it again and examining it more closely. With regard to the rights of illegitimate children, I dealt with this at very great length in my opening speech.  Deputy Mrs. Desmond made the accusation that my opening speech contained too much legalistic argument, but it had to.  I understand Deputy Mrs. Desmond's dilemma in dealing with such an opening speech. Having made my speech I was glad that the time of the House brought about an adjournment so that interested Members would have an opportunity of going through it at their leisure instead of, as often happens, having to give instant comment on something that is extremely legalistic and a matter of great importance. There had to be legalistic arguments in my speech because there are fundamental legal questions involving <Col N="1122" /> rights and status involved in adoption. There is no point in saying &ldquo;This is what we want&rdquo; without going into the legal consequences and possible legal consequences of what we are saying.  There is no other way to deal with it.</P>
    <P>With regard to discussions with caring bodies and interested groups, I have had a number of meetings in the past 18 months with such groups.  The Minister of State in the Department of Justice has also arranged a number of meetings for either this week or early next week.</P>
    <P>As regards suggestions for the review of adoption, any criticisms that are made will be examined.  The suggestion to have a commission to consider the whole matter and the difficulties regarding the Constitution of such a commission will be examined.  However, we all know that people who offer themselves to be members of commissions investigating particular issues are not always necessarily the best people to have on such commissions.  As experience has shown, reports of such commissions in the past have divided along personality lines or lines of interest of those who constitute the membership of them.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Deputy O'Keeffe, who spoke on behalf of his party, and Deputy Mrs. Desmond, who spoke on behalf of her party, for their welcome for the Bill.  Naturally, there is certain disagreement between us as to what should be in the Bill.  I have given at great length good reason why certain matters that were raised cannot be incorporated in the Bill.  I hope the general public when they are asked to change the constitution in this regard will do so and that every Member of the House will help to bring about the change which we need.</P>
    <P>I would like to say to Deputy Mrs. Desmond that at no time did I mean to imply that her party would want to upset or break down certain structures in Irish society.  What I did say I said deliberately because of the consequences of suggestions, perhaps not seen then and perhaps not seen yet, which were voiced by members of her party in the past in this area.  I say that with all due respect and do not wish to appear to be point-scoring in this.  I am not.  I have the same legitimate interest in adoption as I am <Col N="1123" /> sure other Members have.  I thank the House for the way in which they received this legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 32, to delete &ldquo;principal&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;primary&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The argument about this amendment, which was eventually withdrawn on Committee Stage, was not a very intense one.  The Minister himself said that he did not have strong feeling about it one way or another.  I was encouraged by this statement to withdraw it and resubmit it so that the Minister would have an opportunity of reconsidering it in the intervening period, and I would be interested to hear what he has to say about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> The word &ldquo;principal&rdquo; which is included in the Bill as it stands at present, owes its parentage to the Commission of the Revival of the Irish Language, where the phrase &ldquo;principal medium of communication&rdquo; was first adopted.  I suspect that the difference between the words &ldquo;principal&rdquo; and &ldquo;primary&rdquo; may only be a question of semantics.  However, I feel that the word &ldquo;primary&rdquo; is a stronger word and that we do have an opportunity to depart from the rather jargonistic phraseology of the Commission on the Revival of Irish in this regard and substitute a word which is a stronger word and a better word in all the circumstances.  I do not propose to make an enormous issue of it.  If the Minister is genuinely convinced that &ldquo;principal&rdquo; is a stronger word than &ldquo;primary&rdquo;, one will bear with him on it, but I hope to hear the result of any consideration he has been able to give to it since Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9.&mdash;(1)  For the purpose of promoting the linguistic, economic, social, cultural and environmental development of the Gaeltacht, the advice and consent of an tÚdarás shall be sought by any planning authority operating in the Gaeltacht before planning permission is given for any development in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>(2)  Nothing in this section shall restrict the right of any applicant to appeal to an Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were discussing this question on Second and Third Stages of the Bill, the Minister's defence to my attempt to write such a power into the Bill was that there is a section in the Bill which entitles an tÚdarás to make representations to the Minister if they believe that this function or any function is necessary for the adequate exercise of their powers.  Unfortunately, as we well know, once this Bill leaves this House, goes through the other House and receives the signature of the President it has effectively gone from the legislative process.  An tÚdarás have to be appointed, an tÚdarás have to meet, an tÚdarás have to deliberate, an tÚdarás have to come to a conclusion about what powers they may or may not seek from the Minister.  This is a process which could take many months.  Even if, as seems possible if not always likely, an tÚdarás come to the conclusion that they would need a planning power such as the one outlined in this amendment, it would then come back to the Minister and the Minister would then have to make an affirmative order which would carry the status of amending this piece of legislation and have this debated in the Dáil.  The Minister would be forced into the position of again seeking from his Cabinet colleagues time in what will obviously become an increasingly complex <Col N="1126" /> and logjammed parliamentary timetable for a relatively small piece of amending legislation by way of motion or resolution without which an tÚdarás might not consider themselves capable of doing their job properly.  That is why we feel that this power, which is fundamental to the working of an tÚdarás, should be put in at this stage.</P>
    <P>The relationship of the planning function to the reservation, development and growth of the Gaeltacht is surely vital.  It is absolutely essential that an tÚdarás should have a direct input into that planning process.  If they are not going to be given this role, most of the other powers that are mentioned in the Bill are little more than verbiage.  They are good intentions and the best of intentions, but without real powers of this kind an tÚdarás will remain something that is not much better than a reconstituted Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    <P>There is an alternative version of this amendment which we shall be discussing in due course.  The amendment we are discussing at present suggests that the advice and consent of an tUdarás should be sought by any planning authority operating in the Gaeltacht before planning permission is given.  It is a fairly dramatic power to seek to give to an tÚdarás, but I suggest that there is a very good argument in favour of it.</P>
    <P>If my recollection is correct, towards the end of the discussion on a similar amendment on Committee Stage the Minister suggested that the real problem he was facing was in deciding whether or not he should give them any other additional powers; that if he had to give them this power he would open the gate to argument that they should also be conferred with a third power and so on.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that this is a legitimate worry on the part of the Minister.  He cannot effectively change the structure of the Bill without laying himself open to argument that he should further extend the powers being given to him by the House.  But in asking for this we are only doing our duty as a Parliamentary Opposition. If the Minister were prepared to give a power like this one to an tÚdarás or some analagous power there would not be any great pressure from this side of the House for further powers to be added <Col N="1127" /> to the Bill because this power is so basic in its function to the development of the Gaeltacht that it seems that without it an tÚdarás runs the risk of being reduced to a cipher.  If it is inevitable that it will be given this power or some similar power it is all the more important, given the fragile nature of the Gaeltacht today that it should be given that power sooner rather than later.  That is why we put down this amendment on this stage of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 is really the minimum acceptable in my view in terms of what can or should be transferred to an tÚdarás by way of powers.  Amendment No. 2 suggests that not only the advice but the consent of an tÚdarás should be sought.  Amendment No. 3 restricts the power simply to giving advice and requires a planning authority to seek the advice of an tÚdarás.  I accept that within the framework of the planning legislation as we have it at the moment a case and an argument can be made that it is complicated to effectively have two planning authorities for the same area, an tÚdarás and the local authority constituted under the Local Authority Acts and the Planning Acts.  It is only in response to that kind of argument to which objection was mainly made by the Minister that I put down the alternative amendment, amendment No. 3, which requires any planning authority operating in the Gaeltacht to seek the advice of an tÚdarás.  Such a planning authority would be free to reject the advice of an tUdarás <Col N="1128" /> but such advice should be sought and should be publicly given.  If the advice is rejected the planning authority would obviously be under at least some obligation to defend its decision in that regard, if not at the point at which it makes the decision, certainly in the forum of An Bord Pleanála and perhaps in public at a public inquiry organised by An Bord Pleanála.  While I feel that amendment No. 2 would be ideal, that the various legislative and planning problems could be ironed out, I must say that amendment No. 3 is the minimum acceptable for this party in relation to this Bill.</P>

Aontaím leis na leasuithe seo agus táim cinnte go n-aontóidh an tAire go bhfuil siad réasúnta agus go háirithe go bhfuil tábhacht ar leith ag baint le cúrsaí pleanála ó thaobh forbairt na Gaeltachta de.</P>
      <P>Is cuimhin liomsa na deacrachtaí a bhíodh ann ó am go ham ó thaobh cúrsaí pleanála.  Cúpla blian ó shin bhí fadhb agus achrann an-mhór sa Spidéal nuair a bhí cead pleanála tugtha ag an Comhairle Chontae chun scéim luxury houses a thógáil.  Ansan bhí oral hearing agus tugadh an cead pleanála.  Chuir mo Roinnse, thar mo cheann agus thar m'ainmse objection isteach agus bhí gach éinne buartha ansin ó thaobh na teanga de agus ó thaobh forbairt shóisialachta go háirithe sa cheantar sin. Dá bhrí sin sílim go mba chóir go rachadh aon údarás pleanála, is cuma an údarás áitiúil atá i gceist no údarás náisiúnta, i gcomhairle le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta nuair a thagann fadhbanna pleanála nó nuair atá sé measta aon fhorbairt a dhéanamh a bheadh ag brú ar an teanga agus rudaí dá leithéid.</P>
      <P>Dá bhrí sin sílim go bhfuil na leasuithe seo an réasúnta, ach go háirithe ó thaobh prionsabail de.  Tá tábhacht ar leith ag baint leo agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil breathnú déanta ag an Aire ar an bprionsabal atá sna leasuithe seo agus a bhfuil mise i bhfábhar leo.</P>

Beidh caoi ag an Údarás cead a fháil ón Rialtas na cumhachtaí seo a fháil agus má bhíonn an cead sin acu beidh an tÚdarás níos láidre go mór.  Ní aontaím, gur gá go mbeadh comhairle an Údaráis ag teastáil.  Is féidir é sin a fháil am ar bith. Nil aon deacracht le comhairle a fháil ón Údarás, ach is beag an mhaith comhairle nó toiliú a thabhairt mura bhfuil cumhacht pleanála ag an Údarás féin.  Sílim go mbeidh an t-alt níos fearr má fhágaimid é faoin Údarás na cumhachtai seo a iarraidh nó a fháil ón Rialtas má shíleann siad go bhfuil gá leo agus gur ceart na cumhachtai sin a bheith acu.

      <P>The most recent available information on the percentage unemployed in different areas relates to the quarterly compilations for planning regions of the ratio of the number of insured persons on the live register to the total insured labour force.  The regional subdivision of the latter aggregate is based on the location of the local employment office where each insured person is registered and as this may differ in a significant number of cases from the office where an unemployed person may sign in order to apply for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, disaggregation of the data according to areas smaller than the planning regions would not yield meaningful results.</P>

Since I became Minister for Justice I have considerably strengthened the hands of the Garda Síochána in dealing with those involved in armed robberies.

      <P>Special measures were introduced by the Garda Síochána during 1978 which were designed to combat this form of criminality.  The Deputy knows that protection is being afforded to very large sums of money in transit and to locations where the high cash holdings are held.  The Deputy should also know, when he underlines the fact that the amount of money taken during 1978 is double that which was taken in 1977, that practically 50 per cent of the money taken in 1978 was taken in a very small number of big robberies. Since the first of these big robberies occurred the Government decided that the Army should help the Garda in protecting large sums of money in transit, and this is being done.  Other measures have been introduced, and the Deputy should not dismiss them too lightly.  They are effective and will be seen to be more effective as time goes on.  They are only beginning.  Whatever changes must take place with regard to legislation are being contemplated, and Government decisions in this area will be made known shortly.</P>

Is it not correct that in the last quarter of 1978 almost £¾ million were taken in armed robberies and that it is not true that there were a confined number of big robberies early in the year and that the figure has fallen since?  In the last quarter the figure amounted to nearly £¾ million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that there is a <Col N="1137" /> serious back-log of cases awaiting trial in the High Court in Cork, with a present delay of 12 months; and the steps he proposes to take to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a backlog of cases awaiting trial by jury exists in Cork as, indeed, it does in the High Court generally.  The average time-lag between the setting down of an action for trial by jury and its coming up for hearing is nine and a half months in the High Court generally and 12 months in Cork.</P>
      <P>One way of dealing with this problem would be to increase the number of judges, and I am considering the possibility of proposing legislation for that purpose.  There are, however, practical problems in relation to accommodation which have to be solved.  Moreover an important recent development has been the making by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure of its Twentieth Interim Report which, <i>inter alia</i>, recommends a substantial transfer of jurisdictions from the High Court to the lower courts.  The effect of these recommendations, if implemented, could result in a substantial reduction in the overall volume of business of the High Court, thus releasing judicial time in that court to deal with the back-log of jury actions.</P>
      <P>I am having the report and the problem of arrears studied, and I will make my proposals in the matter as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the cost per week of maintaining an inmate at Loughan House, County Cavan; if his attention has been drawn to press reports that 82 full-time staff and seven teachers were employed to provide custodial care for 17 boys; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated annual cost at present rates of running Loughan House is £443,000.  The running costs would not vary significantly whether the number of boys was 20, as at present, or 40 or ten, and any attempt to calculate the cost per boy would not be meaningful.  The press reports were based on the reply given by me on 31 January 1979 to a parliamentary question.</P>
      <P>When I decided that something had to be done as soon as possible to provide secure and humane custody for boys who were committing serious offences with impunity in Dublin and elsewhere, I realised that such custody could be provided only by a heavy investment in staff.  Many of these boys had literally been beyond any control and no school was able or willing to attempt to contain them.  Apart from providing a building and surroundings from which they cannot easily escape, it was essential in my view to provide them with schooling and other instruction and to ensure as far as possible that they do not inflict injury on themselves or others or destroy property.  Given the type of boy in question this objective can only be achieved by a high staff: boy ratio.  A large amount of staff time consists of discussions between staff and boys both individually and in groups, and this appears to be having beneficial results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When account is taken of annual leave, sick leave and rest days, the number of basic grade care staff on duty at any time ranges between 14 and 28 <Col N="1143" /> during the day and is down to four at night.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that, while many of the boys were very difficult when first committed to Loughan, there has been significant improvement in the position, and it has been found possible, for example, to allow some of the boys accompanied outings to football matches and to films.</P>
    <P>The staff number will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>Twenty being the present population and 17 having been the population a short time ago, am I to assume that the average cost of maintaining a pupil there is more than £20,000?  At the figure of 20 it would be more than £20,000; and approximate figure would be from £20,000 to £22,000 because the number varies from 17 to 20.  Are the press reports factual that the staff numbers laid down are 82 permanent staff and seven teachers on a part-time basis?  That makes a total of 89.  Is it correct to say that the average cost of maintaining a boy in the school at present is around the £22,000 per annum figure?  Also, are the press reports referred to in the question factual, that there are 82 permanent staff together with seven part-time teachers to care for, manage and provide education for the 17 to 20 boys in the school?</P>

      <P>I should like to repeat for the Deputy part of the answer I gave him initially that he might not have heard.  I realised that the custody of these young persons could be provided only by a heavy investment in staff. Many of these boys had been literally beyond any control, and no school was able or willing to attempt to contain them.  Apart from providing a building and surroundings from which they cannot easily escape, it was essential to provide them with schooling and other instruction to ensure that as far as possible they would not inflict injury on themselves or others or destroy property. Bearing all that in mind this objective can be achieved only by a high staff to boy ratio, I went on and explained to the Deputy why that was necessary.  I went further and said to the Deputy that when account is taken of annual leave, of rest days or whatever leave is normally taken by staff such as this, the number of basic grade care stuff on duty at any time ranges between 14 and 28 during the day and is down to four at night time.  In the earlier part of my reply to the Deputy I said that the cost was as he stated in his supplementary question but that the same cost would be involved if we had twice the number of persons in Loughan House as we have at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he considers that the introduction <Col N="1147" /> of identity cards would assist in the curbing of the abuse of alcohol among young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that there is a consensus among those who have advocated the use of identity cards in this connection as to what precisely they have in mind.  A licensee is not obliged to serve a person if there is a doubt as to the person's age.  Accordingly an identity card system would serve the purpose of permitting certain people to be served who otherwise might or might not be served.  There are people who consider that it should be what is called an absolute offence for an under-age person to be served.  That means that it would be an offence for a licensee or his servant to serve a person genuinely thought to be of age if it turned out that he was in fact under-age.  Here again the main purpose served by an identity card would be to enable the holder to get drink when, in the absence of a card, he might be refused.  If an absolute offence on these lines was created a large number of people in the 18 to 21 age-group would no doubt provide themselves with identity cards&mdash;whether the law provided for their issue or not&mdash;in order to be able to buy drink.</P>
      <P>I do not think that a case for an identity card system has been established on the basis of its efficacy in the matter of ensuring that under-age persons do not get served with drink.  It is, however, possible that the creation of an absolute offence of the kind mentioned would have at least some effect, though I have no doubt that such a development would not be welcomed by what I am certain are the vast majority of licensees who would be unwilling to serve a person who is under-age.</P>

      <P>I agree this is a very difficult problem to solve but would the Minister agree that this call for identity cards is a result of pressure to highlight the social problem created by the abuse of drink amongst young people?

      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary question, I accept that the motivation behind his question was his concern for the abuse of alcohol by young people. That is a concern that any responsible person should share.  With regard to the second part of his supplementary question I have put quite a lot of work and effort into the up-dating of the licencing laws since my time in office.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that in September 1978 the Secretary of Donegal County Council wrote to the Minister in the matter.  The facts are that a number of the items in the cross-Border study have not yet been completed or are in the course of completion and it was felt that because of this and the Minister's own heavy programme there would not be much point at that time in meeting sooner.  There is no acrimony between the three local authorities concerned, that is, Derry City Council, Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council and I do not know why Deputy Harte is making an issue of the matter.  It is very important that this programme be seen to be a unified approach.  The Deputy should see it in that spirit.</P>

      <P>Immediately following publication of the report on cross-Border communications in the Derry/ Donegal area the Government initiated an intensive examination of the consultants' finding by all the relevant Departments and official agencies concerned. The first stage of this examination was completed in June 1978 and at that time the Government reached agreement in principle on a programme of implementation covering the main areas of the consultants' recommendations.  This programme envisages:</P>
      <P>(a)  Full implementation of the consultants' recommendations for the road programme for North Donegal up to 1985;</P>
      <P>(b)  Joint action with the appropriate authorities in Northern Ireland to effect improvements in the cross-Border passenger bus service in the area;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1153" /> (c)  Consultations with the appropriate authorities in Britain and in Northern Ireland with a view to reaching agreement on establishing an air-link between Eglinton Airport and Dublin;</P>
    <P>(d)  Consultation with appropriate authorities in Northern Ireland to pursue certain joint measures for the development of tourism and the coordination of tourism promotion on the lines recommended by the consultants;</P>
    <P>(e)  Conversion of Letterkenny telephone exchanges to automatic working;</P>
    <P>(f) Laying of a cross-Border cable between Derry and Bridgend to facilitate direct dialling between Donegal, Derry and the Belfast area.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitments to full implementation of the road programme work is already proceeding on a number of roads singled out by the consultants for priority action in their road programme for north Donegal up to 1985. Early implementation of many of the other recommended road improvement schemes for which planning is at an advanced stage can be expected.</P>
    <P>The conversion to automatic working of Letterkenny Exchange and the laying of the cross-Border cable should be completed this year.  The design for a £1.12 million scheme for Greencastle has been approved and work is to begin this year.</P>
    <P>The consultants in their report emphasised the need for cross-Border co-operation in relation to the area as a whole and many of the recommendations require joint action by the two Governments for their implementation. At the meeting which the Minister had with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 5 May last it was agreed that a joint committee of officials from North and South should be set up to ensure a co-ordinated approach and monitor implementation of the study.  From the work of that committee the Minister is aware of a number of measures which the various Northern Ireland departments are taking to implement recommendations of the report, in particular in relation to the new Foyle bridge, improvements <Col N="1154" /> at Derry port and improvements in roads and telecommunications.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also asked for an early joint examination of the possibility of securing assistance for the area under the terms of the revised regional fund which is at present under discussion in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The Minister will of course be reviewing the rate of progress in all of these areas of joint endeavour in the course of his meeting today with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>While keeping developments under close review, the Government consider it right to maintain our contingent serving with the United Nations Interim Force in the Lebanon.</P>
      <P>The Government are, however, naturally most concerned about the harassment to which elements of the Irish contingent have been subjected by the so-called <i>de facto</i> forces in Southern Lebanon, and about the underlying cause: the fact that the force has not been able to establish control over the whole area entrusted to it or fully to implement the mandate given to it by the Security Council.  Along with the Secretary General and other troopcontributing countries, we have sought the assistance of the Government of Israel in influencing the <i>de facto</i> forces to co-operate with UNIFIL.</P>
      <P>This concern was expressed by the Security Council when they renewed the mandate of UNIFIL for five months on 19 January last.  The Security Council deplored the lack of co-operation particularly on Israel's part with UNIFIL's efforts to fully implement their mandate, including Israel's assistance to irregular armed groups in Southern Lebanon, and urged all member states which are in a position to do so to bring their influence to bear on those concerned so that UNIFIL could discharge their responsibilities fully and unhampered.  I trust that this will meet with a response.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that no peace-keeping operation can be without risks and that the present one presents peculiar difficulties.  The Government will of course continue in any way possible to assist the Secretary General of the United Nations, who is responsible for the operations of the force, to minimise these risks.</P>

      <P>The Government are deeply sympathetic to the plight of the Vietnamese refugees and are considering how, within our capabilities, we may assist to the greatest degree possible in the task of relieving their situation. The Deputy will be aware that on 22 December the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced a contribution of £30,000 to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for its relief programme for these refugees.  This is in addition to Ireland's regular annual contribution to UNHCR and to £10,000 which we made available in 1977 for Indo-Chinese refugees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1975 the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) requested the Government to admit three Indo-Chinese refugee families.  In July 1976 UNHCR asked the Government to participate in a programme for resettling Indo-Chinese refugees.  On both occasions the Government expressed their regret that due to current economic circumstances, which had given rise to difficulties for refugees previously admitted from Chile, it would not be feasible to admit Indo-Chinese refugees.  Following consultations organised by UNHCR in <Col N="1159" /> Geneva in December 1978, involving Vietnam, south-east Asian countries which have taken in refugees to date, and a number of countries outside that area, including Ireland, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees drew the attention of UN member states to measures he considered should be taken to alleviate the plight of the refugees. These included acceptance of refugees for resettlement by a far wider range of countries than heretofore, and further financial contributions from the widest possible range of countries.  The High Commissioner has since appealed to governments represented at the consultations in Geneva, which have undertaken to admit refugees or are considering doing so, to accelerate the rate of resettlement of refugees.  Apart from this appeal, a request to accept a number of refugees for permanent residence in Ireland has been received from a group of Irish voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that prior to any decision being taken, there are a number of factors to which the Government must give careful consideration. These would include difficulties which refugees might be expected to experience in adapting to life in Ireland and in particular in finding employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs on 8 February met with representatives of the Irish Red Cross Society and of interested voluntary organisations with a view to discussing practical arrangements for the reception and settlement of refugees who might be admitted to Ireland.  An examination of these measures is being undertaken as a matter of urgency.  It is hoped that the result of this examination will facilitate a decision on this country's capacity to accept and settle refugees.</P>

      <P>When I moved the adjournment I was expressing my disappointment with the fact that the Minister had not come any step of the road to meet us on either of these two amendments, which seek to give An tÚdarás some positive role to play in relation to the physical and environmental planning in the Gaeltacht areas.  The Minister has argued that all these powers can be made available to An tÚdarás if and when it decides to ask for them.  I was making the point that if and when it does decide to ask for them&mdash;it would be a strange Údarás if it did not ask for more powers than the Minister is giving it in this Bill&mdash;the Minister will be put to the pin of his collar to get any parliamentary time in order to produce the necessary amending resolution.  Worse than that, we have not had even an inkling of what the Minister's reaction would be to a situation where he was asked by An tÚdarás for such powers.  It is a small thing to ask.  If the Minister had taken advantage of this forum in Dáil Éireann to give an indication to whoever will be the members of An tÚdarás that he would be sympathetically disposed to granting them powers in this area if they thought they were necessary to carry out their functions in an adequate way, we might not have to press this so hard.  All the Minister has done is to hide behind the rather bland terms of the Bill and to refuse to give An tÚdarás, not just a deliberate voice, but an advisory voice in the physical planning of the Gaeltacht, a matter that goes to the heart of what constitutes the Gaeltacht and its future as a viable reality within our country.</P>

      <P>This is an alternative version of the earlier amendments we have been dealing with.  One could argue that the earlier amendments were better than this and that they sought to put on the planning authority the duty of consulting with An tÚdarás in relation to planning applications within the Gaeltacht areas.  This is less satisfactory in the sense that it puts the obligation initially on An tÚdarás to scrutinise and, if necessary, object to all planning applications within the Gaeltacht areas.  I suspect that An tÚdarás will be busy enough without having to make it its business to find out without being told automatically what planning applications are pending in the Gaeltacht areas and so I would have preferred that the onus should have been on the planning authority in any situation to make available directly to An tÚdarás lists of planning applications for its advice and/or acceptance.  This alternative version strives to give An tÚdarás a statutory role as a planning, not necessarily authority but planning voice in the general administration of the physical planning of the Gaeltacht areas.  I urge the Minister to accept it from these benches.</P>

      <P>Aontaím leis an leasú seo.  Os rud é nach raibh an tAire sásta leis na leasuithe a bhi againn roimhe seo, sílim go mba chóir dó an leasú seo a ghlacadh.  Baineann an leasú seo, mar bhain na leasuithe eile, le rud anthábhachtach ar fad chun forbairt na Gaeltachta.  Tá sé riachtanach go mbeadh guth ag An Údarás nua i dtaobh fadhbanna pleanála na Gaeltachta, go háirithe fadhbanna fisiciúla.  Mar a thuigimse an scéal, is é an príomh cuspóir nó an príomh dualgas a bheidh ag An Údarás nua ná forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn ar gach caoi, agus is é an forbairt bunúsach a bheidh le déanamh ag An Údarás ná i dtaobh eacnamaíocht.  Anois, baineann cúrsaí pleanála go mór le forbairt eacnamaiochta <Col N="1201" /> agus ba chóir go mbeadh guth agus suim ag An Údarás i gcúrsaí pleanála sa Ghaeltacht.  Dá bhrí sin ba chóir go mbeadh guth de shaghas éigin ag An Údarás go háirithe nuair a thagann iarrthóirí pleanála os comhair na comhairle contae nó aon údarás áitiúil eile.</P>
      <P>This concerns the whole question of environmental development in the Gaeltacht and it is vital that the Údarás should have a voice in deciding the appropriate type of planning that should take place in any Gaeltacht area.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister should dismiss the amendment out of hand.  I would like to clarify one or two things.  I have said that we are not here seeking effectively even to give a power to An tÚdarás; that question was defeated in an earlier amendment.  We are seeking effectively to impose a modest obligation on An tÚdarás, an obligation which I am sure An tÚdarás would welcome in the light of all the circumstances surrounding their establishment and the area in which they are expected to operate.  It might well be that some planning application of significance might escape their notice unless they were put under an obligation to adopt a positive attitude to such planning applications, and that is the whole force of this amendment.  If the amendment is defeated we are left in the unhappy situation that we do not really know whether An tÚdarás as such have any standing at all in the planning code. <Col N="1202" /> There may be scope for argument, at meetings of An tÚdarás in which objection might be made to any planning application in relation to a Gaeltacht project, about whether An tÚdarás have the right as An tÚdarás to submit an objection to An Bord Pleanála.  In that situation it may well be that members of An tÚdarás may have to fall back in their personal capacity, as individuals, to objecting to planning decisions or planning proposals.  The whole value of an amendment of this kind is that it would give An tÚdarás a standing in the whole planning process and would enable An tÚdarás to make representations&mdash;no more than that&mdash;of a planning nature in such a way as to shield individual members of An tÚdarás from the perhaps sometimes awkward consequences of having personally to make objections to a planning application.  The whole value of giving An tÚdarás a corporate role in the planning field would be precisely that it would enable them to take global decisions in relation to the overall wisdom or unwisdom of any planning application in a way that would protect individual members of An tÚdarás from accusations that they were attempting to further particular interests, local or otherwise.  Therefore, I am pressing the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is virtually self-explanatory and does not need any great argument from me in order to present it to the Minister and the House.  The Minister would show some small <Col N="1203" /> generosity if he were to accept it because it seeks to reverse the order of words in the subsection and to put &ldquo;linguistic&rdquo; before &ldquo;economic&rdquo;.  If we are serious in our belief that the fundamental objective of An tÚdarás is the linguistic objective and that the economic objective, although extremely important, is basically subservient to that linguistic objective, we should put the linguistic claim of An tÚdarás first.  I even doubt whether changing the order will have much practical significance in relation to the activities of An tÚdarás, but in terms of public relations, the way in which the work of An tÚdarás is and can be presented to the public both inside and outside the Gaeltacht, it would be a small change that would not be without significance.  I urge it on the Minister.</P>

      <P>There is no need for me to elaborate further on what Deputy Horgan has said, but there is a very fundamental principle at stake here.  I recall quite clearly that on many occasions when I had the privilege to be Minister for the Gaeltacht, people said that they were of the opinion that the accelerated economic development had a very serious adverse effect on the linguistic development of the Gaeltacht.  Everyone recognises the fact that if the Gaeltacht is to survive it is necessary to create the maximum economic activity there to stabilise the population and to provide job opportunities and so forth.</P>
      <P>Dá bhrí sin an príomh aidhm a bhéas ag Údarás na Gaeltachta ná slánú na Gaeltachta agus an teanga, agus ní dhéanfaidh an leasú seo aon athrú bunúsach.  Ach tá prionsabal i gceist anseo agus tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go mbeadh an béim i gcónaí curtha ar an teanga agus ar chúrsaí eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We last discussed this Bill on 30 November and I will take up where I left off in speaking about the planning function.  I came to the conclusion that the Higher Education Authority had had their say with the Minister on this matter and may have stated quite clearly that under section 3 of the Higher Education Act the Higher Education Authority have a function in relation to planning and financing of the third level sector.  I should be grateful for the Minister's observations on this.  I am <Col N="1210" /> satisfied that the planning function should not be in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The regional and other colleges have developed and evolved their own courses to suit different needs.  It has been a flexible and successful system, judging by the degree of employment obtained after graduation.  We should be responsive to demands for education at third level and promote a relatively loose system.  We cannot afford the duplication of resources but a certain amount of flexibility must be allowed in order to encourage initiative.  The regional colleges have grown successfully and have been very responsive to changes in society.</P>
      <P>Basically, this Bill is promoting a binary system at third level and promoting a fragmented system.  This is unfortunate.  I believe in the comprehensive system and the Minister himself is, in the long run, in favour of a comprehensive system.  He stated this when speaking on a motion on third level education.  The system now being promoted is fragmented because of the three separate partners involved in this sector.  The National Council for Educational Awards is to be established on a statutory basis.  The Higher Education Authority have been established for some time and exert a considerable amount of influence, not only within the universities but also in the NIHE in Limerick.  The HEA actually fund the NIHE in Limerick, while the NCEA award certificates, diplomas and degrees.  This illustrates the fragmented approach.  The HEA see their own overall function in relation to development and planning, and the NCEA will want their special functions to be seen to be operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A third power is at work in the non-university third level system, and this is the Department of Education.  They have complete control in relation to the finances of regional technical colleges. These colleges work fairly happily with the NCEA.  There is a most peculiar position in relation to the Dublin colleges, which have their own system of awards, yet the colleges cannot be seen to be anything other than third level colleges. According to the Minister's policy, the NCEA should have the power to <Col N="1211" /> make awards there but apparently there is some resistence.</P>
    <P>The present system is fragmented, and the Minister has lost an opportunity to unify, even to some degree, the present position in relation to the Dublin colleges, the regional technical colleges and the National Institute for Higher Education at Thomond College.  The opportunity has been lost to create a unified system in relation to financing, staffing, and the utilisation of resources.  Why should the Department of Education finance regional technical colleges, Dublin VEC colleges and Thomond College while the HEA fund the NIHE in Limerick and the National College of Art and Design?  In saying this I correct the slight error which I made on this point in column 549 of the Official Report.</P>
    <P>This is a regretful aspect of this Bill.  It does nothing to bring together the various strands involved in the administration of third-level education.  The Minister is to be faulted on this major error. If the HEA was amended as to its composition and if people from the non-university sector were brought on to the authority the HEA would be the proper vehicle through which State funds would be passed to all third level institutes and colleges.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the reservations among the non-university sector in relation to the university orientation of the HEA.  I understand this, but I see no reason why the HEA Act could not be amended so as to include people from the non-university sector.  That would certainly reduce substantially, if not eliminate, the reservations held.  Some people are in favour of the Department's funding the colleges, while others favour funding by the HEA.  I believe that the Higher Education Authority was established as the developing and funding vehicle for third level education.  That is a constructive attitude.  This Bill does not tackle that question at all.</P>
    <P>The position of the Higher Education Authority comes up twice in the Bill, and I should like the Minister to deal with this matter in his reply.  Section 3 (2)(e) says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> ... through an tÚdarás advise the Minister in relation to the cost of providing, or continuing to provide, or the financing of any study or instruction approved of by the Council....</P>
    <P>In other words the council is to advise the Minister through an tÚdarás in relation to the costs and so on.  The Higher Education Authority was established as an intermediate vehicle or contact between the National Council for Educational Awards and the Minister.  I wonder why is that; I do not know what are the arguments for it.  I would understand it if all the finances were going through the Higher Education Authority.  If that were the case the Higher Education Authority would be in direct contact with the Minister.  This suggests to me that the Minister has not thought out this Bill properly.  If An tÚdarás was the financing and planning vehicle I would understand it, but it is not; there are a number of fragmented sources.  I should be grateful for an explanation of the function and effect of An tÚdarás in the context of advising the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 16 deals with the financing of the National Council for Educational Awards, which I take to be their administration costs and is to be implemented through a grant from the Higher Education Authority.  Again, why is that when the Higher Education Authority have no effective part to play within the NCEA system?  It is another indication that the Bill was not well thought out, that no real attempt was made to rationalise the non-university system or to strive for a comprehensive system in the long-term.  Section 16 states:</P>
    <P>In each year there shall, in accordance with section 12 (2) of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, be paid by An tÚdarás to the Council, out of moneys received by it under section 12 (1) of the said Act, a grant or grants of such amount as An tÚdarás thinks fit.</P>
    <P>Why is that the case?  Are the NCEA subservient to the Higher Education Authority?  Will the Higher Education Authority manage the finances and <Col N="1213" /> budget of the NCEA?  If so, it will influence the budget of the NCEA and will impede the NCEA in carrying out their functions under this Bill, which is not to be desired.  It is most peculiar phraseology, and I should like a full explanation from the Minister.</P>
    <P>A major point arises also in the Bill relating to the awarding of degrees, the tremendous political angle about which the Minister seems so happy.  This warrants clarification.  May I take it that the Bill, as published, and when enacted, will mean that the non-university colleges and institutes will be in receipt of degrees solely from the NCEA, or will those colleges and institutes be in a position to seek and use existing awards&mdash;be they degrees, diplomas, certificates or whatever&mdash;from professional bodies or institutes outside the compass of the NCEA?  My reading of the Bill is that the colleges in the non-university sector are still allowed to seek awards from institutes other than the NCEA.  Perhaps that is a good thing; perhaps that option should be open to colleges; perhaps the competition is healthy.  I have an open mind on it.  I would prefer that the option exists for colleges and institutes to seek awards outside the NCEA.</P>
    <P>A question arises under section 3 (2) (a) (ii) of the Bill which has caused serious concern to the non-university sector relating to the examining role of the National Council for Educational Awards.  That subsection reads:</P>
    <P>have either attained a standard regarded by the Council as satisfactory in examinations or other tests of knowledge or ability set by the Council or which for the time being stand so approved of and relate to such courses or have performed in a manner regarded by the Council as satisfactory other exercises so relating and for the time being standing so approved of,</P>
    <P>This indicates that the Council will have an examining function.  I do not believe that that is correct.  It is unfortunate that that should be so.  The colleges and institutes coming under the Bill, when enacted, should have freedom to develop their own faculties and courses.  They <Col N="1214" /> should have the right to organise their own courses' content, examinations and indeed the RTCs the right to appoint their own extern examiners.  That is an independence highly cherished in the non-university sector.  I see no good reason that it should not be maintained. I believe this subsection of the Bill is obnoxious and unnecessary.  I believe it to be an attempt on the part of whoever drafted this Bill to give to the NCEA overriding powers which the Council should not have.  The National Council for Educational Awards Bill has always been seen as an awards validating council. I do not think it was ever seen as an examining council.  It should not be seen to be an examining council because if it is seen as such there would be great ill will caused among the colleges and institutes throughout the country.  I would earnestly request the Minister to have this section looked at again with a view to deleting it, and I will certainly put a motion down myself because the matter is a serious one.</P>
    <P>Another major criticism which I have of the Bill relates to the composition of the council.  In the first instance let me refer to section 1 before I discuss the composition of the council.  Section 1 states as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;an institution to which this Act applies&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the National College of Art and Design,</P>
    <P>(b) the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin,</P>
    <P>(c) the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick,</P>
    <P>(d) Thomond College of Education, Limerick,</P>
    <P>(e) any Regional Technical College,</P>
    <P>(f) any institution specified in an order made under section 20 of this Act by the Minister;</P>
    <P>There is an opinion that each regional technical college should have been specified and that the position of certain colleges should have been regularised. This should have been done.  If the Minister had the courage he could have taken the question of the Dublin colleges <Col N="1215" /> in hand and resolved the question for the long term.  I regret that he did not have this courage on this occasion.  The question of the Dublin colleges is a vexed one, and it is obvious from public readings, meetings and public utterings that there is severe friction between the Dublin City Vocational Education Committee and the Minister.  The Minister should have taken the bull by the horns and resolved and regularised the position of the Dublin colleges.  That, of course, is wound up in the whole question of the availability of non-university third-level colleges in Dublin.  It is a serious matter and one which should be tackled.  The Minister had an ideal opportunity to tackle this question under the Bill but he failed to do so.</P>
    <P>The question of the composition of the council is the next thing I want to discuss.  Let me say in the first instance that I am of the strong opinion that the director should not be a member of the National Council for Educational Awards.  A director should be seen as a person who implements policy.  Certainly he should be available to the council to give them advice on matters directly affecting the council, but he should not be a member of the council.  I am quite satisfied that that is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>Section 10 indicates that the director is being given inordinate powers.  It is the first Bill that I have ever seen in the House which enshrines the name of a person in it as a director or as a functionary. I do not know what precedent there is for it.  I assume there is some precedent.  Section 10 (2) states:</P>
    <P>The person first appointed to be director shall be Pádraig Uasal Mac Diarmada.</P>
    <P>I wonder how many people there are of that name in the country.  I am sure there is more than one, and which of them is intended in the Bill?  There is a Pádraig Uasal Mac Diarmada who is the present acting director of the council, and I take it that he is the person intended, but certainly the Bill is faulty in its text.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes and it could be he.  Being a Cavan man, I would say he would have a very good chance of being appointed.  However, the drafting of that subsection should be changed, and I would suggest&mdash;and I will suggest on Committee Stage&mdash;that the Bill should read &ldquo;the person first appointed to be the director shall be the present acting director of the council&rdquo;.  That should be a simple formula and should meet the requirements of this section.</P>
      <P>Section 10 (3) (a) refers to the powers of the director.</P>
      <P>The Director shall, in accordance with any direction given to him in that behalf by the council, control and direct the activities of the council and staff of the council.</P>
      <P>That is a most extraordinary power to give any director.</P>
      <P>The Director shall, in accordance with any direction give to him in that behalf by the council&mdash;</P>
      <P>which is peculiar phraseology anyway&mdash;</P>
      <P>control and direct the activities of the council and the staff of the council.</P>
      <P>This seems to be the reverse of what should be happening.  A council should control the direct activities of the director. Maybe the director wrote this Bill, but it does not seem to be the correct position in relation to what should appertain as regards the relationship between the council and the director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now move from the question of the powers of the director to the composition of the council itself.  As I said, I believe that the director should not be a member of the council.  He should be seen to be a chief executive of the council, and he should act on the instruction and at the discretion of the council in decision-making in the council.  He should certainly have the facility for discussing matters with the council.  I do not see why he should be a member of the council, and I will be moving an amendment to ensure that he is not a member of the council.  It is just bad management.  There is a chief executive to carry out instructions, to carry out general policy and specific policy; that is <Col N="1217" /> the correct position, and there is no need for the director to be a member of the council.</P>
    <P>Concerning the composition of the council, the first and obvious omission is the absence of a representative of the National College of Art and Design. That is a most glaring omission.  This is the premier body involved in the national policy of art and design here.  It is quite obvious that the colleges should have a representative on the council.  I stated on 30 November that I would be moving an amendment to ensure that the NCAD would be represented directly on the council.</P>
    <P>The second omission, which I consider an important one, is the lack of student representation on the council.  I believe that at third level there should be student representation on policy making bodies, and in relation to the NCEA I believe there should be at least one student representative on the council.  I would suggest that the simplest method of achieving that aim would be to state in the Bill that the Union of Students in Ireland would nominate a member of the council.</P>
    <P>There should be rapport between the institutions and the people who use them, particularly the students.  At third level there is no reason for students not being anxious to play a constructive role in evolving policy and in the evolution of non-university education.  Admittedly under subsection (1) (a) of section 5 the Minister may appoint students to the board but students should, as of right, have representation, and the simplest manner of ensuring this is to specify in the section the USI.</P>
    <P>The general balance of the council leaves much to be desired.  I do not agree with the provision that four members be appointed by NIHE Limerick or by NIHE Dublin.  I would prefer a good spread of representation.  There is no reason for one person not being appointed by NIHE Limerick and one being appointed by NIHE Dublin or, indeed, by Thomond College.  I am satisfied, though, with the appointment of one from the universities.  Again, there is a glaring omission in respect of the Dublin colleges in relation to the RTC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> There is not any specified recognition of their right to appoint a member to the council.  Because of the importance of the Dublin colleges, they should be represented.  I would prefer a provision whereby a member would be appointed by each of the regional colleges.  There are not very many of them, and I do not think that to have them represented would upset the balance of the council, but it would preserve a sense of involvement among the regional technical colleges who would then have a direct link with the council.  Consequently, they could partake directly in the discussions and the deliberations of the council.  That is an important principle.  Even now RTC authorities are concerned about the preference that might be given to a college because of its being represented on the council.</P>
    <P>The easiest way of ensuring fair play is to have a representative from each regional technical college and by having a representative from all the colleges and institutions to which this legislation will apply.  We are a small country.  We are talking in terms of, perhaps, 15 different colleges and institutions.  There should not be any attempt on the part of anyone to deny representation to any college or institution.  In order to allow for such representation, the number provided for on the council could be changed. Perhaps a council made up of a chairman, a director and 23 other members is adequate.  I agree with the Minister having the right to appoint a number of members direct to the council. This is an important function on his part, and I am convinced that in any such appointment he would have as his primary aim the interest of education. Indeed, it is necessary that he be in a position to appoint distinguished persons to the council in addition to what one might call representative members.</P>
    <P>The lack of provision for the appointment of a registrar is a serious omission, especially when one is talking of a council as important as this who will be responsible for overseeing development in the non-university sector and who will be involved in the awarding of large numbers of certificates, diplomas and degrees.  They will be undertaking <Col N="1219" /> national policy in respect of the non-university sector.  It is only proper that records of decisions reached and of action taken be safeguarded, and the proper way of ensuring this is by the establishing of an office of registrar.  This is a practice that is well-established among large academic bodies.  I shall be moving an amendment in an effort to put right this omission in the legislation. That amendment will not be political in any way.  It will simply take the form of asking the Minister to establish an office that is seen to be obvious in the context of the functioning of the NCEA.</P>
    <P>The position concerning membership of the council is interesting.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to go into detail on the sections.  I shall endeavour to speak in general on the Bill.  I understand the provision in section 7 whereby anybody who is not ordinarily resident in the State cannot qualify for membership of the council, and I understand also the same provision in respect of members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, I do not agree with those who argue that there should not be any bar to membership.  The provision, too, in relation to an undischarged bankrupt is understandable, but the provision in paragraph (d) is rather odd as it reads.  It provides that a person shall not be eligible for membership of the council if within the immediate preceding period of three years he has made a composition or arrangement with his creditors.  I know many people who have made either a composition or arrangement with their creditors.  I see nothing wrong with that.  I take it that what is intended is the exclusion of anyone who has made a composition or arrangement with his creditors under backruptcy law.  The wording of the subsection is rather funny to say the least of it and should be changed.  The bankruptcy laws should be mentioned.  Section 7 (e) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> ... within the immediately preceding period of five years he has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment by a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>A person was jailed for seven days for not paying his television licence because it was not printed in Irish. According to paragraph (e) that person would be debarred from becoming a member of the council if he was so jailed for seven days within the preceding five years.  A specified period of imprisonment should be made, as has been the practice, and paragraph (e) should read:</P>
    <P>within the immediately preceding period of five years he has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment by a court of competent jurisdiction for a period of not less than six months.</P>
    <P>There is one other peculiar omission which relates to an insane person. Apparently if you are insane you can be a member of the council.  I do not think this is intended, and perhaps an additional paragraph (f) should be inserted stating that if a person is insane or is certified insane he should not be allowed be a member of the council, unless the Minister wishes to have an insane person on the council, which I doubt.  The same qualifications in section 7 also relate to a certain extent to section 8 (6) and would, consequently, need amending.</P>
    <P>The director should have a retirement age of 65 like most other officers in the civil service.  He should not be like Idi Amin and be director for life.  I do not think the Minister intended that.  There should be a compulsory age for retirement, and I suggest 65 which is the age most wise people decide to retire from a very active scene.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 (4) (a) the question of the protection of staff arises.  It is important that the staff should be protected and that they should not have to be performing duties at the whim of the council. It is important, especially in relation to transferred staff, that they should not be engaged or involved in tasks other than those for which they were originally intended.  Problems of superannuation for transferred staff may also arise. <Col N="1221" /> Some may prefer to receive a gratuity in lieu of superannuation upon being transferred to the new council.  This is a technical matter which was brought to my attention.</P>
    <P>The question of standards has arisen under the Bill in respect of degrees.  In section 3 (2) (b) (ii) in relation to degrees the phrase: &ldquo;corresponds or is analogous to any relevant standards for the time being in force in universities&rdquo; is used. What universities are meant by that? Are they Irish, English or European universities? In section 9 (4) (g) in relation to standards the phraseology: &ldquo;shall have regard to any corresponding standard required by a university in the State&rdquo; is used.  The council may be pursuing courses which are not available in a university and may have to adopt other standards.  A better phraseology would have been obtained if the words &ldquo;standards should be those which are nationally and internationally recognised&rdquo; in respect of a discipline were used.  That is a simpler and more meaningful phraseology in the context of the NCEA and the non-university sector. A phrase like the one I have just used is a clearer phrase because you are not necessarily referring to university courses but to professional and craftsmen's courses and to new courses which may not be available to either a professional or university institute.  The phraseology used in respect of standards is an important matter, and the words used in the Bill are unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) specifies a number of areas:</P>
    <P>... technical, industrial, scientific, technological and commercial education provided outside the universities, whether professional, vocational or technical, and in association with the aforesaid education to encourage and promote liberal education.</P>
    <P>That subsection lacks a number of references, for example, to complementary studies and art and design.  The words &ldquo;art and design&rdquo; have been omitted, and that is a serious omission in view of the existence of the National College of Art and Design.  Legal studies, catering, applied humanities, public administration, business and <Col N="1222" /> management education and agricultural studies are all areas which the NCEA are involved in, and yet there is no specific reference to them in subsection (1).  It is a glaring omission.  In drafting a Bill of this nature greater care should have been taken to ensure that all the disciplines and courses of study were spelled out in greater detail.  The Bill is all the weaker for this.</P>
    <P>It is a sloppy Bill, as I said before.  I will be putting down a long list of amendments in an effort to correct this.  I regret that the fragmented state of third level education in Ireland will remain. The Minister made no attempt to come to grips with a comprehensive system of third level education in both the non-university and the university sectors.  A great opportunity was lost.  This is an important Bill which will affect the non-university sector for many years to come.  The Minister would have received the plaudits of this House if he had tackled the real problems of third level education and the stopping of the fragmentation which exists.  In not doing so, I believe that he is doing justice neither to himself nor to his Department. I am not opposing it on Second Stage, but I shall have a long list of amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a trojan horse of a Bill.  On the face of it nothing could appear simpler than to introduce a piece of legislation to give statutory existence to an organisation which has had a fruitful and <i>ad hoc</i> existence for several years. There is much more to the Bill than ratifying the present status of the National Council for Educational Awards or restoring to that Council the facilities to award degrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some of its small print&mdash;and some of its print is very small indeed&mdash;the Bill has implications for some parts of the third-level sector in education that go beyond the Government's election commitment in this regard and open up many new fields for querying what precisely the long-term intentions are in relation to third-level education outside the universities.  It is obvious that the Minister, when he was Opposition spokesman for education, was under the <Col N="1223" /> impression that the business of not just restoring to the NCEA their degree-awarding powers but of establishing them on a statutory basis was something which could be accomplished at the stroke of a pen.</P>
    <P>The Government's election manifesto announced that it would immediately establish the NCEA by statute.  I do not know what happened after the Government assumed office to delay the necessary preparation of the Bill.  It may be that the Minister discovered that things were not as simple as he thought they were; indeed, we have his word for it that he took a personal interest in the progress of this Bill during its drafting and made weekly inquiries about it.</P>
    <P>There was a strange contrast between the delay in producing the Bill and the speed with which in November last the Minister expected us to take it.  As far as I recall, I did not object at that time but I thought it was anomalous that the Minister should have spent the better part of the year and a half producing the Bill and then expect us to take it nine days after its publication.  I was all the more suspicious of this tactic because of the absence of an explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill.  If any Bill needs an explanatory memorandum it is this one, not necessarily for Deputy Collins or myself.  In so far as this Bill is going to affect the institutional structures and the working conditions of people involved in the entire third-level educational system outside the universities, it is less than good enough of the Minister to produce a document the basic intent of which is swathed in the traditional jargon of the parliamentary draftsman.  I suspect that the Minister would go down in history if he could ever produce a piece of legislation that was written in plain English or in plain Irish.  It is not impossible in other legislatures&mdash;the American one is a classic example.  I sometimes think that we are too hamstrung by the British tradition of parliamentary drafting. Hamstrung or not, we are stuck with it for the time being.</P>
    <P>The Minister was less than generous when he sought to defend his decision <Col N="1224" /> not to produce an explanatory memorandum for the Bill.  He remarked, no doubt in the heat of the moment, that if the National Coalition Government had produced any education legislation of any substance we might be in a better position.  The implication is that because there was no substantial education legislation from the National Coalition Government this was in some sense an excuse for the absence of the document which in courtesy is produced with most major pieces of legislation.  That courtesy was not extended to the House on that occasion.  It is now three months since the Bill was first introduced.  The Minister could have instructed his officials to produce an explanatory memorandum during that period, and I am quite sure that it would have been within their competence to do so regardless of the volume or otherwise of the legislation thrust upon them by the National Coalition Government.  That we have not got it three months later is a sign of discourtesy to the many people who will be affected by the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is essentially a Committee Stage Bill.  I do not want to weary the House unduly on matters of detail, but there are a few observations which should be made at this stage.  The first observation, which has already been made, relates to the naming of the first director in the Bill.  I am aware that there is a precedent for this, probably in the 1908 Universities Act, for some kind of carry-over of function relating to somebody who was a member of one organisation that has been superseded by another and given a statutory basis.  This section of the Bill is less than clear, and it would have taken very little to clarify it.  Deputy Collins wondered how many Pádraig Mac Diarmadas there were in the country.  I can tell him that none of them appears to be on the telephone, because there is not a single Pádraig Mac Diarmada in either the city or the country part of the telephone directory.  There are 14 Patrick McDermotts in Dublin and three in the country, and he can take his choice from that.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect relating to that which should be mentioned.  I find it an oddity but perhaps the Minister can <Col N="1225" /> tell me why it should not be so.  Apart from naming the director, there are no provisions for his remuneration, for his dismissal or for his retirement.  This seems to be unusual.  In terms of the public service generally it is not desirable.  In politics we operate on the basis that none of us is indispensable. The same is true effectively of the public service.  This is a principle which should be firmly stated in the Bill in relation to such an important person as a director.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to find in November when we were beginning to discuss this Bill that, owing to some oversight which I am glad to say has since been rectified, the <i>ad hoc</i> National Council for Educational Awards had not made any of its annual reports available in the Library of the House.  Apart from that, the NCEA with its <i>ad hoc</i> basis has performed a very difficult job, which was affected by changes in Government policy from time to time, with considerable application, and its members and the members of its boards of studies have given very generously of their time to the creation, organisation and rationalisation of a system of third level education outside the universities which can, and I am sure will, continue to hold its own with similar systems of education anywhere.</P>
    <P>There are two main aspects in relation to the principle of the Bill that need to be mentioned.  The first is a simple one, to make the National Council for Educational Awards a statutory body. There is no disagreement about that in this House.  The second relates to the restoration to the NCEA of the power to award degrees.  This decision relates in turn to another decision which is implicit in the Bill, and that is to plan at Governmental level for the development of third level education on a binary basis.  Deputy Collins has expressed his regret that the Minister did not choose the comprehensive option.  It is certainly true that in choosing the binary option the Minister has explicitly&mdash;he got the endorsement of the electorate for this, in a sense&mdash;rejected the comprehensive option chosen by the previous administration.</P>
    <P>I suspect the Minister will agree that a <Col N="1226" /> cogent intellectual argument can be made for either form of development of third level education and that the final decision is possibly not one which is made initially in principle but on the basis of the particular circumstances of the case, the particular problems that institutions and the people who run them face in Ireland today.  The decision by the previous Government to opt for the comprehensive system was taken in 1974.  Late in 1975 I became a member of a party which supported that Government. I think anybody who scrutinises the pages of the journal I edited during that period will be under no illusion about my position and that in a sense&mdash;and this is true of anybody who joins any political party&mdash;one joins some political parties in spite of some decision they have taken rather than because of it.</P>
    <P>I believed then and I still believe that on balance&mdash;and it is a very close balance&mdash;the binary system probably offers the best model for the development of third level education generally in this country for some time ahead.  Our non-university sector is a thriving youngster, but still a youngster.  It needs to grow and develop on its own terms.  It needs to develop its particular strength, to sort out and solve the teething problems that may affect it.  Then, hopefully, we might in the future be able to talk realistically again about the prospects of a comprehensive third level system.  If that situation came to pass we would be talking about a comprehensive third level system on the basis of equality of partnership.  There would be a great danger&mdash;a danger not entirely absent from the present Bill&mdash;that in a premature comprehensive system the non-university sector, partly because of institutional weakness, partly because of financial weakness and partly because of the ever present danger of academic escalation would find itself sucked into the university aura and its special strength and special charisms attenuated and ultimately negatived by the influence of a university system which does its own thing very well but which is not necessarily doing everything that a third level education system needs to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1227" /> I suspect, in spite of the fact that the decision to restore degree awarding powers to the NCEA was effectively a part of the Government's pre-election commitment, that it was not really an election issue and that here, as in so many other cases, it is the interplay of interest groups and politicians on a comparatively small basis that often form the basis for wide-ranging decisions relating to future development in education or elsewhere.  It was a natural corollary of the Government's decision to opt for the binary system that they should restore degree-awarding powers to the NCEA, and I hope that the binary system which the Government are intent on statutorily recognising here and, hopefully, developing financially with adequate resources will always be an open one, one in which the university and the non-university sector of our third level system remain open to each other, not one in which the virus of academic escalation takes root or in which the two parts of the system will close in upon each other.</P>
    <P>There are two other basic points of principle to which I would like to refer. The first relates to the overwhelmingly institutional character of the Bill.  It deals with institutions; it empowers the NCEA to deal with institutions.  It designates institutes. It does not take sufficient or any cognisance of the fact that there may be situations in which in order to do full justice to the development of third level education there may be some institutions which might not be designated by the Minister but which organise courses which the NCEA might see fit to recognise.</P>
    <P>In section 3 of the Bill there is reference to the recognition of degrees, diplomas, certificates or other educational awards.  It states that the council may:</P>
    <P>confer, grant or give degrees, diplomas, certificates or other educational awards to or on persons who&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) the Council is satisfied have attended or otherwise pursued or followed courses of study or instruction conducted by, or provided <Col N="1228" /> under the supervision of, an institution to which this Act applies....</P>
    <P>In the definition section we are given a list of the institutions to which this Act applies.  Generally speaking the institutions concerned are technological institutions teaching at third level.  Unless I am mistaken, there is already at least one institution to which this Act does not apply and to which the Minister has not given any indication of designation, which has been in touch with the <i>ad hoc</i> National Council for Educational Awards and which has had a course validated by the NCEA.  I am referring to the Irish School of Ecumenics which as far as I know has recognition for a qualification in ecumenical theology. This is a classic example of an institution which does not need to be designated by the Minister but which has the right to apply to the NCEA for validation of a particular course.  There may be many other such institutions.  I am concerned at this point that the Minister should not close the door to the possibility that any such institution, without having to go through the perhaps complicated necessity of being designated by the Minister officially by order, should be able to submit courses that they consider of appropriate standard to the NCEA and have them validated by that council.</P>
    <P>The other main point that might be made at this juncture is that there does not seem to be any restriction in the Bill in regard to the work of the NCEA effectively being carried on at third level. There is no specific reference to third level education as such or third level institutions as such.  There are one or two references which could be open to the interpretation that the NCEA could, if they so wished, or if the Minister permitted, extend their activities downwards into second level, perhaps even taking over the leaving certificate.  That might not be an unmixed blessing, but I wonder what the Minister has in mind as a possibility for the NCEA.  This is what I mean when I say that the Bill is something of a Trojan horse.  There are all sorts of grey areas; all sorts of portmanteau powers are being given to the NCEA and we do not know whether the Minister intends seriously giving them <Col N="1229" /> this kind of power or whether he is aware that this section of the Bill might be open to the kind of interpretation.</P>
    <P>I turn to the question of the function of the NCEA and their powers.  Here one must express some reservation about the very wide nature of the powers being given to the NCEA, particularly in relation to the regional technical colleges. Section 3 (1) of the Bill says:</P>
    <P>The functions of the Council shall be generally to encourage, facilitate, promote, co-ordinate and develop technical, industrial, scientific, technological and commercial education provided outside the universities, whether professional, vocational or technical, and in association with the aforesaid education to encourage and promote liberal education.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of that section goes into considerable detail about the council's functions but it is prefaced by a sentence which says:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section,...</P>
    <P>That means effectively that, even if the council want to do something which is not specifically authorised under subsection (2), it is their business to appeal to subsection (1).  It might have been simpler to put in an entirely new subsection saying that the council may do almost anything they like, because effectively that is the implication of that first phrase in subsection (2), and that phrase has enormous implications for the development of third level education, especially in the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>Mention has already been made of the long-standing debate about exactly how far the powers of the NCEA extend. Deputy Collins, before he moved the adjournment before Christmas, noted that the power to plan third level education outside a university was not included. This afternoon he has gone on record as saying that he thinks that the power to plan would not be an appropriate power to give to a reconstituted NCEA.  The Union of Students in Ireland have advocated the planning function for the NCEA, but I also believe that this function would not be appropriate for the <Col N="1230" /> council in the general context in which they are being asked to play a part in the development of third level education. The Irish Federation of University Teachers in their policy statement on the NCEA issued on 23 November commented on this issue as follows:</P>
    <P>IFUT believes that there is a need for a single body which is competent and has the authority to plan the development of 3rd level education in both the university and non-university sector.  It further believes that the Higher Education Authority, suitably modified, is the appropriate body to undertake this role.  In order to carry out this enlarged function properly it will be necessary that the authority undergoes a significant expansion of its facilities.  In addition it will be necessary that the membership of the Authority be adjusted to take account of its expanded role.</P>
    <P>A corollary of this proposal is that the NCEA would revert to its original role as an academic validating body for the non-university sector.</P>
    <P>One can agree with the federation that the basic function of the NCEA should be a validating one and, I would add, a co-ordinating one, without necessarily agreeing that in present circumstances at any rate and as presently constituted the HEA should be the planning authority for higher education in this country.  I tend to believe that the Minister, advised by the Department of Education and the HEA, is probably the best planning authority for higher education here.  I am speaking in general terms, not specific terms, because I believe that there can and ought to be a creative tension and dialogue between the HEA, the Department and the Minister for Education in relation to resource allocation for higher education.  In that dialogue the voice of the NCEA would not be entirely absent, but its main input would be on the co-ordination and validation side.  It is, of course, effectively impossible for the Minister properly to plan the development of third level education without paying attention to the views of the NCEA on co-ordination and validation, and I have no doubt that any responsible Minister will do at least as much.  I will <Col N="1231" /> come back later to the question of the regional technical colleges when I talk about the question of the composition of the council.</P>
    <P>There is one single problem which the Minister does not appear to have cleared up by this Bill, and it will continue to fester until he solves it.  The problem is, that for all the attempted rationalisation that we had in this Bill we still have a situation in which as a matter of policy teacher qualifications will now be validated formally by two different validating bodies.  The teachers who come from Thomond College in Limerick will receive an NCEA validation for their degrees, and most if not all of the other teachers will receive university validation for their academic and professional qualifications.  This goes way back to 1968 when a tribunal established by the then Government and headed by Professor Ryan went into, among other things, the whole question of teacher remuneration and made a recommendation which broke parity between the teachers of the traditional, as they are rather slightingly called, hand and eye subjects&mdash;as if one could utilise one's hands and eyes without using one's brain&mdash;and the teachers who worked on the more academic side.  A predecessor of the present Minister, Deputy Faulkner, suggested in 1971 that the NCEA should perhaps validate all teacher educational qualifications or at least that they should all be validated in the same way.  We have here a failure to grasp that situation, which has, of course, implications in terms of paying teachers an appropriate wage, a situation which will help to put off the day when we will have a unified teaching profession, which is something that should not be delayed any longer than necessary, because it is something which will have a powerful influence on the development of national policy in relation to education and expenditure on education.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to the question of standards to be expected for the degrees which are to be awarded by the National Council for Educational Awards after the passing of this Bill.  The <Col N="1232" /> Minister in his original contribution pointed out that the advice of the Higher Educational Authority was to the effect that the establishment of a national council for educational awards should be accompanied by the safeguard that the standard of the diplomas and degrees awarded by them be in no way inferior to those of the universities.  This is a kind of educational provincialism which implies that universities are the be-all and end-all of our educational aspirations and qualifications, and that we have to match up to the universities if we are to get any credence at all for anything we do outside.  It was almost inevitable that the Higher Education Authority, given their composition, tended to take this point of view.  I am sorry to see a Minister virtually adopting the same point of view and suggesting in circumstances where the comparison may not be relevant at all that we should match one kind of qualification against another.  The idea that the university degree is the pinnacle of perfection is a 19th century attitude which we should have outgrown by now.  We now know better the strengths of the non-university system and how to retain them.  It is particularly anomalous that the Bill should imply that sub-degree work should be in some sense comparable to university standards.  The universities have traditionally paid very little attention to sub-degree work.  They rarely have diplomas or certificates that are studied for by any substantial number of their students.  We are being asked here to tie the National Council for Educational Awards and their standards to standards which the universities have by and large not thought appropriate to even define. There may be an argument for allowing a certain correspondence at the degree level, but even here we must be careful, because over the years the curricular and syllabus content of many of our non-university degree level courses has diverged quite substantially for very good vocational and occupational reasons from the content courses organised by and held in the universities which are similarly titled.  We must be very slow to allow the universities to continue or to extend hegemony in this area.  The Bill will bear very close looking <Col N="1233" /> at in that regard at a later stage.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in relation to the Dublin situation.  Educationally the Dublin situation is something of a can of worms at the moment.  There is so much uisce fé thalamh about it that it is rather difficult for the outsider to discern either the intentions of the various institutions involved in relation to the future organisation of higher education in Dublin or more importantly the intentions of the Minister.  The Minister has in this Bill given himself the power to sort out the problem in part by designating colleges, but he has not given us any indication of how he proposes to do this or whether he proposes to designate any of the major institutions which we are talking about under this Bill.  We are literally being asked to sign a blank cheque for the Minister in relation to the co-ordination and planning of higher education in Dublin.  Just how blank a cheque it is can be seen by the fact that as the Bill is presently constituted the Minister has the power to designate colleges not presently designated without giving them any statutory right to representation on the council.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that he will never do such a thing; he may say he has the right to appoint persons to the council and that naturally he would not designate any college without making sure they had an appropriate degree of representation on the National Council for Educational Awards, but the Minister has only nine places on the National Council for Educational Awards and the calls on those places are mounting daily.  There is no way in which the Minister can possibly reconcile all the demands, many of them very valid demands, and at the same time stick to his limited nine places.  That must be looked at as well.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Dublin problem, which is general and a classic symptom of which has been the refusal of the vocational colleges in all but a few cases to submit courses to the NCEA for validation.  There is the other problem that some of the vocational third-level institutions have been submitting courses to university institutions&mdash;and one in particular&mdash;for validation.  A <Col N="1234" /> question has been raised both inside and outside this House as to whether the Minister intends to stop this.  I have examined this question in some detail and it appears that it is impossible for the Minister, within currently accepted definitions of the meaning of university autonomy, to prevent any university institution in this country from recognising any course they choose, whether or not it is provided by an institution designated under this Bill.  There is one thing the Minister can do; he has quite recently given himself the power to do it. He can refuse to recognise such courses for grant purposes.</P>
    <P>When some time ago we passed the innocent looking Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Bill, 1978, I examined the wording because it seemed to represent a change from the original Bill in a substantive aspect.  Whereas before the passage of that Bill any university degree-level course was automatically eligible for grant purposes, after the passage of this Bill no university degree-level course is eligible for a grant unless the Minister specifically says it is so eligible.  This effectively gives the Minister the possibility of choking off the development of such courses and of such links between university and non-university institutions without interfering with university autonomy.  He simply declines to recognise the course for grant purposes for students who would otherwise be entitled.  If I am right in my original suspicions, this is why the original Bill was passed in that form and why it came to us before this Bill.  If this Bill had come to us first we would have seen more clearly the implications of the other Bill.</P>
    <P>In this discussion of the relationship between the university and non-university sectors, there is one critical question.  It is particularly critical in the light of the option to take the binary course.  That is the question of whether or not, and the degree to which, students can transfer between institutions in the technological sector and between such institutions and the universities.</P>
    <P>During his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I consider it also extremely important that arrangements should be <Col N="1235" /> worked out to facilitate the transfer of students as appropriate from one institution to another and the co-ordination of courses between the regional technical colleges and the national institutes for higher education, as well as where appropriate the National College of Art and Design, and, in certain instances, the universities, to facilitate the students and secure the maximum opportunities for advancement throughout the whole range of third-level education.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more with this statement by the Minister but I must express the doubt and concern that it represents little more at this stage than a pious aspiration.  It is an aspiration we all share but it is on the implementation of that aspiration, whether by the Minister or the NCEA or by whomsoever, that this decision to establish the binary system will stand or fall.  At present there is virtually no statutory mechanism which will enable the NCEA, even under this Bill, to achieve the necessary degree of collaboration from the universities so that there can be transfers not only from the technological to the university sector but also, and perhaps in some cases more importantly, in the reverse direction so as to ensure that the talent and brains of this country are not wasted because people have been put into an educational <i>cul de sac</i> at the age of 17 or 18.  We must not burn bridges between the two sectors but rather build bridges, but not on the basis of a slavish adherence to a nineteenth-century, old fashioned idea of the supremacy of the universities.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of the competition and the representability of the NCEA.  Shortly after the Bill was published the Minister received a letter from a friend saying it was the best possible Bill and would be more lasting than Brown's.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say about the letter in question is that it was probably <Col N="1236" /> written on the basis of a very cursory examination of the Bill because the Minister seemed to receive it very soon after the Bill was published.</P>
      <P>We face one very important point of principle and that is whether the NCEA should be a representative body.  There are different models here for our examination. The original model for the HEA, for example, was deliberately set up in such a way that even though people were appointed to the HEA who were members of the staff or adminstration of particular institutions falling under the general purview of the authority, they did not represent the institutions from which they came and they were so instructed by the Minister of the day in his inaugural statement.  That is one option. The other option is that an authority or council is set up to which people are not only appointed from particular institutions but on which they are expected, allowed and even encouraged to represent the point of view of their own institutions.</P>
      <P>I have difficulties with the representative idea for a couple of reasons.  First of all, the NCEA is precisely that; it is a national council and it is not a parliament. Secondly, there is the real difficulty of ensuring the degree of representativity which would be appropriate if it were to be a fully representative council of education at third level, outside the universities.  Although I think some compromise can probably be worked out, my initial reaction would be more in favour of the council idea rather than the representative idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that on some occasions in the internal workings of the HEA certain members of that authority were not entirely immune to the temptation of representing institutional interests but&mdash;and this is important&mdash;they were not appointed by the Higher Education Authority on the recommendation of that institution.  Therefore, the decision as to whether or not they represented the interests of that institution in the internal councils of the Higher Education Authority was basically a matter for themselves.  We are setting up a system here providing that a substantial majority <Col N="1237" /> of the members of the National Council for Educational Awards are going to be appointed on the recommendation of one institution or another.  It would be very difficult for persons so appointed to reject the institutional claims of the institution from which they came in the name of the greater good of the development of third-level technological education in general.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his original speech that the original members were not being appointed to promote individual interests of any separate institution, that their allegiance was to the council, and not to the institution on the recommendation of which they may have been appointed by the Government. Later on in his speech he said that his concern was that the provisions in the Bill would make for a well balanced and competent council representative of the main areas of professional and academic activities involved.  The Minister may fail here in that he is trying to have it both ways.  On the one hand, he is introducing a principle of representativity by inviting institutions to nominate members to the council.  On the other hand he is saying: nominated or not, when you get there, you have to forget the fact that you have been effectively nominated or elected by the institution. To put it mildly, it is putting a strain on people to ask them to try and ride both those horses simultaneously.  I wonder whether the Minister's attempt to steer a middle course in this will succeed. It might be better&mdash;and no doubt he will be thinking about this between now and Committee Stage&mdash;for him to go back to the old Higher Education Authority formulation.  If he does not, if he insists on maintaining this para-representative quality of the council, then we open up a much wider area for debate.  That is the area in which there have been already very many statements by people who feel, with considerable justification, that they have not been given a fair crack of the whip in terms of representation.</P>
    <P>The first such complaint came from the Board of the National College of Art and Design, a board appointed only very <Col N="1238" /> recently by the Minister and headed by somebody who is no doubt a friend and mentor of his, Professor John O'Meara. It was a tribute both to the Minister, to the calibre of his appointees to this board, and especially to the chairman, that he should not have felt inhibited in any way from making the statement that he did.  Indeed he is a former mentor of mine.  From what I know of him I would not have expected anything else on a matter of principle.  It is rare enough in those days that moral courage of that kind is shown, and it should be seen for what it is.  There were already signs in his Second Reading speech that the Minister was conscious that there was a certain legitimacy in this claim.  He has already, at least in principle, opened the door to changing the composition or to perhaps giving statutory recognition to the right of the National College of Art and Design to membership on the council.</P>
    <P>Various other institutions have complained about the lack of representation. For example, the Association of Vocational Education Colleges has complained that there is no representation for it, as of right, on the National Council for Educational Awards as we have in this Bill.  The Minister would have to take all of these complaints&mdash;and some of them are very valid ones&mdash;into account when he is making his appointments. Here, however, we come back to the fact that he has nine only out of 25. He will have to think seriously about the overall structure of the council if he is to ensure that, given the principle of representativity which, in a sense he is introducing in this Bill, he will afford membership of the council to all organisations and institutions which can legitimately feel they have a role to play. A particular case has been made in this regard by the regional technical colleges. There is one aspect of that claim I do not think has been sufficiently adverted to. Section 5 (2) of the Bill suggests that before making a recommendation as regards an appointment by the Government under this section&mdash;that is the ministerial nine&mdash;the Minister should consider to what extent industry, agriculture, fisheries, commerce, any of the professions, or the staff or students <Col N="1239" /> of regional technical colleges need representation on the council.  The irony of this, quite apart from the fact that he will have to find a great many more places than nine perhaps if he is going to meet all these needs, is that the statutory recognition&mdash;which is being given to various institutions in relation to the appointment of members&mdash;relates to the management body of these institutions, not to their staff or students.  If the Minister is going to give representation to the management bodies of the various institutions designated and non-designated, such as the universities, it seems only fair that he should be open to the importance and necessity of supplying some kind of adequate recognition or place for the management of the regional technical colleges.  I do not mean by saying this to exclude the legitimate rights of staff members and of students.  In passing I would say that the principle of student involvement in the overall national development and administration of higher education in this country has been universally successful since it was first introduced.  It is not so long ago since it was first introduced.  It is fair to say that when the claims were made for representation, whether on the governing bodies of the universities or indeed on the original <i>ad hoc</i> NCA itself there were quite a few faint hearts who anticipated that all these revolting students would do would be to throw stink bombs, generally disrupting the affairs of a serious and responsible body.  The intervening period has shown that student involvement in higher education on an administrative level is as we might have expected, and certainly is as I would have expected, commensurate with the degree of importance for the students concerned of the whole higher education system.  It has been an act of faith, if you like, in the principle of student involvement and representation, perhaps a minimal one, but certainly one which has worked very well in practice.</P>
    <P>I tend to disagree with Deputy Collins' suggestion that the restriction of membership of the council to persons who are normally resident in the State is an appropriate one.  I do not disbelieve <Col N="1240" /> for a moment that we can supply adequate personnel in this country to act as members of such a council, to staff it and run it, but we should not be too provincial about it.  If a certain admixture of expertise from abroad were to be thought useful there should not be a legal bar on the Minister appointing such a person to the council.</P>
    <P>If, for example, the present president of the Union of Students in Ireland were to be appointed to such a council we might have an ironic situation, in that the present president of the Union of Students in Ireland is effectively a non-national or attended a third level education institution which is not only not technological but a university and outside the confines of the State and might therefore be in some sense adjudged in-appropriate for membership of the council. I do not think anybody in this House would like to see that kind of problem arising.</P>
    <P>There is another particular difficulty in relation to membership which I will mention before leaving this section, and that is the confining in section 5 (2) to the staff and students of regional technical colleges.  If as seems at least possible&mdash;and I repeat we should have some indication of the Minister's intention in this regard&mdash;any or all of the higher education institutions in Dublin run by the Vocational Education Committees are designated under this Bill and are designated without explicit representation on the council one would need to alter or at least widen the scope of this subsection to include vocational colleges as well as regional technical colleges to ensure that the Minister could appoint them in any way in which he saw fit.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the Committee Stage of this Bill will be a fairly lengthy one.  I welcome it for some of the things it does. Some of the other things that it purports to do are by no means clear.  Some of them may not be necessary, and above all the Minister will have to clarify his mind and this Bill on the question of whether or not the council is to be a representative body or not, because if it is to be representative&mdash;and this seems to be the way his mind is going&mdash;we will have to have a far wider spread of interest <Col N="1241" /> so that the really vital, young and growing parts of the technological education sector are not stifled by an academic or institutional top-heaviness. Like Deputy Collins I shall be preparing amendments to the Bill in due course. This party certainly does not intend to vote against it at this stage and, while we are sorry that the Bill took so long to prepare, we are glad to see it, and I would argue that by the time that it leaves this House it will be a monument not to the Minister but to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I want to thank Deputies Horgan and Collins for their contributions.  I notice that Deputy Collins, while not coming down fully on the side of comprehensive third level education before Christmas, did say today that he was in favour of full comprehensive third level education.  Deputy Horgan on the other hand stated at one stage when editing the quite prestigious <i>Education Times</i> that he was in favour of the comprehensive approach and he now backs the binary system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the opposite.  With respect, a Cheann Comhairle, the point I was making was that my point of view before I joined the Labour Party was that I was in favour of a binary system but that point of view was expressed in the columns of that paper at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  I was very pleased to hear the contribution by Deputy Horgan, because it is a rather unfruitful thing to dedicate oneself to binarism or any other ism but as Deputy Horgan outlined his views today, namely, that the technological area is young and growing, that it needs time to build up its muscle, that there would be a danger of its being smothered by the traditional third level education institutions, I am in total accord with the Deputy in his thinking there.  I have stated on numerous occasions that that is my approach. I would hope that there would be no conflict or even an apparent conflict in the objectives of the system because, unlike the universities on the Continent, our university institutions have quite a big technological input. <Col N="1242" /> Quite recently the IAESTE (the International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience) people were here and I was speaking to some of them.  They naturally are very interested in their own technological sphere, and they pointed out to me that it was the exception rather than the rule in continental universities in many countries to have any technological sectors at all.  We have developed, as the British universities have developed, a strong technological sector in the universities, engineering, science and so on, and I cannot see that we should be making a big thing of either comprehensive or binary or making one or the other into an ism.  They are both involved in the business of higher third level education. They are both specific objectives and they should nurture each other and cross-fertilise, cross-pollenate, and this would be to the advantage of third level education in general.</P>
      <P>I just want to take up a few points made by Deputy Collins first and then go on to points made by Deputy Horgan.  The idea that the director of the National Council for Education awards should not be a member of the council is a strange one.  The director in his avocation would be inhibited if he was not a member of the council.  The council will be the better for having him a member and he will be the better for having experience on the council itself.  In fact, if Deputy Collins reflects on it he will find that his own Minister, during the period of office of the National Coalition, followed the policy of putting the director on the council as far as the NIHE in Limerick, for example, was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a very strange thing from Deputy Collins, the idea that the HEA should fund all third-level education.  I should like him on Committee Stage to explain exactly what he meant.  Did he mean, for example, that the HEA should fund the regional technical colleges and take them away from the VECs?  This would be a major departure, and I would be interested to know if that is the point he was making.  I should like to know if he has tried to find out if the VECs in general agree with this view.  Does he think the Vocational Education Act <Col N="1243" /> should be amended in such a way as to allow the RTCs, for example, to be financed not directly by the committees but by the HEA?</P>
    <P>Deputies Horgan and Collins found it hard to identify Pádraig Mac Diarmada, the director mentioned in the Bill, and I was more than shocked to find Deputy Horgan applying the bourgeois criterion of looking for him in the telephone book and deciding that because he was not in it he did not exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">

Though it may be unusual to name a person in a Bill, this will not be the last time when I will be doing this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Horgan about the Irish School of Ecumenism is a good one.  I would envisage the role of the council as being adaptable in this respect.  Adaptability has not necessarily been written into the Bill; but the fact that the council will provide validation for a course which has been assessed is sufficient justification for their existence and the performance of this very useful role of filling a vacuum in the assessment, validation and awards area.</P>
      <P>Detailed discussion of the sections can be left to Committee Stage. However, Deputies Collins and Horgan went into some detail on some sections. In particular, Deputy Horgan referred at some length to the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo;.  He said that planning was not appropriate for the NCEA.  We must not forget that the council are a body for educational awards and that any powers given to them are being given in the context of there being a council for educational awards and are related to the council's role as a council for educational awards. It is important to remember that when discussing the Bill.</P>
      <P>A point was made about giving teacher qualifications and that Thomond College would be under the umbrella of the NCEA while other teachers will be getting their awards from the universities. This point was made by Deputy Horgan.  I do not think this will have any effect on the status or qualifications of the teachers in either sector.  Indeed the whole purpose and thrust of the Bill is to have a council for making educational awards, assessing and validating, which will be internationally recognised and respected at home, second to none in this area, and it is for that reason that we are pleased that the teachers in Thomond&mdash;the physical education, metalwork, rural science and woodwork teachers&mdash;will come under the aegis of the NCEA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Horgan made an interesting remark on the reference in the Bill to the universities.  I fail to understand it.  He said it is a form of provincialism&mdash;I forget the adjective he put before &ldquo;provincialism&rdquo;.  I do not have to give a thumbnail sketch of the development of <Col N="1245" /> the universities in western Europe.  The universities evolved and grew into the consciousness of western Europe, and when we talk of universities in the Irish context we have a yardstick, a criterion&mdash;we are talking in a certain universal discourse, as the philosophers called it, and it is accepted that we mean excellences in certain ways, and it is precisely because we are aiming at that kind of universal discourse that the word &ldquo;universities&rdquo; has been mentioned in the Bill.  It does not mean that the universities are to have any kind of influence, any baleful influence, on the technological sector.  It does not mean that the content of courses will be or should be influenced unduly by the universities. There is a specific technological ethos with which we do not want the universities to interfere, and it was precisely because of that that I opposed in this House the policy of my predecessor who wanted to sit down&mdash;this is the simile I used at the time&mdash;like a pitchcap the university system on the head of the technological system by his proposals for legislation when he was in power.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that Deputy Horgan referred to the mobility aspect and to the role of the NCEA in producing this mobility.  The council's assessing role, validating role and awarding role can be the lubricant which will enable easy mobility from the regional technical colleges to the national institutes for higher education.  There is the horizontal mobility to which the Deputy referred also as between the institutes of higher education or the RTC's and the universities and also the other way from the universities through to the technological sector.  It is possible that the council will have a role in that regard.  I am confident that they will perform that role.</P>
    <P>In my opening speech I referred to the non-representative role of those whom we shall appoint to the council.  I do not think it is beyond the powers of the people from institutions to prescind from whatever institutions to which they belong, to take what is laid down in the Bill as a role for the council to which they will belong, and to dedicate themselves to the objectives expressed in <Col N="1246" /> the legislation without being prejudiced in favour of their own institutions or to the ethos of the institutions to which they belong.  I trust that the Deputy will accept that.  We know that everyone has his share of human weaknesses, but when accepting a position on a council such as the NCEA a person from an institution will know exactly what the council is designed for, what is their business and how they pursue their business.  I would presume that if a person appointed to the council was under the impression that he could not contribute effectively to the working of the council he would not take membership of the council.  That is the attitude I would expect at this level of operation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the NCAD it is as well to say that there were other proposals from that college in regard to their future, their role and their relationship to the NCEA and also to the universities.  That explains why I was chary about including them in the first place but, as has been said, the scene has changed.</P>
    <P>The provision about living in the country was put in specifically for the reason that it was considered that particularly in the technological field it would be useful for a member to be resident in the country, to know the exact state of the technological education in the country, to know of the institutions, to know the strength and weaknesses and to know what demands are being made on the sector by bodies such as the IDA.  It was in this kind of context that the idea was put forward of the desirability of members of the council living in the country.</P>
    <P>The final point made by Deputy Horgan can be summarised by the word &ldquo;academic&rdquo;.  The point he was making is one that has been made frequently, that is, that the institutions to which the council will relate will not be swamped in academicism.  The provisions of the Bill and the various references to the type of person who will be appointed to the council will ensure that there will not be grounds for that fear.  Time and again there has been a repetition of the idea that there was necessarily a conflict at post-primary level between what is called &ldquo;academic&rdquo; and what is known as <Col N="1247" />&ldquo;practical&rdquo; education.  I have not been able ever to see the situation divisively but I think there has been an acceptance of the pushing of a role in the past on holders of leaving certificates.  In other words they were type-casted on the basis of the kind of leaving certificates they held.  But that is not necessarily so, and I should like to see the holders of the leaving certificate putting themselves forward for apprenticeships, for certificates, for diplomas and for degrees in the technological field.  The necessary input at leaving certificate stage need not be great to qualify a person for such studies.  I should hope that in the future more people holding the leaving certificate would regard themselves as right for a lot of areas for which traditionally they did not consider themselves right. While in opposition I visited the AnCO centre at Ballyfermot and I was pleased to find there a number of people who had leaving certificates and who were being trained in trades.  In one case the apprentice had a university degree.  I am giving those examples in order to put forward my views on this matter and also in reference to the final point made by Deputy Horgan.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions. As has been said rightly, this is a Committee Stage Bill and we shall have plenty of time at that stage to tease out the various sections.  I trust that it will not be too long before that stage is under way.  I assure the Deputies that I will welcome their constructive contributions and I trust that the Bill on reaching the Statute Book will deserve the praise that Deputy Horgan has forecast for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In my introductory remarks on the budget speech I said that this was a good budget.  Contrary to what the Coalition have been saying it was a good budget for families, for children and above all for young people. If you tease your way through the budget and separate the various sectors you will find that this budget has a lot for young people, particularly those who are seeking jobs or who are currently unemployed.</P>
      <P>Our economy is in good order.  Our inflation rate has been brought down to 7.6 per cent, our growth rate has been brought up to 7 per cent and our exports and job creation are at record levels.  In that sense, the economy is in good hands and is progressing well.  The targets of reducing borrowing to 10½ per cent and reducing inflation by the end of the year to 5 per cent and increasing jobs by 25 per cent are phase two in the economic development programme and are a major task for all of us.  Broadly speaking these targets are to be achieved by moderate income increases, low levels of inflation and a better tax and social allowance situation for all people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The jobs and wages targets are reasonable and one might say they constitute an ambitious package.  The first part of the package I would like to look at is the social part.  I welcome the general increase across the board of 12 per cent for unemployment, disability, maternity and short-term welfare.  On the other hand, we have received a 16 per cent increase for long-term welfare such as old age pensioners and widows. Everyone in the House will welcome such a contribution, and although I <Col N="1249" /> would like to see these increases at an even higher level, we must recognise that, in the context of our economic circumstances, these are fairly substantial increases in this year.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of comment on children's allowances.  There is an overall increase in expenditure of 28 per cent on this, which is considerable.  For the first child this works out at an increase from £2.30 to £3.50 per month, or a 52 per cent increase.  For the second child it is £4.10 to £5.50 or a 34 per cent increase. For the third child it is £4.85 to £5.50, a 14 per cent increase.  Taking a family with five children the overall effect is a 22 per cent increase.  A mother with three children will receive an extra £3.25 per month or a 29 per cent increase.  A mother with five children will receive £4.55 per month or a 22 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>I listened to some Opposition speakers and their comments in relation to the budget.  I was surprised at the views of the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  He regarded the increases in children's allowances as poor and he did not consider the budget to be a family type one.  I compared this budget with the January 1977 budget of the Coalition.  I found that children's allowances were increased by the Coalition Government in their last budget by 50p per month for all but the first child.  The first child was included in that increase.  In comparing the first, second and third child in that budget with this budget I found that the present budget increases the first child by £1.20 versus no increase in the last Coalition budget.  The second child gets an extra £1.40 as against 50p in the last Coalition budget.  The third and subsequent child gets an extra 65p as against 50p in the Coalition budget.  Taking it overall, the mother with three children receives £3.25 from the Minister for Finance in this budget as against £1 in the Coalition budget.  The Minister for Finance has given substantial increases.</P>
    <P>We have our own views as to how things might be done, but it is only fair to recognise that the increases are substantial.  It is hypocritical and somewhat tongue in cheek for people <Col N="1250" /> who gave small increases in the last budget to claim that these increases are small.  In effect, taking the first three children the increase is 3.25 times that given in the last Coalition budget.</P>
    <P>I looked a little further to see what the differences were in tax-free allowances.  I found that for a single person in the last Coalition budget in 1977 there was an increased allowance of £45 bringing the total to £665.  In this budget the Minister has given an increased allowance of £250 for a single person bringing it to £1,115 or close on double the figure which the Coalition introduced at that time.  It must be recognised that there have been very substantial increases in tax allowances.  One would think from reading the press and statements of various Opposition politicians that the increases given were not of a sufficient magnitude.</P>
    <P>The last Coalition budget gave £90 extra tax-free allowance to married couples bringing the total to £1,100 whereas in this budget the increase was £500 for married couples bringing the total to £2,230 which is slightly more than double the figure which existed in the last Coalition budget.  In the last budget £50 was given to a single person, widow or single parent bringing the total to £735 whereas in this budget, not only has the Minister for Finance given £250, bringing it to £1,185, he has introduced a novel extra £250 bringing the total to £1,435 tax free allowance.  Against this comparison I find it very hard to take the comments which have been made by the principal Opposition speakers up to this stage.  It would be more constructive in everybody's interest to admit honestly that Fianna Fáil in their first two budgets have given very substantial increases in tax-free allowances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that point. They have increased the tax-free allowances very substantially and in so far as would be possible in that time they have fulfilled the promises given.  In addition, inflation has been kept down to 7.6 per cent which means in effect that the allowances and the benefits are <Col N="1251" /> worth something in real terms and are not whittled away by inflation as soon as you have them in your pocket.  I welcome those substantial increases.  I personally favoured higher increases in the 12 to 18 age group for children's allowances and I hope that at some stage in the future the Minister will consider that proposal further.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Horgan's interjection, I was speaking about the mother in that case.  I turn now to her husband, because the child allowance generally affects the husband at this stage.  That represents minus £22 and that has a varying effect depending on the tax position. It is a complicated thing to discuss in a short few moments, but the basic principle of giving the greater increase to the lower income people will be agreed to by most fair-minded and reasonable people.  I accept that as a measure.  I welcome also the measures for the one-parent families in respect of whom there is another special increase of £250 in the tax-free allowances, and this will be very valuable for widows, deserted wives, unmarried mothers and separated parents.</P>
      <P>Another measure relates to the increased allowance in respect of interest on house mortgages.  Any increase in this area is welcome, and this is a definite attempt to keep in touch with the change in house costs.</P>
      <P>Turning to the tax package, the £500 increase is an advantage to families.  A man earning the average industrial wage and with two children can now earn £2,750 or with three children, £3,000 before he is liable for tax.  This represents the equivalent of a 4 per cent wage increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that I consider this budget to be an important one for youth.  I will refer briefly to a few of the points which come to my attention in relation to the Minister's speech.  For instance, we have a work experience programme for which there is an extra £1.8 million, bringing a total of £3 million and providing 6,000 places.  There is a temporary scheme for youth employment in community work operated by the Department of Education. Development officers are to be appointed. The AnCO training programme <Col N="1252" /> has been tremendously increased, providing total AnCO places of 6,370. There is the temporary hire agency which could also play an important part for young people seeking jobs.  There is provision for further employment creation of £3.2 million for the creation of the equivalent of 1,000 temporary posts. There is thus a total of £20 million which will be spent mainly on young people in special job creation.</P>
    <P>There are commitments in this budget to improvements in the tax system. There has been a sense of grievance felt by PAYE taxpayers about inequity in the system, and a number of measures have been taken in this regard.  There is a commitment to provide 25,000 more jobs which will mean 25,000 more people paying tax in the first instance.  There is a commitment to people on higher incomes paying more tax and an extra 6,000 farmers will be brought into the tax net.  In addition to this there is the agricultural levy which at 2 per cent is expected to bring in £16 million during 1979.  There has been a considerable amount of comment on this already in the media and elsewhere, and in this case a number of possible anomalies are raised which have to be discussed and sorted out in a rational way, but the principle remains that the volume of money must be collected from the farming community.  The Minister for Finance has a duty to all of the people to collect this money and in that he has been quite forthright.  He has also said that he is quite prepared to discuss in a rational and reasonable way any anomalies or hardships that may arise, and I am sure that representations will be made to ensure that any anomalies are dealt with effectively.</P>
    <P>The PAYE taxpayers are concerned about the self-employed and there has been a certain amount of grievance in this regard.  The Minister for Finance has made a commitment to additional staff in an attempt to cover this more effectively. He has powers which can be used in legal proceedings but which have not generally been used.  I know he is going to consider this seriously, but I would hope that this facility would not be over-used.  There should be a speeding <Col N="1253" /> up of the agreement of accounts of self-employed people.  There is too much delay in finally agreeing accounts.  I understand that there is a considerable volume of money in bank accounts awaiting final agreement and settlement. I hope that the additional staff who will be provided will enable the Revenue Commissioners to clear up these accounts and get on to chasing people who are evading tax.  There should be a register of accountants approved by the Department of Finance and the list should be published in the public interest. The public should know whether accountants are reliable.  I believe that the vast majority of them are, and in the kind of society that we have I would prefer a situation where they take the onus and carry out the task and the Revenue Commissioners are involved only in checking and from time to time sample checking.  In this way the system could be much more efficient and the backlog of accounts of increasing numbers of people, including the farmers who are coming into the accounting system, could be cleared.  People are sometimes suspicious of accountants, and it has been said that an accountant can make a story whichever way you like it.  I do not believe that.  There may be accountants who would do this but it is not generally the case, and that should be recognised by the Revenue Commissioners in their dealing with accountants. If we are to set about duplicating this work nationally we will lose a great deal, and obviously it will take a whole ocean of Revenue Commissioners to duplicate the work of the accountants.  I would like to see more efficiency and effectiveness in this regard.</P>
    <P>On the question of doctors, dentists, consultants and such categories on whom there has been a good deal of comment recently, I may be naïve about this but I believe that most of these people, even for peace of mind apart from anything else, put forward their accounts fairly honestly.  It could be valuable to publish a list of the top 20 or 50 different professional groups, not naming the people concerned but publishing the kinds of tax paid in the areas so that people would realise the volume of tax which is <Col N="1254" /> paid.  Quite a few of these people pay substantial amounts of tax.  These figures and facts are available to the Revenue Commissioners and we are not really aware of the details of them.</P>
    <P>In the controversy which has been going on recently, there is considerable confusion about the statistics which are involved in the collection of taxes generally.  The latest report of the Revenue Commissioners which was available in 1976 shows that 614,277 PAYE people were actually paying tax. In income tax in general, which would include all income tax, 110,000 did not qualify to pay because of low incomes; 289,000 on incomes below £1,500 paid 5.54 per cent of tax under PAYE.  In other words about 35 per cent of the PAYE people paid 5.5 per cent of the PAYE tax, so there are variations within PAYE as well as within other areas.  If we look at that as tax per head, we find that of the 614,000 PAYE earners the tax paid per head in that year was an average of £372.  If we take those who are earning under £1,500, the 289,000 we find that their average was £43 per head but if we go on up to the remainder who pay the bulk of the tax the 325,277 paid £663 per head.  These figures relate to 1976 which is the latest report available.  In contrast to that, the self-employed which at that stage numbered 344,202 paid £1,257,000 and the unearned incomes group of 14,376 paid £876.  The very low number of unearned income people is striking and it reflects the fact that not many people own shares and other means of having unearned income.  People are inclined to talk about this at times as if there were vast numbers of people with unearned incomes.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.</P>
    <P>On the budget in general, I have noticed that the small savings for the year 1978 increased to a record £65 million, and I also note that the State currently lends £660 million to farmers in business enterprises but that they lend nothing to low income but trustworthy individuals who are often in the clutches of hire purchase companies or money lenders.  We could do with another device to deal with that situation.  We <Col N="1255" /> need a small man's bank, or a division of the banks which would cater for the short-term needs of small individuals which would operate within the local communities.  In my day-to-day experiences I see a great number of hard-working trustworthy people who because of their positions do not come into the echelon which can get a small bank overdraft, and I am concerned about people in that situation.  About £5 million should be advanced as risk money to assist people like that.  The policy of commercial banks, is shown on television by advertisements showing a fairly well dressed person who obviously has a good job and good future becoming a client of the bank.  That is very good and I am glad to see such people being involved and being able to get money without having to turn to hire purchase firms or money lenders but I would like to see more of the people on lower incomes, whose future is improving within the economy being able to obtain money in this way.  We should look at the possibility of making a positive move in this direction.</P>
    <P>In relation to the policy of commercial banks, one could ask, how much do they lose per year to small defaulters?  The amount is negligible.  They should be prepared to lose up to 2 per cent to this category because if they are not doing that they are not going after the market, they are only taking the most secure risks and consequently they are leaving a large number of people outside of their influence and leaving them depending on high interest charges elsewhere.  Changes are coming and there will be a situation where a far greater number of people will be paying by cheque and will be paid by cheque.  This affords an opportunity to encourage people into this way of saving and of dealing in their business.  If the private commercial interests, particularly the banks are not prepared to do this, the State should encourage the trustee banks to expand in that direction and provide a small man's bank.  This may not seem very important when we are talking in terms of the multi-million pounds provided for industry and agriculture.  But we are talking about <Col N="1256" /> people on the ground, people on low incomes, people who have to face great difficulties, who still get money from money lenders at a very high price.  The people in that situation have to pay the highest hire purchase rates which is a very severe depressant on their well-being and on their sharing in the increasing wealth and prosperity of the country.</P>
    <P>In relation to economic development I am pleased to see the Government commitment to job creation.  The target of 25,000 extra jobs is ambitious.  I welcome the Government's direct contribution of an additional 7,170, jobs.  As far as industry and agriculture are concerned we are now in phase 2.  They have been given the impetus and the assistance and now it is time to deliver the goods, particularly in terms of increased job creation.  Job creation is getting major backing from the State and is one of our major planks in the present economic development.  However, it is important that we do not lose sight of the potential and the opportunities still existing in the semi-State sector who have a vital part to play and must not be overlooked.  In relation to the IDA, for instance, I can only echo the views of other Members of the House in congratulating them on their dynamic performance and the success they have been achieving in stimulating job creation and development.  As far as CTT are concerned new goods whether agricultural or industrial must be sold. We must promote the sale of new products and we must continue to give leadership and assistance to industry in this area.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal to be done as yet. I should like to see a greater allocation of resources to CTT because they have the task of promoting exports and developing new markets.  All the other work we do will be frustrated if we do not match our other efforts in the area of responsibility of CTT.  I should like to see more vigorous export campaigns to match our EMS entry.  EMS membership offers many possibilities for us, particularly in relation to continental markets, and I should like to see increased investment in that area.  With the tremendous numbers of young people <Col N="1257" /> we have and the help of our educational and training facilities, I believe we can produce the goods, but we must sell these goods in highly competitive export markets.</P>
    <P>The Buy Irish campaign is closely allied to this.  It would be a great mistake to weaken in any way our efforts in this campaign.  We must maintain and intensify our efforts in every possible way. Guinness and Kerrygold are major brand names and their sales campaigns do not relent at any time; neither should we relent in the Buy Irish campaign.  We must keep up the pressure.</P>
    <P>There are too many stores which do not stock a fair share of Irish goods.  We talk about the farmer contributing a fair share of tax but we could also talk about stores stocking a fair share of Irish goods.  I am often reminded by my constituents of stores which do not stock Irish goods.  The quality of Irish goods is improving all the time.  In the period after Christmas I was very glad to see a good variety of Irish goods, such as shoes, in competition with imported ones.  There is certainly an improvement, but we must continue to support this development and intensify the Buy Irish campaign.</P>
    <P>We should encourage groups within industry to mount promotional campaigns. While individual sectors may be too small to mount such campaigns themselves, by grouping together they have many common interests which could be promoted.</P>
    <P>The semi-State sector has a major contribution to make to economic development, and I should like to see this sector being given the opportunity to make that contribution.  I should welcome an immediate review of the objectives, operations and priorities of the semi-State bodies.  I know that the joint committee are looking at the activities of some semi-State bodies and I have listed these in various categories.  Under the financial heading there are bodies such as Irish Life, VHI, ACC, ICC and Fóir Teoranta.  Then there are the energy bodies such as the ESB, Bord na Móna and An Bord Gais.  There are also the manufacturing and transport bodies and some others.  I have looked at their contribution <Col N="1258" /> to the economy in current terms.</P>
    <P>Taking the 1977 statistics in relation to finance companies, they had a gross profit before tax of £80 million.  The energy companies had a gross profit of £30 million; the manufacturing companies had a loss of £3.5 million, and the transport companies, as we may have guessed, had a deficit of £30.2 million. The other bodies had a total profit of £1.5 million.  The total profit was £78.4 million.  The bulk of the profit came from Irish Life and this represented £78.6 million; the profit of VHI was £.2 million; ACC £1.7 million; ICC £1.9 million and Fóir Teoranta minus £1.8 million, giving a total of £80.5 million.  The ESB made a profit before tax of £29 million, while Bord na Móna had a profit of £.9 million. In the manufacturing area, CSET made a profit of £3 million; NET had a loss of £4.3 million; they were the two major components.</P>
    <P>These are major factors in our economy, and the manufacturing sector seem to give some cause for concern. The financial companies are operating in the area in which we seem to be making most money.</P>
    <P>Looking at the figures in relation to strikes and the number of man days lost, Aer Lingus lost 89,700 man days, NET lost 60,000, CIE 6,000, RTE 5,820 and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs 5,305.  One might think that some of these bodies would have a somewhat different record and the number of man days lost might not be as high as one would expect.</P>
    <P>Obviously energy is of great importance, and the scope of operations and the development strategy of Bord na Móna are most important.  There is an opportunity for much greater development within Bord na Móna not only in regard to energy consumption but in regard to the diversification of products. I know that the Act has put a stay on the hands of the Bord from time to time. Under the Act they are in the raw materials producing business, and this stifles the initiative to some extent in diversifying into consumer-type products.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> We need to decide quite clearly the role and function of semi-State bodies.  I appreciate that they are limited by Act and that is one of the reasons why the responsibility falls back on this House. Many of the Acts are now out of date, for instance, the Turf Development Act of 1946, and there is an onus on the Oireachtas to review and bring up to date such Acts.  I welcome the work currently being done by the joint committee.</P>
    <P>We should consider the appointment of professional teams to review semi-State bodies and make recommendations on areas of potential development for which Acts may need to be altered. Such teams could report to select committees of the Oireachtas.  I should like to see these teams comprising people with wide experience in industry.  I will not mention particular industries, but we all know the companies in the manufacturing sector which score very high in practical commercial terms.  It is in the practical, commercial, profit-making areas that semi-State bodies have their greatest difficulties.  I should like to see mixed teams of people drawn from a wide area, including the accounting organisations, not purely accountants, but commercially-orientated business people who could sit in with top management of the semi-State bodies and review their strategies and potential for development. On this basis one could work out various practical propositions for development which could then be given the backing of any necessary changes in legislation.</P>
    <P>While we develop our private sector, industry and agriculture, and put a great deal of our interest in investment in them, we must recognise that the semi-State bodies have a major part to play and afford them the opportunity of so doing.  As I see them, the semi-State bodies are very strong on control and accountability.  For instance, the Comptroller and Auditor General will keep us right on the financial side and, in the case of those semi-State bodies coming under the Companies Act, the independent audits carried out keep us right also.  In that sense we are quite clear; we know that the money is there; <Col N="1260" /> we know on what it is being or has been spent.  Of course accountability generally is becoming increasingly directed at the relevant Ministers and their Departments. That is a very desirable change. But there is little accounting for performance in the commercial sense.  This has led to the establishment of the select committee of the Oireachtas to investigate the overall situation of semi-State bodies.  In summary I would say that the cash has been accounted for but the commercial performance has not been evaluated in any real sense.  The direction in which these semi-State bodies are headed is not clear; their potential for development has not been defined.  That potential constitutes the big question mark at present.  I am quite certain that people within these semi-State bodies would be very glad to indicate the potential they see and in respect of which they may feel there are some limitations on their operations.  The loss potential has not been identified and there is an urgent need to give impetus to semi-State bodies in this respect.  I should like to see them afforded an opportunity to explore their undeveloped potential.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of industrial relations the main objectives of the budget have been the ultimate creation of full employment and the immediate creation of an additional 25,000 jobs. We know that 50 per cent of our population is under 25.  We know that 43 per cent of our young people are unemployed. We know also that over the next ten years we will have massive numbers of young people leaving school, looking for jobs.  Thinking about that I looked up the figures to ascertain just how many children are at school in this country at present when I found the figure to be close to 900,000.  This is a very significant and sobering figure for anybody wanting to run away in a selfish way, saying they are not really interested in the people coming on after them or whether or not they will have jobs.  The Government are right to aim for such an ambitious target as 25,000 jobs per annum.  Bearing in mind that there are almost 900,000 children at school, assuming that there will be approximately 300,000 coming on to the <Col N="1261" /> labour market over the next five years, that is something of the order of 60,000 coming on per annum in each of those years, we ascertain an idea of the size of the problem.  It is very important that people get the whole debate on wages, industrial relations, self, country and future&mdash;and children particularly&mdash;into proper perspective.  It is when one sees it in that perspective only that one realises firstly that the Government have to go for a target of 25,000 new jobs per annum. Not alone must they go for that target but they must achieve it if we are to have stability and sanity within our society in the future.</P>
    <P>In that sense commentators like to regard the Government's job target as ambitious at 25,000 per annum.  As can be seen from the figures I have quoted, even this achievement will be barely adequate compared with the needs confronting us.  For the sake of these children we cannot afford to follow the British example of a self-destructive policy in industrial relations; we must work out solutions to our own industrial problems.  In that respect I welcome particularly the statements by the craft unions towards the end of last week and the recent statements by the main unions in relation to future wage negotiations. These people are taking a very sensible and realistic approach.  Their suggestion of a national understanding on wages constitutes a realistic approach to the problem.  Within that broad consensus I hope people will have a common interest in seeking reasonable solutions to our problems.</P>
    <P>Certainly the budget has provided the basis for such an approach.  It provides stability in the £.  Inflation is under control and can remain under control if we decide to keep it that way.  In itself it is providing a 4 per cent real increase in incomes for a person with an average industrial wage of some £80 per week.  For people on a lower wage scale it provides something more than that.</P>
    <P>I welcome particularly the assistance being given in the social welfare category; here I am referring to the 16 per cent increase.  I recognise also the benefits given to families.  If these are considered in the context of the period <Col N="1262" /> since Fianna Fáil assumed office this time one will realise they are quite substantial. I welcome also the funds provided for job creation, growth and further wealth.  If we adopt a sensible approach to industrial relations in this sense&mdash;with the lead given by the Government&mdash;then we should achieve something more like the future for which we would all hope and which is there for us in terms of wealth, growth and well-being within a just society.  This calls for a response in the way of moderate and realistic wage increases.  It calls also for real increases in incomes, wealth and improved productivity.  Further it calls for a fairer spread of taxes of all kinds. Ultimately it will lead to a better life for all our people which we must be capable of achieving if we set our minds to it on both sides of this House.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for Finance and his colleagues on what I regard as a balanced budget, one which affords an opportunity to develop our country within another valuable and useful phase.  It constitutes a good basis for growth and provides a framework for job creation and for the attainment of full employment by 1983.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Woods towards the end of his speech when he said that the provisions of this budget&mdash;in the plan outlined therein&mdash; hopefully would lead to a better life for us all.  That is a very laudable sentiment with which any fair-minded person must agree.  However, that is one side of the coin only.  To achieve that we must face reality: the fact is that we are now discussing what is a second budget of 1979. This second budget of 1979 is a strange mixture of what I would regard as fact on the one hand and illusion on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One full week after the Minister has outlined the provisions and details&mdash;he spoke indeed for two hours last week&mdash;there are still many thousands of people here who are not aware of where they stand with regard to so-called benefits which accrued to them as the result of the Minister's provisions or the losses they might have incurred as a <Col N="1263" /> result of other provisions in this second budget in 1979.  I fear that when many of them find out and when the mist clears they will be disappointed.  I agree that the Minister had to face and still faces very serious problems which in many cases are of the Minister's and of his party's own making, because some 18 or 19 months ago, through a manifesto published by Fianna Fáil, they sought power which they succeeded in getting and, subsequently, found that the price paid was, and still is, much too high.  So the day of reckoning has come and the problems which face the Minister and the Government and all of us, problems in areas like industrial relations, unemployment, prices, social welfare, increased demands for ever-increasing wages, are a direct result of the policy adopted by a party intent on getting power at any price.  On the road to success they made promises which raised the expectations of every sector in this community to a very high level.  Of course the expectations were not and could not be realised.</P>
    <P>Prior to the introduction in the House by the Minister for Finance of this budget he went through the normal discourses and discussions with many sectors in the community, farmers, the PAYE sector and the smaller groupings to discuss with them what their approach might be in the event of the Minister taking course A, B or C and he was given certain replies.  Through his negotiations he collected very valuable information.  The end result of that was that the unions, through congress, asked that in order to facilitate the Government and the employers in coming to an agreement on wage increase demands they expected their slice of the cake, and the price they put on that slice of the cake was £100 million in taxation refunds. Of course they were disappointed last week when that £100 millions turned out to be something in the region of £30 million.  On reflection it now transpires that those people who expected to get a certain relief in return for facilitating the other social partners, the Government and the employers, now find to their horror that not only will they not be better <Col N="1264" /> off but that they will now be paying roughly £4 per week in 1979 as opposed to £3 per week in 1978.  We all know the result of that kind of operation, because the ever winding circle of higher prices and inflation will follow.  These are some of the facts concerning that area which the Minister had to face.</P>
    <P>In order to meet in some way the demands of the PAYE sector the Minister tried a different ploy.  It would seem that he set out to penalise a different sector of the community in order to give the impression that he was giving relief to the PAYE sector.  The end result of that was that both the farmers and the unions ended up dissatisfied.  A reduction in the level of valuation at which tax became applicable and the increase in the multiplier to 125 were two measures which brought an ever increasing number of farmers into the tax net.  In reality most people expected that this kind of adjustment would be made.  Many of them no doubt felt that the adjustment might not be as severe as it turned out to be but the main bone of contention was the introduction of the 2 per cent agricultural levy.  A week is a long time in politics, and we are now aware of the reaction of the farming community to this new tax, this new imposition on them.  We also know the reaction of some members of the Minister's own party who felt so strongly about this issue and were so pressurised by their constituents that they decided to go public on this in the past few days.  The main difficulty with this kind of across-the-board imposition is that it does not take into consideration the payees' capacity to pay this tax.  This is the most unjust and unjustifiable aspect of this tax.  The agricultural community, to which it specifically refers, were incensed by this because it did not relate at all to income.  Income tax is normally based on income, and in the business world if one makes a profit one pays tax and if one does not make a profit one does not pay tax.  Despite all these anomalies, it is a fair rule-of-thumb which was completely ignored in this new imposition.</P>
    <P>Looking at the commodities to which this tax refers one is not left in doubt as to the result.  From a certain date in <Col N="1265" /> 1979 the tax will apply to pigs, sheep, sugar beet, cattle going to slaughter for export.  It will have one of two possible results.  The producer may suffer because the purchaser will take into account the fact that he must pay the 2 per cent before the commodity or animal goes into processing, and therefore he will reduce payment to the producer by that amount or a fraction thereof.  If he does not do that, the producer will pay 2 per cent, and whether it be backward or forward to the checkout in a supermarket, the housewife will pay, and the result will be further inflation. The most unjust aspect of this is that it does not take into account the ability or the capacity of the payee to pay the tax.</P>
    <P>The up-to-date position on that tax is that having deliberated at length, the Government party have seen fit to issue a statement that the whole thing is being looked into with a view to amending it, they hope, to the satisfaction of their backbenchers and of the farming community. The statement issued at 4 o'clock this afternoon does not mean much to a politician&mdash;indeed it does not mean anything.  Either way the Government are faced with cutting their losses and ensuring that they will suffer loss of face to the least possible degree.  Loss of face they will suffer whether they abolish this tax or bulldoze their way and impose this penal tax on people who cannot afford to pay.</P>
    <P>Last week the Taoiseach naturally tried to make a case for the budget provisions.  He referred to food subsidies. As I stated at the outset, this is the second 1979 budget, because this year was not one hour old before we had the first budget which yielded £20 million plus to the Exchequer through the simple device of partially withdrawing food subsidies. In that way the Government went back on a promise given in the manifesto before the general election, during the campaign and since assuming office.</P>
    <P>No later than last March the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy jumped down my throat when I suggested it had been rumoured that food subsidies might be withdrawn.  He denied the allegation vehemently and boasted that something in the region of £67 million <Col N="1266" /> was being paid in subsidies at that time.  Three months later the Green Paper was published and for the first time we learned of the Government's commitment to abolish food subsidies. Shortly before Christmas we had the White Paper which reiterated that commitment, and of course the real thing took place on New Year's Day with the announcement during the bank holiday weekend of the partial withdrawal of the subsidies, resulting in the price of butter going up by 8p in the pound together with increases in the price of bread and milk.</P>
    <P>At that time it was stated that the consequential increase in the CPI would be in the region of 0.7 per cent, and the Taoiseach last week trotted out 0.7 per cent, less than ¾ of a percentage point in the CPI.  Of course it means an increase in the cost of living and this has fierce relevance to thousands of our people because the CPI figures are calculated in accordance with certain criteria.  Here and in Western Europe there are people who spend about 18 per cent of their total income on food.  They are people in the well-developed economies, people who have high incomes.  On the other end of the scale there are people who spend more than 50 per cent of their gross incomes on food.  Indeed, there are many thousands of people who spend 70 or 80 per cent of their gross incomes on food.</P>
    <P>I compliment the NPC for their limited but very informative survey on the shopping habits of people in the lower income groups, in this city, such as the unemployed and old age pensioners. The figures were astounding. The withdrawal of food subsidies of 1 per cent to the person spending up to 80 per cent of his income on food represents not an increase in cost of 0.7 per cent but an increase of between 12 and 15 per cent or maybe more in some cases in their annual food bill.  That is why I say that the trotting out of this figure for accountancy purposes is all very well and I am sure it is correct but the reality is very different for those people in the lower income group. Therefore, I was amazed to hear the Taoiseach say on Thursday last that <Col N="1267" /> food subsidies had outlived their usefulness.  I wonder what any old age pensioner receiving £13.65 per week or any old age pension couple receiving £20 per week would think of such a statement.  They would take a dim view of that kind of philosophy.  When talking about this budget, therefore, we are talking about the second budget of 1979.</P>
    <P>The question of inflation has been referred to.  Inflation has been reduced. According to the mid-November figure it is not at 7.8 per cent.  The target outlined by the Minister is 5 per cent.  It is more than likely that for the quarter ending mid-February, taking all the increases into account, the figure for inflation will be seen to be in the region of 4 per cent.  This figure is based on the Government's data.  Do we take it that if the target set is to be achieved, inflation during the next 11 months will be 1 per cent to give us an end-of-year figure of a 5 per cent rate?  With all the optimism and with all the trust possible, I do not think that without good works this situation can be brought about.  This budget will not result in an inflation rate of 5 per cent by the end of 1979.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a man to whom I would give full marks for optimism and for trying to placate the people who know they are not getting what they are told they are getting.  The figures produced by the Government would suggest strongly&mdash;hopefully I will be proved wrong on this&mdash;an inflation rate of about 10 per cent by the end of this year.  I shall refer here to further provisions which were outlined for us last week in relation to children's allowances. Like everything else the increases seem to be generous but on closer scrutiny they are meagre and in addition they are biased because it would seem that there is less going to the larger families.  Also, there is the infamous clawback in tax allowances.</P>
    <P>The increases outlined are in effect about 13p per week for the first child, 17½p per week for the second child and a ½p per week for each additional child. We have heard a lot in the past few weeks about this being the year of the child.  According to the Minister the ideal <Col N="1268" /> family would be a two-child family because for the larger family there is little or no relief in the budget.</P>
    <P>The increases in social welfare seem also to be generous but again under close scrutiny they do not result in what I would regard as a just increase for the people involved.  Many people thought in their innocence that the old age pension qualifying age would be reduced to 65. In 1973 the National Coalition set about reducing the qualifying age from 70. That was the age that had applied since the foundation of the State.  By the time we were leaving office we had reduced the age to 66 but after Fianna Fáil assumed office the expectations of the many 65-year-olds were not realised because not one day was taken off the qualifying age after we left office. Although Fianna Fáil have been in Government for three-quarters of the time that this State has been founded they have not once made an attempt to take as much as a minute off the qualifying age for old age pension.</P>
    <P>Many existing pensioners thought that the means test which applied to the non-contributory old age pension would be amended in their favour but the £6 per week means test remains despite inflation and despite the expectations raised that something would be done in this regard.  These are the people who are now in receipt of increased old age pensions but whose costs are increasing way ahead of these increases.  When one considers the removal of food subsidies and also that the increases in the allowances will not come into operation until April and having regard also to the fact that there will not be further increases for these people until April 1980, I could not imagine anybody venturing to say that enough is being done for those people.</P>
    <P>I talked some time ago about the reality of these increases and the effect they have on this type of social welfare recipient.  I will give one more figure in relation to the increases which have taken place since Fianna Fáil took office.  In 1977 they produced what was called the National Coalition food basket and they showed graphically the increases in prices of basic food <Col N="1269" /> commodities which had taken place during the four-and-a-half years of National Coalition Government.  After 18 months of Fianna Fáil Government, I went through the same exercise last month.  I discovered to my horror that in the case of butter, bread, milk, sugar and cheese, the average increase was 31 per cent due to price increases approved by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy on the one hand and, on the other, due to the partial withdrawal of food subsidies.  Yet we were told prior to the budget that the provisions in the budget would take into account the increases caused by the withdrawal of these subsidies.  When one considers that no further increases will take place until next April 12 months the increases enshrined in this document are grossly inadequate.  There is no Minister&mdash;I do not care how good he is at figures, juggling them or otherwise&mdash;who can tell me that the increases given in the light of that increase of 31 per cent are adequate. I wonder if the Minister would consider or will commit himself to giving an interim increase in the event of a further withdrawal of food subsidies.  I am not a betting man, but I would safely say that there is more likelihood of having a budget between now and the end of the this year than there is of these people getting a supplementary increase next October to take account of the vast increases taking place around us every day.</P>
    <P>On social welfare increases, the demarcation line drawn between short-term beneficiaries and long-term recipients is, to say the least, amazing. What amazes me more is the way the Minister and other speakers from his party have tried to justify the new approach to social welfare recipients.  How can anybody stand up and say that a person in receipt of unemployment assistance should not get an increase which is compatible with the cost of living and, at the same time, say that an old age pensioner should get an increase which is supposed to be compatible with the cost of living?  It is blatantly discriminatory. The idea of the state of a person in receipt of unemployment assistance being short-term is laughable. The Minister and the Minister of State <Col N="1270" /> must know that there are people in receipt of unemployment assistance for the past two, three or four years.  Yet this social welfare assistance is regarded as short-term.  I am sorry it is not short-term. There are 102,000 plus people unemployed, and even with the best will in the world and with the provisions of increased employment there are many thousands of people in receipt of unemployment assistance whose payments will be anything but short-term.  Yet there is this discrimination against them because, in theory, it should be short-term. In fact, it will be long-term for many of them.</P>
    <P>It is working from a wrong premise to suggest that, because these should be short-term, the increases should not be of the order which the long-term beneficiaries would get.  It is discriminating against people who are already discriminated against because of their inability to get work through the inability of the Government to provide them with it.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget we have a hotch potch of provisions many of which are misunderstood.  There are many people completely confused about what they got and what they did not get.  Some of them are living in the belief, as Dickens said, that something might turn up.  They will be badly disappointed when they discover that nothing will turn up.</P>
    <P>The relief in this budget falls far short of the expectations of the community. Indeed, some measures in this budget may provoke certain sections of this community into actions which they do not want to take but many of them feel that there is no other way out, and the package of withdrawal of subsidies, the meagre relief in taxation in some cases, the giving with one hand and taking back with the other, are absolutely provocative.  People are at the moment trying to negotiate a national wage agreement with their social partners only to have the carpet pulled from under them by this kind of policy.  Of course, the technical issue here is that if this package fails, do not blame the Government, blame the unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to get <Col N="1271" /> into a party political debate on the budget; that has all been well dealt with since the Minister released the details here last Wednesday.  However, there should be reference to the Opposition's attitude shown in their attempt to do nothing other than criticise without offering positive alternative suggestions. It was very barren indeed.  It is always very easy to be the hurler on the ditch and to issue reams of destructive criticism.  It is much more difficult to produce alternatives.  The Opposition this year have reached a new low in their criticism of the most comprehensive budget ever announced to this House. The budget was spelt out in great detail and backed up with a supplementary document.  The Minister is to be complimented for the foresight shown in the budget and for his detailed preparation. Probably part of the Opposition's problem is that they found it a weighty and detailed document containing much information, and rather than go to the trouble of assessing it in depth they decided to go on the political attack. Does any rational person really believe that their wild accusations and negative criticisms can be anything other than political point scoring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going into detail on the content of the budget it is worth while making some very brief comparisons concerning the major thrust which we intend this budget to have, that is in the creation of employment.  It is worth taking a brief look at the Coalition's record in job creation.  We find that in their first full year, 1973-74, in the aftermath of taking over from our party they had an increase of 10,000 new jobs.  However, when they endeavoured to implement their rather hurriedly put together 14-point plan they managed in 1974-75 to have a minus of 18,000.  Not alone were they unable to maintain the people at work but we had a minus figure.  Unfortunately, 1975-76 was not much better, with 16,000 people losing their jobs.  For 1976-77, with this party taking over Government by the end of 1977, we can report 6,000 jobs created.  It has been said time and again in this House that in 1977 new jobs totalling 17,000 were <Col N="1272" /> created.  That is very much part of the Government's plan and programme as set out prior to the general election, and our commitments were very clearly spelt out.  The Opposition now like to cite a number of items in the manifesto as promises, but that was an integrated package which was put before the people and supported.  In 1975 when the Coalition Government were at the height of their financial planning they managed to have the State borrowing at 16.5 per cent and also achieved a minus 18,000 in the labour force.  This indicates a very muddled financial control situation which is equalled only by their comments on this budget.  They have neither the capacity nor the ability to programme or plan.  The former Minister for Finance last week when commenting on the budget was very critical of the fact that we have released a green paper and a Government white paper.  Unfortunately, after a number of promises during his term of office it was not possible, probably because of differences of opinion within the Cabinet at that time, to produce any document, even though our spokesman in Opposition called for some form of planning.</P>
    <P>We are now at stage 2 of the Government's programme for spending, planning and job creation.  We have 61 per cent of the capital programme invested in housing, schools, hospitals and roads, and that is what the community have been calling for.  That is where people see real worthwhile progress and development and that is the path this Government are going to follow.  A total 69 per cent plus an extra £250 million will go into Government investment programmes this financial year, which represents a major shift in State finances.  It indicates recognition of (1) the needs and (2) the job creation element.  We have aligned this major shift in Government spending on a target of 25,000 new jobs in 1979.  That is positively ambitious.</P>
    <P>Last week Deputy FitzGerald cited the variation between the Central Bank's figures and the Government's figures regarding inflation and productivity in 1979, and rightly so.  There is a small percentage in the difference which would be anticipated by any forward-looking <Col N="1273" /> financial expert.  We in power should endeavour to create the employment necessary and to set down ambitious programmes.  There is no point in any Government in our circumstances planning and programming for a stalemate situation.  We want to see Government spending cut back to 10.5 per cent and thus get the finances of this country back into a situation where at least it will not require a tremendous amount of the annual capital programme merely to service the national debt.  We want to see the State finances directed in the main towards job creation.  That is what this budget is intended to do, and we will not be deflected from that path.  We cannot afford to be.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable for certain Opposition spokesmen to decry what we have done for the less fortunate, if they do not say how they would have produced additional funds above the excellent increases we provided in the budget.  We gave a 16 per cent increase to long-term social welfare recipients and that is a respectable increase to a group who have no lobbying strength, who cannot send delegations to make detailed submissions.  The Government recognised that they are the less fortunate and for the first time in many years a real increase has been given to them.  Short-term social welfare recipients have received a 12 per cent increase. If we can produce the 25,000 new jobs an extra 25,000 people will be contributing to the national cake instead of requesting the State to supply them with a reasonable income.  The 25,000 new jobs will create a spin-off which will benefit about 75,000 people.  In 1979 there will be 25,000 people bringing in extra income.  In this way we will in due course alleviate poverty altogether.  If Opposition spokesmen decry the percentages social welfare recipients are getting they must come up with alternative proposals in relation to the management of the economy.</P>
    <P>From the comment of my constituents I feel that people have recognised the budget as a very comprehensive financial package which is workable even if ambitious.  We must not deviate from the Government programme on job creation. <Col N="1274" /> Job creation affects all other aspects of Government policy and if we achieve the 1979 job target we have set ourselves, we will have put the country on the right course.  One of the major factors in relation to our achieving our targets is a wage settlement.  It was very heartening last Sunday to hear one of the most prominent members of the trade union movement going into detail about the options open in relation to our 1979 wage settlement.  The Vice-President of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union and a member of the Congress could not agree to the percentage figure mentioned by the Government but they took a very positive and constructive line in relation to pay settlements.  There was a great desire not to create a similar situation to that which prevails in the UK where unco-operative unions just do not function. We must avoid that situation at all costs.  The members of the trade union movement charged with the responsibility of seeking increases for their members recognise that while we would all like to pay high percentages it is just not practical.  If we allowed the percentage which some unions request, we would forego the investment for job creation.  There is no point in the head of a household receiving a 10 or 15 per cent wage increase if his son or daughter cannot secure employment.  That is why I would urge the trade union movement to take into account the major undercurrent of job creation in our strategy.  The creation of new jobs hinges on a reasonable wage settlement and it is our duty to do all in our power to secure such a settlement.  The trade unions and the people in general must accept that they are part of the Government programme and they must play their part in our three-year programme for the abolition of unemployment.  We must encourage the people to accept that the abolition of unemployment is achievable, and thereby encourage the making of a reasonable wage settlement of about 4 per cent in 1979.  If we do that we will be working together for the country.  At the end of 1979, if the Government programme is achieved and if the co-operation of the power sectors in the Community is forthcoming, the Minister <Col N="1275" /> for Finance in his 1980 budget will be in a position once again to give real financial benefit to the less well off in the community.</P>

    <P>* The amounts shown in each year refer to the total multiannual expenditure on the projects approved for fund assistance in that year.  (In the case of industrial projects, the amounts refer to expenditure on industrial grants).</P>
    <P>** These figures show the overall fund contribution committed in respect of the multiannual expenditure on the projects approved for assistance in each year.  However, there is a time lag between commitment of the contribution and actual payments (details of which are given above) because payments are only made <i>pari passu</i> with national expenditure on projects.</P>
    <P>&dagger; These amounts represent the differences between the overall cost of the projects and the Regional Fund contribution.  (The fund contribution is (i) a maximum of 30 per cent of the cost in the case of infrastructure projects and (ii) either 50 per cent of State aid or 20 per cent of the investment cost, whichever is the lesser, in the case of industrial projects).  In practice, the overall cost is met in the first instance by the national authorities and the fund contribution is then recouped by the Government. Under existing arrangements, the fund recoupment is not paid to the authorities or investors concerned but is applied to the financing of increases in the Public Capital Programme.</P>

      <P>A preliminary engineering examination of coast protection proposals submitted by Cork County Council for the Ballycrenane-Garryvoe area of Ballycotton Bay has been completed and is being considered by the Commissioners of Public Works.  If, however, the Deputy is referring to the area at Ballycotton village itself the position is that the council has not submitted any proposal for this area. In any event, due to the protracted procedures necessary under the Coast Protection Act, 1963, it would be a considerable time before works could be undertaken either at Ballycrenane-Garryvoe or the village itself, assuming that the circumstances when fully examined warrant a protection scheme as defined in the Act for either area.</P>

      <P>A further property containing about ten hectares and commonage shares became vested in the Land Commission on 16 June 1978, but possession of these lands has not yet been obtained.

      <P>I inspected these quarters recently and have decided to initiate a programme for their phased replacement with modern dwellings.  Under the scheme which will be undertaken by the National Building Agency ltd., 68 new dwellings will be built in the form of two-storey blocks, each block containing four flats.  Each of the flats will have a lounge, a kitchendining room, a bathroom and a number of bedrooms.  While most of the flats will have three bedrooms, a number with four bedrooms and some with two bedrooms will be built.</P>
      <P>Every effort will be made to have the new dwellings provided at an early date. The first phase of the scheme providing for at least 12 dwelings, will be undertaken this year.</P>

      <Col N="1190" /> The information requested by the Deputy concerning the contribution from the Irish Government to each such project is not readily available and its compilation would involve an inordinate amount of research.  It may be assumed, however, that in general, the amount of contribution from Irish public funds towards each project, other than preparatory studies and pilot schemes, would be the same as the amount of Social Fund Grant for the project.  As regards projects for which fund assistance has been approved after 1 January 1978, the ratio of fund grant to national contribution would normally be 55:45, as a result of the higher intervention rate of 55 per cent for Irish projects introduced following the review of the fund in 1977.  In the case of preparatory studies and pilot schemes, the fund can contribute up to 50 per cent of the costs but no contribution from public funds is required.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour why the Redundancy Fund Accounts for 1976 were not laid before the Dáil until 8 February 1979, the date on which the accounts of the fund for each year since it was created were laid before the Dáil; if he considers information presented more than two years after the end of the year to which it relates is of value; and if such a delay is in conformity with the intention of the Dáil in requiring the laying before it of these accounts.</P>

      <P>Following the end of each accounting year of the Redundancy Fund, it is necessary, firstly, to obtain relevant information and to balance accounts which are operated by other Departments on an agency basis on behalf of the fund.  At this stage, an initial draft of the account of the Redundancy Fund is submitted informally to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for consideration.  The 1976 account of the Redundancy Fund was transmitted formally to the Comptroller and Auditor General on 25 July 1978.</P>
      <P>In subsequent discussions with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, some revisions in the format of the account were agreed in the interests of more informative presentation.  A revised account in final form was transmitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General on 19 October 1978.  The account was signed by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 21 December 1978.  In order to avoid printing delays, the account was presented in stencilled format.</P>

    <P>The preparation of the account for presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas takes place within the general context of accounting procedures of a number of Departments and the general auditing programme.  In the interest of having the information presented to the Oireachtas as early as feasible I have already directed that possible improvements in the procedures be examined in consultation with the other Departments concerned.</P>
