      <P>On the Order of Business yesterday I sought to raise a question on the Adjournment and I was informed by the Ceann Comhairle's Private Secretary that I would not be allowed because of what was described as ministerial attitude.  I can only interpret that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to appear to cut off Deputies but persisting in this questioning of the Chair's ruling is something the Chair cannot permit. There are other ways of doing this. If the Deputy wishes to consult my office he is welcome to do so at any time.</P>

      <P>I understand that <Col N="1112" /> ministerial attitude means that the Taoiseach refuses to fulfil his responsibilities in this House by answering.  But why should I be denied my right to air my views and question relevant matters in this House?  If the Taoiseach does not wish to answer, that is his own business. But I should not be denied my right to make my case, and it would appear from the reply I got and the reasons given for that reply that I am being denied my right and denied the facilities to fulfil my responsibilities as a public representative because the Taoiseach is not prepared to face up to his responsibilities to this House and to this country.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows perfectly well that it is disorderly to have discussion on these matters at this time in the House.  It is not in order and the Chair is responsible for keeping order.  The importance the Deputy attaches to a particular subject or matter does not permit the Chair to allow Deputies to be out of order.  The Chair is not responsible for what is ordered in the House, but he has a very definite guide as to what he will allow in relation to matters about which the Deputy is now speaking.  This is a matter on which the Taoiseach gave a long reply which, so far as the Chair is concerned, was a rather definite and conclusive reply.  The Chair must be guided by the Standing Order, which says matters on the same subject may not be raised within a certain period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be out of order.  I do not wish to be in conflict with the Chair.  However, I must insist on my right as a public representative to be able to make a reasonable case in an orderly way.  If the Taoiseach persistently refuses to live up to his responsibilities that does not justify the Chair's refusal to allow me to live up to my responsibilities as a public representative. This is not a question of the matter being important to my mind.  There is a very fundamental constitutional issue.</P>

      <P>I am not open to be questioned in this way.  My rulings should not be questioned, and all the precedents show that that is never permitted. I will say that anybody who reads the reply given to a number of questions on the subject which Deputy Cluskey is now attempting to raise will see that the Taoiseach's reply was sufficiently conclusive to leave no doubt in the mind of the Chair that this matter can be raised again.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to borrow temporarily such sums as it may require for current expenditure and to borrow on the security of its own lands and premises, without any guarantee by me, such sums as it may require for the purpose of purchasing capital equipment.  These latter powers will be exercised by the institute only where it can fully service the borrowing through the earnings effected with the equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> Before dealing with the Bill I would like to say something briefly about the institute and its operations.  This, I trust, will assist the Deputies to see the Bill in its proper setting.  Deputies are, no doubt, aware of the central objective of the institute: to promote the efficient operation of industry and to maintain and stimulate where possible industrial growth.  Its activities are distinguished from those of other State bodies such as CTT and IDA in that they are centred on industrial technology.  The function of the IIRS is to ensure that industry has access to and uses the most up-to-date technology available for the creation of wealth, high quality employment and a higher standard of living for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The institute strives to achieve this objective in two ways.  Firstly, the provision of technological advice to industry in the form of solving technical problems, providing technical information, and testing of manufactured products on behalf of firms to certify that they are up to certain standards of quality.  The demand for the services of the institute can be gauged from the £1.6 million income which the institute earned in 1978, over half of which came from charges for the services I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>Simply solving industry's problems, however, is not enough.  The institute also engages in applied research and development which can lead to the development of new industrial processes and products and to the creation of new jobs.  This research and development service now represents about 20 per cent of the institute's activities and the institute is hopeful of increasing this figure.  I am sure Deputies will agree with this aim; the more new products and ideas which originate in Irish-based industry, the more resources which are built up in Ireland for research and development, the more secure will our industrial base become.</P>
    <P>The institute also acts as technical adviser to the Government.  Indeed, as Deputies know, only recently the institute <Col N="1116" /> was given the lead role in the Government's Energy Saving Campaign.</P>
    <P>The institute receives the bulk of its funding from State sources.  In 1979 the total Exchequer grant-in-aid amounts to over £5.1 million, of which £1.4 million is earmarked for building and construction at the institute's headquarters at Ballymun Road, Glasnevin.  On top of this £5.1 million the institute expects to increase its earned income this year to over the £2 million mark.  It is this very growth in fee income which is one of the reasons for the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years the institute's income from clients has increased from £83,000 in 1968 to present levels.  In 1968, income as a percentage of the current expenditure of the institute came to only 15 per cent.  It now represents over 33 per cent.</P>
    <P>This increase in earned income has brought its attendant problems.  Experience has shown that because of the inevitable delays in clients settling their accounts, there is a substantial amount owing to the IIRS at the end of each accounting year.  This money is received in the early months of the following accounting year.  Since 1975 the outstanding amount has had to be financed by bank overdrafts to meet the cash flow problem at the end of the accounting year.  The Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961, makes no specific provision for borrowing powers for the institute.  Section 2 (1) of this Bill proposes to permit the institute, with my consent and the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, to borrow temporarily by arrangements with bankers such sums as it may require for the purpose of providing for current expenditures.</P>
    <P>Deputies can be assured that these overdrafts will be cleared very quickly in the new accounting year, when the first instalment of Exchequer funds for the new Vote year is paid.  This has been the practice since 1975, and the overdraft facility has been a purely year-end phenomenon brought about by a combination <Col N="1117" /> of the usual delays in clients paying bills and the sharp growth in income from clients.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes in section 2 (2) to extend the borrowing powers of the institute to cover the acquisition of capital equipment which can pay for itself on a self-financing basis from the fee income of the institute.  With the increasing technological content of our exports in recent years, and the demand for certification of exports as meeting certain standards, it is more and more obvious that there are certain areas of product testing where the income generated from testing is capable of paying for the investment necessary to meet the demand. This Bill proposes, therefore, that in such cases the institute be allowed to borrow money on the security of its own assets&mdash;its lands and buildings&mdash; without State guarantee for the repayment of the sums borrowed. These borrowing powers will only be exercised with my consent and with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance. Indeed, in relation to capital equipment in general it is essential for the institute to have equipment which is as technologically advanced as that available to its clients.  These borrowing powers should assist the institute in keeping abreast of technological change in equipment needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise in advance to the Minister of State for the fact that I cannot be here when she comes to reply. I do not intend any discourtesy in putting questions, the replies to which I will not be present to hear, assuming that she is good enough to deliver such replies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment on a couple of points which arise on the central section of the Bill.  Section 2 (1) has been explained by the Minister of State as intended to allow the institute a certain amount of elbow room in regard to <Col N="1118" /> covering difficulties which cash flow problems might cause at the end of the year when outstanding debts have not been paid.  I understand that a business whose entire income is derived from people with whom it does business and which gets no money from any other source may need to have recourse to a bank until such time as people begin to pay the sums owed.  That is not the case with this institute.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has recited the very welcome and much to be applauded increase in the proportion of the institute's revenue derived from fees for testing this and that, but that proportion still adds up to much less than half of the institute's entire revenue, representing only one-third.  It cannot be the case that the institute is strapped for money at the end of the year merely because there are bills which have not been paid.  If the only source of income were fees for these tests, of course that would be an understandable point of view.  But the Minister in putting the matter as she has&mdash;although I appreciate she has read only what she has been told to read&mdash;has skated over the fact that if the funding of the institute from State sources were adequate the temporary shortage caused by the delay in meeting accounts would not arise.  I hope I have made that point sufficiently clear.  Only one-third of the institute's revenue is accounted for by clients; and if there is a squeeze for money at the end of the year it is due not only to clients being slow in paying up but also to the inadequate funding of which the chairman of the IIRS has repeatedly complained in recent years.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the amount of the State grant to the institute has increased every year in real terms except in 1975, which was the depth of the recession and in which year a large number of public services had to be pruned.  For the kind of work which it is the institute's duty to do these step by step increases are obviously not adequate.  I know it is easy for Members on this side to call for further expenditure and it is not so easy on the Government's side, because <Col N="1119" /> enough must be kept for all the other little thrushes in the nest with their beaks permanently open.  I think we are agreed that the major&mdash;perhaps the only&mdash;growth area in the Irish economy is industry in one shape or form.  I do not think anyone would quarrel with the idea that the maintenance of standards and assistance to industry in making the right product and maintaining its perfection is absolutely vital.  If money has to be skimped it must not be skimped on that.  But it is not good enough for the Government to pretend that the purpose of this subsection is merely to relieve the difficulties caused by delay in meeting accounts, when the difficulties are a cumulative result of a slowness in paying accounts and of the fact that the institute does not get enough money from the State.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first subsection, I was somewhat foxed until I heard the speech of the Minister of State by the expression &ldquo;the institute may borrow temporarily by arrangement with bankers&rdquo;. As far as I know all borrowings are temporary. There is no such thing as a permanent loan of money; there may be permanent loans of items of antiquarian interest to museums and so on but, by definition, a borrowing is temporary.  I do not know how one goes about borrowing money unless it is by arrangement with the person lending the money. The expression &ldquo;temporarily by arrangement&rdquo; is merely redundant verbiage.  The subsection fails completely to make explicit the matter which the Minister of State explained, namely, that in each case it is only a matter of helping the institute over the end of the year into the early months of the spring.  I am not making a meal out of this.  All I am saying is that I think it is a rather odd piece of drafting inasmuch as the words &ldquo;temporarily by arrangement with bankers&rdquo; might just as easily be dropped from the subsection and it would mean exactly the same thing except that I suppose the word &ldquo;bankers&rdquo; implies that they cannot borrow from anyone other than a bank. Otherwise it does not seem to me to <Col N="1120" /> delineate the duty or the rights of the institute in any way.  If it is the explicit intention of the Government that the borrowing power should only run into the early months of the year and no further&mdash;I am not saying I would necessarily support such a policy&mdash;it does not come through in this subsection.</P>
    <P>The second subsection was the subject of an even stranger lapse on the part of the Minister of State and of the Department. She said:</P>
    <P>With the increasing technological content of our exports in recent years, and the demand for clarification of exports as meeting certain standards, it is more and more obvious that there are certain areas of product testing where the income generated from testing is capable of paying for the investment necessary to meet the demand...</P>
    <P>That is, in the purchase of capital equipment. The income from testing is only a minor fraction of the revenue of the institute. It is not good enough to say that the reason the institute may need a leg up in the purchase of capital equipment is to give it increased scope for earning revenue, because the institute has functions other than testing and the Minister adverted to them a few moments ago. The institute has functions that are inherently incapable of earning fees; it has functions <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Minister himself in respect of which presumably fees cannot be charged.  The chairman of the institute has drawn attention to the fact that a large proportion of the work they do and of the expenses involved are by their nature not capable of earning fees.</P>
    <P>I am not technically instructed and, therefore, I cannot guess how much, but presumably much of that work if it is to be of any use must depend on adequate capital equipment.  We are talking here about the acquisition of capital equipment for purposes that are not necessarily fee earning and some of which cannot be fee earning.  Why cannot the Minister and the Government recognise that we are talking about the proper equipping of an institute which <Col N="1121" /> has a spectrum of functions of which fee-earning testing for industry is but one function?  If the institute is needed&mdash;and it is&mdash;it should be properly funded.  Let us not pretend, as the Minister of State has done, that it is merely in connection with the testing function that provision has to be made for funding the purchase of capital equipment.  The institute needs capital equipment even if it never had a testing function or never earned a fee from industry.  That was almost the situation as recently as ten years ago. The Minister said that in 1968 the income from testing was only £85,000&mdash;a flea bite.</P>
    <P>I dislike the way in which this measure is being slipped through as though it was only the testing function which called for the investment of capital equipment.  The Minister has not explained the very curious provision&mdash;in my experience the unique provision but I do not pretend to have all our legislation at my fingertips&mdash;in subsection (2) which specifically excludes the Minister from guaranteeing any borrowing carried out by the institute. The subsection specifies that the institute may only borrow on the security of its land and buildings.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of either one House or the other for more than ten years and I have watched much legislation going through, but offhand I cannot recall another Bill in which a State body is limited in this way.  If I am wrong about this, I am quite willing to take it back.  I cannot recall any legislation which said that a State body could borrow only on the security of their land or premises.  That necessarily puts an automatic ceiling on the borrowing they can do because a banker will not lend on more than a certain proportion of the estimated value of the security.  It would be more frank if the Minister were to say the State body can borrow to the extent of some hundreds of thousands of pounds or a few million pounds.  So far as I know there is no precedent for this in other legislation.  I shall not be here when the Minister is replying but I shall ask one of my colleagues to note her reply to my specific question whether there is any precedent for empowering a <Col N="1122" /> State body to borrow only on the security of their own land and premises and in no other way and where the Minister is specifically excluded from guaranteeing the loan.  If there is a precedent it may be that the Minister will also be able to supply an explanation for this curious mode.  If there is not a precedent or if no explanation is forthcoming, I should like to ask the House to take a little interest in what is happening here.  We have here a State-sponsored body performing a work of major national importance who are being held at arms length. Something less than trust is being reposed in them; they are being given something less than a vote of confidence. The Government are showing themselves less than willing to back them in their requirements.  The whole thing is being done in a system of presentation which tends to obscure this truth and to shove the whole issue off onto the exigencies of testing and temporary cash flow difficulties.</P>
    <P>The brutal naked truth seems to be that the institute needs money but the Government cannot give it any.  That is not an uncommon thing with State-sponsored bodies, but when one thinks of the immense sums that CIE are able to swallow almost without rating a headline and when one considers the niggling sums we are dealing with here in long term work comparable in importance with the work of CIE, one must ask oneself if the Government have scraped the bottom of the barrel so fast that they cannot even provide £1 million or £2 million which would make a great difference to the institute.  Why cannot the Government bring in a Supplementary Estimate for the institute if it has a shopping list of capital equipment which it wants to buy?  Are we so far down the drain with regard to revenue that all the institute is able to borrow is something on the rather modest security of its own modest land and buildings?  I am sure they have a fairly substantial sale value if such a thing were to happen and the institute's equipment must be worth a great deal.  But it is still a very niggardly and, as the Germans say, step-motherly way of dealing with this child of the <Col N="1123" /> State which should be one of its most favoured offsprings.  I shall ask one of my colleagues to require from the Minister an absolutely clear statement in that regard, whether there is any precedent for this form that we see in subsection (2) and, whether there is or not, what is the reason for adopting it rather than allowing the institute, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to borrow with a State guarantee as is normally the case with all State-sponsored bodies, whether the ESB, Nitrigin Éireann, or the Industrial Development Authority.  We have seen several Bills go through in the past couple of years in which astronomical sums were put within the borrowing capacity of State bodies of one kind or another, of course with ministerial permission, but then enjoying the benefit of ministerial guarantee.</P>
    <P>The final thing I want to say&mdash;and I hope the Minister will not regard it as a blow beneath the belt&mdash;is something which again she may wish to contradict or put me right about.  This Bill was circulated on 15 August.  It came through my post in the ordinary way.  I saw it, I suppose, on 16 August, looked at it briefly, noted the peculiar provision in the second subsection of section 2 and put it aside.  A little later in a non-official context I had an encounter&mdash;the Minister will understand if I do not specify the person or persons&mdash;from which it became evident that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards did not know that this Bill had been presented and perhaps did not even know that it was in the pipeline.  It was only when I passed on the information that the Bill had arrived in my post that it came within the knowledge of the institute that such a Bill had been drafted and presented.  If that is wrong I should like the Minister to contradict it.  I can certainly vouch for my memory and the genuineness of the encounter I have described, but if there is a mistake or misunderstanding somewhere I should like the Minister to clear it up.  If there is no mistake and this is in fact the case, as <Col N="1124" /> I believe it is, that the institute did not know about this Bill, I should like to know the background to the institute being treated in such a way.  I should like to know if there is any precedent for it particularly in the case of a child of the State which instead of being treated at arms length should be warmly cherished by it.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say except for the usual expression which is expected of spokesmen and which in our case is very eagerly and warmly forthcoming, the usual expression of congratulation to the institute for all its hard work and the expression of our good wishes for its future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards could play a pivotal and very dynamic role in the further development of Irish industry but I have considerable doubt that as presently operated it is playing such a role or that without very considerable change it could play such a role.  I have chosen these words carefully.  They are somewhat outside the ambit of this Bill and I hope to elaborate on them directly to the Minister on another occasion.  I do not propose to do so at this stage.  I have held these views for some time and I hold them very strongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill itself we are dealing with permission to the Institute to borrow temporarily for current expenditure. There is no quibble on our part about such permission being given.  Like Deputy Moore here, I am a member of a local authority and each year end and often in mid-year we seek temporary accommodation. This should be a normal part of the powers of any State-sponsored body.  There is nothing unusual in giving that power to the institute. Naturally, such borrowings are extremely expensive and the difficulty with permissive borrowings even at local authority level is that they tend to become a normal feature of work.  This can be open to question.  It can mean that in the last quarter of every year the pressure is no longer on the accounting officers to bring in the money nor is the <Col N="1125" /> pressure there very frequently to ensure that one lives within one's budget for a full 12 months.  Inevitably where borrow ings of that nature are permitted there is always a tendency to avail of accommodation because the taxpayer at the end of the year is picking up the tab.  But since such temporary borrowings are subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance and also the consent of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy I have no doubt that the borrowings and arrangements with bankers will be stringently checked.  That should apply to every State-sponsored body. Either we provide sufficient funds in the current budget to enable it to operate on a normal basis throughout the full twelve months accounting period or we do not. If we do not, we should be very careful about sanctioning temporary borrowings, particularly nowadays when one is sanctioning substantial profits for the bankers concerned who pick up 17 or 20 per cent interest on such borrowings.  We are not in the business of transferring taxpayers' money to the bankers just because some of our State-sponsored bodies do not keep within their normal 12 months' budget.  That is not to say that the institute has been in any way negligent in that respect.  By and large it has managed to keep within its financial allocations.  On that aspect of the Bill, section 2 (1), I have no quibble and our approval is given.  I regard section 2 (2) as somewhat unusual.  I am not quite clear as to the precise intention of the Department or the Minister in advancing what I would regard as such an unusual&mdash;if not unique&mdash;financial provision in respect of the day-to-day operation of a State-sponsored body.</P>
    <P>We have a situation where, for capital purposes, State borrowing powers can be exercised for certain capital expenditures provided that the cost of such borrowing is met from the fees earned from such equipment.  This is unusual. The Minister might seriously have another look at it.  I have a fair knowledge of quite a number of State-sponsored bodies throughout the country and I do not know of any where powers for the purchase of capital equipment <Col N="1126" /> are granted only where it can fully service the borrowing through the earnings effected by the equipment.  That means, in effect, that within the IIRS now one would have two criteria for capital borrowing.  The Minister, apparently, has said to the institute: &ldquo;If you want to buy that particular piece of capital invested equipment, if you want to spend a half million pounds on it and to borrow to buy it, you may so do, provided the fees earned by that equipment pay for the borrowing&rdquo;.  That is a bit odd, to say the least.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of capital expenditure within the institute to which the same criterion does not apply.  The institute has purchased a good deal of capital equipment over the years.  If my memory serves me right, the institute has even received capital equipment on a gift basis from industry over the years, so there are several types of capital equipment in the institute, material received from manufacturers to equip the institute generally in several divisions; material bought, perhaps out of the institute's current expenditure; capital equipment which it has bought out of capital allocations and equipment which now, apparently, it is going to buy and will only be permitted to buy from borrowings provided that the fees from such equipment pay for the borrowing&mdash;I could see the Committee of Public Accounts casting a jaundiced eye on such an odd management criterion being laid down by a Government Department towards a State-sponsored body.</P>
    <P>Of course current capital borrowings must be paid for, and I fully agree that any borrowing powers invested in the institute for capital expenditure should be exercised only with the consent and concurrence of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  However, to incorporate it in the formal layout of the Bill is indeed rather unusual, unless it is intended to be a temporary provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, as is public knowledge, appointed consultants to the IIRS in relation to future developmental work and the whole role of services for <Col N="1127" /> Irish industry.  Whether their work will encompass all that is contained in the Bill and the report remains to be seen. Perhaps we should have a new Bill relating to the institute itself.  That may come about and I would certainly welcome it.</P>
    <P>With these somewhat jaundiced comments on the provisions of the Bill, we would not, in any way, stand in the way of the Minister and the Department in giving the institute the power to borrow for temporary current expenditure or for capital expenditure.  On that basis, we approve of the Bill.  As I said in the very first part of my contribution, I believe we could have a consolidation of legislation relating to the institute.  The 1961 Act is now rather dated.  The functions as laid down under this Act are still quite broad, but should be updated.  As we enter the 1980s, I suggest there is a good case to be made for a root and branch examination of the 1961 Act within the Department, consolidation with this present Bill and the bringing forward of a new Act in the early 1980s.  Irish technological development has changed dramatically since enactment by this House of the original 1961 Act.  Indeed, in the context of the report which the Minister will receive in due course from the consultants, it may well be that such an Act could also incorporate, if necessary, the consultants' report.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I approve of the Bill. With the very considerable changes in the whole structure and role and operation of the IIRS, I can see it making a tremendous contribution to Irish industry provided, for example, the work of the institute was integrated and properly co-ordinated with the work of other Irish developmental agencies in the technological field, whether with the Irish Productivity Agency, the Irish Management Institute, the National Board of Science and Technology or atomic energy institutes and so on.  I see a major role developing for the institute. It will require considerable political courage and muscle to get to grips with <Col N="1128" /> the situation, but that could be done. This Bill in no way purports to do that but, in so far as it provides a measure of accounting relief to the institute, I certainly support the Bill and we do not at this stage intend putting forward any amendments to it, although the Minister might seriously consider deleting from the Bill that section relating to the fees from capital expenditure.  Rather than spend time going back to the Department of Finance to have the Bill amended, it is better to let it go through in its present form and see how it works out in the long term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very few Members of the House who would oppose the Bill and I add my voice to welcome it and to compliment the Minister on its contents, brief as they are.  The IIRS is now 33 years old and we can see the stamp of the late Seán Lemass on its whole conception.  I pay tribute to the staff for their great work and the confidence they have given to Irish industry.</P>
      <P>This is a very short Bill.  Deputy John Kelly queried why the institute should borrow in this way without guarantee.  I look on the Bill as a vote of confidence in the institute, that they will be able, without any guarantee, to raise sufficient moneys for themselves.  This shows a confidence that the institute has displayed in handling technological problems in industry.  It is a vote of confidence in the institute that the Minister should have devised the Bill in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would question, perhaps, the institute's accountancy.  The Minister's brief mentions that it has got quite a lot of money and it is wrong, when people are taxed to finance the work of the institute, that industrial firms benefiting from the techniques of the institute should not pay more promptly.  Why should the taxpayer have to pay on time if industry does not?  The institute might ask their accountant to examine the possibility of charging interest on money owed because this might encourage people to pay what they owe.  A poor struggling firm which cannot pay will be excused but there are big firms which use <Col N="1129" /> the services of the institute and which could pay more quickly.  That is a very small point.</P>
    <P>The institute provides a great service but I wonder if it goes far enough.  It provides 66 services for industry but the ordinary man in the street does not know much about them.  I see the institute as being a very powerful factor in helping to keep down the costs of manufactured goods, whether it be clothing, footwear, food or anything else.  By its examination of products it ensures a very high standard.  This ensures that people are not buying faulty goods and wasting their money.  At the same time the institute is ensuring that our exports are of a standard that they can be sold in competition with similar products of other countries.  Many countries demand high standards for their imports.</P>
    <P>Could the institute examine and report on our imports?  If those goods do not reach the required standard, the institute could warn the public not to buy faulty or substandard commodities because they would not be getting value for money.  In that way it would raise the standard of our imports.  We want our people to buy more home-produced goods but we must always import certain goods.  We have all seen very shoddy imported footwear and wearing apparel.  The institute could help the housewife to buy quality goods, whether they are imported or home produced.  I have the utmost confidence in its ability to do this.</P>
    <P>I would like them to give more time and attention to the construction industry. They are doing a great service for which that industry is very thankful. The building industry division is number 1 in the main service.  On building sites one sees a great deal of materials being wasted.  Perhaps they are not durable enough to stand up to the treatment they get because a building site is not a place where materials are handled in a delicate way.  A young couple buying a house are paying for that waste.  I would like the institute to set a standard for the products which go into the building of a house or factory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> This institute is one of our best semi-State bodies.  I cannot praise it highly enough.  I have had experience in dealing with it because it advised a firm I know very well on certain matters.</P>
    <P>As regards new techniques and new industries it must be remembered that without the institute we would not have made very much progress in the industrial sector.  It must increase its services. This will call for a big increase in staff and that should not be denied to it. A great Englishman once said that never was so much owed by so many to so few.  I feel the same about the institute.  It works quietly, does a great job and the people have confidence in it.  No money must be spared to enable it to expand. The Minister is giving the institute power to borrow.  Even without that the Government would ensure the institute would not be impeded by a lack of finance.</P>
    <P>There are other State enterprises which are not so successful.  While it is not my intention to examine their records, I want to say that if semi-State industries patterned themselves on the IIRS, we would have a very efficient industrial sector.  Practically every facet of the industry is covered by its activities.  It provides 66 services.  There is a tremendous task facing it.  We know that because of technological knowledge, industry is facing a huge cutback in personnel. It is said that in the age we are entering there will be many thousands of workers made redundant.  It is not good for a man to be idle and out of work. People will have more leisure time.  The institute might perhaps provide another service to industry on how to prepare for leisure.  When it is examining techniques it would be a soulless exercise if it had not a social aspect to its planning.  We must have concern for people involved in industry.  It is not enough to invent machinery to produce cheaper goods if it means the wholesale displacement of workers.</P>
    <P>The great tragedy of the industrial revolution was that there was no social aspect involved in it.  We know the terrible results and misery that created for <Col N="1131" /> many people in industrialised countries. We were lucky to have escaped the worst aspects of the industrial revolution. We must have a more humane approach to these matters.  I have the utmost confidence in the IIRS and in its ability to advise industry technologically as to what they should do.  However, all the planning would go for nought if there is no humanising influence in it.  Planning is not the end, it is only the means to an end to improve the quality of life of those engaged in industry.</P>
    <P>If the institute needs to increase staff it should do so.  I do not know whether or not the staff is adequate but I would not deny it an increase in staff to engage in another activity.  Thirty-three years is not a long time in the life of a nation.  We are indebted to the institute for the service it gives to industry.  In the book, it illustrates the services offered and it works in conjunction with other agencies such as the IDA, CCT and so on.  It should take steps to publicise its efforts so that its services will be availed of more.  CTT would naturally tell prospective developers that this excellent institute is here to advise them.  The IDA, in deciding the location and nature of an industry, also avails of its services.  That is essential and leads to the creation of new industries.</P>
    <P>I read that in the United States a firm had trouble with the control of effluent from a factory.  They were advised by a body similar to the institute and have perfected plant to control it.  It was so successful that there was a great demand for the filter and it led to the creation of an industry.  We are only a small country and we have big neighbours.  We must compete with them and we are doing so successfully, thanks to bodies like the IIRS.  Are we aware of the great work it is doing?  I know that the Government are and Deputy Kelly's remarks were somewhat amazing.  He mentioned that it was unaware of the preparation of this Bill.  I am sure he had some basis for saying that but I can hardly believe it.  The IIRS has perhaps silent servers but that does not detract from its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> I do not see any faults in the Bill.  I am sure the institute will continue to provide a great service.  I would ask it to include a social dimension in its activities.  If it perfects a new technique that would produce goods in less time than was originally taken and with fewer people, it should employ a sociologist to advise it on what should happen to the people displaced by the new techniques.  Industry must not be allowed to discard people. They have the protection of the various redundancy Acts but we must watch this carefully.</P>
    <P>The institute has the task of helping industry to become stronger.  It will not become stronger if we forget the human element involved.  I have every confidence that the institute can bring in this humanising influence.  I am sure people would not begrudge any money to do this.  They are facing a tough future. With our entry into the EEC and the dismantling of tariff barriers Irish manufacturers must be as competent as foreign manufacturers.  We would not have reached our present high level of industrial production but for the IIRS.  It is a tribute to the institute and the Minister.</P>
    <P>The IIRS is a tribute to the late Seán Lemass who, 33 years ago in 1946, founded it.  It was only a year after the second world war ended.  The institute has done a great job for the country.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very much aware of the splendid work carried out by the IIRS.  We would wish to assist this important national work.  As Deputy Moore has pointed out this institute was set up in 1946 by Seán Lemass.  The late Seán Lemass was Taoiseach when the Industrial Research and Development Bill was passed in 1961.  Part VI of that Act deals with the seal of the institute, the offices and premises, the officers and servants, superannuation, scholarships and grants for industrial research, the State endowment of the institute, the power to charge fees, subscriptions from industrial firms and other bodies, the power to accept donations, finances, accounts, <Col N="1133" /> audits and annual report.  I wonder why it was decided then that the premises of the institute should not be mortgaged.  I believe that the people who helped to formulate the Act decided to grant independence to the institute.  Let us be clear that those involved in the important work of industrial research must be granted independence.  The staff of the institute are working on behalf of the elected Government and for the good of the State.  It is my view that they must be granted independence and freedom from worry of meeting overdrafts and mortgage repayments.  For that reason, I am concerned with the purpose for which this Bill has been introduced.  I believe that my views are similar to the views expressed in 1946 and 1961.</P>
      <P>This Bill will be the cause of concern for many people.  I believe that our best scientists, engineers and technologists are working in the institute.  We attracted these people to the institute because they felt that they were Government backed and financed and that there was no danger of a serious cash situation arising.</P>
      <P>In regard to section 2 (2), I grant that there could be a reason for granting the institute power to make temporary borrowings for current expenditure. However, I would say: thus far shall thou go and no further.  I believe that the inclusion of section 2 (2) is a grave mistake and questions the seriousness of the Government in regard to industrial research and development.  We must remember that research and development are important in this industrial age. It causes me concern to note that the institute which, as Deputy Moore said, has been prospering for 33 years without having to mortgage its land and premises, will now be able to mortgage them without the guarantee of the Minister.  Why is he unwilling to give them a guarantee?  Is he shy or is he frightened?  It amazes me that the institute is now prepared to mortgage its land and premises without a Government guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister and her advisors are aware that we spend less on research and development than other <Col N="1134" /> European countries.  I should like to quote some figures on research and development in 1975 which were published by the National Science Council in September 1977.  These figures were produced during the term of the National Coalition Government.  The Minister may say that we did not spend much in 1975 on research and development, and I will admit that that was so because I want to be fair about this matter. Page 48 of the report gives a comparison of total research and development expenditures per head of population both here and in other countries. The US spent 2.3 per cent, Germany spent 2.1 per cent, Japan spent 1.7 per cent, the UK spent 2.1 per cent, Switzerland 2.2 per cent, the Netherlands 1.9 per cent, Austria 1 per cent and we here in Ireland spent .9 per cent.  According to this table the only countries spending less than ourselves are Spain and Portugal with 0.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is something about which we should be worried.  I have made inquiries and I understand from the figures for 1978 that they have remained more or less static, that they have changed fractionally only in respect of any of those countries.  In other words, the amount of money at present being spent on research and development is more or less similar to that spent in 1975.  I believe there is an obligation on us to spend a larger amount of money in respect of research and development than we are doing, because it is there that our hope for the future lies.  There lies also our hope for the expansion of industrial development.  Our expenditure on research and development, expressed as a percentage of our gross national product, is 0.9 per cent not nearly sufficient for a country like ours, slow for many years in making a major breakthrough in regard to industrial development.</P>
    <P>For that reason we have an amount of ground to make up in comparison with other countries.  Those figures I have quoted were carefully prepared, are accurate and are available for inspection in the Library here in Leinster House.  I am <Col N="1135" /> pointing this out because we are already behind.  Now, with ground to be made up, we are deciding that we will moragage our lands and equipment for this institute without even a guarantee from any member of the Government, the Minister for Finance or anybody else.  It is a matter that causes me concern. I would seriously urge the Minister to review section 2 (2) because that is a subsection that causes me great concern.</P>
    <P>I might just mention to the Minister some of the things on which we are missing out here in regard to industrial research and development.  For example, from 24-27 October 1978 there was held a meeting and a type of exhibition organised by the Midland Regional Development Organisation in Athlone dealing with industrial components, many items imported here annually.  At that exhibition the Irish Goods Council had some 800 samples of low and medium type technological components, small items of equipment used in industry and utilised by some 58 firms in the Midland Regional Development Organisation, which is comprised of five counties.  These were small, simple components, of which some £6 million worth is imported into this country annually because most of them are not manufactured here.  Some may have been but the firms concerned were not aware of that fact.  What I want to get across clearly to the Minister is that this was £6 million worth of goods, the vast majority of which could have been manufactured here with the help and assistance of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, by their applying their minds to it and assisting, advising and encouraging such activity.  I believe that the greater portion of those £6 million could have been saved.</P>
    <P>That was in one region only but I am sure other regions would have the same story to relate.  For example, I remember a representative of the Irish Goods Council appearing on the Late Late Show one evening exhibiting those types of components from another region. <Col N="1136" /> Therefore, throughout the length and breadth of the country there could be something in the region of £40 million to £50 million saved annually with assistance from the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  At least a sizeable amount of that money could be saved had we given full support to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  Therefore it is important that we make a major effort to spend more money on this very important work being carried out by that institute.</P>
    <P>In relation to the amount of money being spent by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, and the amount of money allocated to them annually, it is no harm to recapitulate.  I have here their annual report for the years ending 31 December 1976 and 31 December 1977.  I have also the Book of Estimates for the year ending 31 December 1979 which incorporates the year 1978.  The Vote for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards&mdash;I am quoting now from the Book of Estimates, page 146, subhead F1&mdash;is divided into two subheads: Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, Administration and General Expenditure, Grant-in-Aid, and then: Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, Capital Expenditure, Grant-in-Aid.  In the year 1975 the total grant-in-aid under the first subhead for general revenue expenditure and capital equipment amounted to £2,966,000.  In 1976 the amount was £3,240,000; in 1977 it was £3,684,000; in 1978, £3,468,000 and in 1979 the estimate is £3,675,000.  Those figures are interesting in that under the first subhead, general revenue expenditure and capital equipment, there was a reduction in 1978.  I agree that a sizeable amount was made available by the Government towards buildings.  I accept that improvements took place and a large amount of money was made available for land and buildings but, in regard to research and development and the purchasing of capital equipment, it is of the utmost importance that we continue to make money available.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we meet the total <Col N="1137" /> revenue necessary to keep in line with inflation. That is the basic minimum I would be prepared to accept: revenue must keep in line with inflation.  It is my belief that more money should be granted to research and development.  We are not keeping in line with inflation and I am anxious to know why.  It is a mistake not to keep in line with inflation.  As a country dependant on industrial expansion we must keep in line with industrial research.  In regard to providing for current expenditure, I agree, with some reservations, to granting the institute, with the consent of the Minister and the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, subject to certain conditions, permission to borrow temporarily from banks such sums as the institute may require. However, to allow a situation to develop that the institute would borrow on the security of it's own land and premises and without any guarantee by the Minister would be a serious step which we must question.  We need to keep pace with scientific and technological development but we cannot have the institute's work curtailed through lack of finance from the Government and being forced to borrow from different national or international banking groups.  There are many dangers in such a situation.  The institute is of major national importance and we cannot allow that body to mortgage its land and premises.  We must cry stop to such a move.  I would be failing in my duty if I did not call on the Government to stop such an approach.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Moore pointed out, the institute, which commenced operations in 1946, has prospered and developed without having to mortgage its land and premises.  We should not decide to put the premises of such a body at risk by allowing them to be mortgaged.  There is an obligation on me to cry halt because it would be a mistake to allow those premises to be mortgaged.  I am opposed to section 2 (2).</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome an opportunity to speak on this brief and concise Bill, which contains three sections <Col N="1138" /> amounting to 31 lines.  However, there are two basic principles involved in it: borrowing arrangements for current expenditure and permitting the institute to purchase certain units, which would be self-financing, with its own guarantee of its land and premises.  I appreciate why Deputy Enright is worried about this section because usually when such enabling Bills come before the House they are for the purpose of getting money or guarantees from the State.  In most cases we simply have to, by virtue of the type of concern involved, keep the State plunging money into such concerns. However, in this instance we are dealing with a concern that has proved its worth.  The procedure set out in the Bill is one of confidence in the IIRS which has proved to be very effective in applied technology.  Section 2 (2) permits the institute to purchase capital equipment, which would be self-financing, with its own collateral.  What is wrong with that?  Why restrict the institute and put it into the groups that depend on money from the State or State guarantees?</P>
      <P>This Bill represents a vote of confidence in the IIRS.  It has been a frontrunner in industry, quality control and applied and functional technology.  The institute is very up to date and its purpose is to create technology to improve working and living conditions.  It also works for better quality of employment. The institute achieves these aims through a constant active role and has a vital role to play in a continuing cycle of monitoring and assessing our development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The institute continues to grapple with new ideas and to innovate.  It should be allowed a certain amount of freedom to acquire equipment, which on a fee per item basis will pay for itself and the servicing of the borrowing for this.  This is a good policy which ought to be developed.  They assess equipment, they monitor its performance, they look after the area of profits control and they offer a very important aspect of certification whereby they underwrite industrial products from this country.  This could be compared with the &ldquo;Guaranteed <Col N="1139" /> Irish&rdquo; symbol in many aspects.  They not alone underwrite these exports but the jobs of the Irish industrial worker.</P>
    <P>Many of us do not consider how effective the IIRS has been in society, but its effectiveness can be seen when one looks at standardisation and specifications and sees the IIRS stamp.  Doors, windowframes and so on used in the construction industry all bear the IIRS stamp. The jobs of many industrial workers are underwritten through this process of certification and product control.</P>
    <P>It has built up a national and international reputation in the field of industrial research and standardisation.  It has done so by hard work and continuing assessment.  It also plays the role of an impartial referee in the social economic world.  It looks at services to industry and builds them up.  On a visit to the IIRS with other Dáil Deputies a few years ago, we had the wonderful experience of seeing this concentrator in action, the European space agency concentrator, which links up with the documentation library service computer in Rome.  It is a fantastic opportunity and investment for Irish industry, whereby through computerisation the most up-to-date papers, information and documentation is made available to us.  It is right that this concentrator should be located at the IIRS and there is no better location.  Perhaps the Minister when replying will offer some further information about the usage and demand for this concentrator.  I would also like to know about the costings to firms for the use of it.  I am aware that the National Science Council offered money a few years ago to help firms initially, but I would like to know what the position is now.  I hope that many of the newer Dáil Deputies will have the opportunity to go along to the IIRS and see what actually happens there on the ground, in applied technology and to see this research concentrator at work.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why this Bill is before us is that this concentrator offers information and it is part and parcel of <Col N="1140" /> the overall system within the IIRS of earning on this earned income basis.  It would be wonderful for accounting if the books for a year were closed in the same year.  Deputy O'Toole is the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee of which I am a member, and we would both like to see the books for any year closed in that year.  However, in practice a certain amount of carryover takes place.  This is one of the problems for the IIRS.  There has been such a demand for information and for advice, that fees are not paid within the year, and this section enables the IIRS to borrow for current expenditure to get over this.  If we look at a table from annual reports on the income from clients, under the heading, Fees Earned Basis, we see that in 1976 the income for the IIRS on this fees earned basis was £912,614, in 1977 it had jumped to £1,149,921, in 1978 to £1,600,000 and in 1979 the estimate at over £200,000 was for £2,031,000.  This indicates why section 2, part 1 of this Bill is very important.</P>
    <P>There has been a huge expansion in demand, but I would question one or two aspects of this.  Perhaps in his reply the Minister will tell who actually monitors the fee rate of the IIRS.  We are very much aware of the numerous requests from industry, technologists and researchers which has brought about this big boost in the fees earned column, but I would like to know the criterion for the fixing of this fees rate basis.  This is one of the most important aspects of this section.</P>
    <P>In order to allow the IIRS to innovate, Part II of the Bill is vital.  It enables the institute, on security of their land and premises, to raise money for a very specific purpose, that is, to purchase equipment which will become self-financing. If one reads the table under the heading Fees Earned why should one not have confidence in the ability of the IIRS to evolve in this fashion?  Why should one feel, like Deputy Enright, that the State should continuously guarantee and offer money?  It might be no harm to look at the table of grant-in-aid under the heading Building and Lands.  In 1976 the <Col N="1141" /> grant-in-aid under this heading was £650,000, in 1977 it was £718,000, in 1978 it was £944,000 and in 1979 it was £1,444,000.  If we look at the gap, the increase between 1976 and 1977 was of the magnitude of £68,000.  In the following year it increased by £226,000 and in a later period by £500,000.  That shows confidence.  It is a practical example of Fianna Fáil policy at work for Irish industry. When people ask what are the Government doing for industry, what is being done in job promotion, those are general questions.  One must look at specifics such as these which indicate clearly what is being done, what has been done, and what must be done if we want industrial expansion to continue, and to keep the momentum moving.</P>
    <P>I regret and resent suggestions about a cut-back when these figures show clearly that there is not a cut-back.  The concept of self-financing from land and premises could not be considered in 1976 when the grant-in-aid was running at about £650,000 only.  Over a few years we have seen that figure increased to £1,444,000.  Let no one have any doubt but that this Government are acting in the interest of the Irish worker, in the development of applied technology, in promoting and keeping the momentum of industry moving forward.  Under this section the IIRS is being allowed a freedom which on its record over the years since it was founded by the late Seán Lemass, it has earned.  It can stand over its reputation.  I find nothing wrong with the concept in this section.  It is vital.</P>
    <P>I read through the annual report and I know the involvement of the personnel of the IIRS, but I sometimes worry about the staffing.  On 31 December 1978, 578 persons were employed and nine months later the figure had reached 589.  We must also take into consideration the internal reorganisation and assessment within the structure of the institute.  The nine former divisions have now been condensed into four.  Based on the demands being made, and having regard to the future of the Irish worker and the Irish product, it is vital that staffing should be kept up and that the best people <Col N="1142" /> should be brought in.  I look forward to the Minister dealing with that aspect in her reply.</P>
    <P>There was an increase in staff of 11 in the past nine months, on the figures I have.  Looking at the demand for present, ongoing and future work, I should like to see that figure boosted, not for the sake of having an increase for a statistical case I might like to make from this side of the House, but so that the affairs of the institute will move forward.</P>
    <P>The Irish people benefit in many ways from the activities of the IIRS.  We should remember that in our living quarters, our roads and factories, very high and improving standards are being maintained due to the work of the institute. We are indebted to them.  They have been very much involved in developing native timber for the construction industry. That is good.  It is wonderful to see an Irish product being used.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention in passing a recent problem we had on a national primary road in County Wicklow about which there was massive publicity in the media and which caused some concern. A new road surface dressing was completed in an area and the road lifted a few days later.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  This is a short concise Bill consisting of three sections.  Under section 1, the definition section, &ldquo;the Institute&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; are defined.  I have dealt with section 2 (1) and the reasons for it.  I welcome the main reason for it because of demands on a fee-paying basis for the services of the institute.  I regard subsection (2) as an expression of confidence in the work and future operations of the IIRS.  What is wrong with the basic intent of it being enabled to purchase the necessary items of capital equipment which will become self-financing as a unit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third section of this Bill is simply the short title, and the Act will be known as the Amendment to the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961.  It is vital that the institute continue to play the magnificent role that it has played in Irish society.  It is vital that more and still more new ideas emerge and new products come on the market <Col N="1144" /> which are underwritten and certified by this institute.  I wish the institute well in its endeavours and I renew my thanks for not alone its hospitality but also for the amount of information which it made available to Deputies on a visit there.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>Normally a Bill enabling the raising of money for a State body is very much welcome in this House by all and nobody complains or cribs about it. The contents of this Bill to a large extent are also very welcome.  The past hour has been spent by speakers on the far side of the House in the exercise of evading the real crunch issue, and Deputy Murphy has displayed an amazing facility and capacity for this very art of evasion.  He is a long-standing member of the Committee of Public Accounts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry senior member. He ought to know that there is a grave departure in this Bill from the norm to which I will refer later, I hope more precisely than Deputy Murphy did in his meandering along badly tarred roads in Wicklow and other evasive tactics which he used in evading blatantly the issue at stake here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know and accept that the IIRS is engaged in very worthwhile work. Nobody in this country could but be aware of the contribution it has made as an agency to the whole development of this country since the inception of the institute in the mid-forties.  One cannot but be struck by the changes that have taken place since it was first set up when one recalls the limit which was placed on its activities by virtue of the limit placed on its expenditure at that time.  Written into the Bill was the sum of £35,000 beyond which it could not go.  In 1961 this limit provision in the Bill was removed and the 1961 Act provided that there would be an annual review of the sum made available in the form of grant-in-aid amounting to something over £5 million. It is indicative of the massive expansion which has taken place within the institute <Col N="1145" /> and in its work commensurate with the expansion in industrial development in this country.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House can point a finger at the IIRS and its work.  In its personnel it has people of substantial ability and capacity who have shown their paces, and no Deputy in this House is not aware in his own constituency of the involvement of the IIRS.  At different times it has been called in at planning permission stage to scrutinise and investigate certain aspects of development concerning environment which have been raised.  It has always come up with satisfactory answers and more often than not it has been successful in advising people of the position with information based on scientific facts.</P>
    <P>This Bill has serious consequences for the IIRS.  I am sure that other boards of State bodies have pricked up their ears when they have discovered what this Bill contains, because they may think that it is only a matter of time before the same type of approach is applied to them.  Up to now financing of the IIRS has been through the system of a grant-in-aid. Certain conditions apply to moneys expended under a grant-in-aid.  Apart from the normal conditions the Minister concerned with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance must allocate the money and so on.  There must be consent between the two and it must be shown that the money has been spent in accordance with certain norms.  One condition applying is that you cannot overexpend a grant-in-aid.  While any balance left over need not be surrendered and can be carried on to the next year, the reverse side of the coin is that if you do overexpend you find yourself in breach of the condition applying to a grant-in-aid. Because of the enormous pressure on the IIRS in recent years it has found itself in the red for reasons some of which were stated by the Minister in her speech, such as payments not coming in within the accounting year and so on. On paper the institute found itself on the wrong side of the fence with a debit balance.  The Committee of Public Accounts as one of their functions found it necessary to point this out, and this Bill <Col N="1146" /> now before the House was expected to be nothing more than an enabling Bill to regularise this over-expenditure.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Kelly I have made some inquiries and have found that, while the institute was aware of the comments of the Committee of Public Accounts, that this matter of overexpenditure would have to be regularised through legislation, it was not aware of the sting in the tail of this Bill.  It seems that this matter was not discussed with it.  The Minister will clarify that.  In making the allegation I have fairly good authority, as I am sure Deputy Kelly has also, to say this.  I accept it at face value and will continue so to accept it unless the Minister can deny it categorically.</P>
    <P>The enabling section of the Bill is section 2 (1).  Section 2 (2) is where the problem arises, and this may have serious consequences.  Like Deputy Kelly, I have made inquiries in so far as I can about this new departure.</P>
    <P>In so far as can be ascertained by me, this is a totally new concept for the financing of State bodies which may have far-reaching effects.  I cannot project what might happen.  What I am saying&mdash;and again I must persist in saying it&mdash;is that unless the Minister can deny it or show me a precedent for it, this idea of mortgaging the fixed assets of a semi-State body is a totally new concept.  If the Minister can deny that I will accept her statement without reservation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore made a statement that the Government will not be found wanting in the provision of finance for the IIRS.  Deputy Moore must not have read the Bill, because section 2 (2) is just saying that in so far as the purchasing of capital equipment is concerned the IIRS must literally work out its own salvation in that any purchase will be made from moneys borrowed on the security of its lands and premises.  This is a very substantial departure from the norm of guaranteed State finance for such bodies. As has been stated three or four times today already the IIRS has been underfinanced despite the major increases in the grant aid over the years, and the chairman has constantly stated in his annual <Col N="1147" /> report that this has been the position and that it is finding it very difficult to make ends meet, given the kind of service which it feels it ought to give to meet the many demands made on it and on its service.</P>
    <P>What is the significance of this new concept?  To me it is this: the IIRS are now in the position where the onus is on it to provide capital equipment with borrowed money which must be repaid. In some cases the equipment may pay for itself.  But in other cases, such as for example research, equipment purchased with borrowed money which is very expensive today may not pay for itself and we would have the situation where the IIRS would be forced to take some of the grant aid money to service and pay back the loan on that piece of equipment. It is the classic case of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  It does not make sense.  It shifts the onus from the Minister on to the board and on to the personnel of the IIRS.  This is a very serious shift, and I do not think this facility which is now given in the name of freedom and autonomy to the board is worth a tráinín.  It is not freedom.  It restricts the institute because it is forever going to have to look over its shoulders to see where it is going to get the money to service and repay that loan.  The obvious answer to this is that the Government should provide the money.  We all acknowledge that the Government cannot provide adequate funds for everything in which they are involved.  If that were so we would run the risk of having different agencies not taking proper care of their finance.  But where we have a case like the IIRS which is at the kernel of our industrial development and research, surely that body above any other body in the country ought to be given adequate facilities to carry out the job that it was put there to do.</P>
    <P>Cutting the umbilical cord and telling it that it must now look after itself is wrong; it is a regressive and retrograde step, and one wonders at this stage how far this is going to go.  Is it going to apply to other State bodies involved in very important work also on behalf of this nation? <Col N="1148" /> The whole concept of underwriting expenditure by the Minister for Finance has been with us since the foundation of the State.  I cannot but be amused at the logic displayed by Deputy Murphy in stating that the IIRS has underwritten thousands of jobs here.  That is absolutely correct, and I accept that.  If that is so is it not logical to expect that he and the Government of which he is a supporter should undertake to underwrite that same agency which underwrites the jobs of many thousands of people here?  That is the logical thing to do, and any departure from that stance is a retrograde one. The Minister has said that the IIRS also acts as a technical adviser to the Government.  That is so.  In that area it does a very fine job.  For that reason the Government should not be reluctant, as indeed they are, to underwrite the activities of that agency in the expenditure of moneys for capital equipment.</P>
    <P>It is rather strange and curious, and I would like the Minister to give us whatever information she has available at present on that concept of allowing State bodies to raise finance without the normal, usual guarantee from the Minister for Finance.  The work of the IIRS has now become very important indeed because we are now entering a phase of high technology.  Very specialised personnel are required for a very specialised job.</P>
    <P>Apart from the usual testing carried out by the IIRS we are talking about the initiation of studies into things like offshore exploration and the kind of equipment which would be most effective, micro-processing and other highly technical areas such as the development of minerals, about which we know very little.  We are dependent on this kind of agency which has the expertise and, hopefully, will have the equipment to initiate research into the best way to capitalise on our resources.  What is happening? The onus of responsibility for the provision of the necessary equipment is now being shifted from the Minister of the day to the board.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) ought to be looked at again because it may have very serious consequences.  What would happen, for <Col N="1149" /> example, if the board were foolish enough, though I am sure they are not, to reach the limits of their borrowing power and mortgaged their assets to a degree beyond which they could not borrow any more under this section? Would it be necessary to repeal this legislation so that the institute could be totally supported by grant-in-aid as heretofore?  If that were not done they would be unable to continue their work to the standard they would wish.  These questions must be answered.  They raise major problems for other State bodies.  This country is nationally going into hock at present, and we are now asking State agencies to put themselves into hock. This concept is wrong and is a major departure from established procedures. It is blatantly dishonest to say those people are being given freedom of choice; the onus of responsibility for the provision of capital is being shifted away from a Government Minister to a board, and that is a very unfair tactic.</P>
    <P>I also object to the fact that this came into the House under the guise of validating legislation to provide for the validation of over-expenditure in grant-in-aid, and this was shoved in as a device to shift responsibility and to ensure that the Government would not have to spend money in this very important area of industrial development.  This kind of Bill would normally be welcomed with open arms as an enabling device to allow extra money to be provided, but because of a particular section the Bill is offensive. It includes this very retrograde section which could not be acceptable to the Opposition and I am sure there are Members on the other side of the House who are speaking with tongue in cheek in welcoming the Bill, knowing that it is a retrograde step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House as I am aware that there is another Bill to be dealt with later.  In 1934 the Industrial Research Council were set up, and this country was not then as organised industrially as it was in 1946.  <i>Ad hoc</i> committees were set up to try to co-ordinate industrial activity and technology.  In 1946 the IIRS were set up <Col N="1150" /> by the late Seán Lemass who did so much to get Irish industry off the ground.  They had as their basic philosophy the provision of more effective organisation of industrial research with the object of promoting the utilisation of the national resources of the State.  It was hoped to provide standards of specification for industrial commodities, processes and practices and the utilisation of waste products in industry. They were to make recommendations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to the formulation of standard specifications for various commodities on the market at that time, to test and analyse commodities for sale to the public, and to publish results.  All speakers have agreed that the IIRS have done a very good job.</P>
      <P>Seán Lemass said in this House in July 1946 that, despite the energy and enthusiasm of the council, the financial arrangements made in relation to their work were not such as to give them the freedom of action which experience had shown to be necessary to implement a useful research programme.  I heard the same thing today from the Minister.  She is trying to expand and take some of the red tape and bureaucracy away from an area which requires flexibility.  She is not trying to put an onus on a semi-State board.  The purpose of the Bill is to allow the board to borrow temporarily such sums as may be required for current expenditure and, secondly, to borrow on the security of assets for the purchase of capital equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central objective of the IIRS is to promote the efficient operation of industry and to maintain and stimulate where possible industrial growth.  They co-operate with all the other semi-State bodies involved in trying to promote Irish industry and improve living standards. They ensure that industry has access to and uses the most up-to-date technology available anywhere in the world, and assist in the creation of wealth for those industries and their workers and the raising of living standards. It is fair that a semi-State body should have as much freedom as <Col N="1151" /> necessary in carrying out its functions.</P>
    <P>The IIRS assist industry in many ways.  They provide advice and help to solve technical problems and also test products for sale either at home or abroad.  A recent example of their useful work is the publication of a document on the installation of back boilers which is of great help to the public at large.  The institute will have an income of about £2 million this year due to their services to industry and the assistance they are providing in solving problems.  Their initial income in this area was in the region of £70,000 and has grown considerably.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in her speech, simply solving industrial problems is not enough, and the institute also engage in research leading to the development of new industrial processes.  In the past few years much has been done in conjunction with the IDA to help small industries to get data on various products we have imported up to now so that such products can be made at home.  I live near the IIRS and I have been there many times.  Anyone can make an appointment to visit the institute and if one has some good ideas with regard to technology and so on one can discuss them with the personnel there.  Many small industries have been given valuable advice by the IIRS.  The institute carried out a survey last winter when there was a major freeze-up of oil supplies.  In an estate of 2,000 houses in my area the IIRS examined each house and provided an excellent report to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>While it is easy to say that finance should be provided to cover all aspects of the work of the institute, the resources of the Government are limited.  The IIRS will never have to sell the assets of their valuable estate but it is obvious that they could borrow much more from their bankers to provide finance in an easier way and thus allow them to continue to promote Irish industry and technology.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a grant-in-aid of £5.1 million.  I do not know how much <Col N="1152" /> of that is for productive machinery purposes and how much is in respect of salary.  Anyone in business knows that the IIRS are providing a commercial service and that it stands on its own feet.  We are always complaining about the large grants-in-aid that are given to semi-State companies, but here is a case where the organisation in question are trying to stand on their own feet.  I am sure the Minister has discussed this Bill with them.</P>
    <P>There is a shortfall because people are not paying their bills quickly enough. One speaker this morning suggested that the firms who have not paid their accounts may be trying to expand and thus have a cash flow problem.  Perhaps the Department would take note of the way some other Government Departments try to have some arrangement to keep bank interest down to a minimum.  Since this Government came to office some Departments have done this effectively to decrease the amount of interest the banks get from semi-State bodies or from Government Departments.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Opposition will not give an outright welcome to the Bill.  In cases where services are required in order to assist the public, such as the instance of my own constituency or with regard to the oil problem which was of concern to the entire nation, perhaps the Minister would consider giving the institute grants for equipment.  I do not know if provision is made for such grants in the £5.1 million mentioned by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to a statement made in this House in July 1946.  In that same report there is the following statement:</P>
    <P>The Bill has been framed with recognition to the fact that for research, especially industrial research, elastic conditions of control and development are required.</P>
    <P>The Minister has followed the same line and has allowed for flexibility of control. The semi-State bodies can stand on their own feet and do their work efficiently.  It is necessary on occasion to cut through <Col N="1153" /> the red tape and I congratulate the Minister on an excellent Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome an opportunity to discuss the workings of the IIRS.  The institute is in the top group of successful semi-State organisations.  This Bill gives us an opportunity to consider its operations in the past and to point out some of the directions it will have to travel in the future.</P>
      <P>This morning Deputy Kelly was concerned about the question of finance and the way the Bill will allow the institute to raise capital, particularly for the purchase of equipment.  I have visited the institute and I know the workings of that organisation.  A very progressive stand has been taken by the Minister to ensure that the IIRS will not be short of funds, particularly for capital equipment.  That in itself is an investment, especially when one sees the direction the institute has gone in its sub-contracting services.  It provides a service to industry as well as to Government and is the watch dog for the environment and for other major complex technical areas.</P>
      <P>Some of the growth in development of the IIRS has been in a commercial capacity.  This is desirable, particularly in a small economy like ours.  Small Irish developing companies need technological expertise.  Obviously because of their size they cannot afford the capital outlay themselves but they can go to the IIRS for the most up-to-date information on technological development.  In addition, they can have their products tested, they can have research carried out and they can be given recommendations.  The IIRS staff are in a position to improve products and they can go to the shop floor of businesses to give the best advice available.  If this Bill and the funds which the IIRS is going to raise as a result of this legislation will further assist in that direction, that should be welcomed and supported by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues in the publication <i>Technology Ireland</i> dated March 1978 regarding future technology and methods of forecasting which were raised by the IIRS are worthy of serious <Col N="1154" /> consideration.  It is sobering for politicians when the technicians put forward some of the up-to-date views that are available on technological development. It is particularly challenging when in that article it is pointed out that the Yale historian Mr. De Salla Price feels that we know 20 per cent of the scientific and engineering technology as discovered and by the end of the century we should literally have 100 per cent information on the availability of new products, designs and technologies.  That being so and, as is mentioned in the article:</P>
    <P>If this forecast proved even approximately accurate then it is a very sobering thought for anyone under the impression that our knowledge of basic science is reasonably complete. Scientists and engineers as well as those informed on scientific and technical affairs know however that the explosive growth of knowledge continues.  This trend has ramifications for all sectors of society intent on industrial development.  All Governments want to be involved in whatever technological developments there are but, that being the case, for the remainder of this century the IIRS are going to play a very major and significant role in the further development of our economy.</P>
    <P>If one is to look at the previous forecasting of technological development up to our present-day situation, when we find ourselves with industry not capable of securing adequate staff with the necessary experience to enable them to fulfil their real potential&mdash;the Minister for Education and the Minister for Labour have actively promoted schemes recently to endeavour to solve this problem&mdash;it is an indication of how rapidly technological development can proceed, and if that is so, particularly as we come to the close of the seventies with developments in micro-processing, the chip and electronic and computer advances putting up a real challenge to industry, the IIRS in particular must be the watch-dog for this country in advising Government, industry, the IDA and other interested parties so as to ensure a <Col N="1155" /> co-ordinated policy as we enter the eighties.</P>
    <P>The IIRS to date has certainly lived up to expectations outlined when it was set up.  It has expanded along a number of different paths which were possibly not envisaged then.  It must continue in this way to develop and have an open mind on the services it provides.  It must be extremely well qualified in technological matters and it must be capable of coming down to the mundane duties of explaining to the public what is best for them in consumer goods particularly in engineering and electrical areas.  It has a number of challenges in that area.  Its consumer advisory service is a very essential part of consumers' protection against manufacturers who deliberately or otherwise may market products that can be dangerous.  On a number of occasions the IIRS has had to advise on products on sale that were dangerous, and some problems were experienced. We all owe a debt of gratitude to the IIRS for recognising its need to expand and for the many different directions it has taken.</P>
    <P>When dealing with technology of the type in which the IIRS is involved capital needs can never be fully satisfied. There is a question of priority, of considering investing in equipment that can best support existing-industry and also leave it in a position to invest in experimental areas which can possibly generate development in areas where it does not presently exist.  This is the dilemma facing the IIRS directors and managers.  As a Government we recognise this, and the Bill gives it such a degree of independence that based on its assets it can raise necessary funds, particularly in areas that are to be selffinancing, as stated in the Bill&mdash;that is the intention.  It will give the IIRS the opportunity of purchasing capital equipment where hopefully it will be used in extension of the sub-contractor services area of providing to industry on a fee-paying basis the type of information the organisations themselves are not capable of providing internally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> Because of the growth of the economy in many directions the IIRS should probably look to the prospect of bringing some of its expertise and services outside Dublin.  I am aware of a major development by the IIRS at Shannon.  Probably in the Munster area where there is a very heavy concentration of chemical processing and other industries which need the type of service that the IIRS is providing, it should look in that direction. Setting up separate units of this type tends to bring about a good competitive, technical, internal activity which can give rise to much innovation and new thinking and development.  I suggest that the IIRS should consider setting up a more specialised type of operation outside Dublin to meet the needs of developing industries in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on one particular area of activity.  During my visit I saw the excellent work at present going on in research on Irish timber, a resource which is becoming freely available.  We have a great deal of timber imported at present.  The IIRS is doing very extensive experiments on Irish timber in an effort to introduce it into the construction industry and so redress the export-import imbalance.  A good deal of thinnings are now becoming available as a result of the foresight put into our plantations and the IIRS is, I think, the organisation to maximise the potential of this Irish product.  I saw its up to date work in this area of timber utilisation and house construction, and it is very encouraging.  If the Bill provides additional funds for equipment that will allow that work to proceed as rapidly as possible it is to be welcomed and commended.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of IIRS activity I wish to mention is in connection with standards of plant installation and safety standards, which are the responsibility of the Department of Labour.  Complex plant in many cases is installed without guidelines or compliance with any statutory standards.  Difficulties or problems afterwards mean that the IIRS is inevitably called in to report on the problems, how they can be remedied or avoided in future.  In one issue of <Col N="1157" /><i>Technology Ireland</i> the subject of welding was dealt with.  I am aware of a number of accidents in welding operations where there is no proper control or compliance with standards necessary to ensure safety of the people operating the plant.  The IIRS should have a more expanded role in recommending here the adoption of standards recognised in other countries or an amalgamation of different standards, whether British or continental, which are accepted generally and backed up by legislation.</P>
    <P>We are now installing very complex engineering equipment, much of which will contain very lethal gases and liquids, and operate in plants with a high concentration of personnel.  I would like to see the IIRS introducing a set of guidelines which would, in time, be backed by legislation, ensuring that the standards of installation of plant are to a proper level of safety and operational satisfaction. On a number of occasions, the institute carried out investigations and discovered defects which, with a proper level of standards, could have been avoided.</P>
    <P>In the area of safety at work, the IIRS has often been called in to recommend guidelines for safety and, in particular, for the wellbeing of staff working in many gas processing operations and in engineering.  Sir Peter Cassells of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions wrote a very lengthy article in one of the <i>Technology Ireland</i> issues dealing with the subject of safety at work, which interlinks with what I said previously about the standard of plant installation. The Department of Labour have taken recommendations from the IIRS, from the trade unions and, no doubt, from employers, to set up an investigation body to look into this important matter.  The IIRS has a very important function and role here, and I would like to think that it will play a much more dominant role in that area of industry.</P>

      <P>I apologise.  In conclusion, the engineering industry has been recognised as one of the industries with most potential.  The IIRS has kept itself abreast of technological advancement and is to be complimented on its work to date.  The future challenge to that organisation will be great, especially when multi-national organisations and some of the worlds' better equipped economies can invest vast sums of money.  It is our task to ensure that we provide the industrial base for investment and it is the IIRS's duty to ensure that we can provide the necessary personnel and standards to ensure that we get our fair share of investments in this complex industry.  We should always recognise the importance of the IIRS and by giving it this facility of raising additional funds should see it improving on its role to the benefit of Irish industry in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who took part in this morning's debate on this Bill.  The people involved in the IIRS would be pleased to realise that so many Members of the House are interested in their work and in ensuring that the funding of the institute is sufficient to enable them to do the important job which they are at present performing.</P>
      <P>Very many points have been raised by the Deputies in relation to the IIRS and, in particular, in relation to the Bill.  I hope in my remarks to cover all the points raised, but I am sure the Deputies will remind me if I forget some.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I mention is that made by Deputy John Kelly and reiterated by Deputy O'Toole.  These two Deputies said that this Bill was not known to the IIRS.  The Bill was discussed with the Director and the Deputy Director as far back as late 1978.  The proposals in an <Col N="1159" /> advanced stage were not put to them. The Bill was sent to them after circulation and the IIRS was not advised of the limitation of the borrowing powers before they got the Bill.  The director of the institute, in September last, acknowledged receipt of a copy of the Bill and stated, in his letter to the Department, that his board were satisfied with the Bill which is here before us and I quote: &ldquo;adequately caters for the particular difficulty that the Institute has experienced in this regard during the last few years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright, in his contribution, talked about figures.  It is very important when figures are tossed around on the floor of this House or, indeed, anywhere else, that they be accurate.  I take exception to the fact that Deputy Enright feels that the Government grant-in-aid to the institute was reduced in one year&mdash;I think he said in 1978.  In fact, if we look at the figures, we find that in 1976 the institute got a grant of £3,240,000; in 1977, £3,684,000; in 1978, £4,412,000 and in 1979 £5,119,000.  The Deputy may have confused the amount given for current expenditure in 1978 and the full amount for 1977.  I am sure he did not intend to misrepresent the figures in any way.</P>
    <P>If we look at the increase in the vote itself, 1973-1974 to 1977, there was an increase of 84 per cent.  That would work out at 16 per cent per annum, approximately, and from 1977 to 1979, an increase of 39 per cent, which would work out at about 20 per cent per annum. Deputy Enright asked that, as a minimum, the grant at least rise with inflation. I assure the Deputy that we try at least to do this and, indeed, to do more than that because it is important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no reduction of any kind in any of those years whether on current or capital expenditure. That is my point.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright spoke about import substitution.  As we all know, the Deputy's point has some validity.  The Industrial Development Authority and the IIRS are very much alive to this possibility.  Every proposal put forward to them can have help from those two bodies and would have the full support of the Government and its agencies in this regard.  If the proposal is viable it should be pursued.  In this connection, I refer to the IIRS annual report for the year ended 31 December 1977.  On page 14, it is shown that the IIRS was instrumental in getting most of the Kinsale Head development work jobs for Irish firms who were capable of supplying the work, and I quote:</P>
      <P>The total value of contracts placed by Marathon in Ireland for the development phase of the Kinsale Head Field was £15.7 million at the end of 1977, with an employment content of 630 man/years.  Irish participation is now some 15% of the overall project, which represents some 95 per cent of the business that Irish industry was capable of handling at the time.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise that the IIRS and the IDA will give any help possible to any proposal which they think is viable, in the case of an import substitution.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond spoke about the consultancy study being undertaken and wondered what matters would be included in this.  Earlier this year, it was decided that, in the light of demands being made and likely to be made in the future on the Exchequer by a major building programme begun some years ago by the institute, and other factors, the time had come to undertake a detailed examination of all the activities of the institute in relation to the expanding needs of Irish industrial development.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that a farmer who got a £60 grant for a tank, other than a plastic tank, some years ago, and who is now modernising his farming methods would qualify for a grant of £800 towards the cost of the new tank were it not for the fact that he got £60 some years ago?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be a case where the normal practice of not grant-aiding replacement equipment would operate.  There is a case to be made for the replacement of a plastic mobile tank with stationary steel installations but there is not a case to be made genuinely for the normal replacement of equipment <Col N="1163" /> by bigger and better equipment.

Would it not be fair if the original £60 grant was deducted from the £800 grant which would be payable if the previous grant had not been drawn?

      <P>I do not grasp the Deputy's point about taxing farmers for modernising their farms.  What I am saying, and I would not wish to be misunderstood by Deputy Murphy or by anybody else, is that grants will be paid for the replacement of plastic tanks by permanent installations.  In-between cases will be considered, but I cannot guarantee that grants will be paid in those cases which could possibly be construed as merely grading up a farm and replacing equipment with better and more modern equipment.  That is never grant-aided and I do not think it should be.</P>

      <P>Far from there being any dissatisfaction there is a general recognition on the part of herdowners that it is vital that it be introduced.  There have been certain grounds for dissatisfaction in the slowness of the delivery of results of tests because of the postal difficulties early this year.  That situation has been corrected now.  There is need naturally, since there is a 30-day limit, to have the farmer in a position to avail of the maximum number of days in which he can sell or move his stock.  I am applying the energies of the Department of Agriculture to solving this problem and it has been solved in large measure.  I do not in any way, as a herdowner myself, share the extraordinary view expressed by Deputy Murphy that there is general dissatisfaction with it.  On the contrary there is general recognition of its importance.</P>

Large farmers perhaps do not suffer but the small farmer who has to sell his cattle to pay rates and get money is suffering severely at present.</P>

      <P>I am aware that, at times recently, the interval between the taking of blood samples for brucellosis testing and the receipt of test results has been longer than would normally be the case.  The situation has been remedied by improved arrangements for the delivery and handling of samples and the dispatch of test results to local offices.  I am also examining the feasibility of providing test facilities at other centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that as recently as a little over a week ago it was taking over 24 days to get results in some parts of the country?  Is he aware that in yesterday's evening paper there is a report of a man who stated that the test results had not returned in some cases until three days after the 30 days were up?  Does the Minister know that if <Col N="1171" /> the test results do not come back the farmers either miss the market at which they had proposed to sell their stock or alternatively sell them without the test and risk the chance of spreading disease? Would he not let us know what he intends to do rather than say that perhaps next year he will introduce something in Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department assure me that the average waiting time is now between five and seven days, which is long enough, I agree.  One method by which the waiting time can be shortened is by the use of CIE's Fastrack service.  I would draw Deputies' attention to the remaining possibility that may account for some delays.  Practitioners may not have been lightning fast in rushing out to the herdowners with the results of tests. The despatch of the blood samples in that case may not have been as quick as it should have been.  I have no reason to believe that the cause of the very serious delays mentioned by Deputy Tully can be traced solely to the Department of Agriculture or the difficulties in the postal service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not persuaded that the mere despatch of results occasions any great delay and that that despatch would be hastened by having the results distributed by local offices.  I know that local veterinary offices cannot carry out the brucellosis test that is now carried out in Abbotstown.

The bottleneck originated during the postal dispute.  Even after the settlement of that dispute it took a long time to deal with the backlog that had accumulated. Parallel to that is the use by farmers of CIE's Fastrack service.  Blood can be tested and the results can be on their way back to the farmer on the same day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This question seems to suggest there is no development programme for beef, whereas in fact the collective effect of the various measures in operation by my Department constitutes a comprehensive ongoing development programme for the industry.</P>
      <P>Among the specific measures taken since I resumed office as Minister, legislation has been enacted to give CBF expanded promotional responsibilities, a selective trading role and increased funds.  I have secured the resolution of certain MCA problems which were impeding the meat industry and, most important, the disease eradication schemes have been extended and intensified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the beef quality side the beef carcase classification scheme is being introduced on an experimental basis, the <Col N="1174" /> more widespread use of continental breeds is being encouraged and the identification of easier-calving continental bulls in AI is helping in this connection.</P>
    <P>As regards cattle numbers, these are recovering steadily following the run down which occurred between 1974 and 1976.  A publicity scheme to encourage farmers to keep more livestock has been launched and action has been taken on the disease and welfare aspects of the trade in calves.  I am continuing to press in the Council of Ministers in Brussels for assistance for specialised beef production, and provision for aiding investment in calf-to-beef systems has been included in the proposals already put forward by the EEC Commission for the development of agriculture in the West of Ireland.</P>

      <P>On the question of cattle prices as against last year, most people in the trade realise that the prices paid by feeders this time last year for cattle to feed over the winter were excessively high.  Consequently, the profit those feeders made on the cattle when they came to be sold was very small.  We are in the presence of a constant shortfall in cattle numbers.  That can be traced back without any doubt at all&mdash;and my reply said so&mdash;to the crazy cattle policy followed by our predecessors by the slaughter of all the breeding cows in this country in 1975&mdash;650,000 cows were slaughtered in the year 1975.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position in regard to imports of Australian beef and <Col N="1178" /> cheese into the Community is that, apart from such quantities as are imported under the GATT quota for frozen beef or the special Community arrangements for manufacturing beef, all such imports are subject to the levies and/or duties applicable under the common agricultural policy.</P>
      <P>In the context of the GATT multilateral trade negotiations, however, the Community proposes to grant concessions to Australia on beef and cheese. These provide for access to the Community, on preferential terms, each year of 5,000 tonnes of high quality beef cuts and 3,000 tonnes of cheddar cheese of which 500 tonnes is for processing. These concessions are being made by the Community as part of an overall reciprocal trade package and, while I do not favour the granting of concessions for agricultural products, it is clear that in a compromise which involves substantial benefits for Community exports one must take an overall view of the impact of the package.</P>
      <P>Imports of New Zealand lamb into the Community are subject to duty at the rate of 20 per cent which has been bound in GATT since before Ireland's accession. The future arrangements for these imports are being considered by the Community in the context of the proposed common organisation of the market for sheepmeat.</P>

      <P>Since it would appear that nothing can be done about importing that which we could produce ourselves, which in fact is creating a surplus and therefore intervention and so on, would the Minister endeavour, particularly in his present position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC, to ensure that any costs that arise as a result of these trade agreements are not left at the door of the farming community, that they will not be debited as a charge against the farmers; in other words, that they will not be included in the overall alleged moneys the EEC are paying to support farming.  It is wrong that this should be so if it arises from trade situations?</P>

      <P>On 30 October 1979 Gulf Oil completed removal of about 3½ million barrels of crude oil from their Whiddy terminal, leaving slightly over 1 million barrels of oil still in storage there.</P>
      <P>There were no arrangements agreed between Petrogal, the Portuguese stateowned oil company, and my Department.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I should like to raise a matter on the Adjournment this evening, I would ask the Ceann Comhairle to advert to a supplementary question asked on a group of questions, Nos. 3 to 7, on 17 October. When I asked about the reported air corridor, the Taoiseach indicated that if I were more specific he would give a reply but, unfortunately, I was interrupted by an irrelevant question.  It is the question of the air corridor that I wish to raise in view of the fact that the Taoiseach said <Col N="1194" /> he would answer it if I were precise.  I was precise.</P>

    <Title>Trading Stamps Bill, 1979: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There is general agreement on this side of the House about this Bill.  It will have the support of almost everyone in the House.  It is welcome because this is the first time any effort has been made to bring legislation before the House dealing with trading stamps. An effort is now being made to regulate all types of transactions involving trading stamps.</P>
      <P>Up to now trading stamps have been used mainly in connection with petrol sales.  They have also been used in supermarkets and shops, but the main emphasis has been in connection with sales of petrol.  Since the petrol crisis and the shortage of petrol they have faded from the scene and whether they will be restored to their previous prominence is a matter for conjecture.</P>
      <P>Some matters connected with trading stamps have been a cause for concern. This Bill makes an effort to grapple with them.  For example, if a firm in a small town had the right to use a particular brand of stamps, similar type businesses were prevented from obtaining such stamps.  People selling similar commodities were seriously affected in their business and the firm with the stamps could obtain a monopoly of the trading in the town.  I hope this Bill will ensure that, if trading stamps revert to their former position, they will not be allowed to create a monopoly situation.  If there are two garages in one town and one garage obtains trading stamps, effectively they can close down the other garage selling a similar product.  This Bill makes an effort to ensure that that will not be allowed to happen, and I welcome that approach.</P>
      <P>It could happen that major firms would come into a town and put small companies and family firms out of business.  This is serious and I am glad the Bill makes an effort to prevent stamps being withheld unreasonably from businesses.  I am somewhat concerned about the number of companies who will be allowed to deal in trading stamps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> The number of such companies should be limited.  If too many people are dealing in trading stamps the value of the stamps may be lessened.  Any company issuing trading stamps should be a reputable company with some type of major issued share capital so that the Minister can ensure that if they issue a large number of stamps the people who obtain the stamps will be able to collect the relevant items.  If a person has 50 books of stamps he should be guaranteed on calling to the headquarters of the trading stamps firm that he can pick up a television set, radio, items of furniture, and so on, and that this firm are reputable and honest and can meet their commitments in full.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious to ensure safeguards in regard to catalogues.  The Minister and many people are aware that the catalogues issued by these companies have been changing with a rapidity which was causing concern.  I am anxious to ensure that firms will not be allowed to change too rapidly the cash-in values of stamps.  If a catalogue sets out that, say, 25 books of stamps are required in order to obtain, for instance, a certain type of lamp, this should not be changed to 35 books in a short time and 45 in a further few weeks. The values in the catalogues must be retained for defined periods.  I am glad that the Bill is endeavouring to ensure this.  I would like the Minister to confirm that these firms will not be entitled to change the values contained in the catalogues without the written permission of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  Too many firms were changing the values published in the catalogues too quickly, thereby devaluing the stamps.  My wife and I and various acquaintances, believing that we were going to obtain something at a certain valuation of stamps, found on going to cash in the stamps that we needed more books than we had.  This is a cheap way of catching people out.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill which everybody will have to welcome.  Section 9 deals with display of information in shops. Sometimes people are not aware of values and they have insufficient information <Col N="1207" /> about the type of goods and it is important that people be informed sufficiently on this.  The Bill appears to be safe on the next point, but I would like to know if a person is prevented from obtaining cash as distinct from goods in exchange for stamps.  A person who has saved, say, 50 books of stamps may decide that he is entitled to some product and on calling to apply for this may be told that there has been a massive demand for this article and that it cannot be obtained for him.  It might be a set of delph specified in the catalogue at a certain value in trading stamps.  I would hope that such a person can obtain money in lieu of the product that he is seeking if that product is not available. On the morning radio programmes for housewives especially we hear of people seeking the various items and being told that unfortunately there has been a massive demand for this product and the number of applications has exceeded all expectations.  That is too simple and glib an answer and I hope that the company who would set out an item in the catalogue and then be unable to furnish such an item because there has been a large demand for it will be obliged to pay cash instead.</P>
    <P>Those are the major points I wish to make.  One matter which appears to be covered adequately in the Bill is that products which people obtain against trading stamps will be equal in value to similar goods which can be purchased for cash.  Section 8 would appear to cover that, but I would like clarification on this point.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the company must have their place of business within the State.  It may or may not be within the Minister's power, but I hope that efforts will be made within the Department and also other Government Departments to ensure where possible that goods of Irish manufacture can be obtained by a person cashing in stamps.  I have been amazed to discover that a sizeable proportion of the products of the firms concerned are manufactured outside Ireland.  We must use all the muscle we can to ensure that the <Col N="1208" /> products obtained on cashing in trading stamps are Irish.  The Minister should ensure that the catalogues issued by these firms include Irish-made goods.  There is a duty on all of us to ensure that the goods which will be obtained are Irish made.  This Bill should help in the continuation and expansion of Irish industry. This is something that we should encompass in this Bill and which does not appear to be contained in it at present. It seems that the firms must be companies within the meaning of the Companies Act, 1963 but I do not see any reference to Irish-made products being used or exchanged by the companies. These companies would be obtaining their profits in Ireland and we must use all the muscle we can to ensure that they deal in goods bearing Irish trade marks and the &ldquo;Guaranteed Irish&rdquo; stamp.  If we can ensure that these types of products are used then we should do so.</P>
    <P>This Bill is breaking new ground and I welcome it.  I do not know if trading stamps will be around for a long time but while they are we have a duty to ensure that the people who obtain them are treated fairly.  This Bill is making a genuine effort to see that that is the case. Purchasers will in most instances be able to obtain good value in most shops not giving trading stamps if they shop wisely.  If there are two products on the market which are similar in every respect and two shopkeepers are selling them, the consumer is right to obtain the product in the shop which gives him or her trading stamps.  Our obligation is to ensure that the person who gets trading stamps gets a commodity which is fit for the purpose it was intended for and to ensure that the value of the stamps that person obtains are not reduced on a very regular basis.  The Bill goes a fair way to meet the desires I have expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entirely opposed to the Bill because I believe that the so-called practice of issuing trading stamps should be prohibited in this country. A number of countries have seen fit to outlaw this practice.  Canada, Denmark and Norway were mentioned.  I have an additional worry about this Bill <Col N="1209" /> in that it appears to give a degree of superficial legality to what I regard as the spurious operation of so-called trading stamps.</P>
      <P>There are a number of basic questions which have to be asked about the practice. Who pays for the trading stamps? This House has a fundamental obligation to point out to the consumer that the ordinary shopper, whether it is a person going into a supermarket and buying a basketful of groceries or a person going to a petrol station and buying a tankful of petrol, pays for the stamps.  The consumer pays through the nose for the trading stamps.</P>
      <P>In practice, the retailer pays for the cost because he is wedded to a system which has control over him and he also pays for the cost of the so-called trading operation.  Who makes the money?  Who gains in this so-called benefit of attractive offers made to the consumer?  It is quite evident that the multi-million pound international trading stamp companies make all the money.  The consumer pays in the long term as well as in the short term by the increased price of the products he or she buys.  I regard trading stamps as an unfair trading practice.  I know that enormous political pressures are brought to bear by these companies in whatever country they operate when they point out that they employ 100 people, that they purchase goods of a high manufacturing standard and that certain retailers want to operate the stamp system.  They are very plausible.  These arguments are superficially very attractive but they do not eliminate the fundamental objection that one can have. There is highly competitive trading in any part of the country and customers can get value for money without the intrusion of trading stamp companies into the midst of retail transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that there is any need for trading stamps.  I do not believe we would be a killjoy society or an anticonsumer society if we had not trading stamps.  I do not believe we would unduly upset motorists who have to wait an extra half minute at the petrol pumps while the attendant fiddles around with a <Col N="1210" /> stamp machine to give them their 500 stamps or whatever they get, if we did not have trading stamps.  I do not believe a cessation of the trading stamp operation would cause many tears to be shed except by the multinational companies who have specialised in this matter, notably in the UK.  There is one particular company in the UK, whom I do not propose to name, who have become so successful that one or two individuals have become millionaires as a result of the rip-off from consumers. They are very persuasive and they have very good PR.  They have been very good in that regard here as well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright talks about the stamp companies buying Irish.  They would buy Hong Kongese or Japanese if they thought they would get a foothold in any particular market and satisfy the local objections.  I believe the system should be abolished.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State has inherited this Bill, which has had a long and difficult gestation in the Department. The Bill is one of those classic Bills where one tells the parliamentary draftsmen to give one a Bill to deal with a particular issue and the Minister comes up with the issue.  It is like the definition of a main road.  The old definition was that &ldquo;a main road is any road which is deemed by the Minister to be a main road&rdquo;.  Accordingly, any trading stamp company is a trading stamp company deemed by the Minister to be a trading stamp company.  One has this official idiom in the various sections in the Bill whereby a trading stamp company can only be a company in the Republic of Ireland, which is a company with a place of business within the State.  It is like telling a bookie that he is running a bookie's office in the Republic of Ireland provided he has the bookie's office within the Republic of Ireland.  We know that all any one of those international companies have to do is to set up a &ldquo;Barry Desmond (Ireland) Limited&rdquo; company and off they go trading within the State.  It is a non-provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill also states that any such company which offers goods in exchange <Col N="1211" /> for stamps will be required to publish a catalogue illustrating the various goods on offer.  That again is really a non-provision because one cannot operate such a company without having at least the modicum of a catalogue; and such questions as whether the catalogue is kept up to date or whether it is brought periodically to the notice of the Minister for scrutiny of the situation are not major issues because the trading stamp companies have a wealth of expertise available to them.  One can assume reasonably that, for instance, if 45 fairy lights are given in exchange for 45 books of stamps, the next boxes of fairy lights to be ordered from Hong Kong will contain only 42 fairy lights.  It would be difficult for a consumer to be able to distinguish between the ways in which the pay-offs are manipulated.</P>
    <P>Any shopkeeper participating in a trading stamp scheme is to be obliged to have available a current catalogue for the information of customers.  I am confident that that provision will be complied with, but we know that in practice the majority of people on their way from a supermarket or on their departure from a garage do not ask for a catalogue and we can be sure that if they were to ask for one they would be asked what they were anxious about and had they not bought their commodities in that place in the first instance.  Therefore, the provision that every petrol pump attendant should have a catalogue in his pocket for the benefit for any customer who might ask for one is not a provision in effect and I cannot see it being enforced.</P>
    <P>We read in the explanatory memorandum that:</P>
    <P>...the protection afforded to buyers under the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, is extended to gifts in exchange for stamps, to ensure that all gifts will be as fit for their purpose and as durable as similar goods purchased for cash...</P>
    <P>All I can say in that regard is that the <Col N="1212" /> provision should be a lucrative source for Mr. Gay Byrne in view of the telephone lines to his programme being kept busy by people phoning to say that the goods they received were not as durable as similar goods purchased for cash.  How can one operate such criteria?  If, say, a person receives two dozen Arklow pottery plates for 60 stamps, the plates would need to be evaluated in terms of their cash value for the purposes of comparison.  In such a case it would be necessary to ascertain the manufacturer's catalogue price.  An official in the Department responsible for such operations would have to assess the value of the goods as against the manufacturer's price and then to tell the customer whether he had been cheated. This, again, would be an impossible provision to operate having regard to the wide range of goods offered by the trading stamp companies&mdash;anything from a fine looking mop to a packet of fairy lights.</P>
    <P>If the legislation is enacted it will be fashionable and easy for the Department to say that there is trading stamp legislation which is kept under constant review and monitored regularly.  But, having regard to the likely situation within the section of the Department responsible for such activity, it is difficult to visualise the legislation being operated.  Presumably the relevant sections in the Department would be dealing also with a large number of other provisions relating to trade and so on and one can imagine some clerical officer placing on top of a cabinet a file marked &ldquo;Trading Stamps&rdquo; and referring to it only when there is the occasional complaint.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not consider this to be a Bill at all.  Trading stamps should be outlawed as has been the case in Canada, in Norway and in Denmark. But the difficulty is that, once these companies get a foothold in an economy, they can exert very considerable political pressure.  There was an instance of this while we were in office when we were told that so many people would lose their jobs if the trading stamp companies were not allowed continue to operate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> However, it is not our job to give seeming legality to the titillation of the consumer. Unfortunately, consumer habit is an outstanding phenomenon.  People tend to continue to return to the same supermarket and to continue to collect trading stamps until such time perhaps as the glove compartments in their cars overflow with these stamps and the children lay hands on them, take them home and paste them to the wallpaper. Trading stamps are usually left lying around the house until such time as people have nothing else to do but to affix them to books, perhaps when there are power cuts and the only light is that provided by a candle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case most people must be up to date in the filling of their stamp books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all part of the age of superficial consumerism, of the plastic society and of the waste of human effort simply because some bright spark put into effect his idea of how to make a million and the trading stamp companies have made millions of pounds.  Meanwhile the consumer goes into town periodically to exchange his or her stamps for alleged gifts.  One wonders what value they are really getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the stage will be reached soon when, after having a couple of pints in the evening, we will be handed, say, 55 trading stamps.  I had an example of this trend while in Cork recently.  We do not want that kind of society.  There is not any need for it and neither is there a need for this Bill.  Trading stamps should be declared an illegal and unfair trading practice.  People should be discouraged positively from availing of these alleged offers from retailers and wholesalers. Perhaps this is not a popular line to adopt.  One could always argue that the consumer is entitled to do as he or she wishes.  Of course, if the consumer wishes to give £5 for a gallon of petrol, it is his privilege to do so but there is no reason for Dáil Éireann to give superficial apparent legality to the operation of trading stamps, an operation that is <Col N="1214" /> harmful to society, is of no real value to the consumer, causes havoc and endless disputes in the retail trade, is wasteful in the long run and simply increases the overall retail prices here.  Accordingly I oppose this Bill.  I do not propose to have a division on it but it should be opposed by the House because it is inherently uncompetitive and not in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I am rather surprised at the approach of Deputy Desmond to the Bill and I will go into that in a moment.  First, I want to congratulate the Minister of State on her initiative in bringing this legislation before the House.  It is appropriate that she, as a consumer, a housewife and a mother, a person in contact with the retailers and the supermarkets, should bring forward this type of legislation; she knows the advantages and the disadvantages of trading stamps.</P>
      <P>I regard this legislation as consumer orientated legislation and not trading stamp legislation and I am pleased that the Minister of State has brought it forward.  It does not encourage the distribution of trading stamps but it certainly protects the consumer who may avail of the offers provided by the trading stamp companies.  The Minister and the Government have brought forward many items of legislation which protect the consumer and it is not before time for the Government to show their concern for the most vulnerable area of society, the consumer area.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright's approach is to be admired.  He appreciates the general features of the Bill and the points he raised are worth noting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as Deputy Desmond is concerned, I was surprised at his approach because I thought he would have applauded the Bill and perhaps brought forward certain ideas which could be incorporated in the Bill.  But he opposed it outright.  He advocated the abolition of the trading stamp concept.  Surely he must be aware of the consequences of such an approach.  There are many firms <Col N="1215" /> here distributing trading stamps.  We are all aware of one very large company who provide a good service and are providing employment in Dublin, in Cork, where employment is very important, and in Limerick and Waterford. More important, they are giving employment to the producers and small industries. Much of this company's catalogue deals with quality Irish products.  Surely Deputy Desmond could not oppose a company promoting Irish goods and providing jobs throughout the country.  Certainly that company are not there to provide a social service; like all firms operating in any country they are there to make a profit.  This Bill regulates the profit motive and provides safeguards against exploitation of the consumer.  It is a balance between abolition, which I would oppose, and no protection for the consumer.  It is controlling legislation and it is the most acceptable approach because these companies are providing stable employment and promoting Irish goods.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note, as Deputy Desmond said and as the Minister said in her statement, that Canada, Denmark and Norway have actually banned this type of sales promotion because they found that the companies operating the scheme were not acceptable and were not providing a service.  Since I became a Member of Dáil Eireann approximately two-and-a-half years ago I have never received a complaint from a consumer in relation to the goods provided by any of the trading stamp companies but it is only right that we should provide safeguards and these safeguards have been provided in the UK and in the USA.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not interfere with the private voucher or stamp schemes, that is to say, schemes which are organised by a single retailer or supplier and under which stamps are redeemable from that retailer or supplier alone.  But care should be taken to ensure that by allowing large combines or groups to promote their own stamp schemes the general principle of this Bill is not undermined.  A scheme that caught my attention in the <Col N="1216" /> evening papers had a very attractive and costly advertisement headed &ldquo;A Fistful of Dollars&rdquo;.  That advertisement, which is being promoted by a particular firm, makes rather outlandish statements. They have that freedom but we should try to limit the freedom of those large combines to promote very attractive voucher type schemes.  The statement is made:</P>
    <P>Every $ 10 Sunshine Dollar Token is an entry form too and each Token you hold is worth 20 genuine U.S. Dollars in spending money (up to a total of $ 1,000) if you win the fabulous holiday for 4 in Florida, the million dollar playground.</P>
    <P>So come on, get a fistful of Sunshine Dollars this Thursday, Friday and Saturday at ........................&mdash;and a fistful of savings too.</P>
    <P>I wonder who will get the savings.  Those firms are trying to attract gullible consumers who might feel that they are getting something for nothing.</P>
    <P>The Minister could consider embodying in the Bill a section which would control or enable the Government to scrutinise or prevent that type of advertising promotion by individual firms which generally mislead the consumer. It certainly adds to the cost of consumer items.  She has an opportunity in this Bill of embodying controlling legislation for all firms operating in the State for all types of promotions.  I do not want to operate a complete watchdog system that would interfere with private promotions or reach a stage where firms would be afraid of advertising but at least the Department could step in and say that this type of promotion is unacceptable. It is as unacceptable as having no control over the trading stamp companies. That is an aspect of the Bill which I am concerned about and I fail to see the real advantage for the consumer in this type of promotion.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of the need for consumer protection and is carrying out her brief very well.  I suggest that she should consider some controlling <Col N="1217" /> measure.  From the point of view of the trader or consumer trading stamps are not, on the whole, great value.</P>
    <P>Though I agree with the Bill I would not accept the approach of Deputy Barry Desmond and the abolition of the trading stamp companies.  One such company is supplied by 70 Irish manufacturers and by another 20 firms which have Irish connections.  It is easy to realise the effect of a ban on all trading stamp companies on their employees and the resultant possibility of redundancies in the manufacturing firms. It is fortunate that Deputy Desmond is not sitting in the Minister's place and that we have a Fianna Fáil Government who will protect the people with sensible and practical legislation.  Deputy Desmond's approach seems to be contrary to the employment policy of the Labour Party.  I know that the Minister would not bring forward that kind of legislation because it is not our type of policy, though it seems to be the policy of the so-called socialists.  Deputy Desmond was not a Minister in the Coalition Government and I do not know if they were aware of his views.  I am surprised that he holds such extreme views regarding consumer legislation and I cannot understand his approach.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating the trading stamp type of operation.  Let the people decide whether they want such stamps.  It is not our job as legislators to ban these operations. We must, however, ensure that they are controlled.  These stamps are not very good value because the retailer has to increase his costs by 2½ or 3 per cent to cover his outlay on stamps.  It is not possible to get precise figures as to the number of stamps which are not redeemed, but based on information I have obtained I calculate that this would amount to 50 or 60 per cent.  I would ask the trading stamp companies to contradict those figures if they are not accurate.</P>
    <P>Traders must pay for stamps on receipt and the companies have the use of that money until such time as the consumer cashes in the stamps.  The trader naturally expects a certain advantage <Col N="1218" /> because of increased sales but in many cases these increased sales are at the expense of other traders in an area.  Many retailers have decided that trading stamps do not represent good value and have decided not to proceed with them. However, the final decision rests with the consumer.</P>
    <P>When a trading company come into an area they are quite selective in their approach.  They give a retailer exclusive rights to their stamps while the contract is in operation.  Many housewives are interested in collecting trading stamps because they can exchange them for luxury items which they would not normally buy.  They may feel they are getting something for nothing, though they must pay in some way for it.  The trading companies benefit by the fact that many people do not bother to keep their stamps, but it must be noted that the retailer has already paid for them.  It is an important part of the Bill that the redeemable value of the stamps should be clearly indicated and people may take more care of the stamps when they are aware of their real monetary value. Some people may be under the impression that retailers obtain stamps very cheaply but, in fact, they are quite expensive and many retailers find it difficult to carry on.  During the petrol crisis all the petrol companies banned the use of trading stamps because they could not afford them during the period of scarcity. Some of them have restored stamp promotions since supplies became available but they have limited the number of stamps given to customers. Another part of the Bill deals with the larger companies who have licensed retail outlets for petrol and insist on stamps being given to customers.  The Bill makes provision to prevent this and that is welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Post Office have their own savings stamps where the minimum is 10p. Perhaps the new board would consider the provision of special savings stamps for sales promotion.  Perhaps they would see in this Bill an opportunity to increase their sales while providing a useful method of saving for the consumer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> They could provide stamps of 1p or 2p and these stamps could be given for a certain number of purchases at grocery and retail outlets.  The stamps would be legal tender, cashable at 2,000 sub-post offices and in other retail outlets and there would be no control over where the consumer bought his goods.  I think there is a certain merit in my suggestion and I suggest that the new board give consideration to it.  It would give extra funds to the Post Office and would provide a facility for the elderly and for other people to save.</P>

      <P>I am throwing out an idea which the Post Office board might like to consider.  Deputy Enright does not appear to like my suggestion, but this is the place to discuss ideas that might be of benefit to the people and I make no apology for doing so.  When I was young I bought 10p stamps every week and saved a few pounds.  I do not see anything wrong in the State being involved through the Post Office and I wonder why Deputy Enright considers it repugnant.  If there is anything wrong with what I have suggested there must be something wrong with the trading stamps system as such.  We are downgrading the whole system if we say that the State could not see some worth in a saving promotion through retail outlets. What I have suggested would be acceptable under the terms of the Bill. Many benefits would accrue if we had that type of system in operation.  There would be freedom of choice.  If people knew that the State was backing a certain scheme and that the stamps could be regarded as currency, they would have respect for it.  If I had a few retail outlets I would give consideration to the suggestion.</P>

      <Col N="1220" /> In the case of one stamp company it takes £38 of groceries to fill one book of stamps and that is quite a considerable amount of money.  It is vital when a person goes to obtain goods for the books of stamps that he gets equal value. This legislation ensures to a great extent that the consumer will get good value.  It gives the Minister and the Department tremendous power to supervise companies, to see that they give good value and do not operate restrictive practices. Since this legislation was proposed some of the more reputable companies have adapted their schemes to some extent to bring them into line with some of the proposals in the Bill.  For instance, in one of their recent catalogues one firm will allow consumers to make up the balance if they have not collected enough stamps.  However, that also has certain dangers and it is vital for the Minister to ensure that there is price control in respect of all the items advertised in the colourful and glossy brochures.  As Deputy Enright said, there should not be fluctuating value for stamps.  If it takes ten books today to get a certain item it should not take 12 books to obtain the same item tomorrow.  Some companies have the value stated on their stamps, but they should go even further and give in their catalogues the actual cost of the item.  This legislation will allow the Minister, by regulation or otherwise, to ensure fair play and a good return for the purchaser of the stamps.  That is an acceptable approach.</P>
    <P>The legislation before us is timely and I regret that the Labour Party will oppose it.  I cannot see the reason for this or understand the ideology behind that opposition.  They seem to be opposing it merely for the sake of opposition.  I cannot see anything objectionable in the Bill. It is giving power to the Minister that has not existed up to now.  When we get to the stage that we bring forward a Bill to regulate a scheme that has been operating since the foundation of the State, the first piece of legislation which deals with trading stamps, surely every sensible and practical Member would applaud the efforts of the Government and the Minister to draft this type of legislation. <Col N="1221" /> I appreciate that it is difficult legislation to draft because it entails detailed consideration of many matters.  I would encourage the Minister to leave it as open and as broad as possible to ensure that she would have wide powers to control not only trading stamp companies but also the internal stamps or &ldquo;offers&rdquo; made by very large supermarket chains.  Perhaps the Government and the Minister could incorporate some regulation in the Bill giving the type of power that would ensure they could be a consumer watch-dog to ensure that consumers obtain value for money, as they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>It is a very useful Bill; it is complex and detailed and I congratulate those who drafted it on their foresight in including so many useful provisions.  Section 3 tackles the problem of the unreasonable withholding by a company which promotes a trading stamps scheme of a supply of trading stamps which will be an unfair practice within the meaning of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  The section does not judge what is unreasonable; determination of this clearly depends very much on circumstances of individual cases.  By the operation of the investigative machinery available under the Restrictive Practices Act the differing circumstances of different cases can be taken fully into account. That is a very reasonable approach. It gives the retailer an opportunity to go before the Restrictive Practices Commission and say he has been unfairly treated by a particular trading company and that he is having difficulty as a result of restrictive practices.  Then, as the Bill states, each case can be judged on its merits.  This is certainly worth while.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 deal with the notion of a cash option.  This option has two main objectives.  First, it provides an indication of the value of the stamps thus aiding rational comparison with the value of goods offered in exchange for stamps.  Secondly, it offers a stamp holder the right of choosing between redemption for cash or for goods.  This section will create certain worries for the trading stamp companies because to <Col N="1222" /> date you must accept goods for your stamps but to be in a position to choose cash rather than goods would be a very useful departure which would provide the consumer purchasing goods and obtaining stamps with a very useful option.</P>
    <P>Under section 4 the Minister may by order prescribe the value to be specified on the face of the trading stamp.  The alternative would be to leave the option entirely to the stamp company to decide on the cash value.  If this were done an artificially low value could be fixed. Therefore, it is important that a corrective power be available to meet the situation. That also is a very useful provision giving the Minister the powers deemed necessary.  Under section 5 the holder of trading stamps is enabled to recover the value of stamps as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction, where a stamp trading company fails to redeem the stamp for cash.  This is a much more realistic and effective formula from the stamp holder's viewpoint than would be the creation of an offence for the stamp trading company in such circumstances.  If the stamp-holders wish to obtain cash in exchange for stamps there is now an unequivocal statutory right to sue for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of such useful legislation and I congratulate the Minister who has brought in so much useful consumer legislation since she became Minister of State.  All housewives in the country would also certainly congratulate her on her initiative and on introducing such useful legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to congratulate the Minister on the great amount of consumer legislation introduced. We live in an era of the consumer society where people demand certain legislation.  It is a complex area and certain tactics and shrewdness have to be adopted.  The Minister and the Department are working to a certain scheme.  If one considers just the aspect of trading stamps one notes two diverse situations.  There are those who are completely <Col N="1223" /> in favour of stamps and those who are completely against trading stamps.  The Bill strikes a happy medium in that it opts for regulation rather than prohibition.  It has not come suddenly out of the blue but it is a matter the Department have been examining for years through the Fair Trade Commission and the Prices Commission.  The Prices Commission have moved from the original stance to a situation now which brings about what I would call an Irish solution to an Irish situation.  The situation needs clarification and regulation. This Bill will improve the position. It will regularise it, allow for proper development and will also take cognisance of the fact that the consumer society in Ireland is a shrewd society knowing a fair amount about the concept of value for money.  The Minister expressed this view in her speech and has taken cognisance of it.  I endorse that view.  The public generally have this shrewdness and common sense and they will appreciate the main elements of the Bill which aims at a three-fold objective&mdash;to regulate the issue, use and redemption of trading stamps; to regulate the business of issuing and redeeming the stamps and to provide for other connected matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had diverse views on the matter.  One particular brand of stamps used be very much in the news.  Circumstances in the domestic and international markets caused a decline in emphasis on stamps and the situation seemed to have eased and became less obvious.  With that easing people have a tendency to forget and no longer were the positions polarised because of the oil situation and people moved away from really strongly held views, but the Department did not move away from them; they continued working towards this Irish solution and this Bill is a fine example of bringing the matter to its logical and reasonable end.  I do not intend to delay the House in this matter.  I am very pleased with this legislation and with the fact that even though the issue went somewhat off the boil the Department <Col N="1224" /> continued to tackle the problem and found a solution.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Deputies who saw fit to come into the House and debate the Second Stage of this Bill.  I am glad that at least the last Deputy to speak appreciates that the problem of trading stamps did not disappear with the worsening of the oil situation in the recent past.  All of us realise that the vast majority of those trading with these stamps and the vast majority of retailers to give trading stamps are involved in the oil industry, petrol retailers and so on.  As a result of this oil crisis, trading stamps have virtually disappeared and are no longer available at petrol stations.  Some think this is a good thing and some think it is not; it is not for us to decide that point.  It is for us to legislate for the possibility of things improving in the next few months or years, when stamp trading will again become the lucrative business it was.  I thank Deputy Murphy for appreciating the fact that the Department officials did not decide to shelve the draft legislation that was being examined at the time, but went ahead with the legislation to ensure that consumers will be protected and that certain protections will be there for retailers also.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that Deputy Desmond has a blind spot where trading stamps are concerned and that, if he were in my position, he would possibly ban them altogether.  His views on the Bill were approached in that light.  He was picking out all the loopholes that he saw in the Bill and I will deal with his comments as I go along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons for the introduction of the Trading Stamps Bill were touched on in my speech on Second Stage.  We opted in the Bill for regulation of trading stamps rather than absolute prohibition.  Deputy Desmond rightly made the point that in some countries they have been <Col N="1225" /> prohibited, which he felt was a better idea.  Equally, it is right to mention that some countries, for example, some of the States of America and our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, opted for regulation rather than absolute prohibition.  Our legislation was brought about, first, because a very close study had been done for many years by the Department on the trading stamp business as it developed.  One of the findings in favour of regulation was that it was very often the features of the trading stamp scheme rather than the scheme itself that created certain problems.</P>
    <P>In 1971 the whole question of the trading stamp business was examined by the Fair Trade Commission, as it then was, during the public inquiry into the grocery business.  Though the commission's report of July 1972 following that inquiry made no recommendation in the matter, the view was offered that trading stamps were an undesirable method of sales promotion and an unsatisfactory method of saving from the consumer's point of view.  In their report of November 1972 the National Prices Commission recommended that the Minister explore the possibility of doing exactly what Deputy Desmond recommends and legally prohibit trading stamps.  The commission felt that this was an unsatisfactory method of saving and created difficulties, which inevitably it does, for certain retailers and, indeed, for consumers.  In May 1973 the National Prices Commission recognised the legal difficulties of providing legislation which would ban stamps and recommended instead a higher cash redemption value for stamps and also recommended that advance notice should be required if changes in catalogues were to be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden read out an advertisement which has been appearing in some <Col N="1226" /> of our papers in connection with a scheme offered by one of the multiples. His positive point as regards the advertisement was that it was misleading.  The Director of Consumer Affairs would be very interested in that matter.  Under the Consumer Information Act which sets up the office of the director he has specific powers in relation to misleading advertising.  If he has not done so already, the fact that this advertisement has been mentioned here will interest him to ensure that whatever appears in the advertisement will not mislead the public.</P>
    <P>Retailers' and suppliers' own schemes have been excluded from the provisions of the Bill because they have limited scope.  This type of scheme is redeemable from the retailer or supplier only, for either cash or goods.  Because of its local nature, holders of stamps can make a direct comparison between stamp values and prevailing prices in the shops or chain concerned, or in respect of the supplier's product.  These direct comparisons are relatively easy to make.</P>
    <P>In so far as stamp trading can be argued to be a legitimate competitive tool for a retailer, the scheme operated by a supplier, or within a chain, by retailers themselves, comes closest to being a legitimate competitive tool.  The benefits from this type of limited trading accrue to the retailer himself, as compared with the operations of a stamp trading company.  Such companies are creaming the profit.  There is a third party involved, the stamp company operating within the State; the retailer through whom the company operates the scheme and, finally, the consumer who probably suffers most.</P>

      <P>I do not know in what sense the Deputy is using the word &ldquo;research&rdquo; in this context. The facts are that the Garda Síochána have for many years past&mdash;apart from certain periods&mdash;kept records of those crimes which either have been admitted to have been committed <Col N="1201" /> by persons while on bail or which the Garda are satisfied that they otherwise know were committed in those circumstances.  I am perfectly satisfied that such figures are a useful guide to the Garda authorities and to me though, of course, as scarcely needs saying, they need to be interpreted in their proper context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the estimated number of crimes committed by people on bail for each of the last five years and the information on which these estimates are based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in reply to Question No. 351, the figures provided to me are not based on Garda estimates but on records kept by them.  That reply also shows the basis of those records.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the records of Garda Divisions outside the DMA show the number of crimes by persons on bail in each of the last five years as:&mdash;1974, 796; 1975, 1,192; 1976, 1,238; 1977, 1,497; 1978, 1,128; 1979 (up to and including 30 September), 1,130.</P>
      <P>It was not possible in the time available to compile similar figures for Garda Divisions in the Dublin Metropolitan Area but I hope to be in a position to give those figures in a week or so and I will have them communicated to the Deputy as soon as they are received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the longest, shortest and average length of time at present for bail while awaiting trial, and if in view of the evidence available to him in this regard, he will consider the following steps to shorten terms of bail (1) a system of preliminary hearings analogous to the Magistrates' Tribunal in Great Britain, (2) the provision of more staff to shorten the existing procedural necessities for people awaiting trial, and (3) the creation of more court fora to deal expeditiously with cases and thus avoid a backlog.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics in respect of the District Court are not compiled in such a way as to provide the information sought by the Deputy.  Delays in disposing of indictable cases in the District Court are due in the main to requests for adjournments by prosecution or defence.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons who have been returned for trial to the Circuit Criminal Court in Dublin the present position is that they can expect to be tried, at the earliest, within one month or at the latest within six weeks of the date of return for trial.  Outside Dublin the time-lag can be as short as one or two weeks or as long as three months.</P>
      <P>Of 64 bail cases at present awaiting hearing in the Central Criminal Court, ten were returned for trial to that court by the District Court and 54 were transferred to it from the Circuit Criminal Court.  The most recent of these cases was returned for trial two weeks ago and the oldest three years ago.  In the latter case the trial has been adjourned on 19 different occasions at the request of either the defence or the prosecution.  The average delay in having a case heard in the Central Criminal Court is at present five months from the date of return for trial.</P>
      <P>Two additional judges of the High Court were recently appointed and it can be expected that the increased complement of judges will help in reducing this back-log quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Special Criminal Court 23 cases are awaiting hearing in 18 of which bail has been granted.  One of these cases which dates back to 1976 has been listed for trial on a number of occasions but has had to be put back because one of the three defendants is in prison in another jurisdiction, one has failed to answer his bail and the third has instituted prohibition proceedings in the High Court.  A case dating back to 1977, which involves seven defendants and 114 witnesses and is expected to take four to six weeks to dispose of, could not be listed before now because of other lengthy trials in the Special Criminal Court.  It is listed for hearing this month. The usual delay in the hearing of the <Col N="1203" /> remaining bail cases before the court is four to six weeks.</P>
    <P>The information given does not include cases where bench warrants have been issued where an accused person has not presented himself for trial.</P>
    <P>As indicated, two additional High Court judges have been appointed and if the need for additional judges or court staff is established at any time they will be provided.</P>
    <P>In the normal course preliminary examination of serious indictable offences takes place in the District Court.  The Deputy will be aware that one of the main purposes of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, was to expedite the District Court proceedings in such cases.</P>

      <P>3,003 local authority dwellings were completed between 1 January 1979 and 31 August 1979 and 3,315 were completed in the same period last year. The average number of houses on which work was in progress during the 1979 period was 8,585 and in the 1978 period, 8,620.</P>
      <P>The delay in completions this year is due primarily to the difficulties being experienced by contractors in obtaining skilled tradesmen because of the current high level of demand for such workers in the building industry generally.  In spite of the shortfall to date in completions this year, returns received by me recently from housing authorities suggest that the total number of completions of local authority dwellings in 1979 will be of the same general order as last year.</P>
