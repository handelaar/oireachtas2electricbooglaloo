      <P>Nuair a bhí an Teachta Kelly ag tabhairt an óráid faoi na rialacháin atá ag teacht ós ár gcomhair, luaigh sé Bille an Údaráis fhéin, agus mar is gnách leis, bhí sé ag caitheamh anuas is ag caitheamh drochmheasa ar an mBille agus ar céard atá i gceist leis an Údarás fhéin.  Tá rud amháin ann agus ba cheart go dtuigfeadh an Teachta é, go bhfuil an tÚdarás le bheith ann anois, bíodh sé olc nó maith.  Tá Údarás ann agus tá solúbthacht san Acht le deis a thabhairt do bhaill an Údaráis na cumhachtaí breise a luaigh sé a lorg nuair a thogróidh siad é agus na cumhachtaí breise a luaigh sé a fháil ón Rialtas.</P>

Mhínigh mé go raibh solúbthacht san Acht go bhfuil an deis ag baill an Údaráis cibé cumhachtaí breise a shíleann siad a theastaíonn uathu a fháil de réir a chéile.  Ba cheart go mbeadh náire ar an Teachta Kelly labhairt faoi ar an gcaoi sin sa Teach seo.  Bhí Aire ansin thall ar feadh ceithre bliana go leith agus cuireadh ceist i ndiaidh ceiste air, mí i ndiaidh míosa, faoin Údarás agus cén uair a bheadh sé ann, agus gheall sé go dtabharfadh sé isteach Údarás agus ní raibh misneach aige é a dhéanamh ná ní raibh misneach ag an pháirtí a mbaineann an Teachta leis Údarás a thabhairt isteach.  Bhí sé lá amháin dá thabhairt isteach; bhí sé ag iarraidh chuile dhuine a shásamh agus i ndeireadh na bogadaí níor éirigh leis tada a thabhairt os comhair an Tí seo. Ní raibh sé de mhisneach aige Údarás a thabhairt isteach.</P>

      <P>Ach loic sé ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta, níor thug sé isteach an tÚdarás.  Beidh Údarás ann anois ar a mbeidh deis ag muintir na Gaeltachta daoine a thoghadh, mórsheisear a thoghadh, rud nár thárla ariamh.  Beidh gnothaí uile Ghaeltarra Éireann, an comhlacht Stáit sin a bhí ann á dtabhairt faoina gcúram agus á n-oibriú acu.  Is iad a chaithfidh an chuid is mó den airgid a thugtar do Ghaeltarra agus don Roinn&mdash;£20 milliún tugtha imbliana ag an Rialtas seo, an tsuim airgid is mó a tugadh riamh, beidh sé sin acu le <Col N="584" /> cur ag obair ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta.  Níor tharla sé le haon chomhlacht Stáit eile go bhfuair na daoine deis baill an bhoird a bheas ann a thoghadh go daonlathach agus tá mé cinnte go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta buíoch den Rialtas seo gur thug siad isteach an tÚdarás.  Tá glactha go fonnmhar ag muintir na Gaeltachta leis.  Tuigeann siad go bhfuil údarás acu don chéad uair.</P>
      <P>Tá an Teachta Kelly ag cur síos ar chumhachtaí an Aire.  Tá sé soiléir ón méid atá le rá aige go bhfuil droch-mhuinín aige as an pháirtí a mbaineann sé leis.  Tá sé ag rá go soiléir nach mbeidh sé ariamh ar an taobh seo den Teach feasta.  An é sin atá a rá aige, nach mbeidh Rialtas ar bith eile anseo choíche ach Fianna Fáil?  Tá mé buíoch dó go dtuigeann sé féin é sin agus go bhfuil a fhios aige cén dearcadh atá ag muintir na hÉireann ar Fhine Gael agus ar an Chomhrialtas agus ar an chaimiléireacht a bhí ar siúl acu maidir leis an Údarás seo.</P>

      <P>The section shows the various types of sales which are exempt from the provisions of the Bill.  On Second Stage all of us were agreed that all these exemptions should be allowed to remain.  Section 2 (2) (a) exempts selling by auction, other than by Dutch auction. Auctioneers hold a licence under another Act and obviously they should be exempted under this Bill.  Many of the exemptions are already covered by various charters or the Hawkers Act or local authority provisions.  It would be wrong for us to interfere in any way with traditions.  The person we are trying to get at is the fly-by-night individual who comes in, makes a quick &ldquo;buck&rdquo; and gets out fast.  The exemptions here refer to traditional types of sales which have lasted for centuries.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage we were in agreement with the Bill.  There were some other matters which required to be dealt with in legislation but we were assured these would be dealt with in the future.  I am in full agreement with the exemptions.  It appears that a person must be in continuous occupation for a period of not less than three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  One of the problems when drafting the Bill was to decide what the period of time should be.  We could be getting at the legitimate trader setting up in business for the first time or moving to another premises.  We felt that three months was the most suitable period.  A longer period would inhibit genuine traders and a lesser period would give too much scope to the person against whom we are guarding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>What type of interest must a person have for that period? Must he be the owner or the leaseholder? A person can obtain a premises and move in goods over a period of three months in preparation for an auction in an attempt to circumvent the good intentions of the Bill.  How can we ensure that this will not happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  A Dutch auction is an auction at which items are offered initially at a very high price in excess of their value.  This is a ruse to get people excited and pay more for these items than they are worth. Gradually the auctioneer drops the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought a Dutch auction to be somewhat different. I have in mind auctions which are advertised throughout the countryside and are held without permits.  Some of the goods may be of doubtful origin and quality and the buyer is unprotected in the case of faulty goods.  There is no means by which the State would be able to obtain any benefit by way of VAT.</P>

      <P>This provides for the granting by the Minister of occasional trading permits and it is my opinion that the Minister will find it very difficult to operate this provisions.  How is it intended to make sure that the conduct of the sales will be in order and that there are adequate safeguards in regard to fire insurance and safety exists from the premises?  I do not believe the Department have the necessary personnel to enforce this section properly.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to satisfy me on this point.  Local authorities would be in a better position to enforce these regulations, working in conjunction with the Department.  They have the personnel to carry out inspections.  In the case of dancehall licences a person must have fire insurance on the premises and the local authority must issue a certificate guaranteeing that the property is so insured. The matter is brought before the District Court on an annual basis.  I want to be satisfied that the Department have sufficient personnel to ensure proper and adequate safeguards in regard to the suitability of premises.  In many instances there will be large amounts of furniture and fabrics which are highly inflammable.</P>
      <P>The property should be properly inspected by the authorised fire officer for the area and this should be done on a regular basis to ensure that proper fire extinguishers are provided, that there are the necessary exits and so on.  I should like to be fully satisfied with regard to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt if the Department will be able to enforce all of these matters in as strict a way as may be desirable.  I do not <Col N="590" /> know if the Department from their administrative base in Dublin will be able to determine if the people have been in continuous occupation.  I would have thought that the local authorities would be more in touch with the local situation. I do not think that the income the Department will receive will be of any sizeable significance.  It will probably just about pay for itself.  Neither the Department nor the local authorities will make a fortune.  It is my view that the local authorities would be in a better position to administer the matter.</P>

      <P>The point came up for discussion within the Department as to whether the Minister should be given the power to issue the permits or whether they should be issued by the local authority.  The main reason we came down in favour of the Minister issuing the permits was that at least it would be centralised and the one authority would issue all the permits. While I appreciate that probably it would be easier for local authorities to do it, at the same time there could be a situation where they would issue various permits with various conditions attached and it would be frustrating both for the genuine trader and for a person who wanted to have one of those sales.  There might be very strict regulations imposed in some cases and lenient regulations imposed in other cases.  Therefore, I considered that if the power was vested in the Minister and he was the licensing authority, at least it would be centralised and the same provisions would apply across the board.  On that basis I think the Deputy would probably agree it would be better to leave it as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of whether the Department would be able to enforce it, I believe there are adequate enforcement officers and, if there are not, they will have to be appointed to ensure that when the legislation becomes law it will be enforced.  We have had numerous representations from genuine traders, from various groups on their behalf and from chambers of commerce and I can tell the Dáil they were not slow in putting pressure on the Minister to <Col N="591" /> have this kind of legislation introduced. If a situation arises&mdash;although all of us hope it will not&mdash;that one of these sales takes place where the permit is being flouted or the conditions are not being kept, the genuine traders will be able to bring it to our notice immediately just as the enforcement officers on the prices side respond immediately to a complaint as well as doing their normal work in going to various trading outlets and shops.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised about safety precautions, fire hazards and having a premises inspected, that is not a function of my Department.  It would be a matter for the authorities in the area and for another Department.  I do not think it would be wise to start crossing over various Acts which are in existence to deal with that kind of situation.  I do not think we should get involved in that. We have enough to do to enforce the regulations without looking for extra work, which is not a function in which we should involve our enforcement officers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In an earlier section there is the provision that a person must be three months in occupation.  It concerns me that a permit can be granted to a person by a district justice without taking adequate precautions to ensure that the person has the necessary insurance. In my opinion it should be necessary to have some kind of bond.  We should be careful to see that there are some safeguards for people who purchase property at these auctions.  Under the Acts dealing with auctioneers and estate agents, they are obliged by law to have a bond in the region of £10,000 with a reputable insurance company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this instance vast sums of money will be changing hands.  A person who appears before a district justice looking for such a permit should have proper fire insurance or some similar arrangement to cover adequately people who may be burned or injured in some way at such auctions.  If a person goes to an auction in respect of which an occasional trading licence has been obtained and if he is <Col N="592" /> seriously injured, who does he bring a claim against?</P>
    <P>What is the position with regard to a person who buys property at an auction and afterwards discovers that it is absolutely useless or that ownership of the property may not have been lawfully vested in the persons selling it?  I shall come back to that point again but would welcome the Minister's comments with regard to the question of fire insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The permits granted under the Bill will be granted not by a district justice but by the Minister. Therefore, the application would not be made to the normal courts but directly through the Minister.  In relation to a person who may be injured, surely it is in the interests of the person holding an auction or a monster sale, to ensure that there are safety precautions in the case of fire breaking out, so that if someone is accidentally injured on the premises he is insured to cover it.  A person who receives a permit from the Minister must display on all his advertisements and in the place where he is having his auction, his name and full address together with the number of the permit.  This would help to ensure that people are protected when they buy goods at an auction or sale such as this, if the goods do not come up to scratch.  Time and again we on all sides of the House have warned the public that they should not buy goods at such sales and auctions because very often the country of origin of the article is not known and it may be and very often is, of a doubtful quality.  It is to guard against this type of thing that we introduced the legislation so as to make it more difficult to get away with this type of offence.  It is desirable that the legislation remain as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister when issuing a permit has powers under the section to attach certain conditions to it.  Those conditions have not yet been decided but the points made by Deputy Enright in relation to fire hazards or insurance could very well attach to the permit.  I will keep those points in mind when the Minister is making conditions to attach to the first permit <Col N="593" /> issued.  Under that section of the Bill the points made by the Deputy could be covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has gone a long way towards meeting my points. However, I may put down an amendment on Report Stage to debate it further.  I have seen the results of cases such as I have mentioned.  In this sort of case the trustee of a hall or some such person, an innocent person who is making little or no profit, would be sued.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to ensure that adequate precautions are taken when making regulations under this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister elaborate on the people who will be entitled to conduct these auctions?  On the payment of a fee of £50 together with a further fee of £25 a day a person can engage in trading and must specify such matters as the Minister may determine.  The Minister authorises the person to engage in occasional trading and obliges the person to display the trading permit.  As well as that the Minister should ensure that people carrying out occasional trading should be obliged by law to take out a bond.  When a person takes out a bond his character, financial background and history is taken into account.  A thorough investigation is made to ensure the financial suitability of a person.  At present the bond costs £10,000 and a hefty premium of some hundreds of pounds is paid each year.  This is vital because in every line of business some people will cut corners.  In this instance. we are speaking of vast sums of money. About £10,000 or £20,000 worth of goods could change hands over a few days.  People can also purchase property at these auctions and consumers would like to know that they have some protection if they find out that they have been conned.  They do not wish to come up against a man of straw when they find that they have been fooled in some way. The only way a person would have adequate protection would be if a bond had been lodged.  Perhaps the Minister of State has some other ideas on this and if she has I would like to hear them as I <Col N="594" /> would like a clear picture as to how a person will be protected apart from the issuing of permits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The person could be protected by the fact that on a permit the trader must state his name and address.  If something goes wrong with the article afterwards the consumer can get after him.  Up to now once the trader was gone nothing could be done about it.</P>
      <P>In relation to the bond, genuine traders as we know them and ordinary shopkeepers do not have to have a bond to set up in business.  It would be discriminating between the two types of traders if we asked the occasional trader to take out a bond.  The penalties in the Bill and the regulations that must be complied with under the Bill are a sufficient deterrent to ensure that if an occasional trader does set up in business for a period of less than three months, at least he must comply with various regulations that were not there before. The danger that was there before is not there now, where there was no protection for members of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there will be protection now where we had no protection but it does not go far enough.  There is scope here to go a stage further to try adequately to safeguard the consumer. Where occasional trading has taken place I have known people to arrive home with so-called colour television sets that they bought for £25 or £75 but they had nothing inside and they never worked.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <P>I know that, and I appreciate that these people are foolish, innocent and gullible, but people will be innocent and gullible.  They are not in the majority but they are a big minority and their money which has been hard earned in the majority of cases must be <Col N="595" /> protected to ensure that they get value for money.  Where these people buy a similar piece of furniture in a reputable store, from people whose backgrounds and everything else is known, there is a building up of goodwill over a long period with the people who are carrying on the business in the ordinary way.  In this instance a person from Kerry can conduct an auction in Donegal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or from Galway or from Offaly.  A person may travel the length of the country and carry on trading.  I can see why the Minister will have the person's name and address; it is to ensure that the person who is conducting this sale will be known and if that person attempts to fool or defraud people there will be a right of action against him.  The penalties are considerable but one must ensure that the legislation goes a stage further and that there are means by which an action can be brought against whoever conducts the sale and carries out some sort of fraud. I do not know if the Minister can satisfy us on that; if not, I shall leave it.</P>

      <P>I think the provisions at present in the Bill are sufficient deterrents.  If we find, after the Bill has been in operation for a while, that the type of situation the Deputy talks about arises and that the provisions of the Bill are not sufficiently strong enough to stop this happening, we can take another look at it and perhaps talk in terms of ensuring that these traders will have to take out a bond.  I think the present provisions are sufficient deterrents and when they are enforced, as they will be by officers of the Department, it will ensure that things such as the Deputy has outlined will not arise.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 106:</P>
    <P>In page 8, subsection (3), between lines 21 and 22, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was cut off by the bell last week I was trying to drag the attention of the House back to the specific wording of my amendment, because I feel it is a distinct improvement on the first subparagraph of section 10 (3).  I was drawing attention to the extraordinary role given to the director in the council.  For example, the council, apparently, and the Minister mentioned this in his reply to my amendment, shall have no option but to consider any proposal made to it by the director whether or not he is in a minority of one in relation to the proposal he is making. This is an extraordinary position in which to put any council.  It could produce a situation theoretically&mdash;I do not want to stretch it too far&mdash;in which the director could effectively hamstring the operations of the council by insisting <Col N="598" /> on the observance of this subsection at all times.  I find it extraordinary that we should have anything in the Bill about the director beyond the fact that the council should have a director because the plain, ordinary understanding of the function of a director is that he does what the council tells him and that he has charge of the day-to-day operation of the council within the general parameters of policy as laid down by the council.  That is true as it ought to be of every director and council.  So, when we see special functions and special roles being written into this Bill for the director, we have to ask why.  I invite the Minister to comment specifically on the terms of my amendment:</P>
      <P>The Director shall be responsible to the Council and shall implement its policy and decisions.</P>
      <P>It says here &ldquo;decision&rdquo; but, with the agreement of the House, I should like to make that &ldquo;decisions&rdquo;.  I believe a simple misprint is responsible.  I cannot think of anything clearer than this.  If it were accepted it would involve, certainly, the deletion of (3) (a) of section 10 and I believe it makes subparagraphs (b) and (c) equally irrelevant.  On the Report Stage I hope to make this point more directly.  The whole problem can be solved if the Minister accepts this very simple amendment, which goes to the heart of the matter and makes clear what precisely the role of the director is and ought to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment Deputy Horgan has put down would probably be necessary if in fact the wording of the subsection carried the kind of dangers the Deputy reads into it.  It is not an extraordinary role for a director to direct.  Nobody can claim that it is but this direction is under the council.  Subsection (3) (a) states that &ldquo;The Director shall, in accordance with any direction given to him in that behalf by the Council, control and direct the activities of the Council and the staff of the Council.&rdquo;  That makes it clear where the direction in this case will come from.  The words used are: &ldquo;by the Council&rdquo;.  The <Col N="599" /> director only controls and directs the activities of the council and the staff in so far as he is directed to do so by the council.</P>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Horgan, that even if the director is in a minority of one he can put a proposal to the council, is true but the fact that he is in a minority of one carries the answer to the whole problem posed by that Deputy. The council are in full control and may refuse the proposal.  I cannot see the dangers referred to by Deputy Horgan arising because of the wording of the three subsections.  I do not see any reason to change the wording because I do not see any dangers to the council. The council will consist of 25 members, including the director, and those people will be chosen for their ability.  It is extremely unlikely that they will be so malleable and easily manipulated&mdash;&ldquo;manipulation&rdquo; was the word used by Deputy Horgan&mdash;by one director.  It is not unknown for the chairman of such a council to have a will of his own.  It is unlikely that a director would be able to manipulate certain chairmen who are known to be men of sound character. Even in the case of the extraordinary, in fact, the impossible case of positing a weak council the wording of the Bill in this subsection protects the activities of the council.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Horgan's amendment.  I accept that in laying down the functions, duties and responsibilities of a director there will always be different avenues open to a Minister to express those functions, duties and responsibilities.  However, the words used in section 10 may give the impression abroad that a director has overbearing powers in relation to his duties, responsibilities and powers under the Bill.  My amendment, No. 107, seeks to water down the subsection as it stands.  The amendment under discussion is a sound one.  The Bill should explicitly state that the director is an employee of the NCEA.  I accept that he is the most important employee but, <Col N="600" /> nevertheless, he is an employee.  It should be made clear that the director merely carries out the policy as expressed by the NCEA.  There may be a misunderstanding of his powers, duties and responsibility if the subsection is allowed remain in its present form.</P>

My preferred solution would be to substitute my subsection for subsections (a), (b) and (c) but I would be prepared to consider the insertion of my amendment as a new subsection (a) and the rewording of subsections (a), (b) and (c) as (b), (c) and (d) in order to remove this fundamental ambiguity.

      <P>I appreciate the motives of the Deputies and what they have said on the subsection.  I gather that they feel that the powers given in the Bill to the director will in some way be overbearing&mdash;the word used&mdash;or overwhelm the council.  If I thought that was so I would accept the amendment but I do not think it is so.  I have referred to the intellectual and moral strength of 24 members and the director and I cannot see how we could possibly get a collection of people with the expertise to act on the NCEA who could be put in the pocket of the director under the wording of the Bill.  That wording makes it clear that the role of the council is <i>vis-à-vis</i> the director and of the director <i>vis-à-vis</i> the council.  I deny that there is a fundamental <Col N="601" /> ambiguity, as suggested by Deputy Horgan.  If I accepted the amendment I would be criticising the intellectual and <Col N="602" /> moral calibre of the council.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 107:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (3), to delete lines 25 to 29 and insert:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  The Director may submit to the Council for consideration such <Col N="603" /> recommendations regarding the functions of the Council as he shall consider appropriate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This deals with the same subject matters as the last amendment.  It attempts to clarify the duties, responsibilities and functions of the director.  At present paragraphs (b) and (c) in section 10 (3) are unsatisfactory and will give rise to tension between the director and the council because of their wording.  The important word to note is &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo;. The amendment says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) The Director may submit to the council for consideration such recommendations regarding the functions of the council as he shall consider appropriate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The words used in the Bill as it stands are:</P>
    <P>(b)  The Director may from time to time make such proposals...</P>
    <P>There is a difference between recommendations and proposals.  I would have preferred the word &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo;. It is more suitable and a better parliamentary word than &ldquo;proposals&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;proposals&rdquo; in the context of paragraphs (b) and (c) seems to carry weight and to say that if the director makes these proposals they must be accepted by the council.  The word &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo; means that the director knows that he is subordinate to the council as such, that he is making recommendations to the council for consideration by the council and, if necessary, for decision by the council but at the behest of the council.  The word &ldquo;proposals&rdquo; will be seen from time to time as carrying more weight than the council might want to attach to them.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (c) I do not like the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  The Bill as it stands states:</P>
    <P>(c) The Council shall consider any proposal...</P>
    <P>That is dictating to the council.  &ldquo;Now, council, you must be a good little council <Col N="604" /> and you must consider what the director tells you to consider.  You must know your place.  The director is really the man who knows what is going on, who is running the show, who is directing you, and you shall do this&rdquo;.  The council should not be in a position of &ldquo;must&rdquo; do anything.  In parliamentary terms the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is mandatory on the council. That is demeaning the council.  If a proposal comes before the council from the director it should be within the council's own powers and decision to decide whether they will consider the proposal. Surely, if they are a body of 25 intelligent men and women, they must have the right to decide for themselves whether they shall consider any proposal.  They should be equally entitled not to consider a proposal coming from the director if they so see fit.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is indicative of the powers the Minister is trying to give the director over the council.  It is wrong that the council should be directed in the Bill to consider any proposal that the director should make to the council.</P>
    <P>The phrasing of paragraphs (b) and (c), as is in the Bill, is giving the director superior rights over the council.  It will be seen that the director has the upper hand in deliberations and in the evolution and laying down of policy at council level. That is wrong.  The council should be superior to the director.  That is not the position as the Bill stands at present.  The director will be seen to have inordinate power, especially under paragraph (c). That will make it quite clear to the council that the director has the upper hand. We as parliamentarians should not demean the council, and that is being done here by the inclusion of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; which allows the director to have the powers given to him in paragraphs (b) and (c).</P>

      <P>My amendment deletes paragraphs (b) and (c) and puts in a new paragraph (b) which incorporates paragraphs (b) and (c) as at present in the Bill but there is a difference in words.  My amendment states that &ldquo;the Director may submit to the Council for consideration such recommendations...&rdquo;&ldquo;Recommendations&rdquo; is a different word from &ldquo;proposals&rdquo;.  I am not trying to say that the director should not have the right to submit proposals but I am saying that he may submit them.  They are only recommendations and are not proposals.  The word &ldquo;proposals&rdquo; has an emotive terminology in this paragraph.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Deputy Collins's amendment, which contains a much more elegant set of phrases than that which appears in the Bill.  I believe it is much more consistent with the general spirit of the Bill.  The Minister's approach, as exemplified in this section, seems more to be the iron fist and the iron glove.  We should have something more sensible, more intelligible and less mandatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take up the points made by Deputy Collins and supported by Deputy Horgan on the grounds of elegance.  I do not believe that the difference between &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo; and &ldquo;proposals&rdquo; in the particular context of the work of the council is so great that it in any way affects the relationship between the director and the council.  That is what this amendment is about.  A proposal put by the director to the council may be rejected and a recommendation put to the council may not be <Col N="606" /> accepted.  It is the same thing.  He can recommend and the council can refuse to accept his recommendation.  He can propose and his proposal can be defeated.  I believe that the wording of the subsection is adequate to ensure the powers of the council with regard to recommendations and with regard to proposals.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins takes particular exception to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in giving powers to the director <i>vis-à-vis</i> the council and he interprets the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; correctly in this case.  He uses the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in his amendment when the director is the objective and states that &ldquo;the director shall&rdquo;.  I would have thought in so far as the council are concerned, being a body of people, that they would be able to sustain the force and strength of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; far better than an individual would.  I do not believe in this particular section, either on grounds of elegance of phrase, as Deputy Horgan put it, or on the grounds of the substantive meaning of the section, that there is anything to be feared.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    </Speaker>

      <P>&ldquo;(4) The Director shall retire upon reaching the age of sixty-five years.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is not stated anywhere that the director should retire at 65 but I would consider it good policy if we here would support a retiring age of 65, if not earlier, for public servants.  It should be mandatory for the director of this board to retire at 65.  Accordingly, I am endeavouring to have this condition of employment stipulated in subsection (4) of section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much in sympathy with the spirit behind Deputy Collins' amendment though I fear that in practice it may be a little rigid because there may be situations, though I should hope not, in which persons who reach <Col N="608" /> retiring age are granted extensions from time to time to enable them, for instance, to complete certain projects in which they are closely involved.  In general, though, I support the amendment.  Ours is a changing society.  We have a changing country and a changing Dáil.  One of the aspects of that change is that there are many younger people who are anxious and avid for responsibility and we should be very slow to encourage gerontocracies. I speak in the knowledge that we as politicians may be as guilty as anybody else in this regard.  Somebody said once that it is difficult enough to get into this place but once in it is almost impossible to get out of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking here about an aspect that relates to the public service.  We may have problems in the years ahead in that in situations in which there have been promotions of comparatively young men to positions from which it is not possible for them to be promoted further, there are just behind them a large group of people who are only slightly younger but whose natural and legitimate promotional aspects are frustrated indefinitely.  Therefore, a retiring age of 65 seems to be reasonable. The Minister will be aware that in the public service there is a regulation at least in regard to certain grades that once a public servant in a Government Department reaches the age of 60 his Minister may request his resignation.  In such circumstances I do not think that an official would have any option but to respond in a positive way to the request, regardless of what might be his personal feelings on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not be above thinking in terms of writing something similar into this legislation because we must make room for younger people in terms of promotions and so on.  Of course, we must provide also meaningful opportunities for older people to acquire and to exercise the responsibility to which their age and experience entitles them. We tend to ignore older people, to put them on a shelf as it were.  In the past it <Col N="609" /> has been said that the reason for the respect for old age was that it was unusual in primitive or even in comparatively recent modern societies to have a large number of elderly people. This was because of the shorter life expectancy then but the situation is different now as a result of medical science and better health conditions generally. We now have many more older people but we have not even begun to think in terms of how to utilise that resource for the benefit of the community.  However, that is a side issue.  In the case we are talking of here we should not assume that there are not other people who could do the job just as well and we should bear in mind also that there are other jobs that the person concerned could do elsewhere.  That is why I am in sympathy with the spirit of Deputy Collins' amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to delete subsection (4) and in a sense it appears to be consequential on amendment No. 31 which sought to exclude the director from membership of the council. Subsection (4) proposes to bind the director, as a member of the council, to the conditions of non-eligibility&mdash; bankruptcy, imprisonment and so on&mdash;that we have discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the retirement age, I take Deputy Horgan's point about the dangers of gerontocracy and the problems about hold-ups in promotion, about young people anxious to improve themselves, but I do not consider the Bill to be the place in which to specify a retirement age of 65 for the director. There will be a contract of employment and it is in that document that the retiing age ought to be specified.  I am aware that we are not discussing here the contract of employment but it is more than likely that the retiring age mentioned by Deputy Collins will be the age specified in that contract.  For all the staff of the council, the director included, the terms and conditions of employment are subject to the approval of the Minister and come under the eye of the Minister for the Public Service.  It is only reasonable to expect that the terms and conditions <Col N="610" /> of service in the case of the director and of the other employees of the council will be in line with the terms and conditions of service obtaining in the public sector generally.</P>
    <P>My main objection to the amendment is that to insert the retiring age in the legislation is to make the whole situation rigid and not to allow for any flexibility. If one wished to change the age provided for, it would be necessary to bring in an amendment to the Act and to go through the laborious process of this House.  It would be much easier to make the change if the age were set out in the contract of employment but not in the Act.</P>
    <P>I do not think there will be any danger of the person who will be the director of the council being able to last more than that number of years anyway having regard to the rate of work that will be involved and which has been involved up to now even for the <i>ad hoc</i> council.</P>
    <P>I take Deputy Horgan's point about respect for the elderly and about increased life expectancy but I do not accept that respect for the old resulted merely from the situation of there being so few of them around.  It was more than that, as was exemplified by some African tribes who are their grandfathers in order to continue the spirit of the family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said.  I know he is speaking directly about subsection (2) of section 11 which provides for a contract being entered into by the director and also by the other servants of the council.  I merely raised the question of age in order to have clarification of there being a retiring age of 65 for the director as well as for the other servants of the council.  I take the Minister's point that it will be included in the contract of employment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 109:</P>
      <P>In page 8, after line 32, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) The Director may resign his office <Col N="611" /> by giving six months' notice in writing to the Council.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill that gives the director an avenue to retire officially from the position of director.  It is important that it should be specified in the Bill rather than be left to the contract of employment. The director's position is very important in the context of the council and it is not one that should be vacated at short notice because of the need to ensure continuity.  If I may digress slightly, the position in relation to the National College of Art and Design is proof of what I am saying.  A director will retire at 65 years of age.  That is understandable and we should plan accordingly.  If a director wishes to resign prior to his retirement we are obliged in this Bill to ensure&mdash;I have said six months as the period to be laid down&mdash;that the council, the Minister and the Government will have adequate time to plan his replacement and so ensure continuity of office. That is important and should not be left to a contract.  It should be specified in the Bill that the director's position is of such importance that he must give six months' notice in writing to the council of his intention to resign.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy noted when he was proposing his amendment, this matter is also dealt with in the contract of employment.  There are certain reasons why it would not be desirable to have the period mentioned become part of our statute law.  The six months' notice might be something that would keep a highly competent person from applying for the position.  We have had reference already to the changing composition of our society and one feature of that is mobility and a desire for high mobility.  If the person is tied by statute to a six months' notice it might keep those who have the qualifications and ability to make a contribution from applying for the position.  Flexibility would be needed in trying to get someone as director for this important position.  For the reason that this would limit flexibility it would not be acceptable to stipulate <Col N="612" /> six months' notice in writing in our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister when he says that it would deter people of high ability from applying for the position.  If the position is made attractive enough, both financially and from the point of view of work satisfaction, it will attract a person of high ability.  We have an overriding responsibility to ensure that we avoid a position where we do not know what will happen in three months.  It will take more than three months to recruit a top class director. I suggest that by protecting ourselves, as we are doing here by ensuring that there is a six months' notice required, there would be a smoother running position in relation to the directorship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would call the Deputy's attention to the reverse of the coin, the obverse of which he has shown us.  The question of notice is generally reciprocal and if, for example, a director was not satisfactory the Council would have to give him six months' notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 110:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 11, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11&mdash;(1)  The Council shall appoint a Registrar whose functions shall be to establish and maintain all the records, minutes, decisions and correspondence of the Council.</P>
      <P>(2)  The appointment of the Registrar shall be on such terms and conditions as the Council shall decide, and he or she shall be an officer of the Council and may be removed only by a special resolution of the Council.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Registrar may resign his office by giving six months' notice in writing to the Council.</P>
      <P>(4)  The Registrar shall have the right to be present at all meetings of the council and any such other meetings as the Registrar shall see fit.</P>
      <P>(5)  The Registrar shall convene meetings of the Council.</P>
      <P>(6)  The Registrar shall maintain a register of awards made by the Council.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is very important.  We are establishing an award-making council which will give awards to students. We are setting down standards for courses and establishing on a statutory basis a very important educational council. As it is a statutory council making awards and considering standards, it is important that there should be an officer with prime responsibility for recording <Col N="614" /> the decisions taken by the council, the awards made by the council and the important matters which the council has made a decision on.  There is a registrar in the universities and there should be one in the NCEA.  An independent office should be created to establish the position of registrar and it must be made clear that he should be an independent person having his own contract, being responsible directly to the council and being present at meetings.  The secretarial work of the council should be his responsibility.  He should be the convenor of meetings, keep the minutes of meetings and maintain a register of awards made by the council.  There is a legal need for such an office.  I consider it of such importance that I put down this amendment.  I was rather surprised it was not in the Bill originally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that the director has being doing registrar's work and is also aware that there are eight authorised posts of assistant registrar in the NCEA.  My main reliance is on section 11 (1) of the Bill.  It provides that the council may appoint such members of staff as they think fit, subject to the concurrence of the Ministers for Education and the Public Service.  That authority embraces all posts, including that of registrar, but excludes that of director.  It covers adequately the whole position of staffing without it being specified in this section of the Bill.  Its authorised assistant registrars are dealing with the situation as of now; in the future, section 11 (1) of the Bill empowers the council to employ a registrar, if sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that I consider the position of registrar as of equal importance to that of director.  The present system referred to by the Minister needs to be tied together and to be under the umbrella of a registrar as such.  The present director is over-worked in this aspect.  There is a legal need to specify the office of registrar in the council.  It should not be left under section 11 (1). This is a statutory office which should be enshrined in this Bill, given pre-eminence <Col N="615" /> and not left to the omnibus provisions of section 11 (1).  The office of registrar is very important.  He has separate and independent responsibilities.  His powers of position should be made quite clear in the Bill, and not left to section 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident that the House will see that section 11 of the Bill gives power to the council to appoint members of staff.  The council are fully aware of their own needs.  When, and if, the post of registrar becomes necessary, then the powers for such appointment are already in the Bill.  We must adhere to the old principle of not multiplying beings beyond necessity.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 113:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 42 to 44 and insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  (a)  The Council may suspend for a period or remove from office any of its officers (including the Director and Registrar) by a special resolution passed at a meeting at which two-thirds of the members present and voting supported.</P>
      <P>(b)  The Minister may consider an appeal under this section from an officer so suspended or removed from office and may confirm the decision of the Council or refer the matter back to the Council for further consideration.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I prefer my wording to that used in section 11.  It is the council's prime responsibility to remove any of their officers, <Col N="616" /> including the director, by a special resolution, on condition that there be two-thirds of the members present and voting in favour of it.  That is a fair provision which makes it quite clear that the council have a procedure to remove their officers.  Section 11 is not sufficiently clear in its setting down of the powers of this council.  Section 11 (3) reads:</P>
    <P>The Council may not remove or suspend any of its officers (including the Director) from office save with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Why should people have to run to the Minister if they want to suspend, say, a relatively minor officer?  The Minister has enough work to do without his consent being sought to the council's decision to remove an errant servant.  The wording is wrong.  Under my amendment the council's position would be stronger. In that amendment, they have the right to suspend or dismiss an officer without referring to anyone.  In paragraph (b) there is an avenue for the dismissed or suspended person to appeal to the Minister, but that is a different matter. My amendment removes responsibility from the Minister in the first instance, in relation to a dismissal or suspension.  I am giving the council the primary function and responsibility of making their own decision in this regard, and allowing an appeal mechanism to the Minister. This is better than the structure of subsection (3) as it now stands.</P>

      <P>I maintain that the section as it is is the more humane.

      <P>The decision to dismiss must be referred to the Minister, to protect the employee of the council.

It is with the Minister that the power should rest.</P>

      <P>I feel that the Minister, in this section, is hamstringing the council at every hand's turn.  That is the position in relation to the director's situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the council.  If the Minister asks 25 good, sound men and women to serve on a council, surely he will expect them to serve responsibly and to use their own God-given brains to manage the affairs of the council.  Surely the Minister does not expect them to play ducks and drakes with each other on the question of a dismissal or suspension.  Surely the Minister will grant them the intelligence to make a proper decision about the suspension of a minor servant and give them credit for being able to make a decision.</P>
      <P>Why is the Minister trying to hamstring the council at every hand's turn, which he is doing?  He says there may be a charge on public funds.  There may very well be, but surely they will not make a decision on a dismissal or a suspension in the knowledge that they are doing something wrong.  Surely they will not be that silly.  They will make a decision on a suspension or on a dismissal based on logic, and based on the realities of the situation.  Surely they must be allowed that facility without having to run to the Minister about every decision they have to make.  The Minister is contradicting himself.</P>

      <P>There is no interference with the council.  The council's judgment, intellect and integrity may be brought into play, and they may decide on a removal or a suspension.  Section 11 (3) reads:</P>
      <P>The Council may not remove or suspend any of its officers (including the Director) from office save with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may consent to what they do.  He will have an over view.  He may very well consent in 100 per cent of the cases.  He may consent in 99 per cent of the cases but, to protect the minor servants, <Col N="618" /> in the phrase the Deputy used, each person as an employee, no matter what role the employee is in, is entitled to the full consideration of the council with all their intellectual power and ability, and also to come to the Minister who, we would hope, would add an extra dimension of humanity to particular cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not seek to use the Bill to remove from the council their duty to consider unfair dismissals.  If the council, in their wisdom or otherwise, dismiss a servant unfairly, there is an avenue open under the Unfair Dismissals Act and the Labour Court <Col N="619" /> procedures.  There are many avenues open for the protection of servants of the council.  I fully agree that they should be protected where necessary.</P>
      <P>The wording of the subsection indicates the attitude of the Minister to the council.  Why not phrase subsection (3) as follows: &ldquo;The Council may remove or suspend any of its officers (including the Director) from office with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;?  The Minister phrased the subsection negatively.  He did not phrase it positively and say the council may remove or suspend.  The Minister's attitude to the council is demeaning.</P>
      <P>He also leaves himself open to a political approach if a servant of the council feels he can bring pressure on the Minister, be he a Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, or Labour Minister, because of his political affiliations whether active or passive.  It is rather unfortunate to have that type of pressure brought on any Minister and it should be avoided.  It is important that we try to minimise it, especially in this case where there are statutory bodies to consider any redress to which an employee might feel he is entitled. That avenue is there.  The Minister does not need to be involved in this.  Unfortunately, I have to come to the conclusion that this is another attempt by the Minister to encircle the council with all sorts of ifs, ands and buts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment on Deputy Collins' statement.  This debate has indicated Deputy Collins' mind more than the Minister's, and the state of his mind is one in which he wants to give almost Fascist powers to the council and to downgrade the individual working for the council.  This was clearly indicated to me when the Deputy objected to the provision that the council shall do something on the proposal of the director.  He suggested it was wrong to make the council do something, but it was not wrong to make the director do something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also in the course of the discussion he referred to the minor servant of the council and asked why should the minor <Col N="620" /> servant of the council have to go through the council and then on to the Minister in the event of his suspension or dismissal. I would be more afraid of the philosophy behind that kind of argumentation than I would be of the philosophy behind the wording of section 11 (3).  It is a kind of Croppies-lie-down attitude to anybody who happens to be working for the council and who holds the office of director or any other office under the council.  I submit there is, as I said initially, in section 11 (3) an added dimension of humanity which is desirable in the case of servants of the council, if we use that phrase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must reject the Minister's allegation about Fascism.  It is not in my nature to support any such thing.  I feel the council have superior rights to the rights of an employee of the council.  They are the premier organ in this Bill and should be seen as such.  The council should have autonomy in relation to what they should consider and what they should not consider.  The Minister was upset at my use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in relation to individuals.  I suggested in my amendment that the director shall retire at the age of 65 years.  That is a reasonable provision to put in a Bill.  It is reasonable that senior civil servants should retire at 65 years of age.  I certainly hope to retire at 65 years. I am trying to avoid a position in law where, if this is not specified, there may be some arguments between the council, the Minister and the director as to the age at which the director should retire.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the dignity of mankind and of workers.  If there is a question of a member of the senior staff being dismissed, such as the director, an assistant registrar, or the registrar if such an officer is appointed, I agree the Minister should be informed and his consent should be sought.  As the subsection stands, each case will have to come to the Minister's desk and, to a certain extent, that may be a waste of his time.</P>

      <P>No, but if the Minister is to allow the council to enter into their own contracts, as they are entitled to do under the Bill, there will also be recourse to the civil law, to the Labour Court and to the Unfair Dismissals Act.

      <P>This amendment relates to the position of an employee other than the director who wishes to stand for a political party.  I consider that he has every right to do so and his rights of employment should be protected in the event of his withdrawing or not being re-elected.  He should be given leave without pay.  We should recognise his right to return to work for the council should he cease to be a Member of the Dáil.  The word &ldquo;disqualified&rdquo; in section 11 (6) may mean that he will lose his pension rights and his position on becoming a Member of Dáil Éireann.  We should neither discourage nor punish people for standing for election.  We should be human in this regard.  The correct attitude in this matter would be for the council to give the employee leave without pay for the duration of his service in the Dáil and to keep his position open for him.  I feel that the word &ldquo;disqualified&rdquo; might mean that an employee would lose his job.</P>

      <P>The sentiments expressed by Deputy Collins were expressed by me when I was on that side of the House.  I took a great deal of persuasion to admit the subsection into the Bill.  In the end I was persuaded that it should be inserted. I know that I once argued that it was a standard provision in Bills and I am doing the same now.  Being a standard provision does not give it validity. <Col N="622" /> However, I was convinced of the wisdom of inserting in the Bill that while a person is a Member of the Oireachtas he should not be employed by the council. On balance, it is better to have the section that way.  I held very strong views about the matter and I expressed them in this House.  For that reason I was reluctant to insert it but I have been convinced that the smooth running of the council would be better assured if the person did not have a dual allegiance &mdash;an allegiance to the Seanad or Dáil as well as an allegiance to the NCEA.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Minister feels that he is being consumed by the system, but it happens to the best. Does an employee of the council who stands for the Dáil and is elected lose his pension rights?  Does he have the right to resume his employment with the council if he retires or is not re-elected?  These two points are important.  We should not punish people who want to stand for election to Dáil Éireann.  I should not like to be party to anything which would discourage citizens from standing for election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>Section 11 (5) reads:</P>
      <P>Where a person who is an officer (including the Director) or servant of the Council is nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann or for election to either House of the Oireachtas, he shall stand seconded from employment by the Council and shall not be paid by, or be entitled to receive from the Council any remuneration or allowances&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in case he is nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann, in respect of the period commencing on his acceptance of the nomination and ending when he ceases to be a member of that House;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  in case he is nominated for election to either such House, in respect of the period commencing on his nomination and ending when he ceases to be a member of that House or fails to be elected or <Col N="623" /> withdraws his candidature, as may be appropriate;</P>
    <P>and in addition to the foregoing he shall not be entitled to reckon the whole or any part of such period for any benefits payable under any scheme under section 14 of this Act.</P>
    <P>That is the section leading to the subsection which the Deputy mentioned.  I think it would be unfair if he were not allowed to resume his position after the period and I think there should be a mechanism whereby he would not suffer the loss of his superannuation.

His period of service in the Oireachtas should not be disregarded in connection with his salary increments.

      <P>This relates to the question of an examiner being engaged to participate in an examination of knowledge or ability. An examiner should be allowed to be employed where the course is under consideration by the council for approval.  It may very well be that there might be an outside course which is seeking NCEA approval and that there may be a need to employ an examiner to examine the position and to assess standards and so on. The section should allow for an examiner to be employed for the purposes of looking at courses for which approval is pending.  It is an enabling clause and gives the council more freedom.</P>

      <P>I concur with the spirit of what Deputy Collins has said.  I would urge the Minister to take a positive attitude to it and to have a look at the whole thing between now and Report Stage, because there may be a time lag between the creation of courses, the inauguration of courses, even the examination of courses, and their validation by the NCEA and it would be sad to see <Col N="625" /> this process delayed by any undue rigidity in the structure.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of fairly serious problems with regard to this.  As the House knows, there are committees for assessing the courses, for setting them up; the Council appoints the committees and consults them and has the benefit of their research.  The appointment of an examiner before that stage has been reached would be a waste if the course which was to be examined failed of approval.  It would also be very misleading for the institution concerned if examiners were appointed and then this gave both the students and the administration of the college the impression that because examiners were appointed the Council's decision was being anticipated. A whole series of events could be set in train and this could be damaging educationally.  I cannot see any overwhelming reason for this amendment which was supported by Deputy Horgan.  In fact, if an examiner were appointed and the course was not approved and the institution was aware of the existence of an examiner already appointed, it could be very embarrassing for the council.  This amendment seems to be putting the cart before the horse.</P>

    <P>This is to ensure that transferred staffs would have protection in relation to their position consequent on being transferred.  With regard to the transfer of staff, subsection (4) (a) states that <Col N="627" /> staff who are employed in a particular grade or class of employment shall be bound to perform the duties allocated to them in any distribution or rearrangement. The wording of the subsection is rather dictatorial and seems to be somewhat restrictive.  I have attempted to protect the transferred staff by adding the words &ldquo;in keeping with his or her experience and qualifications&rdquo;.  There is a responsibility on the council to understand that people are employed in certain capacities in accordance with their qualifications.  The council do not have the right to do what they like with transferred staff.  They have an obligation to ensure that staff who are transferred will continue to do work in keeping with their experience and qualifications.  This is not stated in the subsection as it stands and it could be punitive on some officers of the council. People could be dealt with unfairly unless they are protected.  We have the opportunity of affording such protection to the employees of the council by specifying their right to continue in a certain capacity.  The council should not assume the right to change a person's position without reference to experience and qualifications.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will note that subsection (4) (a) states:</P>
      <P>The Council may, following consultation with any recognised staff associations or trade unions concerned, redistribute or rearrange the duties to be performed....</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured that people who work for the council will be looked after by their staff association and there is no need for this amendment.  If we start the process of examining semantically the amendment and the words &ldquo;in keeping with his or her experience or qualifications&rdquo;, it is obvious that a person could be employed by the council the day before this Bill becomes an Act whose experience was in a different field and whose qualifications could be in something other than the purely educational sphere.  There could be endless argument about the suitability of a qualification for a specifically educational council.  We can rely on the humanity and good sense of the council and on the safeguards already provided in subsection (4).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the imposition of limits over the constituents of plastic packaging materials, the EEC is currently reviewing the whole question of food <Col N="633" /> packaging materials with the long-term objective of establishing both migration limits and limits on individual constituents of plastic packaging materials. To date, the EEC Council has adopted a directive on limits for the monomer, vinyl chloride, which I will be very soon adapting into Irish law.</P>
    <P>The question of migration limits and limits on other constituents of plastic packaging materials is being examined by various EEC working parties on which Ireland is represented.  I am advised in this area by the Food Advisory Committee&mdash;a multidisciplinary scientific and medical body&mdash;which is keeping EEC developments on food packaging materials under continuous review.  I would emphasise, however, that I have powers available to me under which food for sale may be sampled.  If contamination from whatever source is likely to arise then foodstuffs can be specifically monitored for the presence of the relevant contaminants.</P>

    <P>1.  It is not possible, from the records maintained by the health board, to state the precise ages of patients.  The waiting list for orthodontics comprises children aged 4-12 years and others aged over 12 years whose need for treatment was noted while they were in the 4-12 age group.  Otherwise, children, as recorded in the statement are those aged 4 to 12 years.</P>
    <P>2.  Orthodontic services for the area are provided in Clonmel.  Children on the waiting list are called for treatment when their general dental condition warrants the commencement of orthodontic treatment.</P>
    <P>3.  Extractions are provided in Clonmel for adults without delay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not received the representations referred to in Question No. 17.  The statement regarding the heating value of the allowance is, roughly speaking, correct.  These groups of social welfare recipients are also being helped to meet their heating needs by the cheap fuel scheme and other schemes operated by health boards.  The Deputies will be <Col N="643" /> aware that a number of improvements in the provision of heating assistance for this winter have already been made.</P>
    <P>The combined effect of the cheap fuel schemes operated by the local authorities concerned and of the schemes administered by the health boards should ensure that the domestic heating requirements of persons needing assistance in this regard throughout the country will be catered for this winter.</P>
    <P>Persons with exceptional heating needs can also qualify for assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme operated by the health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the enlightened position which he adopted in regard to the voucher scheme would the Minister accept that the amount of the voucher is decreasing almost daily in value?  For example, is the Minister taking into consideration the recently announced increase in the cost of electricity and would he be willing to either index link the voucher or simply increase it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the cost of electricity does not affect the free electricity scheme which is based on the number of units.  The price may vary but the number of units is still the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister about the voucher, which is worth £1.50.  The enormous amount of money expended on the turf scheme prior to the introduction of the voucher would seem to allow a little latitude which without extra cost to the Exchequer would enable the Minister to increase the voucher quite significantly.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope to have a fairly comprehensive approach to heating needs.  First, there will be the <Col N="644" /> voucher.  The Deputy will realise that we have added £1 per week to all social welfare payments for the winter period which will also help.  In addition, in the city, Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board will keep fuel depots in operation to meet any particular requirements.  Voluntary organisations will have access to fuel supplies where necessary.  I have asked the corporation and the health board to lay in supplies of blankets, electric fires and various heating equipment of that kind and have these available.  As a last resort there is always the supplementary welfare scheme.  I think the preparations we have made should meet the situation this winter.  We can only hope that it will not be as severe as last winter.</P>

      <P>Since 1 October local authorities who operate the cheap fuel scheme may issue money value vouchers which will be exchanged by shopkeepers and traders for any type of domestic fuel or which can be used in paying gas or electricity bills.

    <P>The weekly value of the voucher is £1.50 and 30 weekly payments will be made in the period from October 1979 to April 1980.

The social welfare payments of all those eligible for the cheap fuel scheme have also been increased by a minimum of £1.00 per week this winter.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 to 32, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to previous questions on this subject before the summer recess, discussions took place between officials of my Department, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the British Department of Health and Social Security about the problems of paying Irish pensions in Britain and British pensions in Ireland following the break in parity between the British and Irish currencies.  As neither the British nor the Irish post offices operate a currency conversion service the following arrangements have been agreed.</P>
      <P>British pensioners resident in Ireland will be paid their pensions in sterling by payable orders cashable through banks with effect from 15 October 1979.  The pensioners concerned are being notified individually of these arrangements by the British Department of Health and Social Security.  In the meantime, as an interim arrangement, Irish post offices continued to cash British pensions at face value up to 12 October 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the amount by which British pensioners have been underpaid at post offices by reason of receiving one punt for each pound sterling, arrangements have been made to compensate them fully for the difference in the exchange rates between the Irish and British currencies for the period April to mid-October 1979.  This payment is being made this month at post offices. Similarly, since the beginning of August Irish pensioners residing in Britain are <Col N="654" /> being paid by cheque cashable at banks at the prevailing exchange rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason a number of men employed with Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta in Tuam, County Galway for several years were refused unemployment benefit this year although they registered with the National Manpower Agency and made several other efforts to get employment, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the records at my Department a number of men who had been employed by Cómhlucht Siuícre Éireann Teo, Tuam, on a seasonal basis had their claims to unemployment benefit disallowed on the grounds that they were not available for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the disqualification of these claims the deciding officer took into consideration registration of the claimants with the <Col N="655" /> National Manpower Service and all aspects of their employment history.</P>
    <P>Appeals against the disallowance were lodged in a number of cases and claims were referred to an appeals officer for determination.  In the majority of cases the appeals officer upheld the disallowance of the deciding officer.</P>
    <P>The determination of claims for unemployment benefit is a matter for statutorily appointed deciding officers and appeals officers.  It would not therefore be appropriate for me to make a statement on how the decision of the deciding officer or the appeals officer was arrived at in any of the cases in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not sound very peculiar to the Minister that for the last 20 or 30 years many of those people have been in the same situation and their claim for unemployment benefit has always been allowed?  How is it that on this occasion it has not been allowed, bearing in mind the fact that they received a blanket reply from the Department stating that they were seasonal workers only while at the same time they had registered with the National Manpower Service and the labour exchange for employment?  Indeed, to prove the point, many of them were employed.  My question is, taking all of that into account how can the Department, the deciding officer or appeals officer come to the conclusion that they are not available for work when it has been proved conclusively that they are and have been so for the last 20 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>All the factors were taken into account.  This is not a matter for me.  It is a matter for deciding officers in the first instance and appeals officers in the second.  The test is whether the employees concerned are in fact available for work.  There are altogether 117 of these cases.  Quite a number of them have been allowed but a number of them have been disallowed on the basis that they are not available for work.  A number of them are smallholders and that <Col N="656" /> was taken into account.  The fact that they had registered with the National Manpower Service was also taken into account.  But in all of the cases where appeals have been refused all the facts were considered and the reasons given were explained to the people concerned.  I repeat that these matters are governed by statute.  There is this independent deciding system: the deciding officer in the first instance, the appeals officer in the case of an appeal, and I am bound by decisions taken by these officers.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider the following fact in proof of my case and perhaps have a decision taken on it on this basis&mdash;that two people who received this blanket reply stating that they were seasonal workers only at that time were signing in the labour exchange and, when they were called to Galway for whatever type of hearing they have in the Department of Social Welfare, on that date, they had to go to their new employers to request the day off in order to go to Galway to attend the deciding officer's hearing so that their case could be made for the receipt of the money to which I feel, and I think the Minister also, feels they were entitled, which proves conclusively that they were available for work despite what the deciding officer and appeals officer said?

      <P>I believe we will want to be more specific in regard to the latitude which we allow to the Minister in this matter.  I feel that any request he makes to the council for information regarding the performance of their duties should be made in writing. That would be a proper procedure.  The wording in the section leaves it too open to the Minister to communicate by telephone, if he is peeved and wants to criticise the council in the performance of their functions.

I know that on occasion the reports of proceedings, which are required from various bodies, come quite late and this has attracted a good deal of criticism over the years.

      <P>I move amendment No. 134:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> In page 11, line 8, after &ldquo;fit&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and in keeping with the financial requirements of the Council in the pursuance of its functions under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an interesting section in that for the first time there is brought into the picture the Higher Education Authority. During the Second Stage debate this matter was discussed and I pointed out that An tUdaras, as provided for in section 3 of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, shall, in addition to the specific functions given to them in the Act, have the general functions of:</P>
    <P>(a)  furthering the development of higher education,</P>
    <P>(b) assisting in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education and preparing proposals for such investment...</P>
    <P>I argued on Second Stage that the HEA would seem to be not fully involved in the NCEA in regard to development, to policy, to academic matters and to courses in general in the way that the Act provided for.  Here we have a section which brings into play the HEA who are now the funding authority for the council. That is a change from the present position whereby the Department fund the NCEA.  Perhaps the Minister would be a little more specific on the role he envisages for the HEA in terms of this section. My amendment seeks to specify that role.</P>
    <P>What is the position specifically of the HEA <i>vis-á-vis</i> the NCEA? On what basis will the HEA decide to pay moneys to the NCEA?  Will they have a right to an input in policy and a right to examine the expenditure of the NCEA?  What liaison will there be between the NCEA and the HEA in this matter of grantaiding the NCEA?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that the council are being funded directly at present.  The <i>ad hoc</i> NCEA Council have been designated and are being financed at the moment through An Udaras.  The procedure as of now is that the financial requirements of the council <Col N="689" /> in the pursuance of their functions under the Act will be taken into account by the Authority as part of their statutory responsibility under sections 7 to 12 of the HEA Act 1971.  The council are obliged to furnish the Authority with periodic statements of their financial position and to supply the Authority with such information relative to the council as the Authority may require.  Both sections 7 and 11 of the HEA Act apply that provision.  In addition the council must ask the Authority, as a designated institution, for such subvention as they may require and the Authority must examine any such request.  That is provided for in section 8 of the Act.</P>
      <P>The Authority must include the financial requirments of the council in their own financial planning and must assess the amount of financial provision that they will recommend to the Minister. That is provided for in sections 9 and 10 of the HEA Act.  Therefore, the words suggested by the Deputy are pleonastic. They do not add anything to the section</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position in relation to having an input into policy making, that is, the overall policy making of the NCEA?  The Authority have a function in this legislation in relation to non-university education.  Obviously, in section 3 they are being given a very important function in this respect.  The Higher Education Authority have a function in the overall development and furtherance of higher education. However, apart from this provision in section 14 where the HEA designate the NCEA, there would not seem to be any function for the HEA in assisting the NCEA in setting down policy or in evolving policy in respect of higher education, though this is primarily an important function of the HEA.  It appears that in this Bill the Minister has ignored the role of the HEA in the overall development of third level education. I do not imagine that the HEA are very happy with the present situation. They must regard themselves as being out on a limb.  Yet, the HEA Act is specific in relation to their role in education.</P>

      <P>That role of the HEA is central to the whole evolution of the NCEA.  Section 3 of the HEA Act gives to the HEA the following specific functions:</P>
      <P>(a)  furthering the development of higher education.</P>
      <P>(b)  assisting in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education and preparing proposals for such investment.</P>
      <P>(c)  promoting an appreciation of the value of higher education and research,</P>
      <P>(d)  promoting the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education,</P>
      <P>(e)  promoting the democratisation of the structure of higher education.</P>
      <P>It is clear from that section that the HEA have an input so far as the laying down of policy in respect of all third level education is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there is a bias against the HEA on the part of people working in the non-university sector who may regard the Authority as being too oriented towards the university sector.  That may be the case, but if there is a need to amend the legislation, to broaden the <Col N="691" /> membership of the Authority, I should be happy to go along with such amendment. This Bill seems to be by-passing the HEA in this respect and it seems to be cutting out the seeking of advice from the HEA.</P>
    <P>The input of the HEA into non-university sector policy seems to have been by-passed by this Bill.  We have reached section 16.  The HEA are now financing the NCEA.  It does not tally in my book.  Either there is a HEA that will be effective and be involved in all third level education or there is not.  I would like a full explanation from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>He said he did not know how An tUdaras related to the NCEA. He went through section 3 of the 1971 Act and said that An tUdaras shall&mdash;that is our old friend&mdash;in addition to the specific functions given to them by this Act have the general function of furthering the development of higher education.  I submit that in assessing the needs of the NCEA and in allocating money to the NCEA, An tUdaras are furthering the development of higher education.</P>
      <P>Under (b) assisting in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education and preparing proposals for such investment, before the <i>ad hoc</i> NCEA were set up the universities practically&mdash;I say &ldquo;practically&rdquo; deliberately&mdash;had the whole field of higher education in their ambit.  An tUdaras are in fact, and very much so, assisting in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education by funding the council which deals with the third level sector outside of universities.  An tUdaras also have an obligation under section 3 to promote an appreciation of the value of higher education and research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> In assessing the needs of the council and satisfying those financial needs An tUdaras are fulfilling their obligations in regard to third level education and in regard to the promotion of appreciation of the value of higher education and research in a field that was long neglected. I am glad Deputy Collins raised this matter because it gives me an opportunity of underlining the importance of the council and the importance attached to it by An tUdaras when they financing it for this purpose.</P>
    <P>As regards promoting the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education, I do not suppose there is any single council in the whole field of education that is more involved than this council in the promotion of equality of opportunity. Therefore, An tUdaras, having designated the NCEA and having by the very act of designation commended the council, are in fact very much in the field of the promotion of the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education. As regards promoting the democratisation of the structure of higher education, An tUdaras in assessing the council, in funding it and in designating it as I have said, are helping to spread democratically third level education into corners and areas where it was not available before.</P>

      <P>I take that point but I am trying to elicit, unsuccessfully, from the Minister the depth of attachment of the HEA to the NCEA policy.  I admit that the NCEA are being funded by An tUdaras.  To what extent does that involve the HEA in policy-making?  Prior to sanctioning moneys every year do they examine the expenditure?  I am sure the method is that estimates are submitted by the NCEA to the HEA and are examined, questioned and agreed.  That is fair enough.  That is completely and totally different from the HEA having an input into the laying down of policy and the evolution of policy in the non-university sector.  I am not buying the Minister's opinion from his grand reading of section 3&mdash;far more dramatic than mine&mdash;or the imputation from it that the HEA are involved in evolution of policy.  It is not correct.</P>

      <P>There is no formal mechanism in section 16 for An tUdaras to have an examination of policy of the NCEA.  There is no formal clause, sentence or paragraph in the Bill which formally links the setting down of policy within the NCEA to the role which the HEA have and are deemed to have by virtue of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.  There is not one wisp of truth in what the Minister says, that the HEA are carrying out their functions under section 3 by virtue of section 16 of this Bill.</P>

From his last statement it would seem to me that he is demanding some form of direct interference by the HEA into the activity of the council.  If he demands it there, why does he not demand it for any of the other designated institutions? Why should the HEA want to interfere, or have the power to interfere, with the activities of the council any more than they have with the universities?  I am puzzled by the thinking behind this.  Why should the council have to have a different relationship with An tUdaras than any of the designated institutions?  It seems to me that Deputy Collins is picking out the NCEA and trying to force some kind of unnatural marriage between them and An tUdaras, a marriage, that he refuses to the other designated institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up the Minister's ridiculous suggestion that I am trying to interfere.  It is not to be expected from the Minister.  I should certainly like to see some form of co-operation or link between the Higher Education Authority and the National Council for Educational Awards.  I submit that the link which the Minister is using in section 16 is entirely inadequate.  I am seeking nothing special for the NCEA and I am not trying to isolate this body from other designated institutions. <Col N="695" /> Other designated institutions are going along a certain well-known path, of which the authorities are fully aware. However, the NCEA are in a peculiar position in that they themselves are laying down policy in an area which will become greater than the whole university sector.  The result of this Bill will be that the Higher Education Authority will not really know what the policy is in the non-university higher education sector. That is the point I am making and that is the point that I feel is being neglected here by the Minister.</P>
      <P>We are talking about the use of resources.  We are talking about the financing of these resources.  If there is not formal co-operation between the Higher Education Authority and the NCEA we may end up with a duplication of resources in some disciplines, which is surely to be avoided.  I am quite sure that the Higher Education Authority are not too pleased with the Bill in its present form in so far as there is no formal linkage into the NCEA. This is a serious omission and the superficial linkage of paying their annual bills&mdash;and administration bills, really&mdash;does not at all comply with the HEA Act requirement which our party introduced in 1971-72, I think.</P>
      <P>The university sector is controlled by the HEA and the non-university sector is controlled by the NCEA, and Peter does not know what Paul is doing.  In fact, we are in a worse situation than that, where we have the so-called Dublin Institute of Technology running off on its own canter, under the control neither of the HEA nor of the NCEA.  The Minister is closing his eyes to these major problems.  I am quite satisfied that in framing section 16 the Minister is neglecting the Higher Education Act.  Be it on his own head.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  I have two comments. First of all, the Deputy's definition of a superficial connection between An tUdaras um Ard Oideachais and the National Council for Educational Awards is the funniest definition of superficiality that ever I heard.  An tUdaras are charged with the responsibility of assessing the financial need of the council and of allotting to the council adequate finance for their activities. Anybody who is naive enough to think that is a superficial link must not know how these things work.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's second point was on the possibility of duplication in the whole third level area.  The strength of An tUdaras um Ard Oideachais is that, as far as the designated institutions are concerned, An tUdaras see the whole scene and assess the needs and allocates the resources in accordance with the expertise they have developed in considering those needs.  That is one area where there will not be duplication because An tÚdarás assesses the needs and demands of each institution and these demands are often very high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that An tUdaras have no right to control non-university sector needs? They only pay the bill for the cost of the council and have no right under this Bill to examine the evolution of policy of the NCEA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that a designated institution, when it is so designated, comes under the survey of An tUdaras. Section 7 of the 1971 Act says that an tUdaras may, annually or at such other intervals as it may determine&mdash;which could be every month if they so wanted&mdash;require any institution of higher education to submit a statement of its financial position to An tUdaras and it shall be the duty of every institution of higher education to comply with any requirements which are imposed on it under this section.</P>
      <P>The following sections all deal with that and the Deputy cannot say that An tUdaras cannot assess aspects of the policy of the NCEA because they can, and they have to finance them in the end.</P>

    <P>I would like more information on this section.  Does it mean that the council may set fees for colleges or institutions for courses, or is this restricted to fees in respect of entrance for examinations?  I accept that there is a need for fees for examinations, to cover the administrative costs and so on.  I would not be niggardly about that point.  However, if we are talking about fees to pursue courses, I totally reject this in this form, in so far as I am aware that the regional technical <Col N="698" /> colleges and colleges of technology set their own fees for courses and have tried to be as reasonable as possible and not to charge too much.  They are now in conflict with the Minister, who sent a letter on 31 July instructing all third-level university institutions to increase their fees for new students by 25 per cent forgetting, of course, that the colleges and the RTCs probably set their fees last February.</P>

      <P>It is very unclear as of now what these fees refer to.  Personally I would be against the charging of examination fees by the NCEA to students sitting for examinations for qualifications recognised by the NCEA.  If there are costs involved here, they have to be included in whatever fees are charged at the initial level of entry to the course by the institution concerned.  We all have our different views about the appropriate level of such fees, but it seems to me to be niggardly and extraordinarily timeconsuming in administrative terms for examination fees to be charged on top of course fees.  If that is what the section has in mind I, too, oppose it, but if what is in mind is simply that the NCEA can charge the institutions concerned for some services they provide in relation to validation, then I suppose there is not much difficulty about it.  Certainly, the section as it stands is unclear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an examination fee.  There are certificate, diploma, degree and repeat fees.  The income of the council at the moment from fees represents about 8 per cent of their total income.  There has never been a tradition of charging fees which would cover the costs of examinations, for example.  Indeed, in this case the fees charged for the assessment of courses would not cover the cost of the assessment.</P>
      <P>There is a principle that a fee should be paid and while the fees are small which are charged both for the institutions and the examinations, we think the principle should be maintained.  In view of the <i>cri de coeur</i> of Deputy Collins for the HEA, it is interesting to note that the HEA are pressing the council at the moment to increase their fees for assessment and for examination.</P>

      <P>In page 11, after line 44, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) Where an order under this section is proposed to be made, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution <Col N="701" /> approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to orders made by the Minister under the section.  Under section 20 (2) the Minister may revoke or amend an order.  There is no direction that such an order should come before the Houses of the Oireachtas, as I understand all ministerial orders must do. In my amendment I used the phrase, &ldquo;a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;  The other phrase refers to the draft order becoming an order after 21 sitting days.  I put down the amendment to bring it to the Minister's notice that there is nothing in the Bill which obliges him to come before the Houses with the draft order.  It is proper procedure that any order the Minister makes should come before the House and should be brought to the attention of Members of the House.  It is a procedural question and I do not think the Minister should let this pass.</P>

      <P>On the procedural question I sympathise with the spirit of Deputy Collins's amendment.  I agree that the order should be tabled before the House but I do not think it is necessary that every such order should be the subject of a positive affirmation.  I certainly believe that every such order should be subject to a positive-negative affirmation, if my contorted syntax can be followed, in the sense that it will become effective unless a motion negativing it shall have been passed with certain specified number of sitting days.</P>

      <P>With regard to the one specifically before the House rather than the suggestion from Deputy Horgan, to <Col N="702" /> want a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas would be using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and would be wasteful of the time of the Houses.  There would also be considerable delay which would not be helpful.  I did not quite keep with Deputy Horgan in his formulation.</P>

      <P>I was just proposing an alternative formulation which says that the Minister has to bring any such designation before the Houses, that it would be up to any Member of the Houses to put down a motion to disallow such designations within a certain number of sitting days, and that if nobody brings forward any such designations, which would be a most unusual occurrence and would not be done for malicious reasons or for vexatious reasons, then the Minister would have to present his case, but only then.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the procedure suggested in my amendment would be cumbersome but the wording of my amendment is the same as the wording in section 3 (3) (b).  According to the subsection the Minister may by order assign to the council such functions relating to technical, industrial, scientific, technological or commercial education as the Minister thinks fit.  Section 3 (3) (b) provides for the order to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and for the order not to be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.  I have used the same wording in my amendment.  I do not care for this procedure because I think it is cumbersome.  I would prefer the procedure whereby a draft order is laid before the House and is confirmed after a certain number of sitting days. When he makes a ministerial order, there is an obligation on a Minister to come before the House with it in draft.  As this is provided for under section 3 it should also be provided for under section 20. Designating an institute or college is important and we should have notice of it in the House.</P>

      <P>While the Minister is reading section 3, might I suggest that I would not support the formulation given in section 3.  What is involved in section 3 is the adding of a power to the NCEA which would immediately affect every institution which is designated under it. Therefore, it is quite valid that such a power should be the subject of a positive order tabled in the House.  In relation to the further designation of an individual institution, which is most likely to be a non-controversial decision, it seems that the negative order mechanism would be a simpler one than that.  If the Minister will give an undertaking to look at the matter between now and Report Stage, we need not delay any further.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 141:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 10, to delete &ldquo;eight&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;twelve&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are 23 members of the council including the director.  I contend that a quorum of eight for a meeting of the council is too low as it is only slightly over one-third of the membership of the council.  I have suggested a quorum of 12 and Deputy Horgan has suggested a quorum of ten.  I think we are both in agreement that a quorum of eight is too low.  I would be appalled to think that only one-third of the membership of a council appointed by the Government would attend a meeting.  That situation is not desirable and should not be allowed. We must increase the quorum so that the members themselves are conscious of their responsibility to attend meetings.  A quorum of 12 is more realistic than a quorum of eight.</P>

      <P>We had difficulty enough in finding a quorum of 20 out of 148 Members this afternoon. Nevertheless I feel that eight out of 23 is too low a figure.  I propose a quorum of ten and I believe that the Minister would not be sabotaging the work of the council if he were to accept either my amendment or the amendment of Deputy Collins.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The total council is composed of 25.  The normal fraction used is one-third, which is the fraction I have decided on.  As Deputy Horgan said, there is at times the difficulty in all organisations of having a quorum present. The dilemma is that we do not want to make it too high as this can be impractical and we do not want to make it too low so that the views of the council become contorted by a low number.  The <Col N="705" /> figure of one-third seems to be reasonable.  It is a percentage that is used in many organisations and I do not see any need for making the quorum any bigger.</P>

      <P>In page 12, Article 4, line 23, after &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, other than the Director&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is in relation to the schedule which affects the operations of the council.  It is designed to ensure very simply that the director should not be among those members of the council who are empowered to act as chairman in the absence of the regular chairman.  I should emphasise that there is no personal animus or feeling in this whatsoever. It is exactly the same point I made in relation to an earlier section.  If the director is to be a servant of the council he cannot at the same time be the chairman of the council.  That is a simple point and I would urge it on the Minister.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Horgan.  It seems completely out of place that the director should be chairman even in the context of the Minister's remark this morning that the director is directed by the council.  It seems to be a complete antithesis in that the chairman <Col N="706" /> could turn out to be the director himself and have a casting vote.</P>

      <P>I am amazed by this line now because Deputy Collins in particular has been championing the council and the powers of the council and the freedom of action of the council.  He is being unnecessarily sensitive to the role of the director in the council as defined in the Bill and now in the very unusual circumstances of the chairman being absent and the deputy chairman being absent he is going to refuse the council the power to elect their own chairman if they decide to elect the director.</P>
      <P>The director cannot create himself as chairman if he is not voted in by the members of council.  What Deputy Collins is advocating now is depriving the council of the right to choose the chairman it wants for a particular meeting.</P>

      <P>I cannot conceive of a position where a director who is a paid servant of the council and who acts only on the direction of the council, because he is made a member of the council, should turn out to be the chairman of a meeting of that council.  If that is the <Col N="707" /> Minister's position it is a very illogical one.  The director could have a casting vote on a very crucial issue of policy on which he might be biased because he himself might have submitted the report to the council for consideration.  That is not sound procedure.  It is not a correct attitude for the Minister to take and it is altogether out of place for a director to be elected or eligible for election as chairman of a meeting.  It is a serious issue.</P>

That is what he is doing specifically when he acts as chairman in the unlikely event of both the chairman and the deputy chairman being absent and unavailable to chair a meeting.  There is no way he can get into the chair against the will of the council and if he is in the chair it is with the will of the votes of the members of the council and if he as chairman has a casting vote it is by the will of the members of the council.  I see a total lack of logic in what Deputy Collins has said.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go too deeply into the argument between the Minister and Deputy Collins on this but I do want to refer to the question that we are here infringing in some way upon the council's competence as the Minister has suggested.  It is not as if we are releasing this council like a bunch of lunatics to do what they like wherever they like and whenever they like.  This council is set up under an act of the Oireachtas.  Its functions, its powers and everything about it are delimited in very many ways by this act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 of the schedule that we are discussing points out that subject to the provisions of this Act the council shall regulate by standing orders or otherwise its procedure and business.  All we are suggesting is that among the provisions of this Act should be one to provide that the director should not be in the unduly privileged position of being both a director of the council and chairman of the council on a special issue on a special <Col N="708" /> occasion.  We are not introducing a new principle here.  The principle is that the council works within the limits set down by the Act and there are many such limits.  We are simply adding one minor and, I would suggest, administratively important parameter to those limits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that a director who is, according to the definition in this Bill, a full member of the council should be delimited in any way as distinct from any other member of the council.  He is, in accordance with the provision of this Act a full member of the National Council for Educational Awards.  We are here talking of an eventuality which would be very rare, the chairman and deputy chairman absent and an <i>ad hoc</i> chairman chosen for a specific meeting.  The chairman who is proposed, seconded and elected to the chair is the chairman who in the opinion of the experienced members present and voting on that council is the best able to chair that particular meeting.  Now I can see no danger whatsoever to the running of the meeting.  It has not been suggested that he would not be competent to direct the meeting.  He is a full member of the council.  He is in the chair by the will of the members.  He is the person they say is best able to chair that meeting.  I cannot see how anyone could justify his exclusion by statute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an eventuality which might not occur in a hundred years.  It is simply that we do not want to impugn his membership of the council, to make him in any way less a member of the <Col N="709" /> council than any other member.  Right through the discussion there seems to be the idea that he should not be a member of the council at all.  This was put forward in several amendments by Deputy Collins and I think by Deputy Horgan as well.  This amendment is of course in keeping with that view and the Deputies are entitled to their views on it, but I take the opposite view that it would be important for the director because of his all-round commitment to the work of the council to be on the council as a full member.  If he is on the council as a full member any delimiting of that, such as would take place as a result of the acceptance of this amendment, would make him less than a full member.</P>

      <P>In section 10 of the Bill the director is described as the chief officer of the council and among his responsibilities, in accordance with the direction given to him by the council, is the responsibility to control and direct activities and staff. Paragraph 7 is a reciprocal provision whereby the council may perform such of its functions as it may deem proper through the director.  Notice where the power lies to make this decision.  It is provided that the council may delegate its functions to the director in a specific case or for a specific purpose.  The chief executive may delegate still further down the line.  The provision for delegation by a statutory body is standard in an Act setting up such a body.  Frequently such provision specifies that the body shall perform such of its functions as it may deem proper through or by its officers or servants, duly authorised on that behalf. That provision exists in paragraph 23 of the Schedule to the Higher Education Authority Act.  In drafting this provision, the draftsman argued that it was more appropriate that the council should delegate in the first instance to its chief officer, who would in turn, according to his duties and responsibilities, delegate to other staff as necessary.</P>

The basic problem goes back, as the Minister said, to the fundamental wrongness of appointing the director as a member of the council.  If there are 25 directors in a company and they all have an equal shareholding but one of them is managing director and the other 24 are not, is there any real doubt that effectively the managing director has far more authority than the other 24, even though his shareholding may be identical and he may have no greater rights than the other directors?  Effectively we know where the power lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this situation we are creating something analogous, in that we are having among the council one member who is more than just that because he is the director.  That enhances and magnifies his powers as director.  It also magnifies his significance as a council member.  We are now proposing to put him on every board of studies; the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used, not &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I am not for a moment proposing that he should be barred from being a member of the boards of studies. I am just saying that if we put him on every board of studies the man will not see his chair in his office from one end of the week to the other.  I do not know how many committees the Minister is on but I know how many committees I am on. Every time I am asked to go on another committee&mdash;it happens about once a fortnight&mdash;I refuse for the reason that I will not allow myself to become a member of any committee to which I cannot give a real commitment in terms of time and work.  Even if the director of the <Col N="713" /> NCEA were Superman, I do not think he could give the kind of commitment that is involved in his membership of so many parts and subsidiaries of the organisation.  For the sake of his health, even if for nothing else, I appeal to the Minister to make this a non-mandatory section so that he can go on a board of studies he wishes to go on and which the council want to put him on.</P>

      <P>I concur entirely with what Deputy Horgan has said.  This is the obverse side of the director being chairman.  The Minister is anxious that if the council so wish they may elect the director as chairman.  Surely that also goes for the board of studies?  If the council so wish to put him on a board of studies they shall do so.  Why give him super powers in relation to the boards of studies?  By specifying that he shall be a member of all such boards are we not making him a more important member than the other members?</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that if the council wish to appoint him to a board of studies they may do so?  In this Bill the Minister has made the director a superman.  I believe he was wrong to do so.  It may be detrimental to the overall <i>esprit de corps</i> of the council in that the shadow of the director will be over all their deliberations and this may mean that members will always have to consider what the director may say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my belief that the director should not be on any board of studies.  They are relatively technical boards.  For instance, they may be assessing a course in electronics and I do not think the director should be expected to be <i>au fait</i> with all theories and practices in the area of electronics. The director will be out of place on a board of studies.  His proper function is assessing the recommendations of the board and it appears to me superflous to have him on such a board.  As Deputy Horgan pointed out, it would be physically impossible for the director to be on all such boards.  What would be <Col N="714" /> the position if he were ill and unable to attend meetings for a long period? Would that invalidate the proceedings of the boards?  I do not think it would.  I am satisfied that the inclusion of the mandatory &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the Second Schedule is completely out of place.  It will put undue pressure on the director.  Primarily his role is not to participate in all such boards but to assess their recommendations and conclusions.  The inclusion of the director is another manifestation of the attitude of the Minister in the Bill to the role of the director but obviously we are not going to get anywhere on this point.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to take up the analogy of a company or corporation which Deputy Horgan used.  I do not think the analogy between the managing director of a manufacturing company and the director of the NCEA is acceptable.  On this council we will have 24 members in addition to the director.  Each of them has his own expertise in the educational area, particularly with regard to educational assessment and the granting of awards. While I will accept that the system of part-time directors in a company helps to build up a managing director, I do not accept that 24 people on the NCEA would in any way think they were dealing with a superman or allow their activity to be clouded by one particular individual. I do not think that is a real danger.  I am sure Deputy Horgan knows enough about people in the academic world to realise the truth of the old proverb <i>omnis comparatio clandicat</i>&mdash;all comparisons limp a bit.  This one limps in that he is not comparing like with like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take Deputy Horgan's point that the amount of committee work is very heavy and must be very wearing on anybody who takes it on.  However, there are people&mdash;the Deputy himself is one of them, as are Members of this House, members of the Government, members of semi-State bodies and people in the public service&mdash;who really work themselves to a standstill in the public interest. While the director could not be <Col N="715" /> expected to attend every meeting of every board, what the legislation is doing, even with the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, is seeing to it that <i>ex officio</i> he may attend a board meeting.</P>

      <P>His absence would not invalidate the activity of the board or its conclusions.  Perusal of the handbooks of third level institutions will show that there is an <i>ex officio</i> membership, for example, of the president of University College, Galway on all committees.  It does not mean he has to attend them all but <i>ex officio</i> he is entitled to attend them.  I think it important that the director of the council should have this power.  There is a limit to what a human being can endure and I am sure the director will not be able to attend all board meetings.  That is self-evident unless he wishes to kill himself when he is very young.</P>

      <P>During the Committee Stage debate on the Bill I said that, while I intend to give full discretion to the road authorities to decide who should be liable for tolls, I did not think it likely that the authority would impose tolls on pedestrians and cyclists and I felt sure that road authorities would wish to give special consideration to the question of exempting handicapped persons driving invalid carriages or specially adapted cars. I also mentioned the special consideration which for many years has been afforded to vehicles used by handicapped persons under the motor tax code and parking by-laws.  On further consideration of the matter and to put beyond doubt my desire that handicapped persons would be taken into account I propose that this new subsection be inserted.</P>
      <P>Consistently with the underlying principles of the Bill, the elected members of the road authorities will decide whether toll charges will apply to all or any users of a toll facility.  This new subsection simply requires that they give special consideration to the question of exempting the category of road users referred to.  In making a toll scheme the road authority must give special consideration to exempting from tolls, pedestrians, pedal cyclists, invalid carriages and vehicles especially adapted for use by physically handicapped persons.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Bill as originally drafted left it wide open to the local authority in preparing a road toll scheme to impose <Col N="718" /> tolls on pedestrians, pedal cyclists, invalids and physically handicapped people using special carriages.  I did my best on Committee Stage to have these categories specifically excluded from tolls.  I was not successful, as the Minister resisted my efforts to have the Bill amended to make it impossible for road authorities to subject these people to tolls.  It would be a disgrace to collect tolls from these people.  Having done my best on Committee Stage to exclude these people from the Bill and having failed, I put down amendment No. 3 on Report Stage.  I concede that amendment No. 2 in the name of the Minister fully meets my amendment No. 3 and is somewhat stronger than my amendment. &ldquo;Special consideration&rdquo; is stronger than &ldquo;due consideration&rdquo; and for that reason I am grateful to the Minister for his amendment.  I accept it as meeting my amendment, but I sincerely trust that no road authority will ever draft a toll scheme which proposes to subject invalids, pedestrians and cyclists to tolls and that the Minister will refuse to sanction such a proposal if it is ever submitted. As far as I understand it, there is no provision to enable the Minister to amend such a scheme: he must either approve of it or reject it.</P>
      <P>I hope that a scheme that contains proposals for collecting tolls from invalids, pedestrians and cyclists would be rejected by the Minister.  While I am sorry that the Minister did not see fit to meet me on Committee Stage or even have second thoughts on Report Stage and meet me fully there, I am glad that he has come some of the way to at least put the road authority on notice that he expects them to give special consideration to these people.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to give a clear indication as to what precisely is meant by the words &ldquo;special consideration&rdquo;.  It seems to me that on the one hand the Minister is accepting the spirit of Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment and on the other attempting to stave off the day when a decision will have to be made.  If you want to give exemption to the categories of people who, for whatever reason&mdash;and the criteria are set out in both amendments&mdash;are outside the economic market so to speak, and therefore should not be deemed to be obliged to pay a toll, surely it can be done in the legislative logic of Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment rather than in the ambiguous and ambivalent legislative language of the Minister's amendment.</P>
      <P>There is not all that much of a gap between the two amendments in essence. Perhaps the Minister could tell us what his Department's view is so that any local authority or body operating under the aegis of a local authority making a toll scheme will be in no doubt from the passing of this Bill as to what &ldquo;special consideration&rdquo; means.  Perhaps the Minister feels unable to meet Deputy Fitzpatrick 100 per cent in this regard for a variety of reasons but the object should now surely be for us to make it quite clear as legislators what our intentions are so that any subsequent Minister will have it clearly indicated in advance, and can refer to the debate and to the Ministerial explanation at the time of the Report Stage of this legislation, that the intention of the House was clear that special &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; means such and such.</P>

      <P>I have already explained the reasons for amendment No. 2.  The objection to Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment is that the exact wording would not be acceptable.  The inclusion of the final clause of that amendment, that the road authority shall satisfy the Minister that they have considered the needs of the handicapped, might be taken as implying that they need not satisfy the Minister on other elements of the toll scheme.  The Deputy is not <Col N="720" /> correct in assuming that the Minister can only approve or reject a toll scheme. Section 3 (4) (c) enables the Minister to approve a scheme with or without modification.  The Minister can modify a scheme when it comes to him for approval.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Quinn's queries, it is now proposed to incorporate in the Bill a very important subsection requiring a road authority to give special consideration to the question of exempting from tolls under the scheme, pedestrians, pedal cyclists, invalid carriages and vehicles specially adapted for use by physically andicapped persons.  I do not believe that there is any road authority which would not take cognisance of this very important subsection and I have no doubt that if such an exclusion did occur the Minister would in all likelihood modify the scheme after a public inquiry.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 50, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Committee debate I expressed great concern that an agreement with a private individual regarding a toll scheme should contain a provision for the termination of tolls when the contractor had been adequately remunerated for his investment.  We do not want a situation in which a person enters into an agreement with a road authority to construct a road or bridge or improve a road or do some other road work in exchange for a toll which he will be permitted to collect from users of the bridge or road and that that toll should continue indefinitely.  If we are going to revert to the old system of doing roads by contract and going to enter into toll agreements with private individuals, corporations or companies, we should ensure that there is provision in the agreement for its termination.  The reasonable time to terminate it would be when the contractor&mdash;for want of a better name <Col N="721" />&mdash;had been adequately remunerated for his investment.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands there is no obligation on a road authority or on the Minister to see that the toll agreement contains such machinery or clauses for its own termination.  The object of the amendment is to make sure that the agreement contains such a clause because section 9 of the Bill, which deals with agreements between road authorities and other persons in relation to the financing, construction and operation of toll roads, reads in subsection (2):</P>
    <P>(2)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, an agreement under this section may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  provide for the application of the proceeds of tolls, systems of accounting for tolls collected and the methods and times of payment of proceeds of tolls to the persons to whom they are to be paid under the terms of the agreement,</P>
    <P>(b)  provide for its duration and for its termination or suspension and for matters connected with or incidental or ancillary to or consequent upon the expiration of the agreement or such termination or suspension, and</P>
    <P>(c)  provide for the giving of such security as may be specified therein to the road authority.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure that subsection (2) (b) is complied with.  As the subsection stands an agreement with a contractor may contain a clause for termination. I want to change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  By doing so I will be ensuring that the agreement will contain a clause for the termination of the agreement. That is reasonable.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the tolls will be substantial. Experience elsewhere has shown that they will be substantial.  I am anxious to ensure that the agreement will contain machinery for its own termination and that a road authority will be obliged to direct its mind to that when it is entering into such an agreement.  That <Col N="722" /> is not an unreasonable request to make or an unreasonable provision to insert in the Bill.  It is no answer to say that a road authority will be concerned to get the best deal possible and to see that the toll agreement with a contractor contains such a clause.  Corporations, companies or individuals who will be involved in the construction of toll roads will be hard-headed businessmen concerned to make as much profit as possible out of these transactions.  There is a danger that a road authority in its anxiety to get a road or bridge constructed when finance for such work from rates or the Department is scarce&mdash;we are all aware that such money is getting scarcer and that the Customs House has a tight grip on the availability of such money&mdash;would be bullied into entering into an agreement that in the long run would not be to its own advantage or to the advantage of the general public.  A contractor might tell such an authority that by insisting on that sort of thing he would not have any dealing with that authority.  I am anxious to strengthen the hands of local authorities by inserting in the agreement with the person who will construct and operate toll roads must contain the safeguard that the agreement may be terminated on reasonable terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In confining my remarks specifically to the amendment I am in a position to comment directly on the only specific proposal that has surfaced here in relation to a toll scheme because it has emerged from within the confines of the local authority of which I was once a member and of which Deputy Moore is still a member.  It is fair to say that the concern of the public at large, and the specific public organisations who have contacted me in relation to this matter, focuses entirely on the issue that the amendment before the House concentrates upon.  Irrespective of whether the groups see a benefit or not in the specific bridge proposal to which I referred, they are all concerned with the possibility that an individual or groups of individuals can possibly profit <i>ad infinitum</i> from the traffic congestion of a certain district or area.  I support Deputy Fitzpatrick who <Col N="723" /> has urged the Minister to accept the amendment.  This will not cost anything. Any Minister worth his salt will look for such a clause in the toll scheme that will be presented to him or her for approval.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has indicated, he has a right to make a modification.  I believe any Minister would insert such a modification in a toll scheme.  Whether he would decide to do so or not I have no doubt that he would be given such advice from his officials.  It is clear that Dublin Corporation will be the first authority to operate this legislation.  If the Minister is sincere about attempting to attract private capital into the realm of road construction and expanding the national network, and it he wants to get local authority support for such an objective, he would strengthen the hand of local authority representatives if he made such a clause a requirement of the law as distinct from a voluntary one.  I cannot stress this too strongly because the view of the people I have spoken to is that there is an argument for and against the specific toll bridge in terms of the relieving of traffic congestion.  Deputy Moore, who is more up to date on this position than I, may wish to speak on this matter later.  But the clarity of that argument is obscured by the perception of how long the toll will remain in operation, how long the benefit, in terms of the relief of traffic congestion, would be translated into net profit after the capital and interest have been repaid to its promoters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I simply cannot understand for the life of me why in an enabling Bill, and this is nothing more or less, the Minister and the Government cannot avail of the opportunity to make it quite clear to the public at large that something always perceived to be the free and democratic right of anybody&mdash;the right to travel on the open highway, now running the risk of the prospect of being a chargeable right&mdash;will be chargeable within very clearly defined parameters, one of which is that when the total cost, including capital, interest and net profit are discharged, that charge will disappear and <Col N="724" /> will be clearly terminated.  That is the very essence of Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment.  In fairness to the people who drafted this Bill, I should say it is the essence and spirit of these three clauses.  What is at issue here quite simply is to give that aspiration teeth and precision.</P>
    <P>In what has been a non-controversial debate between the three parties in this House this afternoon I would urge strongly that the Minister accept this amendment.  At this stage we are talking of one proposal only, one which has provoked considerable response, one which is coloured largely by the questions centred around the duration of the toll and the principle involved in not so much allowing somebody to step in and supplement the scarce capital funds of the Customs House but rather permitting somebody to come in who, having invested capital, will reap its benefits <i>ad infinitum.</i>  That lies at the root of many people's reservation&mdash;not the location of that particular bridge, that particular time but the principle of a toll bridge and toll road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  I am advised that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the more suitable word for the purpose of the Bill.  While the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; itself does not impose a specific obligation the fact that three specific provisions relating to the application of toll proceeds, duration of an agreement and the giving of security by the private party to an agreement are included in section 9 (2) clearly indicates that those types of clauses should be considered in the preparation of any agreement.  It is open to the Minister, where he considers it desirable, to advise a local authority that he will expect certain clauses to be included in any agreement submitted for his approval.  Finally he can, if he considers it necessary, insist on the inclusion of a clause, such as a duration clause, before giving his approval to a toll scheme.  If rigid duration clauses were required to be incorporated in agreements under this section this could deter private enterprise from undertaking or participating in toll projects.  I believe that <Col N="725" /> the flexible word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the correct one to use in the circumstances especially as the necessity for Ministerial approval provides an additional safeguard.</P>
      <P>A final point which strengthens the argument against the Deputy's amendment is that the substitution of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; might be unduly restrict, if not completely rule out, the possibility of cross-subsidisation of toll projects in cases where road authorities might consider such a course reasonable and/or desirable.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I simply cannot follow the logic of the Minister of State's argument. Indeed I think the Minister himself made the same argument when he was in the House, if my memory serves me correctly, and seemed to insist that &ldquo;may&rdquo; meant the same as &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  Of course &ldquo;may&rdquo; means that the agreement may contain provisions for its termination, or duration or it may not.  That is ordinary English.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are dealing with people who have accumulated or who can get enough capital to spend a million or perhaps a few million of pounds on a road or bridge, then we are dealing with hard-headed business people who will avail of all the arguments at their disposal and drive home the hardest possible bargain they can.  If they have a willing road authority anxious to get a road or bridge constructed which they cannot construct out of their own funds and for which the Minister of the day will not make funds available, they may be stampeded into entering into an agreement without any clause for its termination.  If the Minister of the day has refused to put the road authority in funds to carry out the work they want to carry out, he will be in a fairly weak position to refuse to sanction an agreement by which they propose to get the work done without money from the Exchequer; he will be in <Col N="726" /> a very weak position indeed.  It is in that type of situation that the road authority and the Minister should be protected from themselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is what I am putting forward here.  Nobody thinks for one moment that a person who is going to spend millions of pounds on a venture such as this is going to enter into a foolish agreement.  Of course, the agreement entered into will have to be reasonable from his point of view, but we do not want him to get on to a good thing.  Nobody will expect a contractor to enter into an agreement which does not give him a fair return on his capital, that does not provide him with the necessary machinery to recover his capital and profit on it.  That is what we are doing by inviting private enterprise to come into the road-making business.  But we must ensure that the public get a fair deal.  It is only by placing an obligation on the Minister and the road authority to write into a toll agreement the machinery for determining its duration and providing for its termination we can ensure that the road authority, the taxpayer and above all, the road user gets a fair crack of the whip.  That is what this amendment is all about, nothing more and nothing less.  It would be reckless of this House to pass this Bill without that safeguard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The effect of this Bill is to provide machinery for operating toll roads which motorists and commercial users will be required to pay for.  This Bill makes history because it is the first time that the Oireachtas has been asked to give authority for the creation of toll roads.  I regard the imposition of tolls on motorists as a serious one.  Motorists through taxes and excise duties of one sort or another over the years have contributed hundreds of millions of £s to the Exchequer.  It is unreasonable that they should now be asked to pay for the use of the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government relieved motorists <Col N="729" /> from paying road tax up to 16 horse power cars.  I believe that this Bill could well be the thin edge of the wedge because it introduces a charge for using the roads.  When the road authorities and the Minister are operating this Bill they should make sure that the tolls, which will be imposed and charged under the machinery provided under the Bill, are reasonable.  Before they enter into agreement with any person, corporation or company they should be satisfied that the proposed tolls are reasonable.</P>
    <P>Toll bridges have been provided in England by public expense and not by private enterprise, as is proposed in this Bill.  I understand that it is a very costly business to finance those toll bridges.  I believe that the charge there is from 15p to 20p per private car and that charge is not doing much more than pay for its collection and is not going anywhere near servicing the interest charges on the capital involved in the undertaking.  In Britain the toll bridges are provided out of public funds by the road authorities or their equivalent.  If there is a shortfall in payment of the interest at the end of the year that interest is added on to the capital and the general taxpayer pays for it.</P>
    <P>We will have a different situation here because the toll roads will be provided by private enterprise, a company, corporation or an individual who wants to make money out of it.  You will not get public benefactors to invest millions of £s in this sort of undertaking unless they can make money out of it.  Those who undertake this will not be in a position to pass on the deficit to the general taxpayer as happens in Britain.  I believe that the toll charges here will increase and that a case will be made that the suggested toll is inadequate, is not giving a proper return, is not servicing the deficit and is not giving a return on capital.  I believe that the tolls will then be increased substantially.</P>
    <P>I understand that in Britain in respect of the proposed Humber Bridge there is talk of a toll of £1 per car so as to bring some reality into the financing of the undertaking. If that is the sort of charge to <Col N="730" /> which road users in this city can look forward, they would be better off with the old system of tax because of their having to pay a high charge on every occasion on which they use a toll road or bridge.  Dublin Corporation are negotiating for the building of a bridge to span the area from Ringsend to the North Wall quay.  I understand that there is general agreement on the corporation in this regard, but I hope sincerely that when the deal is being negotiated the corporation will ascertain exactly what the users of the bridge are to be charged.</P>
    <P>This afternoon and during the various Stages of the Bill we have discussed the terms of the tolls.  Deputy Quinn has told us that there are two schools of thought about the advisability of introducing tolls, but there is one view that seems to be common to both and that is that tolls should not be continued indefinitely. Notwithstanding the depleted forces here this evening I forced a division on an amendment which would have rendered mandatory the insertion of a termination clause in the agreement.  As the amendment was lost we must wait and see what will happen.  All we are asking is that the agreement be reasonable in terms of tolls.  When we invite private enterprise to do a job that the State should be doing we do not expect them to become public benefactors, but we must ensure that they do not get more than a fair deal.  That is what parliament and debates of this kind are all about.  There is a good deal of scope for negotiation between a road authority and the toll bridge or toll road contractor.  If there is a lucrative or a prestige site and when an offer is made to somebody who wishes to construct and operate a toll road at a place which is attractive, that person should be invited to construct another toll road elsewhere that might not be so lucrative but which might be needed badly and for which finance might not be available either locally or from the Exchequer.  I know that that may be thrown back at me by way of saying that I have been talking about the difficulty of making these toll roads or bridges pay, but of <Col N="731" /> course they can be made pay if one charges enough and if they are used by the people.  My suggestion should be taken into account when making deals of the sort that will be made in the new situation as created by this Bill.</P>
    <P>These are some of the points that occur to me regarding this Bill which has had a rather odd sort of passage through the House.  It was introduced on 13 December 1978 and when the Second Stage was taken we were told that there was considerable urgency about the matter. However, the whole thing was brought to a halt in June last, though there was ample opportunity for concluding the legislation before the Summer recess.  Instead, it was put into cold storage and has now come up again towards the end of the year.  We know that, in anticipation of the passing of the Bill, Dublin Corporation have been taking certain steps and reaching certain decisions; but the Bill is one that the public will be watching carefully.  The schemes that will be authorised on foot of the Bill will be watched with much interest and will be scrutinised closely by the public generally for many years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right and proper that Deputies Fitzpatrick and Quinn should examine in detail all the provisions of this measure but we must realise, too, that we are dealing with a new type of legislation, legislation that is therefore exciting.  However, I appreciate the meticulous way in which both the Deputies have examined some aspects of the Bill this evening.  Since this is a Bill to deal with a new type of situation there is bound to be a period of trial and error. Of course, it will be necessary to scrutinise the working of the legislation in regard to any new undertaking in any part of the country.  In some cases there will be a mixture of both private and public enterprise involved.  In this context we are reminded of the proposed toll bridge in Dublin city.  It may well be that after a year or so of that bridge being in <Col N="732" /> operation we may find it necessary to make changes, but the local authority will have sufficient powers to make a good deal with the sponsors of the bridge on foot of this Bill, and even with local legislation they will have the power to have a bridge built.  I am sure everybody here will agree that the person building the bridge is entitled to a reasonable profit on the project, but in common with other Members of the House, I would question the making of too much profit in this way.  After a bridge has been built and has paid for itself and the builder has been allowed a reasonable profit, we must put whatever profits are there to the common good.  That poses the question: if they do not pay, do they pay for the loss as well?  Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned a charge of £1 per truck&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understand that this is provided for in the Bill and the Deputy's amendment is superfluous.  The guarantee is in the Bill already.  If we adopt a proper attitude to toll roads and bridges we will fill in something which has been missing in the life of the country.  None of us likes paying tax but we are paying a hidden tax when we try to drive cars and trucks through traffic jams.  If private enterprise moves in to help with road building, why not welcome them? We do not object to them building houses because the public authorities cannot build enough.</P>
      <P>The discussion has been a healthy one.  I hope the Bill will become law very shortly and will usher in a new era in road travel which will simplify things and perhaps give us a more equitable system of taxation.</P>

      <P>I have considerable respect for my Dublin South-East colleague, Deputy Moore, but he has given me the impression of wanting to travel down both sides of the road, toll road or no, on this issue.  In rejecting the last amendment, which he obviously supports in spirit if not with his feet, the Minister has left himself open to being backed into a corner whereby, having made the modification as he clearly indicates he or his successors have the right to do, the financial backers, the much-lauded private sector, will simply say: &ldquo;Sorry, we will not accept the time frame of duration that you by way of modification have inserted into this agreement.  It was an option that you choose yourself.&rdquo;  If the Minister had accepted the very mild amendment Deputy Fitzpatrick put forward he would have put himself in a position of not leaving his side vulnerable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Deputy Moore <Col N="734" /> choose to speak on that point, I felt I should reply.  Having regard to the fact that the Minister of State will reply and also to the fact that it has taken one year for this legislation to go through the House, can the Minister indicate what Government policy is in relation to putting this enabling legislation into effect? We know that the declared policy objective at the outset was to encourage the private sector to go into road building.  Since that declared objective was stated by the Government, they have published their roads plan for the 1980's.  Can the Minister indicate what percentage, section or part of the roads plan they envisage will be financed by the private sector?  What sections of the roads plan will be financed by tolls irrespective of whether the finance in the form of capital made available either by the private sector, the State, the EEC Regional Fund or the EMS resource transfers is recouped or financed by way of tolls?  Have the Government a policy on this or are they, as I suspect, simply responding to a one off inquiry from a single source in the private sec-tor&mdash;the Government have never denied this&mdash;in relation to a toll road, that is, the Ringsend Bridge?</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I said that the private sector have researched road structure and have come up with the observation that the only profitable area for private enterprise is toll bridges. There are no more than about five of them.  It is unprofitable for the private sector to attempt to produce a toll road because of the land acquisition problem involved irrespective of the powers a road authority have under compulsory purchase legislation.  The commitment of capital and the charges that the commercial banks and the associated banks are making for such capital is in itself a deterrent, having regard to the un-specifiable length of time involved in finalising such land acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister, when we first talked about this legislation the roads plan had not been published. Presumably a roads policy still needed to be clarified within the Department and <Col N="735" /> the Custom House.  Now that that has been done and the Government, through the economic Ministers, have clearly identified that telecommunications and infrastructure, that is roads basically, are major deterrents to industrial progress, and therefore to the Government's overall economic objective of job creation, and since the Government's public sector borrowing requirements are totally askew with their declared manifesto commitment, can the Minister indicate if the Government propose to bring forward or meet on time as indicated in the 1980 road plan any of the road proposals by means of a toll?  By that I mean that, where the Government take the initiative in saying to a local authority that they would like them, in the national interest and in accordance with this White Paper or that Green Paper, to bring forward, for example, the Limerick by-pass, that they would recommend to Limerick Corporation and council that they should provide a toll roads scheme and that they would make a specific application to Brussels under the Regional Fund or Ortoli facility for funding on the basis that part of that capital investment could be refunded by the economic return that could be measured from it.  That is a legitimate question and one to which the Minister should give serious reply.</P>
    <P>I would regard myself as being fairly well informed, but neither I nor the Labour Party have any evidence to suggest that, other than the declared interest by the private sector in participating in toll roads that we are already aware of and to which the House has already referred, there is any other interest being positively declared.  In that context, perhaps the Minister would update his reply to me of Wednesday, 14 March.  At that stage, I asked the Minister for the Environment the number of organisations, both private and professional, which had contacted him in writing, expressing a positive interest in participating in the provision of toll roads and, in respect of such indications, (1) the number of such organisations, <Col N="736" /> both private and professional, (2) the number of specific projects identified and (3) the approximate volume of capital which was indicated as being available for participation in such toll road schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in March of this year that he was aware that a number of road authorities also have been approached about particular projects in their areas.  At that stage this legislation was hardly through its Second Stage. Perhaps the Minister is now in a position, since the legislation has been clearly published and, indeed, one local authority has moved in anticipation of its being passed, to indicate to the House just how successful this legislation has been in attracting private capital into the road capital programme.  The Labour Party have always maintained in this House that this legislation is, essentially, enabling legislation.  There are certain drafting defects which were identified on Committee Stage and these have come up again on Report Stage, but it is enabling legislation with the purpose of improving that section of the national primary road system which is grossly defective in certain key areas, which has been identified as being a major barrier to economic progress in the eighties and nineties.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear to all on all sides of the House, and to all of us who have contact with local authorities and are aware that the Government's economic targets are totally off course, particularly with regard to Government borrowing, that the capital resources required to make major improvements in the national primary road system simply do not exist. An alternative to replacing these is provided in the possibility of a toll scheme but that would require, not the private sector but the public sector itself, that is, the local authorities, road authorities, getting support and encouragement from the Department of the Environment for themselves to put forward toll road schemes.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, could the Minister, if he is in a position to do so, indicate if any other private interests&mdash;without in any <Col N="737" /> way wishing to break the confidentiality of an approach, or looking for the names or locations&mdash;have approached the Department in a positive sense, since March 14 and, if so, could he indicate the volume of capital involved?  Could the Minister indicate, now that the Government's roads programme has been published, if he or the Government proposes to suggest, or indeed encourage, any local authority who have not been approached by the private sector to themselves come forward with a toll road scheme?  Could he indicate whether such a scheme of road financing is more likely to attract funds out of Brussels, such as EMS resources transfers or, alternatively, the Ortoli facility?  On those three questions, I conclude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply, I make three important points.  First, the Bill is an enabling measure.  Therefore there is no question of any compulsion or pressure on road authorities to constitute tolls for public roads.  Secondly, the Bill is so drafted as to preserve, in full, the existing statutory responsibilities, role and power of decision of the road authorities in relation to the provision of public roads in their administrative areas.  All the important decisions of road authorities under the Bill, that is, the making of a toll scheme, of by-laws for the operation of toll roads, entering into agreements with private persons for financing, construction, maintenance and management of a toll project, the making of agency arrangements with other road authorities, will be reserved for the elected members of the local authorities themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who knows the local authorities system as well as Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Quinn do should be quite satisfied with the vesting of the real decisions in regard to tolls in the elected members in this manner, which is virtually a guarantee that there will be no abuse of the enabling powers provided in this Bill&mdash;and that is the third point.  The rights and interests of the public generally will be amply protected under the Bill.  Notice of the making of a toll <Col N="738" /> scheme, accompanied by an explanatory statement, must be published in the press.  The public will have at least one month to examine the toll scheme, accompanying explanatory statement and any relevant maps and a further period of at least two months in which to lodge objections with the Minister.  In the event of an objection, a local inquiry must be held.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn had some queries in relation to the Government's national road plan for the 1980's.  The position is at the moment that the Government are quite confident that they will be able to finance, by various means, this scheme in full during the 1980's.</P>

      <P>The objects of the Bill are threefold:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  to regulate the issue, use and redemption of trading stamps,</P>
      <P>(ii)  to regulate the business of issuing and redeeming trading stamps, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  to provide for other connected matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been written, and spoken, on the subject of trading stamps.  I do not think, therefore, that the House will expect me now to describe either the features of trading stamps schemes or the economics of their operation.  In one famous American court case, however&mdash;namely the Rast case of <Col N="739" /> 1916&mdash;trading stamps were said to be a &ldquo;lure to improvidence&rdquo;.  In the circumstances of 1979 that is, perhaps, too extreme a statement of their persuasive power.  But it does, nevertheless, summarise one side of the debate on the merits or otherwise of trading stamps. The other side, of course, as argued by those who defend the concept of stamp trading, is that it is no more than a long established and efficient form of sales promotion.  In between, there is a wide range of other arguments both for and against.</P>
    <P>Both points of view have already been expressed and are well documented in other countries where trading stamps schemes appeared and were then made the subject of legislative attention.  Some countries, notably Canada, Denmark and Norway, saw fit ultimately to ban such stamps.  Others, such as the United Kingdom and some states in America, adopted a more flexible approach by introducing varying kinds of regulatory provisions.</P>
    <P>The type of stamp trading which is covered by the Bill is the general kind of scheme organised by a specialist stamp firm which serves a number of different retail outlets.  Excluded are &ldquo;private&rdquo; voucher or stamp schemes, that is to say, schemes which are organised by a single retailer or his supplier and under which stamps are redeemable from that retailer or supplier alone.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House opts for regulation as distinct from prohibition. Its nature and scope spring from a close study by the Department over some years into trading stamp business as it developed in Ireland.  One major finding, in favour of regulation instead of suppression, was that it is the features of certain schemes, and not so much the schemes themselves, that are disquieting. In 1971, the question of stamp trading was raised at the public inquiry by the then Fair Trade Commission into grocery goods.  Though the commission's report, in July 1972, made no recommendations in the matter, the view <Col N="740" /> was offered that trading stamps were an undesirable method of sales promotion and an unsatisfactory method of savings.</P>
    <P>In their report for November 1972 the National Prices Commission recommended that the Minister should explore the possibility of legally prohibiting trading stamps.  The Prices Commission felt that stamps were an unsatisfactory method of savings and created difficulties for individual retailers and housewives. However, in their report for May 1973 the Prices Commission recognised the legal difficulties involved in producing such legislation and recommended instead a higher cash redemption value for stamps and that advance notice be required of changes in the numbers of stamps needed for items in a gift catalogue.</P>
    <P>In its present form the Bill takes account of the recommendations of the National Prices Commission.  It has been framed with the interests both of retailers and of consumers in mind.  It is concerned with the needs of retailers, because of their susceptibility, on one hand, to pressure to sell stamps and, on the other, their legitimate need to adopt competitive devices.  But the predominant concern is that the interests of consumers as stamp holders should be best served.</P>
    <P>To this end the Bill adopts the approach that all pertinent and relevant facts about trading stamps themselves&mdash;and about the companies which promote trading stamps schemes&mdash; should be made fully available and accessible to the buying public.  The facts I have in mind would include, in respect of the stamps themselves, information as to their real value in terms of purchasing merchandise and, in respect of the companies, information as to their financial standing.  For there is no evidence to suggest that the buying public generally lacks shrewdness of judgment or common sense in determining good value for money.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains definitions for the purposes of the Bill.  Excluded from the definition of a &ldquo;trading stamp&rdquo; is a stamp, coupon, voucher, token or similar <Col N="741" /> device which is redeemable from the seller of goods or his supplier or from the person who provides the service.  Such schemes come closest to being the acceptable type of competitive tool for retailers that trading stamps are sometimes claimed to be.  Moreover, because of their limited spread in terms of use, such schemes do not pose the same problems for consumers in the area of price comparisons as do the more widespread schemes.</P>
    <P>Independent stamp operators on the other hand&mdash;meaning the specialist stamp firms which serve a number of different retail outlets&mdash;will be covered by the provisions of the Bill.  Such operators are few in Ireland but it is, ironically, this very fact that often leaves them in a position, by the use of the franchising system, to influence the structure of competition in the retail trade.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides that only a company within the meaning of the Companies Act, 1963, having a place of business within the State, will be permitted to carry on business as the promoter of a trading stamps scheme.  More importantly, however, the section waives the right of a private company which is the promoter of a trading stamp scheme not to annex prescribed accounting data to its annual return.  This provision aims to make sure that the public can get essential facts about the stamp company's financial state and the likelihood of its remaining solvent.  This is somewhat similar to the approach adopted in the United Kingdom in its legislation and it is an approach which has not been found wanting there to date.</P>
    <P>One of the allegedly essential features of the business of the trading stamp company is the operation of the exclusive franchise.  This is the system whereby the stamp company allocates stamps to one retailer, or to a limited number of them, in the same line of business in a particular area.  Inherent in this approach is the freedom to be selective which is enjoyed by the stamp company. However, unintentionally such an untrammelled right to be selective can lead to abuse.  I am sure that all Members <Col N="742" /> of the House have heard complaints from time to time from traders who claimed to have been refused the right to participate in a trading stamps scheme for reasons which in their eyes were less than sound economic or business ones.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill tackles this problem.  It provides that the unreasonable withholding by a company which is the promoter of a trading stamps scheme of a supply of trading stamps will be an unfair practice within the meaning of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  The section does not pass judgement on what is deemed to be unreasonable. The determination of this can clearly depend so much on the circumstances of individual cases; and in the operation of the investigative machinery that is available under the Restrictive Practices Act the differing circumstances of different cases can be fully taken into account.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 deal with the notion of the &ldquo;cash option&rdquo;.  This option has two main objectives.  Firstly, it provides for the indication of the worth of the stamps in cash, thus aiding rational comparison with the value of goods offered in exchange for stamps.  Secondly, it offers the stamp holder the right of choosing between redemption for cash or for goods.</P>
    <P>Under section 4, the Minister may, by order, prescribe the value to be specified on the face of a trading stamp.  The alternative would be to leave the option entirely to the stamp company to decide on the level of the cash value and if this were done an artificially low value could be fixed.  It is important, therefore, that a corrective power be available to meet such a situation.</P>
    <P>In the case of section 5, a provision worthy of specific mention, the holder of the trading stamps is enabled to recover the value of the stamps as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction where a stamp trading company fails to redeem the stamps for cash. This is a much more realistic and effective formula from the stamp holder's viewpoint than would be, say, the creation of an offence for the trading stamp <Col N="743" /> company in such circumstances.  If the stamp holder's wish is to obtain cash in exchange for stamps there is now an unequivocal statutory right to sue for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The main objective of the cash option&mdash;namely, to permit stamp holders to calculate the worth of stamps in merchandise&mdash;would be frustrated, of course, if adequate provision were not made for the availability of catalogues where goods are offered in exchange for stamps.</P>
    <P>Section 6 makes such provision and obviates the possibility of confusion among stamp holders by making sure of a reasonable time-lag between the replacement of old catalogues by new ones.</P>
    <P>Two of the offences created in section 7 deserve elaboration.  An alteration in exchange values clearly affects, in turn, the real value of the stamps held by shoppers.  Where more stamps than before are required to obtain goods in exchange, this is in effect akin to a price increase.  Hence, an offence is being created where exchange values in catalogues are altered without the Minister's prior approval.  Likewise, the expectations of stamp holders can be seriously jeopardised if specific goods publicised in a catalogue, and for which shoppers had been collecting stamps for the purposes of an exchange, are found later to be unavailable from the stamp company.  Accordingly, an offence is being created too to prevent this type of situation.</P>
    <P>The Sale of Goods Act, 1893, provides for implied conditions and warranties in contracts for the sale of goods.  Such conditions and warranties are, of course, being improved by the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill, which is still before the House.  In the context of the present Bill, however, there is no good reason why goods exchanged for stamps should not carry the same implied undertakings as to quality and fitness.  Section 8 of the Bill makes the requisite provisions in this respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> Generally, stamps are offered to shoppers at retail outlets.  It is at this point of doing their business, therefore, that shoppers should have access to certain basic items of information relating to stamps offered with the goods purchased.  Section 9 makes obligatory the display of specified items of information which items are considered to be those most fundamental to the shopper.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with a kind of misrepresentation which is peculiar to stamp trading business.  This poses as a type of promotional inducement in the form of a statement which describes the worth of stamps in terms of the money the prospective collector must spend in order to receive them.  Misleading though they are, these statements, nonetheless, serve their purpose by enticing consumers into shopping in the outlets concerned. The use of such deceptive claims should clearly be stopped and section 10 has been drafted for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is section 11 of the Bill, which declares contracts of a specified type to be void.  This section is emphatically a protective provision for traders as distinct from consumers. Complaints have been made to the Department, predominantly by petrol retailers, that their suppliers have sometimes compelled them to offer trading stamps by reason of their operating from leased or licensed premises.  Terms of leases, which have a promotional emphasis from the viewpoint of the lessor, have been invoked for this purpose.  That such can happen is a most unsatisfactory and inequitable state of affairs.  It is contrary to any principle of fair play that any trader should be forced into doing a business that he does not want to do, particularly when, as some complaints have alleged, the trader must fund the cost of the unwanted business from the profit gained on his normal business.  Section 11 is designed to put an end to this practice.  Given its objective, I am sure it will have the full backing of the House.  Its purpose is none other than to ensure that lessees and licensees of premises cannot be forced to handle trading stamps on foot of a <Col N="745" /> condition of a lease or licence.  The section will not curtail competition or limit the competitive use of stamps by those traders who themselves choose to handle stamps by agreement with a stamp company. Nor will it affect the contractual obligations as between a retailer and his customers where the retailer decides, of his own free will, to offer stamps and the fact that he offers them acts as an inducement to shoppers to take their custom to him.</P>
    <P>Because of what has been happening recently in relation to petrol supplies and because of certain other developments both in this country and in Britain, some people may be inclined to say that stamp trading as a marketing tool is on the decline.  They might then ask if there is really any need for the present measure. My answer to that is, &ldquo;Definitely yes&rdquo;, and from their remarks on another Bill not too long ago, I believe that most Deputies&mdash;and particularly those Deputies who have shown a special interest in the subject&mdash;would agree with me.  For trading stamps are still a prevalent factor in our trading sector and there are few, if any, who do not think that they should be subject to some kind of legislative control.  It is important that the type of control in this area be balanced and effective, yet free from the danger of &ldquo;overkill&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is the first genuine attempt of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy to ensure that we have some kind of protection in regard to trading stamps.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House.  It is a necessary Bill and one that will be welcomed by most people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are mixed views in regard to the use of trading stamps.  However, trading stamps are with us and I believe they will remain with us.  An important aspect of this matter is that the Department are responsible for the education of consumers through the use of the media and <Col N="746" /> the schools.  We should also try to inform consumers of the necessity to ensure that they are getting value for money when making purchases.  The number of trading stamps given with purchases is an important factor for many consumers.  The Bill should ensure that consumers are able to cash stamps or obtain alternative goods for them.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress the need to ensure that only reputable firms are permitted to issue trading stamps.  The Minister should ensure that there are safeguards and that the Department make regular checks in the Companies Office on the annual returns of firms issuing trading stamps in order to ensure that they are fulfilling their obligations and furnishing details to the Companies Office.  The Minister should also ensure that companies issuing trading stamps have sufficient share capital to meet any claims that may be brought against them.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a wide-ranging one and there are many important items in it.  I am aware that the withholding of supplies of stamps can adversely affect some firms such as petrol outlets and has been responsible for the closure of some small businesses.  I brought this matter to the Minister's attention and he said that every effort would be made to remedy the situation.  Only two firms in the town to which I referred had trading stamps. This, slowly but surely, put a stranglehold on the remaining firms. This is very wrong and I would hope that section 3 of this Bill will meet that situation.  The companies issuing these stamps are very wealthy and if they are only going to issue stamps to perhaps two firms in a particular area they could, by doing this, be able to close down other businesses.  This is morally wrong and we must ensure, with all the strength that we command, that it will be legally wrong as well and that they are prevented from doing this.  If action is not taken large quantities of trading stamps will be issued as bonuses and so on and, for a two- or three-month period, they could boost the sales of the firms to whom the stamps are supplied.  In this way and by other devices they could close down the <Col N="747" /> other firms and they may have the ulterior motive of trying to buy up the firms which they are causing to be closed down.  It is entirely wrong that a number of these firms could unreasonably and wrongfully withhold stamps from certain firms and I hope this Bill will remedy this situation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the redemption of trading stamps for cash, I was not aware that this could be done.  I have seen the catalogues that are issued and from speaking to housewives and people who are involved in buying stamps I know that they have been used by people to obtain household goods and so on.  I do not know how regularly the Minister intends to check the catalogues to see whether or not sufficient goods are offered for the stamps.  Will this be on a monthly or a three-monthly basis?  What notice will the trading stamp firms have to give to the Department when changing their catalogues?  This is dealt with in sections 6 and 7.  I have seen these catalogues and I am amazed at the rapidity with which they change.  One might require 50 books for a certain type of radio and some weeks later one would require 70 books for the same radio and several weeks later again one would require 80 books for the same radio.  The speed with which the catalogues are changing is far too rapid.  This is wrong and I am glad to see that a genuine effort is being made to get at some of these companies who are making a kill in regard to the items offered in their catalogues.</P>
    <P>Let us take, for example, a small radio bought by the trading stamp firms for about £20.  The amount of stamps required to obtain it would be worth about £20 but inside of a few weeks it is raised to £25 and then to £30.  I want the Minister to ensure that this is not allowed to happen, because if it is allowed to happen it will be going in the face of this Bill and against the spirit of this Bill.  The Minister should ensure that no company are allowed to make excessive profits from the issuing of their <Col N="748" /> trading stamps by means of changing the values quoted in their catalogues.  This issue is of great importance and we must ensure that it is thoroughly investigated. Section 6 deals in detail with the lodging of catalogues and the changing of the dates and so on and this is of the utmost importance.</P>
    <P>Penalties are included in the Bill.  A person convicted on indictment shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding £5,000.  This is of interest.  A further section deals with a person convicted in the District Court and the fine here is only £500.  The trading stamp companies which we are dealing with here are firms whose total business turnover could be millions of pounds in one year.  It is clear from this that the £5,000 fine might go some way towards making them more careful that they are complying with the law but it is certainly not a sufficient deterrent to some of these companies.  This Bill should have the strength and the teeth to make these huge companies take care and make them wide awake to the fact that this Bill means business.  A fine of £500 would indicate that the Government do not really mean business to the extent necessary. Much more minor offences involving much less money than we are dealing with here are subject to fines of £500.  In this case this is not sufficiently strong.</P>
    <P>What powers has the Minister to deal with firms which continually flout the regulations and the rules set out here and are continually in breach of this Act? Normally in cases of this nature the fines increase with the number of convictions recorded against a firm or person.  What exactly does the Minister intend to do in the case of a firm that continues to be in breach of these regulations?  This is something that could prove to be of importance, particularly in regard to the unreasonable withholding of stamps from firms or in regard to certain offences relating to changes in the catalogues.  What powers exactly has the Minister to prevent a recurrence of the offences?</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the Government's economic mismanagement, which has resulted in the credit squeeze and in a general loss of confidence in agriculture, industry, construction, and other parts of the economy.</P>
      <P>I said in the Dáil last week, perhaps in a disorderly way, that it was disgraceful that the Government had not been able or did not wish or were afraid to make time out of their own resources for this debate, not because there is any special merit in the form of words which Deputy Peter Barry and myself used in putting down this motion but because it is high time that the economy received a full debate in this House, not in the limited form of a Private Members' Motion heard by whatever Deputies and members of the press and public are still around at an hour in the evening when the possibility for coverage has largely disappeared and in which speakers are limited to a length of time which makes it impossible to do justice to a subject of this kind.  I contrasted the behaviour of this Government in this regard with the behaviour of the Government for which I worked which, in circumstances of Dáil pressure no less exacting and in my recollection a good deal more exacting than this Government now face, made time in November 1976 for a debate of this sort which occupied many hours on three separate days.  The House and the people, if they are interested in such matters, can draw their own conclusions from this act of contempt or of cowardice. I am not sure which emotion&mdash;if it is an emotion&mdash;is uppermost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the House that the Taoiseach did not deny yesterday the information I passed to the House that we will get a White Paper towards the end of November.  That means that he will be more or less forgiven if it is a week or ten days late and does not appear until early <Col N="750" /> December.  The House should understand that this would make it impossible to have a debate on the forthcoming White Paper before Christmas unless that debate is to be taken together with the Adjournment Debate.  That would be an unfair and unsatisfactory solution.  In an Adjournment Debate, in which time for most speakers is limited to 30 minutes as a rule and 45 minutes at the outside, every possible aspect of the Government's work or lack of it needs to be discussed and not merely the economy.  To expect this House to debate the White Paper in the context of an Adjournment Debate, when no other opportunity will offer for a full debate on the economy before the budget some time in February, is forcing this House to neglect its duty in this regard.  The Minister for Finance knows perfectly well that by taking this line the Government have succeeded in their objective of trying to distract Dáil attention and to that extent some part of public attention from the position of the economy, to the poor state of which he himself in late months has repeatedly testified, as has the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
    <P>These two Ministers get a certain amount of sympathy from me, though perhaps they do not want and do not value it.  I have some sympathy for them because at least they are visible up on deck.  They are like the captain and first mate on the conning tower of a submarine and are visible for as long as the boat stays surfaced.  On the other hand, I have nothing but contempt for their colleagues on the front bench or on the back benches who are trying to distance themselves from the mistakes this Government have made and are trying by whispers to say, &ldquo;Well, of course, that's O'Donoghue.  We ought never to have bothered with an academic like that.  We ought never to have listened to him.  He has led us all astray.  He has Jack by the ear&rdquo;.  That kind of talk is contemptible from men who were perfectly willing to take the benefit of the Santa Claus advice that the same Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, was handing out two-and-a-half years ago <Col N="751" /> when they were preparing their election manifesto.</P>
    <P>In those days that refugee from the Muppet laboratories, Dr. Bunsen, was telling them that they could do away with major sources of public revenue, that they could scrap major sources of public taxation, that they could hand out to the people relatively enormous sums of money to spend the way they please and that they could do away with many of the restraints which the National Coalition had been obliged to impose, which they had painfully struggled through and for the imposition of which they paid the penalty.  They were very happy to go along with the sunburst period, happy to believe that ground rents and rates could be abolished, that car tax could be abolished, that tax concessions could be given on all sides and very happy to believe that this would generate economic activity so enormous that the revenue buoyancy would solve all problems and that jobs would drop out of the skies.  They were happy to believe it then but a different tune is now being played and a different face is now being worn by these gentlemen.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for the economic chaos in which this country now finds itself rests not just on the Minister for Finance, though I am sure he would resent and repel the idea of being defended by me.  It rests not just on him or on the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  It equally rests on those other geniuses, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, the bluffmaster general, Deputy Lenihan and all the other members of the Government who were perfectly happy to take the benefit of the advice they were getting from this academic import from Trinity College in 1977, but now do not want to be stuck with it and feel that he can be used as a scapegoat.</P>
    <P>If I may introduce a premature note of levity into a serious subject, it reminds me of one of the favourite film clichés of my childhood when that imperishable <Col N="752" /> pair, Laurel and Hardy, were alive and flourishing.  Whenever some appalling disaster occurred in their lives, invariably the fault of Hardy, he would always turn to his simpering colleague, Laurel and say, &ldquo;There is another nice mess you have got me into,&rdquo; thrusting the blame onto the member of the pair who was blameless.  The Minister, Professor O'Donoghue, is not blameless but he is not very long in the tooth politically either and although I am an academic myself he has lived a bit longer and a bit more intensively in ivory towers than I have.  Though I believe he led his party by the nose in the wrong direction, that party willingly went along with him.  I believe he is a man of decency and integrity even though he is unreal&mdash;his feet simply are not on the ground in most respects.  It would be a scandal if the blame for the situation in which we now find ourselves is allowed to be deposited at his door alone or at the door of the Minister for Finance alone.  He is no more to blame than the rest of them either.  The latter Minister is a member of a Government about whom I have mixed feelings.  There are times when he is good and he is very, very good and there are other times when he is bad and then he is horrid, like the little girl with the curl.</P>
    <P>I was amused, when thumbing through the enormous elephant-load of literature which the Government Information Services are good enough to favour me with every afternoon, at the address which the Minister gave to the insurance brokers of Ireland on 18 October last.  He invited the plain people of Ireland, and in particular the working members of the plain people of Ireland, to take a leaf out of the book of the Germans. He stated:</P>
    <P>No one will deny, however, that we have something to learn from the distinguished visitor who was our guest earlier this week, the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.  In the years since the war Herr Schmidt's countrymen have demonstrated to the whole world what can be achieved by approaching problems in an orderly <Col N="753" /> and sensible manner.  They have done this without sacrificing essential freedoms or without inhibiting in any way the scope of their trade unions to work for the betterment of their members. Their reward is one of the highest standards of living enjoyed by workers anywhere.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;And remember, they had to cope with oil price rises and world-wide recessions like everyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thing I found engaging about that paragraph was the idea that there is some comparability between the atmosphere of public, political, economic and social life in the Federal Republic of Germany and here.  I have been&mdash;not by design but accidently&mdash;in Germany during two general elections to the Bundestag as well as during the European election last May.  The kind of invitations, solicitations and allurements held out to the Irish people by the Minister's party at the election two-and-a-half years ago would have been regarded with contempt by the humblest German tram driver.  I will not say by an unemployed tram driver because there are not too many of them around.  The humblest coal miner or tram driver would have regarded the Fianna Fáil manifesto as an insult.  He knows what the game is about. He knows what are realities.  He knows wealth cannot be produced out of the sky.  He knows he cannot improve his standard of living simply by casting a vote.  We are supposed to imitate the Germans.  It is a good job Chancellor Schmidt was not shown the manifesto and asked for his opinion about it.  It is a good job he was not shown the advertisements about the abolition of ground rents, of rates and of motor taxation. The Germans know what it is to do a day's work, a week's work and a life's <Col N="754" /> work.  They have got leaders in the past 35 years who do not fool them and lead them by the nose.  For the Minister for Finance to invoke the Germans when he is the second in command in a Government who conducted such methods as put them in power two-and-a-half years ago should cause him to be ashamed of himself.</P>
    <P>The story started in the early part of 1977.  It continued when the Government inexorably and unavoidably, because of the necessity of fulfilling their election promises, or appearing to fulfil as many of them as could quickly and easily be done, worked themselves into an impossibly tight corner in regard to revenue.  I shall come back to this point next week when I am closing the debate. Revenue is the central and the single most important point, it is the point at which the lever and the crowbar have to be inserted into the rock-fall which the Fianna Fáil Government have strewn on the road.</P>
    <P>The first thing they did was to leave themselves in a hopeless jam from the point of view of revenue by abolishing sources of revenue, not only those that were large and important and could not be replaced readily, such as rates and to a lesser extent motor taxation, but revenue which may not have been financially significant but which was symbolically very important, such as the capital taxation system which the National Coalition introduced.  By that comprehensive bungling not alone did they leave themselves in a situation which they are now desperately trying to pick themselves out of in regard to getting money to finance the public services but they left themselves with a population alienated, particularly the very section whom the Minister for Finance, dinner-jacketed and sitting at a table covered with flowers and bottles of brandy, is appealing to in regard to wage moderation.</P>
    <P>What are they expected to think when they hear the Minister preaching wage moderation?  Although I know that he himself is a man of frugality and has no respect for people of a different type&mdash;I <Col N="755" /> acknowledge this and I am not sneering at him&mdash;how does he think people will take that kind of appeal when they find the Government have done away with the capital taxation system which even though it may not have brought in very much money visibly made it apparent, as his own tax officials have said publicly, that an attempt was being made to throw the burden evenly on all sections&mdash;and by evenly I mean that it would weigh heavier on those better able to bear a heavy burden.  He expects wage moderation from a man who scarcely knows how he can pay to have his son's shoes repaired, which nowadays can cost £6. Wage moderation is to be afforded in the national interest because Pearse and the dead generations expect it.  Wage moderation is to be shown by a man of that kind while he sees the tax exiles coming home from the West Indies with tans, exulting because Fianna Fáil are back in power.</P>
    <P>That comprehensive bungling has cost this Government and the country dear. They are not at the bottom of the pit yet; they have some distance still to go.  The result was that last year and even more so this year, there is a national understanding which is far more generous than the country can afford, as the Minister said last week.  It is not a settlement any longer, it is an understanding.  I realise there are dimensions in it that go beyond mere wages but the Minister belongs to a party who think a pretty name will cure anything, that it will transform the nature of something which is in essence only a deal like the others.  It has some extra elements in it and I am glad there is such a thing as a comprehensive national settlement but this one is too generous.  I am not going to lecture people who are getting something out of it, particularly those low down in the economic heap, but it is too generous and the Minister knows this.  He knows the reason it is too generous is because of the conduct of his Government in their taxation policy, in phasing out food subsidies and in the awful, cowardly bungling about farming taxation at the <Col N="756" /> beginning of this year.  He was asking for it.  If he had set out to get an extravagant wage agreement he could not have done it more effectively.</P>
    <P>I admit it is not an endearing thing to do, but if ever a party were entitled to say &ldquo;We told you so&rdquo; this party can take that credit.  Since the election campaign we said what would happen if the programme announced by Fianna Fáil and which they pursued to a great extent continued.  I know there has been an Iranian revolution and I know that counts for a lot even though the convulsion in oil prices which it caused was nothing like the convulsion caused in 1973-74.  It is supposed to be an excuse for the Fianna Fáil Government but there was no excuse for us.  I sat in this House and listened to speeches from Fianna Fáil when they were in Opposition assaulting the then Government.  The oil crisis of 1973-74 was never mentioned but now a much less serious crisis, one that did not take the world unawares because the world had suddenly woken up to its vulnerability to unstable oil prices, is supposed to be the scapegoat for everything.  It is true we did not foresee the oil crisis in Iran but in the past two-and-a-half years we warned the Government about where they were going and, unfortunately, what we have seen has amply borne us out.</P>
    <P>I do not want to offend or upset the Minister for Finance or work him into high gear earlier than is necessary&mdash;I am sure we will see him doing his windmill act before the evening is out &mdash;but I must point out that we began the year with a phoney budget.  I am not a financial expert but I followed as well as I could the passages between him and the leader of my party earlier this year.  I still think it was a phoney budget.  It began with an estimate of revenue based on a ridiculously optimistic assessment of the growth rate, far in excess of anything coming from independent bodies.  Even now the Government are saying that the growth rate for this year can be expected to be 4 per cent or thereabouts when everybody else is saying it will be 2 per cent or even 1 per <Col N="757" /> cent.  They ignored all objections to the budget's internal inconsistencies, all objections to the expectation of huge revenue buoyancy at a time which was supposed to be one of diminishing inflation. Inflation was going to go down but revenue buoyancy was going to go up and there was going to be a moderate wage settlement.  Still, huge revenue gains were expected.</P>
    <P>Sufficient account was not taken of the strain that was going to be imposed on the Government by their own wage bill, by the settlements that the Government were going to be engaged in and by what they were going to be forced to hand out notwithstanding what the Minister frequently pointed out, that an increase of 1 per cent in the public service pay bill means an extra bill of £10 million.  Of course the bill is more than that now because the increase is calculated not on a fixed sum but presumably on a given sum in any one year.  The last time the Minister mentioned it, it amounted to a round figure of £10 million.  These awful figures were not taken into account in the Government's planning and we now find that the borrowing requirement for this year will for the first time go over the billion pound mark.</P>
    <P>Three or four years ago there was empty laughter from these benches, about how we were putting ourselves into hock.  They said that we were hocking not only our own future but our children's future and that there would not be the price of a bag of cement left. That was in the depths of the recession when the National Coalition at their worst borrowed less than half what the Minister will have to borrow this year. This is a Government that is supposed to plan.  They have been planning their borrowing requirements not just from year to year but well in advance.  We were told two years ago what the borrowing requirement would be for this year but that has now gone out the window. The Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Dr. Bunsen, gave an explanation in relation to the borrowing requirement on this occasion.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Economic Planning and Development, upwards of two years ago, told us what the public sector borrowing requirement would be in percentage terms expressed as a percentage of GNP, and we were told frequently that although there would have to be an initial spate of borrowing in order to get the Bunsen machine going, that would then be steeply cut back because we could not sustain borrowing at that level.  Where are these resolutions now?  Last week the Minister for Economic Planning and Development said in relation to the need to scale down <Col N="759" /> borrowing progressively, that there is no ideal or necessary level of borrowing for any country and that this was only a fiction. I hope the Minister will not be offended and that the Chair will not get excited if I say that that is the kind of looney talk that gets academics a bad name.  How can the Minister expect to be taken seriously when for two-and-a-half years he has been laying down in advance the level of borrowing which we would have but now tells us that these figures might as well not have been written down.  They were written in water or in sand, there is no such thing as a necessary or ideal borrowing level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing which contributed to the situation we find ourselves in is the trade situation.  I have never whinged about being beaten in the last election.  I put it behind me within an hour.  I would have been upset had I lost my seat but I took the political defeat of the Government philosophically.  I recognised that the National Coalition Government, being merely a lot of over-worked men of flesh and blood, made mistakes.  I recognised that we had made ourselves unpopular for a variety of reasons for some of which we were undoubtedly to blame.  At the same time when I looked at the kind of material which people were being offered, I had to pick out things which were advanced not as absolute predictions but as likely predictions.  We were going to have a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign but it was never quite explained in what respects it would differ from previous &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaigns.  I am not trying to belittle the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign or the people who run it because they are doing their best.  I pay tribute to Deputy R. Burke who seems to be out nearly every night of the week trying to push this thing forward.  I salute him because he is not trying to duck these awful jobs and he does his best with them.  The idea that one can predict, as did the Fianna Fáil Party, that 3 per cent of consumer spending would be switched to home-produced goods is ludicrous.  This was a figure plucked down from the shelf of the Bunsen <Col N="760" /> laboratory and 10,000 jobs were supposed to have been created by this means.  I do not know about the job creation aspect of the imports substitution; all I know is that far from imports being cut, they went out through the ceiling. When people found themselves let off rates and motor car tax and were given tax concessions which the country could not afford and which the Minister would be ashamed to tell Chancellor Schmidt about, they spent the money on motor cars and largely on imported consumer goods.  The trade deficit over the last 18 months has notched up record after record and has now broken the billion pound record just like the borrowing requirement.  When we subtract the other forms of inflow which do not show up in trade figures that means that the general balance of payments is also at a record level.  When asked if this had some bearing on our prospects of maintaining our currency in its present situation in the EMS, I heard the Minister for Finance saying that the balance of payments situation was only one of a number of factors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The current deficit.</P>

      <P>If we find a crock of gold under Deputy Colley's rainbow, that no doubt will be a help and if Dr. Bunsen can find gold in the Liffey that will be another one, but at the moment the balance of payments is the main index which other people use&mdash;financial experts that I am not qualified to criticise. The balance of payments has an immediate and drastic effect on the status of one's currency and no one should know that better than the Minister.  The Minister is almost in the Doctor Bunsen class when he says as he did yesterday that it is not a worrying factor in regard to the status of our currency.  It is a worrying factor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot maintain a balance of payments deficit of this kind and still hope to maintain our currency situation inside the EMS.  It just cannot be done and the Minister knows that.</P>
      <P>That brings me to another matter which was in the forefront of this motion or the pivot on which this motion rests, the credit squeeze.  With all the difficulties I have outlined a credit squeeze could still have been avoided if Government borrowing had been kept within limits.  I have the White and Green Papers of 1978&mdash;we are still waiting for the 1979 Green Paper which has sunk without trace&mdash;and both those papers emphasise the absolute necessity for controlling the growth in public spending.  Where is the control in the growth of public spending?  The national understanding of which the Minister is so proud provides that if the public sector do not produce jobs, the Minister will produce them.  There was a time when people with the Minister's job, in the 1920s under Cumman na nGaedheal and in the 1930s and 1940s under Fianna Fáil, boasted to this House that they had kept the size of the public service within limits and apologised for increases in the public service.  I am referring to non-industrial civil service jobs when I say that the civil service is almost twice the size it was in 1959 which is not that long ago.  That was the year of the first Fianna Fáil attempt to do away with PR, it was the year in which Deputy de Valera was first elected to the park, the year when Deputy Lemass became Taoiseach.  In that year there were only 28,000 non-industrial civil servants. In that year there were only 28,000 civil servants in the non-industrial category; there are now 52,000.  Do not tell me that the output of the civil service, the range, the quantity and the size of the jobs they do have almost doubled in 20 years.  I do not believe it.  Some sections of the civil service such as the Land Commission must have less to do than they had then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I asked another question yesterday <Col N="762" /> I found there is not a single section of the civil service that has a smaller personnel now than it had in 1969, let alone 1959.  If there are departments in the civil service or the public service which are undermanned let us employ people for them because they are undermanned but let us not build offices, put in desks and push people down behind them just to make jobs.  That is demoralising and expensive.  It is a drain on the nation.  Let the Minister not tell Chancellor Schmidt the next time they meet that is how he solved the employment problem.  Do not tell him that you make useless, pointless, demoralising jobs for the sake of appearing to create employment.  Chancellor Schmidt would have something to say about that and the German unions, if the Minister owned up to it, would be at one with us in regarding that as a ridiculous, infantile and unforgivable waste of public money and national resources.</P>
    <P>Let me recall the day Deputy Lynch became Taoiseach in 1977.  In his acceptance speech he harped eloquently on the need for public service and civil service reform.  Political will was needed here, he said.  Where is the sign of it?  All we have is a series of changes, nominal, cosmetic changes in what used to be Parliamentary Secretaries.  They are now much grander&mdash;Ministers of State&mdash;but they are doing the same job and it takes ten of them to do what in our time five did. Where is the reform in the public service? Would the Minister tell us some time in regard to economy in public expenditure what operations are on foot at present to make sure that he is getting what I may call full value out of the 52,000 people he is employing as Minister for the Public Service, that these staggering wage bills which they involve are justified&mdash;40p in every £1 of revenue goes on the public pay bills, not to speak of the 21p in the £ that goes on paying interest on the public debt?  Is he satisfied he is getting full value for that? These are the things he should be looking at.  I know it will cost him votes if ever he has the courage to do it.  It will be unpopular.  He will have a lot of carping and snarling but as the Taoiseach spoke on 5 July 1977 about the necessity for <Col N="763" /> political will to do these things, let him show that political will.</P>
    <P>These are the circumstances in which a credit squeeze has become necessary. So far from cutting back on public services&mdash;I want to make clear that by no means do I recommend cutting back on a certain range of public services, the social services which help the needy sections of the population&mdash;instead of doing some pruning, keeping some eye on where State money is being spent, so far as I can see there is absolutely no visible control at all.  The reckless and remorseless expansion of the Government's demand for money has left the private sector strapped for credit.  That will shortly be reflected in increased unemployment. I admit I used think at one time that Fianna Fáil were almost a different race from the rest of us, that so far from being a party they were a kind of miasma and that you could not be a member of it without being half way to being a devil, certainly somebody not believing in the national interest.  I have become wiser since then and I know that the party is full of people who are hardworking, decent, patriotic and so on and I regret many of the things which I said along that line in my earlier years.  I do not think that now but their greed for power, their sick greed to sit in Mercedes and to swank around the country has left them in a situation where they made election promises which infallibly led to the position in which we now are.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister can sleep at night; I do not want to make personal remarks about him but I think if I were in that situation I really would be desperate about where to find the money to keep this show on the road.  It is not simply the credit squeeze although obviously that hurts.  Even Fianna Fáil's friends in the building industry have complained about it and it takes a lot to make them complain when Fianna Fáil are in office.  He will have to think of something which in effect will bring back rates or motor tax or both, or do something even more drastic.  Either that or he must keep on borrowing to the <Col N="764" /> point where the borrowing can only be repaid by selling off County Donegal or perhaps a couple of other counties also&mdash;some fantastic measure of that kind&mdash;or handing over the public finances into the control of foreigners which is the road we are already on.</P>
    <P>After two-and-a-half years the Minister is in the situation that he is making up his own growth rate.  None of the independent agencies agree with him. Inflation is up.  When we left office the people were supposed to be groaning because of high prices.  So they were.  In the quarter measured by the date nearest to our departure from office, 5 July 1977, the year-on-year inflation&mdash;I am not talking about end of year inflation but about a year's inflation&mdash;the year's inflation was 13.5 per cent.  The Minister knows that when the November figures are available by the end of next month or the beginning of December we shall find inflation is between 15 per cent and 16 per cent.  I do not want to hear any more about the Coalition's high prices.  We had got inflation down to 13.5 per cent; we paid heavily to get it down and it continued to fall thereafter because of our efforts.  Now it is going through the roof again.  The borrowing has reached a point never before reached, a point which former Ministers for Finance would have thought came from science fiction if they had been told of it 20 years ago.  The job targets are not within miles of realisation.  If the targets announced in the manifesto had been met there would be 50,000 fewer people now on the unemployment register, 5,000 off in 1977, 25,000 in 1978 and 20,000 this year. Even without seasonally adjusting the register the Minister will find a difference of barely 25,000; seasonally adjusted, it will probably be 22,000 or 23,000.  And that is the only area where any kind of success can be claimed.  Many of these 23,000 jobs are only apparent jobs, jobs which are not productive and which consume wealth instead of creating it.</P>
    <P>Most of the disappearances from the live register must be attributed, and as the Minister for Social Welfare admitted this afternoon, to increased snooping, to <Col N="765" /> getting the fiddlers off the dole.  I am in favour of that but I would not call it job creation.  The Minister has got himself into a desperate revenue situation.  No matter what he does he will have a black eye.  There is no way out of it and he knows that perfectly well.  And this is the most serious part of the whole thing&mdash;he has left himself with a population which is twice as difficult, twice as exigent and demanding, twice as exasperated, twice as bloody-minded as the population which the Coalition governed for four-and-a-half years.  Their expectations were raised and cast down.  When did we ever preside over a march of 250,000 people protesting about PAYE?  When were demonstrations of that kind ever seen in our time even though the people groaned under the recession, under the necessities which accompanied it and were produced by it?  He has left himself with people who are not willing to be governed even to the extent that they were willing to be governed in our time. That situation which I have tried quite inadequately to outline this evening is the situation which the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development invites us to regard, as he did in an incredible speech ten days ago, as an economic miracle.  That is the economic miracle.  I wonder did he say that to Chancellor Schmidt who lives in the country of the economic miracle. When having a conversation with him, I wonder did he say: &ldquo;By the way, I want to tell you for a few minutes about our economic miracle, about our growth, our employment position, our revenue situation, our trade deficit, our balance of payments deficit and our industrial relations situation&rdquo;.  If that is a miracle I would like us to be let off any further miracles.  We would settle for natural events from now on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;approves the Government's economic policies and notes the <Col N="766" /> progress which they are bringing about&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The performance of the economy in the past two years of our term of office was substantially in line with the course which we had charted, a remarkable achievement not only considering the difficulties, some of which Deputy Kelly was gracious enough to acknowledge as to their existence, but also having regard to the targets we set.  In some quarters those targets were dismissed as being ridiculously ambitious and unrealistic. Gross domestic product in 1977 and 1978 grew by more than 6 per cent and that put us at the top of the growth league in the EEC and among OECD countries.  Not even Japan, for so long the pace-setter, fared better than we did in this regard.  Nowhere is the success of the Government's efforts to transform the economy and release the dynamic which exists in the private sector more clearly illustrated than in the buoyancy of investment.</P>
    <P>In 1977 the volume of investment rose by 6 per cent and 1978 saw an acceleration to 15 per cent with private sector spending growing by an estimated 19 per cent.  Such a commitment of resources was a massive vote of confidence not only in current economic policies but also in the longer term benefits of the Government's approach.  The contrast with the previous three years is noteworthy.  In 1974 and 1975 fixed investment actually declined and, despite a slight advance in 1976, its level was over 9 per cent below the 1973 peak.  By 1978 it was over 10 per cent above that peak. That is a fair test in an area which is, perhaps, not terribly important to the man in the street but is very important in the long term.  If we are to get growth and thereby be able to pay our way and create the jobs we need there has to be massive investment.  That is taking place.</P>
    <P>I suppose the area of greatest success as far as the Government are concerned is that of job creation.  I will say something in more detail about that later but I should like to remind the House that in the last general election campaign we said that jobs should be the first <Col N="767" /> priority.  When we were elected we said that jobs would be the first priority of the Government and that we wanted to be judged by our performance in relation to the creation of jobs.  When one is talking about the performance of the economy one must find it difficult to reconcile the facts as we know them, as we see them all about us, with the description we have had from Deputy Kelly and with the terms of the motion which speaks of the Government's mismanagement that resulted in a credit squeeze and a general loss of confidence in agriculture, industry, construction and other parts of the economy.  How can one reconcile that kind of statement about a lack of confidence with the figures I have just given for investment?  Such a statement does not stand up.  How does one reconcile that with what has been achieved in creating jobs?  More than 50,000 new jobs have been created.  Although it is recognised that the live register is not an accurate measure, if one looks at that register one will see what the position was when the National Coalition were in office.  If one compares it with the situation now one will see something of what has been achieved by the Government. We turned this economy round; we found it on its knees&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true. There was a growth rate of 7 per cent and the Minister knows that.  All the Government had to do was to continue as we had been going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not like to hear the truth but he will hear it. Deputy Kelly, when talking about job creation and trying to reconcile the figures on the live register, said that if our targets had been achieved the live register would have been reduced substantially more than it has been.  The Deputy should know that every school leaver who gets a job does not mean a reduction in the live register.  Will the Deputy recognise that the statement he made is not in accordance with the facts?  The facts about the changes that <Col N="768" /> have taken place are well known to most people.</P>
      <P>All the indicators show what has been happening.  Those indicators, subject to certain qualifications, show the upward trend we set out to achieve.  These are qualifications in particular in relation to inflation.  Despite what I regard as an unsatisfactory position at present in relation to inflation the fact is that the kind of inflation the country had to endure under the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition was absolutely enormous compared with anything that we are faced with now. The average increase in the consumer price index in 1976 was 18 per cent.  In our first year in office we halved the rate of inflation compared with the one Deputy Kelly was boasting about. However, I do not regard the present position as being in any way satisfactory but there are factors involved in this over which we do not have control.  There are also factors over which we have control.</P>
      <P>With regard to the factors over which we do not have control, I should like to state that the oil price increase and the consequences of that increase, direct and indirect, and the consequences of the apprehension about the non-availability of oil, are quite serious and substantial. They are much more widespread than the direct increase in the cost of the price of oil which, incidentally, this year alone will cost us somewhere in the region of £120 million, and probably more.  I know Deputy Kelly was dismissing it as of relative unimportance compared with what happened when his Government were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually it is not true. The fact is&mdash;and this is the point I want to make&mdash;I maintained when the Coalition were in office, and I maintain today, and despite what Deputy Kelly said about speeches from those benches when we were in Opposition, if he casts his mind back he will recall that he heard me on many occasions from those benches saying: of course the consequences of the increase in the price of oil was a direct transfer of resources from this <Col N="769" /> country to the oil producer and of course it affected us.  But&mdash;and this is the important thing&mdash;I have always believed and still believe that the more difficult the situation externally the more we have an obligation within the country to do anything open to us to counteract the effects of the external difficulties that arise. And there are external difficulties because the oil price difficulty has come on top of an already downward trend in world trade, vitally important to a trading country like ours, and a recession in the United States.</P>
      <P>Therefore, let nobody be under any illusions but that the external situation is bad and is more than likely going to get worse.  That is a fact; we have to live with it.  But despite that difficulty and all the difficulties we have had in the past year, self-inflicted in many ways in regard to the consequences of the industrial relations scene we can still, between now and the end of the year, by the exercise of reasonable discipline, achieve this year a growth rate of 4 per cent, very high by international standards. The remedy for the real difficulties that face us lies here, not abroad.</P>
      <P>I have talked about the kind of things that have been happening.  I am a little mystified, I must confess, at the references that have been made to various sectors lacking confidence, to gross mismanagement and so on.  All of the indicators available show that, on the contrary, we have had a record performance in regard to cement sales, industrial production, investment and so on.  The one grave misconception from which Deputy Kelly seems to be suffering is this&mdash;and it emerged when he was talking about the credit squeeze&mdash;that government spending has taken the money away so that the private sector&mdash;I think the words he used were&mdash;is strapped for money.  I want to tell the House, and in particular Deputy Kelly, that he is quite wrong in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that the guidelines issued by the Central Bank relate to non-government spending and it does not mean that the private sector was in any way held back because of government <Col N="770" /> spending, whatever that might have been.  Last year, 1978, there was a guideline of 20 per cent; the increase in credit was 33 per cent.  I am talking about the increase outside of government spending.  Even in the early months of this year&mdash;on the revised guideline brought in allowing ample scope for increase in credit&mdash;again a great deal of the credit for the whole year was used up.  I do not think anybody has to be a financial wizard to recognise the consequences of that if it were allowed to continue. This, of course, occurred this year when a decision in the monetary field, one of the major ones made in the history of this State, the one to join the European Monetary System, was taken. But I want to make it clear that had we never joined the EMS, on the figures I have given, it would have been necessary to tighten credit.  The figures I have given, I suggest, speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is necessary to take steps to ensure that the rate of growth in credit is brought within limits the economy can support.  The Government recognise that this is necessary in the interests of the good management of the economy and in the long-term interests of all our people. I want to make it clear that it is not the Government's intention, nor that of the Central Bank, in applying the credit guidelines, to bring about massive disruption and difficulty for any industry, and indeed that is not happening.</P>
    <P>There are two areas about which I would be concerned, one in the more immediate term and the other in the slightly longer term.  I refer first to the question of bridging finance and, secondly, to that of credit for agriculture.  In those two areas the Government are watching the situation very closely.  Within the overall requirement to get the rate of credit expansion back to a reasonable level those two areas are being watched with a view to ensuring that neither of the industries concerned runs into any major difficulties because that is not the intention. On the contrary the intention is to get expansion of credit back to a level where there is ample room for the kind of growth we want to achieve but where <Col N="771" /> there is not an explosion of credit which the whole of our economy could not support.</P>

      <P>I believe that the Fine Gael Party were ill-advised to bring this motion before the House because I believe that the debate taking place on this motion and this amendment will enable people to contrast Fianna Fáil's handling of the economy in difficult circumstances with the manner in which the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition coped with the other oil crisis of the mid-1970s. Fianna Fáil are happy to see that comparison made.  There are very many differences between the approach of the two Governments concerned, but the vital and enormous difference is in the case of jobs.  Look even at the live register, incomplete as it is, in measuring the performance.  Compare, say, October 1976 with October 1979 and you will get some idea of the difference in approach between the two Governments.  In the two years since our coming to office we have created 50,000 new jobs and we have provided special job incentives and training schemes for youth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told about the borrowing we have done.  Yes, we have done a lot of borrowing because we inherited a situation in which there was enormous borrowing, but here is another big difference between the approach of the two Governments.  The unprecedented borrowing done by the Coalition was accompanied by growing dole queues.  The borrowing we are doing is accompanied by shortening dole queues.  We have something to show for it.  No Deputy has to be a statistician to measure the impact of the achievement that we have in job creation.  Whatever criticisms Deputies may hear around about the Government, any of their neighbours will tell them that it is a lot easier now for young people to <Col N="772" /> get jobs than it was when the Coalition were in charge.  In fact, this Government's performance in the field of employment has been spectacular.  At no time since the establishment of this State has there been such a growth in jobs.</P>
    <P>One of the shocking hypocrisies of Irish public life is the pretence by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties that they are the ones who care about the weaker sections of the community.  The true measure of their concern was the length of dole queues when they were in office. They allowed unemployment to reach up to 116,000.  That is on the live register, inaccurate as it is.  Massive unemployment has been the hallmark of the last few Coalition Governments.</P>

      <P>This perceptive analyst would find it ironic that Deputy FitzGerald should be leading.  Bad as the Coalition's record was, it would have been incomparably worse if some of the harebrained economic ideas advocated by Deputy FitzGerald when he was Minister had been adopted by his colleagues.  It is well known that during the Coalition's term of office Deputy FitzGerald made a few high-powered attempts to run the Department of Finance as well as his own Department.  He is reputed to have put forward truly breathtaking ideas.  In the hopeless circumstances into which Coalition mismanagement brought the country in 1976, Deputy FitzGerald, by all acounts, flabbergasted his Cabinet colleagues with a proposal to impose a 12 per cent levy on all agricultural produce&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and at the same time to impose a wages standstill.  Understandably, his colleagues were not enthusiastic about this and wiser counsels prevailed.  In retrospect one must wonder how serious Deputy FitzGerald was about these proposals.  Could he have felt that the Coalition were doomed anyhow and that the measures he proposed would bring their rule to a quick end and lead to a change of leadership in the Fine Gael Party?  If his colleagues had accepted these proposals Deputy FitzGerald as Minister for Foreign Affairs would not have had to take the blame for them, but that would not have been unusual.  Deputy FitzGerald was well known to us as an early advocate of wealth tax, but when <Col N="775" /> the disastrous impact of that tax became apparent Deputy Richie Ryan was left alone to carry the can.</P>

      <P>We got very little evidence from any statement made to date since the last election as to what they would do, but we have had some indications, including even by implication, from what Deputy Kelly was saying this evening.  It would appear that if they were back they would put rates back on domestic dwellings and car tax on all cars.  They would tax co-operatives and refuse the VAT refund to farmers.  They would reimpose the wealth tax &mdash;although Fine Gael are very coy on that; they try to have it both ways. Sometime maybe they will tell us whether they would reimpose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one definite thing we have.  At the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis Deputy FitzGerald proposed, with a great flourish, index income tax rates. He then said, &ldquo;Of course, you would have to index also indirect taxes&rdquo;.  The consequence of that, which I am sure the House would like to know, is that what was being urged by Deputy FitzGerald was that you would reduce the income tax married allowance from £2,230 to £1,315, you would increase the duty on a pint by 5p, on a glass of spirits by 6p, on cigarettes by 4p and on petrol by 19p a gallon.  There is a case to argue for indexation, for transferring from direct to indirect taxation, but those who advocate it should let the people know what they are advocating.  Fine Gael are advocating those kind of increases.</P>

      <P>I would like to pay one compliment to the Minister and it is for his pure neck in coming in here and in regard to his approach to this situation. He appears to have a measure of confidence about him.  I am surprised that he can, even at this stage, put up such a <Col N="777" /> front as he has presented to the House tonight in regard to the approach of the Government, of which he is one of the senior members.  I will be surprised if all his backbenchers who vote for different motions come in here and show their confidence in what has happened throughout the country during the past 18 months.  The approach of the Government in regard to our economy has been one step forward and two steps backwards.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to what the Minister said in his budget speech last February when he brought in the 2 per cent agriculture levy.  He dealt with the position with regard to services and the measures being taken to recover a proportion of the cost of the animal disease eradication programme.  He said:</P>
      <P>...the Government consider that the farming community is now in a position to pay for the cost of the education, research and advisory services specially provided for agriculture. These are estimated to cost about £30 million in the current year.  The cost will be recovered by means of a levy of 2 per cent on the following agricultural products&mdash;cattle, milk, pigs, sheep, sugar beet and cereals.... These products will account for an estimated 90 per cent of total agricultural output this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was dealing with the final item in relation to the cost of services.  He dealt with the measures taken to recover a particular portion of the cost.  He then dealt with the cost of education, research and advisory services <Col N="778" /> specially provided for agriculture. At that time different pressures were placed on the Minister by different people in regard to this levy.  We were told then that there would be no change, that the 2 per cent levy was there, it was imposed in the budget speech, it was Government policy and it could not be changed.  The Minister repeated this on a number of occasions in different interviews when different people approached him.</P>
      <P>Some weeks afterwards at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis the Minister made amendments to the levy.  The matter was taken to court and an undertaking was given by counsel for the State in regard to moneys that may or may not have to be refunded.  I am referring to this because this is a part of budgetary policy.  I have not the actual quotation but I am certain the Minister will contradict me if I am wrong.  The Minister said at that time that once matters of budgetary policy were promulgated and set out they could not be changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a very grave mistake by the Government.  The levy is only one aspect of the matter.  The Minister continued with income tax and increased the amount of income tax paid by farmers.  Every year we have seen a minimum increase of 10 per cent in rates on agricultural land.  The farmers are now being asked to pay a levy, income tax and rates.  This is a serious situation. If the Minister asks any backbencher in <Col N="779" /> his party he can be told that he has really scared the farmers and he can be told about the feeling among the agricultural community throughout the country.  We also have the situation in regard to the disease eradication scheme.  In addition there are the various other levies in respect of animals.  The whole approach is causing concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Chair, too, has not been helping me out. In addition to all these other difficulties, a farmer who borrows money from the ACC pays interest rates of up to 17½ per cent while long term borrowings attract interest rates of up to 19½ per cent.  Is it any wonder, then, that the farmers are extremely concerned and anxious regarding their future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that any of the Minister's backbenchers will confirm what I am saying.  They must know the difficulties <Col N="780" /> for those in the pig trade, for instance. Farmers involved in any aspect of pig production are incurring losses at every level of the operation.  One of the main reasons for this situation is the rapidly escalating cost of feedstuffs.  Any town that is lucky enough to have a meat factory is in a position to provide valuable employment.  Usually the employees in such concerns are among the better paid groups of workers.</P>
    <P>The Government must do something now about cattle and pig prices in order to maintain a profit level for the producers.  Otherwise, farmers will be placed in a very difficult situation.  There is evidence that cattle numbers are down.  This, too, is a serious situation. Pig numbers may have increased marginally but there is no room for complacency because if the producers are to continue to incur losses, it is obvious that pig numbers will decrease, too.  During the past five or six years some farmers have shown their confidence in agriculture by being prepared to borrow money for various improvements and for increasing stock and so on.  Despite the high interest rates to which they have been subjected they have not been deterred from pushing ahead with improvement schemes but the stage has been reached when they are experiencing much difficulty in meeting those high interest rates.  Farmers endeavouring to buy cattle that they are in a position to feed during the winter months are experiencing difficulty in regard to arranging loans with their banks.  No doubt the losses being incurred generally by farmers have a bearing on this situation. We must blame the Government for these difficulties.  They have mismanaged the economy.  However, if they make a serious effort now to engender confidence once more in the agricultural sector there will be some prospect of a future for the industry.  Other factors, some of which relate to other Departments, have played a part in the present difficult situation.  For instance, in regard to the disease eradication schemes, farmers are experiencing difficulty in having blood tests and so on carried out on their animals.</P>

      <P>A special analysis of death certificates for the years 1974 to 1977 has indicated that the number of deaths of infants under one year for which no obvious cause of death was shown was, 75 in 1974; 65 in 1975; 85 in 1976; 108 in 1977. However, for the reason which I have stated, these figures cannot be accepted as giving an accurate picture of the number of cot deaths.</P>

      <P>Section 11 of the Road Transport Act, 1932 confers on the Minister for Tourism and Transport absolute discretion in relation to the grant or refusal of an application for a road passenger licence but, without prejudice to that discretion, provides that the Minister shall have regard to the following matters:</P>
      <P>(a)  whether the proposed service is required in the public interest having regard to the passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service;</P>
      <P>(b)  whether the proposed service is sufficient in regard to frequency, daily duration and other respects to meet the requirements of the public;</P>

    <P>Each application for a road passenger licence is considered on its merits in the <Col N="669" /> light of the provisions of the Road Transport Act, 1932 and of existing policy in relation to the arrangements for the provision of road passenger transport services.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that, where applicable, applicants for road passenger licences must also satisfy the provisions of the European Communities (Road Passenger Transport) Regulations, 1977, which implement in this country the provisions of EEC Directive 74/562 of 12 November 1974 on admission to the occupation of road passenger transport operator.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that CIE road freight services are protected from competition.  The greater part of road freight haulage in this country is undertaken on an own account basis and, as regards haulage undertaken by the professional haulage industry, operators other than CIE have by far the larger share.  Present policy in regard to road freight transport is for a gradual move towards further liberalisation of road freight transport subject only to qualitative control.</P>
      <P>As regards licensing arrangements in relation to road passenger transport, the position of CIE arises from their status as an existing operator and their duty under section 7 of the Transport Act, 1958 to provide reasonable, efficient and economical transport services with due regard to safety of operation, the encouragement of national economic development and the maintenance of reasonable conditions of employment for its employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that private operators who hold road passenger licences also enjoy protection under the licensing arrangements and under section 25 of the Transport Act, 1958, which provides <Col N="670" /> that CIE shall not, without the consent of the Minister for Tourism and Transport, initiate or alter any passenger road service so as to compete with a licensed road passenger service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>The conclusion at paragraph 4.3 of the 1972 NPC Occasional Paper would appear to involve the identification and quantification of the social costs and benefits of CIE's operations on a route or service basis. This would be a very difficult and costly task and I am doubtful whether such an exercise would yield sufficiently worthwhile practical results to justify the expense involved.</P>
      <P>I should point out that CIE are no longer being paid subvention on a generalised or global basis.  Since I January 1975, subvention has been paid in accordance with the public service obligation provisions of EEC Regulations 1191/69 and 1107/70 in respect of losses remaining on CIE's rail passenger services and road passenger services, including Dublin city bus services, after taking account of fares increases and any possible economy in operation. Losses on rail freight services, in so far as they cannot be met by rates increases, economies and so on, have been covered by a combination of payments under the provisions of EEC Regulations 1192/69 and 1107/70.  The subvention also includes provision in respect of losses incurred on the maintenance of the canals and on the Galway/Aran ferry service. No subvention is provided in respect of the board's other services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will no doubt have seen <Col N="671" /> my recent announcement that I have appointed McKinsey and Company Inc., Management Consultants, to undertake a study of the financial position of CIE.  I expect that, as in 1970-71 when they undertook a similar study of CIE's financial position, McKinseys will make an evaluation of the social costs and benefits involved when assessing the future prospects of the board's loss-making operations.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> As a result of these meetings and the efforts of the Dublin Committee for Settlement of Travelling People, considerable progress has been made in tackling the problem.

      <P>The scale of the present tragedy in Cambodia is so vast that only a major effort by the international community, both at the national level and through co-ordinated international action will have an impact on the situation. As an initial national response, I announced on 9 October a contribution of £50,000 from the disaster relief fund of my Department to the joint UNICEF/ ICRC relief programme for Cambodia. Two days later, I announced that a further £50,000 would be contributed to a joint appeal for Cambodia launched by six voluntary agencies with whom, at my request, I had a detailed discussion on the situation on 10 October.  I also indicated my willingness to support the programmes of emergency assistance being organised by these and other voluntary agencies on an individual basis.  In this regard, I have already agreed to underwrite the cost of chartering a plane to fly food and medicine to Cambodia, which is being organised by the agency GOAL.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the Deputy will be aware that the Government made £250,000 available, through UNHCR, for the relief of Indochinese refugees.</P>
      <P>At the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers in Ashford Castle last weekend, which I chaired, we agreed that further and most urgent action needed to be taken by the Community in response to the situation.  I have now set the procedure in motion to give effect to this decision.</P>

I do not anticipate that the recent exemption from driving test granted here should affect progress by the EEC in these matters and because of the limited and emergency nature of the measures I have taken in this regard, prior consultation with the Commission and the other member countries of the EEC did not arise.  However, the Commission were made aware informally of the Regulations at an early date.</P>
