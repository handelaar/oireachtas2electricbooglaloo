      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 8 (Resumed), 5, 6 and 9, in 9 Votes 48 and 49.</P>
      <P>At the close of business today the Dáil will adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 June 1979.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, does the Taoiseach think it proper that this House should adjourn and not meet next week in view of the very serious economic crisis we are facing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is appropriate to the Order of Business if the Taoiseach, without agreement, gets up and announces that the Dáil will not sit next week when we have an unprecedented situation of economic and social chaos throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair, unfortunately, misunderstands the matter.  There has been no agreement by this party that we would not sit next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is free to oppose it if he wishes.  Next Monday is a Bank Holiday and it is not usual to sit on the day after a Bank Holiday.  We usually sit on the following Wednesday at 2.30 p.m. until 8.30 p.m. and we would not sit on the day of the elections. I thought it quite appropriate to put forward this suggestion and, if the Deputy wishes to oppose it, he can do so now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We do oppose it.  While it may have been the practice that we would not sit on normal sitting days during a Bank Holiday week we can hardly regard the present state of the Irish economy as being normal circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be grateful if you gave me a few minutes to make a point of order arising not just from the occasion of the coming week's lack of business but on the issue of principle which has developed here.  Standing Orders provide in relation to sittings in Order No. 20 (1):</P>
      <P>Unless it shall otherwise resolve, the Dáil shall meet every Tuesday and Wednesday ....</P>
      <P>The rest of the paragraph does not matter. Resolutions are dealt with in Standing Order 87 (1) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1884" /> Any matter for decision by the Dáil shall be brought before it by motion for a simple Resolution or Order, or by the initiation of a Bill.</P>
    <P>Motions are dealt with in Standing Order No. 28 which states:</P>
    <P>All motions to be put on the Order Paper for any day, shall be in writing signed by a member and shall reach the Clerk not later than 11 a.m. on the fourth preceding day.</P>
    <P>There is a motion without notice.  One features in Order No. 22 which states:</P>
    <P>A motion that a sitting be suspended for a period may at any time be made, by permission of the Ceann Comhairle and without notice.</P>
    <P>There is nothing about the interruption <Col N="1885" /> of the Dáil weekly cycle by a motion without notice.  While I am a much shorter time here than a lot of Deputies, my impression is that when the House rises for a recess the form which an adjournment frequently takes is: &ldquo;That this House on its rising shall adjourn until,&rdquo;&mdash;for instance&mdash;&ldquo;17 February&rdquo;. That is a resolution of the Dáil which effectively suspends this Standing Order. A motion of this kind has not been put down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is taking up a lot of time on a matter that is obvious to everyone.</P>

      <P>This is a long-standing practice of the House and it is covered even in the rulings of the Chair, one of which I will quote for the Deputy. It has been used on many occasions when motions are taken without any notice.  We have had the Second Readings of Bills opposed, which cannot be anticipated until the matter comes before the House.  Then it is the right of the Opposition to oppose, if they wish, and in such case it must be decided by a motion.</P>

      <P>May I put this point? When the House rises for a recess, as a general rule, in spite of whatever pretence may go on on either side, all Deputies are glad to get away, so that recess does not encounter any opposition. The Government have absolutely no right to assume that, if they call off business for a week in order to allow them to get their own vote out, they will not encounter opposition.  They should, therefore, follow a Standing Order, put a proper motion down and have it properly debated.  Otherwise they are riding roughshod over Standing Orders.  I believe they have done that this morning.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take the Estimates for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation together and also (as agreed with the Whips) the Eleventh and Twelfth Reports on Developments in the European Community. These reports deal with developments in the Community during the period 1 July 1977 to 30 June 1978.  In the course of my Estimates speech I will deal with significant developments in the Community which are covered by these reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A year ago when I was presenting the Estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs for the first time I set out some <Col N="1889" /> general views on our foreign relations and on the aims and objectives which I believe the Department of Foreign Affairs should seek to pursue.  It is not necessary for me, therefore, to repeat these on this occasion.  I shall instead report on the considerable foreign policy developments since then and indicate the major areas of current interest and importance for us.</P>
    <P>When adverting last year to the main issues of continuing concern to us I stated that the first of these was Northern Ireland.  The reconciliation and coming together of all the people of Ireland is a fundamental principle of Government policy.  This remains a dominant concern for my Department, not only as the major element in our relations with Britain but also as a significant element in our policies within the EEC and in relations with many other countries, in particular the United States.</P>
    <P>During the past year there has been some small progress in Northern Ireland and between the two parts of the island. As a result of our initiatives, there is now more active north-south economic co-operation than there has been for many years.  There is also a better understanding of Irish Government policy on Northern Ireland, both within Ireland and abroad.  However, as against these relatively modest gains must be set the continuing contrast between an ever rising toll of death and destruction and the lack of any progress on the political front.  In the past year more than 80 people have died as a result of political violence in Northern Ireland.  At the end of the period, the political parties seem to be as far apart as they were at the beginning.</P>
    <P>Political discussions in Northern Ireland in recent months have been dominated by the lead-up to the recent British general election.  In fact, the shadow of that election was cast much further back.  Since our Government came to power in July 1977, the British Government had been in an unstable position and the political parties in Northern Ireland have been unwilling to commit themselves to any political innovation because they realised that the <Col N="1890" /> British Government would not necessarily be in a position to deliver on any promises that they made.  This has caused a prolonged period of expensive frustration&mdash;expensive not only in financial terms but also in terms of death, damaged lives and foregone opportunities.</P>
    <P>During this period, British policy towards Northern Ireland appears to have been essentially one of containment. It became obvious at an early stage that Northern politicians were not prepared to go along with the proposal put forward in December 1977 for a local administration based on a committee system but no further initiative was taken by the British Government to seek a way forward out of the deadlock.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the recent British general election resulted in a Government with a majority sufficient for a period of stable and authoritative rule.  It is, of course, as yet too soon to judge how this new authority will be used, and the statement of British Government policy at the opening of the new Westminster Parliament, in common with the election manifestos of the two major British political parties, has shown as yet no sign of new initiatives or new thinking.  However, the British Prime Minister indicated to the Taoiseach on 10 May that she would like time to allow the new British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and indeed Mrs. Thatcher herself also to get a fuller knowledge of the whole Northern Ireland situation.  This was a reasonable suggestion on the part of an incoming government and we look forward to continuing contact between the two Government.  We have taken note of the positive elements in the speech made yesterday in Belfast by Mr. Atkins.  From reports of this speech the British Government seem to have embarked on a full examination of the economic position in Northern Ireland and to be conscious of the sensitivity of the political situation which requires a cautious step-by-step approach.</P>
    <P>The experience of 50 years of Stormont rule and indeed of the subsequent years of direct rule do not suggest that a permanent solution to the North's <Col N="1891" /> problems will be found within the existing structures.  Nonetheless, it is clear that there is widespread support in Northern Ireland as well as here and in Britain for the idea of a restored devolved government in Northern Ireland which both parts of the community there could support.  To attain acceptable devolved structures it is clear that a more dynamic political initiative than we have seen in recent years will be necessary and there can be no hope of any progress simply by putting forward theoretical structures and leaving it to the political parties in Northern Ireland to determine whether what is on offer is acceptable.</P>
    <P>Political initiative by a British government implies the existence of a long-term view of British policy and intentions and a single-minded effort to achieve these intentions.  If the aim is to make progress on an acceptable devolved administration, no doubts must remain about the possibility of such alternatives as increased powers for local government. Unfortunately, if a choice is offered between, for example, an acceptable form of devolved administration and the continuation of the present drift towards the further integration of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom, such a choice will give rise to the emergence of the &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; mentality that has bedevilled Northern Ireland politics over the years.</P>
    <P>It would be less than candid of me to hide my belief that the ambivalence and drift which marked the Northern Ireland policy in recent years has made the task of reconciliation and reconstruction more difficult.  We hope that the new British Parliament will deal in a forthright and even-handed fashion with the political parties and the two communities in Northern Ireland.  We shall continue to argue this point of view in our contacts with the British Government and we certainly hope that they will carefully consider our approach. The question is no longer &ldquo;What concessions can sway a bloc of MPs to vote this way or that in a division?&rdquo;  but rather &ldquo;Where will Northern Ireland stand in 20 years' time and what then <Col N="1892" /> will be the relationship between the two parts of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain?&rdquo;  All the political parties here have availed of the hiatus which ensued in Northern Ireland, after the failure of the convention, to carry through a comprehensive analysis of their policies and the means to achieve them.</P>
    <P>This process will remain a priority for the Government in our commitment to eradicate the causes of violence in Northern Ireland and to lay the foundation for a better future for all in Ireland in the new economic and political realities of today's world.  The Government recognise that continuing economic progress at home and international respect and recognition are key elements in these developments.  It is now incumbent on the major British parties, faced with the failures of their policies of the past ten years and indeed since Partition, to undertake a similarly fundamental re-examination of their policies and hopes for the future of Northern Ireland.  Such a fundamental re-examination would promote rather than compromise progress towards peace and prosperity in Ireland and harmonious relationships between the British and Irish Governments.</P>
    <P>The policy of this Government has been set out in various documents and speeches over the years and there is no need for me to repeat it here in detail.  I should like, however, to make one point clear.  When we speak of a coming together of the Irish people we are openly declaring what we consider to be the best and in our opinion the only stable solution for the troubles of this island. We have disavowed violence as a means of attempting to achieve this objective. The only kind of coming together which interests us is one based on the reconciliation and freedom of choice of all the communities on the island.  Accordingly, in no sense do we suggest that the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland can be compelled or pressurised any more than they can be terrorised into accepting our way of thinking.</P>
    <P>It is part of the tradition of British pragmatism that policy should deal with the short- and-medium term and that long-term aspirations can be left to look <Col N="1893" /> after themselves.  From the point of view of the minority community in Northern Ireland, this is, of course, a less than even-handed approach as the long-term aspirations of one community have been an actuality since 1922 while, for much of the period, the aspiration of the other was regarded as seditious.  While the short- and medium-terms are the areas in which policy can operate, I think these must be aimed at a just and stable long-term solution.  Accordingly, I welcome the recognition given in his first public statement on Northern Ireland by the new Secretary of State, Mr. Humphrey Atkins, to the legitimacy of a number of political aspirations which are sincerely held in Northern Ireland and democratically and peacefully expressed.</P>
    <P>In the coming months, we hope to resume our dialogue with the British Government at all levels and to continue our contacts with political leaders in Northern Ireland.  I hope, within those months, to have the opportunity of meeting the new Secretary of State of Northern Ireland.  In this context, I believe that it is in the interests of both parts of this island, irrespective of our long-term ambitions, that we and the leaders of the Northern Ireland Unionist parties should meet regularly and discuss our differences.  I have no wish to compromise political leaders with their constituencies nor any desire to take improper advantage of them from such contacts.  I believe, however, that peace in Northern Ireland can only result from reconciliation and that full reconciliation will be possible only when the bitterness has been taken out of public exchanges between politicians with different long-term aspirations.  Accordingly, I would suggest that in the coming months and years all our interests would be better served by more openness and more confidence in our relations, through continued personal contacts.</P>
    <P>While the Border which was drawn in Ireland is not based on any visible physical features the political and economic consequences of the divisions it imposed have been a major burden for all.  The economic underdevelopment of the regions contiguous to the Border on both sides have been a consequence of, <Col N="1894" /> among other factors, a lack of common infrastructural and economic development. The cross-Border economic projects to which I will return are aimed at correcting this position.  Another immediate problem has been the crushing burden of the costs of Border security.  I would like to pay a special tribute to our security forces for their ever vigilant and effective Border duty and surveillance.  A Border that runs through homes, villages and communities can never, of course, be sealed off, as if it were a natural river or mountain frontier, much less a Berlin Wall.  This would not appear to be taken into account in some of the criticisms that have been made from time to time by sources in Britain and Northern Ireland about the security consequences of an unnatural division they have promoted.</P>
    <P>However, to the extent that it is humanly possible, our Garda Síochána, supported by our Army, will continue to co-operate as much as possible with the RUC in the fight against violence.  Since such co-operation can only be based on mutual respect it is essential that more determined efforts be made to end abuses of the kind most recently outlined in the Bennett report and subsequent disclosures and to remove from the RUC those responsible for such abuses.  Such mistreatment is not a reason for the indictment of the RUC as a whole nor should it be allowed to obscure the significant improvements that have been made in that force in recent years.  One of the worst aspects of these abuses is the re-enforcement of the alienation of the police force from a significant minority.  This alienation will continue and may even tend to increase until there is confidence that those suspected of terrorist offences are not being illtreated during interrogation.  The problem is that until such abuses are seen to have been eliminated there can be no hope in a divided society of acceptance by that society as a whole of the existing police structures.</P>
    <P>This Government have never acknowledged political status or special category for those convicted of crimes of terrorist violence.  The special category status accorded to some such prisoners <Col N="1895" /> and not to others in the North of Ireland has been one of the factors of the H Block protest which has been given widespread publicity throughout the world.  The Government and the overwhelming majority of the Irish people reject the idea that the ideals which violent men profess can justify murder and assault and robbing and therefore we cannot accept their claim for special treatment as it would be tantamount to justifying their horrific actions.</P>
    <P>Is there then a claim for these prisoners based on humanitarian grounds?  The most obnoxious part of their conditions, the dirt in which they live and their isolation, are self-inflicted. Nonetheless, I believe&mdash;and I have expressed this belief on a number of occasions to the former Secretary of State&mdash;that it may be possible to remove some of the grievances of the prisoners and thereby to improve their conditions without compromising the views that I have expressed.</P>
    <P>It is with reluctance that I turn again to the misunderstandings which appear to persist on the problem of extradition. In his speech &ldquo;No Haven for Terrorists&rdquo; on 29 April 1978 the Taoiseach referred to &ldquo;the barrage of envenomed criticism&rdquo; to which Ireland had been subjected on this issue.  In some quarters, this criticism has continued in the past year although the Taoiseach pointed out that no single application for the use of the extra-territorial provisions of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act had been made to the authorities here since it entered into force on 1 June 1976. Another year has passed without any such application being made.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also referred to the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which under an adapted section 9, has permitted since December 1973 the bringing to trial in this jurisdiction of persons suspected of complicity outside the jurisdiction in the crimes of murder and manslaughter.  Again, a further year has passed without any application to the authorities here to instigate a prosecution.  The claim is made again and again that non-extradition is allowing <Col N="1896" /> criminals to escape responsibility for their crimes.  But, in all the period covered by the legislation to which I have referred, there has been only one extradition application in respect of a person located within this jurisdiction where the application related to a terrorist crime committed in Northern Ireland in the relevant period and in that case the accused person in question returned voluntarily to the North.</P>
    <P>The Government have continued to participate with their partners in the European Community in discussions aimed at improving the arrangements obtaining among the member states on the prosecution of fugitive offenders and other aspects of co-operation in criminal matters.  It is hoped that an announcement will be made shortly on an agreement of the Nine on the application among them of the Council of Europe Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism on the basis of the principle of <i>aut dedere aut judicare</i>, the choice between trial in the area where the suspect was arrested or extradition to the area of original jurisdiction.  The new agreement among the Nine will apply between the member states arrangements analogous to those which we have applied in our relations with Britain for some years past.  It is sometimes suggested in Britain that we have come under pressure in Europe to modify our position.  Not only has there not been any such pressure, or indeed criticism of our position, but it is now envisaged that the principle of <i>aut dedere aut judicare</i> will now be applied generally among member states.</P>
    <P>The Government attach particular importance in the context of their Northern Ireland policy to the promotion and development of cross-Border economic co-operation.  Greater contact at all levels in the economic, commercial and social spheres can only lead to a fuller understanding of our common interests in these areas and of the benefits of genuine co-operation.  At a time when the European Communities are entering a new and dynamic phase&mdash;in which process Ireland will have a particularly important part to play over the next six months&mdash;the opportunities for, and the <Col N="1897" /> benefits from, co-operation were never so great.  The challenges posed by EMS, a directly-elected European Parliament, enlargement and the consequent need to review and reshape Community policies will require a heightened involvement in the affairs of the Community.  For our part we in this part of the island have already shown how a smaller member state fully involved at every level in the decision-making processes of the Communities can work to ensure that Community policies reflect its needs and potential.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately Northern Ireland has not been so well-placed.  Obliged to deal with Brussels at one remove, excluded from pressing her interests except in a United Kingdom context, which must needs reflect a much broader perspective, Northern Ireland has been unable to realise the full potential of Community membership.  The North has also been compromised by the attitude of the British Government to the EEC in recent times.  While we are committed to strengthening and developing the policies of the Community the last British Government sometimes seemed to take the opposite view.  In recent informal discussions in France, Lord Carrington assured my European colleagues and myself that the new administration would adopt a much more positive approach to Europe and indeed that it would be the priority area of his ministerial responsibility.</P>
    <P>I look forward to clear signs of this commitment in action and, so far as it impinges on the North of Ireland, a realistic promotion in common with us of the agricultural, industrial and regional advancement of the area.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland's inability to realise the full potential of Community membership is no reflection on the industry, application and adaptability of the North's working men and women.  It indicates rather that prosperity and security for all our people, South as well as North, can be best secured in the context of political structures which better reflect our common interests, be they in agriculture, industry or regional development. I am convinced on the basis of the information available to me that our <Col N="1898" /> message in this regard&mdash;which not so long ago would have been ridiculed by many in the North&mdash;is, if not yet always accepted, being digested and assessed with considerable interest throughout Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have at the same time been making considerable progress with the various economic studies which are being carried out with EEC assistance along the Border.  In the Derry-Donegal area we are already moving ahead with a vigorous programme of implementation of the recommendations in the communications study for that area which was completed in December 1977.  We are examining at present the potential of the newly-established non-quota section of the Regional Fund as a vehicle for increasing the flow of Community development assistance into this and other Border areas.</P>
    <P>In the Erne catchment there is now under way a study of the development potential of that area with particular reference to tourism and the improvement of land resources through arterial drainage.  The study, which is expected to cost in the region of £80,000, is being half financed by the European Communities from moneys specially set aside at the request of the European Parliament&mdash;and here I would like to pay a particular tribute to Senator Yeats who was instrumental in having the Parliament support this initiative&mdash;with the balance being met by the Irish and British Governments.  This study will be completed at the end of this year and will represent the main demand on the funds allocated under the cross-Border subhead in this year's Estimates.  The balance is available to finance further studies on which agreement may be reached during the current year.</P>
    <P>As envisaged in the reports on Economic Co-operation published by the two Governments in June 1978, joint North-South discussions on the co-ordination of infrastructure development in the Newry-Dundalk area are currently taking place at official level and a report to Ministers on the possibilities for future co-operative action in the area, which I look forward to receiving, should be available in the near future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1899" /> It has been a consistent element of Government policy to seek support for their proposals by diplomatic and political endeavour abroad.  In the United States in particular we have been at pains to explain Government policy to the US administration, to the Irish-American community and to Americans generally.  Our aspiration to a peaceful solution to the problems of a divided Ireland has always been sympathetically viewed in the US, but there has been a need to promote among Americans an understanding of the real nature of the problem, the division within the community in Northern Ireland.  It is our belief that, as the Irish-American community understands the abhorrence of people in Ireland for IRA violence and also understands the concrete and positive steps the Government here are taking, we now can rely on the support of the vast majority of the Irish-American community for our policies.</P>
    <P>The last year was marked by the visit last month, at the invitation of the Taoiseach, of a US Congressional delegation headed by Mr. T. P. (&ldquo;Tip&rdquo;) O'Neill, Junior, Speaker of the House of Representatives.  This visit formed part of a continuing series of contacts between the Government and leading US political figures in order to improve mutual understanding of approaches to the Northern Ireland question.  Speaker O'Neill availed of his visit here to express his views, in particular on the urgent need for the incoming British Government to play a more active role in seeking political compromise in Northern Ireland.  This approach of the Speaker is broadly coincidental with the view of the Government and the Government consider Speaker O'Neill's visit useful in emphasising the need for initiative in the coming months.  Some of the initial reactions to the Speaker's statement failed to appreciate the understanding and goodwill which he brought to the subject, based on personal contact with leaders in both parts of Ireland and in Britain.</P>
    <P>A similar failure appears to lie behind the recent letter which Unionist leaders are reported to have addressed to President <Col N="1900" /> Carter protesting against what they call American intervention in Northern Ireland affairs.  I have no doubt, however, that this clear and unequivocal expression of the views of one of America's leading politicians will be a factor which must be borne in mind by the new British Government.  One must distinguish between the views expressed by people like Speaker O'Neill and other distinguished representatives to whom I referred, who have been very helpful in containing any support in America for violence, and those of a limited number of people who seem at least to have an ambiguous approach.  This distinction does not seem to have been clearly understood by all representatives in the North, some of whom have recently published open letters.</P>
    <P>Some of those who criticised Speaker O'Neill gave the impression that he, and indeed the Irish Government, thought that the Northern Ireland situation was a simple matter which could be solved by the manipulation of pressure from one quarter or another and that ultimately, for a British Government to decide to put pressure on the Northern majority could resolve the problems of the area. This sort of criticism is not only absurd in practical terms, but in no way reflects the political ambitions of the Government here.  We have made clear on numerous occasions that our ambition is to persuade, not to coerce or pressure, the Northern majority into recognition of the advantages we can all derive from a joint approach to our various problems.  There can be no mechanical compulsion of a reluctant Northern majority into new political arrangements of which they do not approve.  But it is our firm belief that in recent years the British administration gave up dealing in an even-handed manner with the two communities in Northern Ireland and we regard it as being of fundamental importance that an even-handed approach be restored.  Such an approach and the security which it will offer for the future of both parts of the community in Northern Ireland will, we are confident, constitute a basis which will facilitate the coming together of the peoples of this island.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a particular tribute <Col N="1901" /> to Speaker O'Neill who, far from pandering to minority elements in the US supporting violence in Northern Ireland, has very courageously and effectively isolated those elements from any level of respect or influence in the political scene in the USA.</P>
    <P>Other very prominent and respected political figures in the USA, such as Senator Kennedy, Senator Moynihan and Governor Carey, have also been active in promoting a responsible and concerned interest in the USA towards peace and reconciliation in Ireland and the Government greatly value their consistent support.</P>
    <P>One of the principal concerns of a Foreign Minister must, by definition, be his country's reputation and image in the world.  Promotional work in this area is undertaken by my Department's information service, operating through our network of diplomatic missions abroad, in co-operation with the various semi-State bodies in their particular spheres of economic promotion.</P>
    <P>The task of obtaining the right kind of international coverage of the Northern question was in the past year made particularly difficult by the stagnating political situation in that part of the country and the exploitation by the IRA of human suffering for propaganda purposes. Nevertheless, in spite of these obstacles, the attention of influential international media has been kept focussed on the central issues of the Northern question, on the political plight of the minority and on the necessity for the British authorities to embark on new thinking.  A growing consensus of international opinion in favour of moves towards an ultimate settlement based on reconciliation within the island of Ireland has been cultivated.</P>
    <P>The methods employed to this end have been flexible.  At times, contacts with the international press, whether abroad or at home, have been necessarily discreet.  At other times, according as I have judged it appropriate, public opportunities have been taken to give press conferences abroad, to address influential audiences of opinion-makers or to contribute personally to major foreign journals, as, for example, my recent article in the <i>New York Times.</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1902" /> I can report that international editorial opinion was generally very positive from our point of view during the past year; in the US and Japan, in Britain, and in other EEC countries too, particularly and importantly, in the Federal Republic of Germany.</P>
    <P>The manner in which we manage our Presidency of the European Communities later this year will also of course have implications for our reputation abroad; and I am making arrangements to ensure maximum impact in the international media.  It is largely with this in mind that the Estimate for Foreign Affairs provides for an increase in funds for information work so that distinguished foreign journalists and commentators may be invited to this country during our tenure of the Community Presidency.</P>
    <P>It should be appreciated that the information services of my Department, in addition to the task of ensuring a more accurate general knowledge about the more favourable image of Ireland abroad, have the specific task of presenting Government policies to the media abroad and, through them, to public opinion in relevant countries.  For example, information and press officers in embassies abroad&mdash;and there are at present seven officials engaged wholetime in such duties&mdash;keep leading political correspondents in major capitals fully informed about our policy on Northern Ireland, European Community questions, the Irish economy and other matters of national importance. Our diplomatic missions operate in close harmony with the overseas offices of semi-State bodies such as IDA, Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus and Córas Tráchtála in presenting a coherent overall message about Ireland to international opinion. Thus our Embassies, in addition to the normal diplomatic task of conveying such policy information to the authorities to which they are accredited, also attempt to create a broader public climate of understanding for our national policy objectives.</P>
    <P>Other areas of expenditure defrayed from the information subhead include the commissioning and purchase of films.  Commissioning of films is a particularly <Col N="1903" /> expensive area and, though I am conscious of the value of this form of activity, the limited resources available do not unfortunately permit me to do as much in this field as I would wish.  In the current year, commissioning will be largely concentrated on the provision of material for inclusion in the weekly news magazine of the European Communities which circulates widely in 62 developing countries.  On the occasion of our assumption of the Presidency of the Council of the European Communities, an entire issue of this film magazine will be devoted to Ireland.</P>
    <P>My Department's regular activities in the field of films include the purchase and maintenance of a large repertoire of quality Irish short films and their distribution to non-theatrical audiences abroad.  It is estimated that as a result of these activities, Ireland is brought to the attention of about half a million people annually in countries where our interests are greatest.  I am confident that this number can be increased several-fold over the coming years through continuing investment in this area.</P>
    <P>In the field of publications, Deputies are, of course, familiar with the bulletin of my Department, <i>Ireland Today.</i>  This publication circulates widely abroad and it has, over the years, been extremely successful in projecting an accurate image of Ireland in the round through attractive specially commissioned articles on a wide variety of topics including especially current cultural, social and economic issues.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware that a new edition of <i>Facts about Ireland</i> has just been published, together with two other booklets, the first in a series on aspects of Ireland designed to meet in an attractive format the many requests for information which my Department receive. Though these booklets are primarily designed for dissemination abroad, copies have been placed on sale at home as well to afford the public at home an opportunity of judging our efforts in this field.  I am happy to say that their initial judgment has been positive.  Work is continuing to extend the range of publications to meet the demands on my <Col N="1904" /> Department and on our embassies abroad for them.</P>
    <P>Before I turn to other aspects of my responsibility I must stress the importance of presenting a favourable image of Ireland to the world in the highly-publicised period of our Presidency.  The achievements of recent years and the growing interest and goodwill towards Ireland can be given further impetus if we show ourselves as a responsible and progressive people.  The prospects are indeed great but the alternative is too tragic to contemplate if in the full glare of publicity we were to choose instead to advertise self-interest and irresponsibility in our country.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid for Cultural Relations goes to support projects for the promotion and development of cultural relations between Ireland and other countries.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate that this is an important aspect of our foreign relations.  The outstanding success of the exhibition of Treasures of Early Irish Art in the United States illustrates the value to the nation of making known abroad what we have to offer in the area of art and culture.  It helps to counteract the cumulative effect of all the bad publicity which events in the North have had on the image of Ireland and Irishmen.</P>
    <P>The amount provided under this grant-in-aid in the past has been very modest.  I have decided, however, to increase it this year to £90,000, the first increase in three years.  This will enable a number of important projects to take place&mdash;for example, a festival of Irish culture in London in February 1980 in which the Northern Ireland authorities are co-operating.  In passing, I should like to mention the liaison now established between an Chomhairle Ealaíon and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, which hold periodic meetings to discuss matters of national interest.</P>
    <P>The larger grant-in-aid will also give us scope to take a more active role in planning cultural activities, especially in countries of importance to us.  Our relations with many countries as far as cultural exchanges are concerned&mdash;even with some of our neighbours in the <Col N="1905" /> European Community&mdash;are still relatively undeveloped.  Several European countries are interested in having formal cultural agreements with Ireland and we wish to be able to respond positively to them.  To make a worth-while impact exhibitions, musical performances and so forth, must be planned in advance and be on a reasonably large scale.  This requires the commitment of some resources but it is money well spent.  The enhancement of the country's image abroad is a worth-while objective for its own sake, but in the long run it can also yield economic returns in the form of tourism, investment and exports.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid is administered on the advice of the Cultural Relations Committee, which comprise 18 members of recognised competence in different aspects of cultural affairs.  The committee give their time entirely voluntarily and I should like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to them for the valuable public service they are rendering. Because of its importance I have arranged for the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy David Andrews, to take special responsibility for the activities of the committee.</P>
    <P>A task of particular importance confronting my Department and myself this year will be the Presidency of the Council of Ministers of the European Communities, which Ireland will hold from 1 July to the end of the year.</P>
    <P>There is a constant development in both the range and complexity of the issues dealt with by the Council of Ministers and its subordinate committees and working groups.  This makes increasingly heavy demands on the Ministers who will chair Council meetings and on the officials who will be involved at the preparatory stages of the decision-making process.  As President of the Council of Foreign Ministers, I shall have a particular responsibility in the field of co-ordination and, in addition, the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers will also be deeply involved in the Presidency in their areas of competence: the success of any Presidency depends greatly on the efficient discharge of the business of these councils.</P>
    <P>I should like, as the Minister responsible <Col N="1906" /> for the co-ordination of the preparations for the Presidency, to pay tribute to the excellent co-operation which I have had from the other Ministers and Departments who will be involved in the Presidency.  The demands will be heavy but I am confident that the best possible preparations have been made.  I will also have wide-ranging responsibilities to discharge on behalf of the Council in the external relations field and in its relations with the directly-elected Parliament.  This will be demanding in terms of time and I may have to ask the indulgence of Deputies in regard to absences which will be necessary in the discharge of these responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Our work programme for the Community during our Presidency is already well advanced and I discussed it with President Jenkins and his colleagues at a session of the Commission on 23 May. It will be finalised after the meeting of the European Council on 21 and 22 June, and I shall then present it to the European Parliament at its inaugural session beginning on 17 July.  I was pleased to note that the Commission welcomed the general lines of our work programme and undertook to give us all possible support and assistance during our term of office.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputies, as I did the Commission, that the Irish Presidency will at all times be conscious of the interests and aspirations of the entire Community and that we are determined to conduct Community business in a well-organised and consistent fashion.  I should like to mention in connection with our preparations for the Presidency that I this morning opened in my Department a two-day Conference of Irish Ambassadors and senior officials who will be in key positions during the Presidency.</P>
    <P>The advent of a directly-elected Parliament will have important implications for the Community generally. Much debate has taken place on this subject during the present campaign. The involvement of the peoples of the Community directly in the European Parliament should, it seems to me forge closer links between the European <Col N="1907" /> Parliament and the national Parliaments, leading to a greater understanding of the respective roles of each.  Some of the members of the directly-elected European Parliament will in fact be members of the national Parliaments and this should lead to more, rather than less, mutual understanding between the European Parliament and national Parliaments.</P>
    <P>Though the directly-elected Parliament will not acquire any extra powers by virtue of being directly elected, it seems certain that this will result in a broadening of its influence and an intensification of the dialogue between the Parliament and the other institutions. We see the directly-elected Parliament principally as a means of strengthening the democratic base of the Community. While we must not overstate what can be achieved, the direct involvement of the people of Europe is a significant achievement in itself and the Parliament must be accorded its due weight as a democratically-elected institution.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that the Council of Ministers must clearly recognise the fact that there is a directly-elected Parliament and be prepared to respond positively in terms of explaining its own position on various issues.  More time will have to be devoted to participation in debates particularly where the Council disagrees with the Parliament.</P>
    <P>The tone of relations between the Council and the Parliament is affected to a significant degree by the Presidency's attitude and activity.  This will be particularly so in the case of the first directly elected Parliament.  I am conscious of the responsibilities which will devolve on me in that regard during the Irish Presidency.  I intend to make every effort to ensure the smooth functioning of the more intensive dialogue between the Council and the Parliament.</P>
    <P>The fact that for the first time in nearly 60 years elected representatives from this part of Ireland and from the North&mdash;though in much smaller numbers&mdash;will be members of the same Parliament will give us new scope for co-operation in the range of very important European issues which will affect our <Col N="1908" /> common well-being in Ireland.  I shall be very anxious to promote the most effective possible liaison and co-operation between parliamentarians from both parts of Ireland and I shall be pleased to meet them whenever possible at the sessions of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Though we have been concerned to improve decision-making in the Community we have also been concerned to maintain the balance of the Treaties to preserve the institutions established under them and to maintain the equality of status of all member states of the Community. Naturally we have made these concerns known to the Committee of Three Wise Men set up by the European Council last December.  It is our hope that the Committee will produce practical proposals which can be implemented quickly.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement, I think, that there has been a loss of momentum in the Community and that enlargement called for an examination of the machinery and procedures of the institutions if the situation is not to be exacerbated in a Community of twelve.  We hope that the views which we have put forward, taken together with those of our Community partners, will lead to perhaps unspectacular but practical progress in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the matter of the enlargement of the Community to include Greece, Portugal and Spain, a development which clearly will have an important effect on our future.  Deputies will know that agreement between the Community and Greece on all the major issues outstanding in the accession negotiations was reached at the beginning of last month.  A Treaty of Accession was drawn up and signed in Athens on 28 May.  The Taoiseach and I represented the Irish Government at the signing on that date.  Allowing for the usual time for ratification of the treaty by the national parliaments, Greece will become the tenth member state of the Community on January 1981.</P>
    <P>I can also record that progress is being made with Portugal and Spain.  Accession negotiations with Portugal were opened on 17 October 1978 and are proceeding according to an agreed <Col N="1909" /> schedule.  As regards Spain, a formal opening session of negotiations was held on 5 February 1979 and substantive negotiations will begin in the autumn. This will of course be of significance for the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>As you know, the Irish Government have all along been fully in support of the accession of Greece, Portugal and Spain.  We believe firmly&mdash;and I think that I can speak for the other parties in this House&mdash;that the Community would be incomplete without the membership of these countries which have contributed so much to Europe and the world.</P>
    <P>Throughout the negotiations with Greece and particularly during the debate in the Community on the Commission's overall view of the implications of enlargement&mdash;the so-called &ldquo;fresco&rdquo;&mdash;Ireland has insisted that the Community must be strengthened both economically and as regards their institutions if enlargement is not to lead to an attenuation of the Community's basic aims.  We have referred to the serious regional disparities within the existing Community and have stressed that enlargement must not be carried out at the expense of the weaker member states.  In the context of the negotiations with Greece, we were satisfied on this score.</P>
    <P>Enlargement of the Community can bring problems but it can also mean a challenge and a stimulus to renewed vigour.  When the idea of a European Monetary System was put forward at the European Council in Bremen last July and finally agreed by the Heads of Government at Brussels in December the Community received a further stimulus and challenge.</P>
    <P>It was against the odds that such a scheme could be successfully elaborated and brought into being so soon after a period of severe economic depression and sluggish or non-existent growth. That EMS has come into being is, I think, evidence as much of a renewed dynamism and political will in the Community as it is of the generally improved economic and social situation in Europe.</P>
    <P>The system is the nucleus of a wider strategy aimed at the achievement of <Col N="1910" /> sustained inflation-free growth, the progressive conquering of unemployment, and the gradual equalisation of living standards throughout the EEC.  The movement towards economic and monetary union should receive a new injection of life from the operation of the system.  It should serve in particular to develop a better climate for international trade and investment, reduced inflation and unemployment.</P>
    <P>The transfer mechanism which exists side by side with the monetary arrangements was designed to ensure that the less prosperous member states could more readily remain within the system. The fact that there has been some delay in the final adoption of the interest subsidies regulation due to procedural reasons&mdash;chiefly the consultation procedure with Parliament&mdash;need not give rise to alarm.  At the Finance Council in March, Ireland sought and received an assurance that the interest subsidies facility will apply retrospectively to loans entered into from 1 January 1979.  The Community assistance will enable Ireland both to develop its economic structure and to reduce the potentially adverse effects of the initial years.  It is important however that these advantages should not cause us to lost sight of the wider benefits to this country.  Participation in the system means that we accept a certain discipline, particularly as regards the fight against inflation, in order to benefit from monetary stability and the prospects it offers of increased growth and higher living standards for all.  This means that we must continue the effective economic management and satisfactory results of the past year.</P>
    <P>Our economic policies are not formulated in isolation from current European and world conditions.  Accordingly, the Government have kept the Commission and our partners fully informed on our programme for economic development. These have been endorsed by the Community as appropriate to our position and potential within the EEC.  I must, however, point out that the achievement of our aims will be realised only if the pattern of wages and inflation in Ireland is reasonably in line with those <Col N="1911" /> throughout the other member states.  I have to regret, therefore, that this reality does not seem to have been accepted fully in Ireland if one is to judge from the inflated wage demands of from 20 to 40 per cent in many sectors in our country. The considerable economic progress we have made in Europe would be undermined completely if the Government were to concede these unreasonable demands. Let me give some examples of the pattern of general wage settlements in some Community countries.  The general wage increase in the Netherlands last year was about 7 per cent and the figure emerging this year is of the same order.  With regard to Belgium wage rates last year increased by about 6 per cent.  In the Federal Republic of Germany predictions are that wages this year will increase by between 5 per cent and 6 per cent.  Recently, a strike in the German steel industry, the first for very many years, was settled at about 5 per cent for 1979.  As regards Denmark, official calculations are that the present general framework agreement running for two years from March 1979 will result in a general increase of 9.4 per cent.  These increases are related to the national economic circumstances in the states which in almost every case do not exceed the norms decided as national objectives.  It seems clear that our increases should also be related to national economic circumstances and programmes in our country and should take account of the circumstances in Europe to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>We hope that during our forthcoming Presidency of the European Communities we will see the EMS completed by the entry of the UK into the system. This would provide an additional fillip to the forces of integration and cohesiveness, taking the Community further in the process of economic and political integration.  Not only will EMS bring monetary stability to the Community, it should also play a significant art in reducing disorder in the international monetary system.  Co-operation in the monetary area is made even more necessary in the context of the economic disadvantages associated with current <Col N="1912" /> energy problems&mdash;to which I shall be turning in a moment.</P>
    <P>EMS is a step towards economic and monetary union and the concomitant of such a union is a policy of comprehensive assistance for the weaker or disadvantaged regions.  We have constantly stressed the importance of a proper regional policy and an adequate regional fund.  The fund, however, continues to be very much underendowed.  We welcome the fact that the present fund shows some increase and the quota for Ireland this year amounts to approximately £38.5 million.  Furthermore it is a matter for satisfaction that the Commission budget proposals for next year show a substantial increase in the money allocated from the fund.  We are also guardedly optimistic that the Commission Guidelines for a Community Regional Policy introduced in conjunction with the new fund and regulations represent the first concrete step in the evolution of a comprehensive Community regional policy.  A further major innovation is the introduction of a 5 per cent non-quota section of the fund intended to support specific action designed to take account of the regional effects of existing and future Community policies, and to finance transfrontier studies and projects.</P>
    <P>All this being said, we must and shall continue to press for a comprehensive regional policy and for Community mechanisms which effectively reduce existing disparities.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that the Common Agricultural Policy is and will remain a cornerstone of the European Community.  Any development which made it less effective in any way would be a step in the wrong direction, the effects of which could have repercussions in other areas.</P>
    <P>No one denies that certain problems exist in the CAP; continuing market imbalances in sectors such as milk are an obvious example.  Likewise the problem of the monetary compensatory amounts has not yet been definitively resolved. Problems such as these can and will be solved within the framework of the CAP.  We for our part have shown our willingness to adopt a reasonable approach <Col N="1913" /> towards price policy in the negotiations for the 1979-80 review, which is still under negotiation.  Attacks are often directed at the CAP from certain quarters on the grounds that it accounts for a very high proportion of the Community budget.  So it does.  But this is because it is the only fully developed Community integration policy.  The cost of the CAP must be put in proportion.  It represents less than 1 per cent of Community gross domestic product.  Furthermore it looms so large in the Community budget for the very reason that other expenditure&mdash;on the redistributive mechanisms like the Regional Fund for example&mdash;is so small.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully committed to resisting any tinkering with the essential principles of the CAP and are convinced that this is in the interests not only of the country but of the process of European economic integration.</P>
    <P>The protracted problem of a revised common fisheries policy is still with us.  I am hopeful that the Commission will take a new initiative in bringing forward fresh proposals which can form the basis of a Community solution satisfactory to all.</P>
    <P>The social Fund has been of considerable benefit to Ireland.  Last year, for example, £28.7 million was approved for Irish schemes, most of which went to retraining grants.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless when one considers the very serious problem of unemployment which confronts us, not only here in Ireland but in the Community as a whole, one cannot consider that action in the social sphere&mdash;and I am not referring here just to the fund&mdash;has been anything near adequate.</P>
    <P>The high level of unemployment continues to pose a grave problem for the Community and a major preoccupation for the Heads of Government who at their meeting in Paris in March laid down guidelines for proposals to alleviate the situation.  We intend during our Presidency to make every effort to push forward the measures to tackle the problems which will be before the Council in concrete shape.  Such measures will of course need to be adopted in a Community framework.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1914" /> One of the major factors in the international situation since 1973 is energy, particularly oil, and if we were in any danger of forgetting this, the shortages resulting from the disturbances in Iran have underlined it for us.  The squeeze on supplies which was predicted for the mid-1980s is in a sense with us already. The safety margin on which we have been operating is very small.  The strategic importance of energy for the world economy and for our own economy has to be stressed.  We are still coping with some of the effects of the last recession, notably unemployment and inflation.  The strength or weakness of a country's energy situation helps to determine the value of its currency.  To secure our energy supplies at as reasonable a price as is possible is a major objective not merely of our energy policy but of our foreign policy as well. At an international level, and particularly through our membership of the EEC and of the International Energy Agency, we give our support to initiatives designed to take the tension out of relations between producers and consumers and to promote a dialogue and co-operation based on material interdependence. The role of the EEC is complementary to that of the agency.  During our presidency one of the major themes of both organisations will be energy conservation and October 1979 will be the international conservation month.  During our Presidency we will also make the formulation of a common energy policy a fundamental priority and I have so indicated to the Commission and to my colleagues in the Council of Ministers.  It is unthinkable that a community which has professed itself to be an economic community should not have the solid foundation of an energy policy on which to build its economic programmes.  The task is a complex one but the issue must be faced by all our partners in a community spirit.  In addition to our participation in the work of international organisations we are also exploring the possibilities of bilateral arrangements which could usefully supplement the existing network of supply.  However, I must warn against any premature euphoria about such deals.  To bring a bilateral deal to a successful conclusion <Col N="1915" /> not as easy as it might appear, as a price is usually sought for the advantages and security that a bilateral agreement might bring.  To conclude on this subject we cannot look exclusively for salvation abroad.  Our efforts abroad must be matched by efforts at home, and it is necessary to fit both into a coherent, overall strategy.  Our security, independence and prosperity as a nation will depend much on our ability to come to grips with the energy problem and to accord it a major priority, as there are few factors which have greater potential to all the best-laid plans and target.</P>
    <P>In the external relations area the multilateral trade negotiations (MTN) held under the auspices of the GATT, are on the point of concluding.  The agreed package was initialled by the Commission on behalf of the Community on 12 April last.  The aim of the MTN is to liberalise international trade and to stabilise it to the extent possible for the decade by reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the participants, thus combating the rise of protectionism.</P>
    <P>Ireland played its part in the formulation of Community policy throughout negotiations and Ministerial colleagues and myself, as well as officials form my own and other Departments articulated our concerns in the Council of Ministers and other meetings.  The reduction in tariff rates resulting from the negotiations will be of benefit to our export trade.  Being a country particularly dependent on export trade, the whole GATT negotiations have been strongly supported by us as in fact liberalising international trade and thereby opening up new opportunities and new avenues of trade for us.  Sometimes this aspect of it has been overlooked.</P>
    <P>During the Irish Presidency the MTN package will go to the Council of Ministers for approval, and formal ratification by the participants will follow in Geneva.</P>
    <P>When I presented last year's Estimates, I described in some detail the role which my Department and their missions abroad play, and the contribution <Col N="1916" /> which they make, through their commercial work, in pursuit of the Government's economic goals.  I also referred to the fact that both the Government and myself rate economic considerations among the most important in determining the role of our representatives abroad.  The determination of the Government, as part of their overall economic strategy, to maximise the return from our embassies abroad is clearly reflected in the White Paper &ldquo;Programme for National Development 1978-81&rdquo; where it is stated (Paragraph 4.17) that &ldquo;the activities undertaken by [CTT] offices in supporting the export efforts of Irish business firms and in helping to identify and exploit new market opportunities are complemented by the work carried out by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In recent years an extended network of embassies has been established.  Increased emphasis is being put on the role of embassies in faciliating the activities of CTT, and particularly in those countries where CTT is not represented, the embassies are an important source of commercial market information and assistance to Irish exports in making contacts in overseas markets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In addition the White Paper refers&mdash; Paragraph 4.57&mdash;to the marked increase in the involvement of Irish service organisations in consultancy work overseas and to the study being carried out by the Department of Economic Planning and Development to identify the measures which could be taken to maximise the return to the country from foreign earnings activities such as engineering, architectural and management consultancy, as well as from increased involvement in overseas projects by the building and construction industry. My Department and their missions, drawing on their considerable experience of the situation obtaining in different parts of the world, are contributing to this study.  Its recommendations, when made, will no doubt form a sound basis for the further realisation of the country's foreign earnings potential and I look forward to utilising to the fullest extent possible the resources of our missions to this end.</P>
    <P>The contribution by embassies to the <Col N="1917" /> country's foreign earnings effort, of course, also involves day-to-day activity in the promotion of Irish goods abroad in close liaison with CTT and exporters alike.  Our embassies represent a significant investment on the part of the Irish people.  They also represent a valuable resource&mdash;a resource which is being tapped in many ways at present, and one which is available to be utilised further as required by the various economic interests of the country and in particular by exporters and by the Industrial Development Authority in their highly successful endeavours to attract new industry to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another area where my Department is active is in the negotiation and administration of Government-to-Government agreements for economic, industrial, scientific and technological co-operation.  I have referred in the past to the part the Government-to-Government co-operation agreements can play in assisting the development of trade.  In the case of many countries, bilateral economic contractual relationships, of the type provided by co-operation agreements, are important in creating the conditions within which meaningful trade with these countries can develop.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of these agreements is the provision they make for the establishment of inter-governmental joint commissions which meet to review the state of and encourage the further development of co-operation.  Recently, the second annual session of the Irish-Polish Joint Commission took place in Warsaw and the third annual session of the Irish-Soviet Joint Commission is to take place in Dublin shortly.  These meetings, although administratively burdensome, provide useful opportunities to highlight and provide support in a Government-to-Government context for individual export sectors, products and businessmen.</P>
    <P>I have in the past expressed disappointment at the low level of our exports to the Soviet Union.  It is only fair then that I should now express my satisfaction with the recent improvement.  According to provisional figures, Irish exports to the USSR for the first three <Col N="1918" /> months of 1979 were £9.6 million.  This, Deputies will agree, compares very favourably with exports of £2 million for the same period last year.  It is, indeed, almost double the figure for the whole of 1978.  This growth can be attributed mainly to agricultural exports to the USSR.  I hope that the improvement turns out to be a permanent one.</P>
    <P>Events in the past year have brought home to us even more clearly than before that we live in a world which is increasingly complex and increasingly interdependent.  Small as we are, we are a part of the international community; and we can be deeply affected by distant events in the international political field. This means that we need to follow international political developments with close attention and be ready to take a distinctive position in relation to them&mdash;at the United Nations or elsewhere.  This position should reflect the outlook and concerns of our people. It should take account, too, of our national interests&mdash;since economic and political issues are clearly inter-related.</P>
    <P>Since we joined the EEC in 1973, we have an additional important reason to try to follow international political issues with close attention.  Our EEC membership meant that we became involved also in European Political Co-operation. This is the name given to the separate, intergovernmental framework of foreign policy co-ordination in which the nine member states of the Community try to work out common positions on international issues.  I explained to the Dáil in some detail last year what this consultation process involves.  As I said then, our involvement in these consultations means a new commitment to try to work towards common positions with our partners on international issues. It is of course not always possible to reach common positions.  But where it is, there can be new opportunities for us, too, since it is obvious that the positions we take will have greater weight and effectiveness if they are held in common with our partners in the Community and if they are expressed to the rest of the world as the co-ordinated position of the Nine.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1919" /> As from 1 July of this year we shall have a particular role, as Presidency, in the operation of this system of political co-operation, in parallel with our Presidency of the Council of Ministers of the European Community.  This means among other things, that we will be responsible over a six-month period for organising and chairing a whole series of meetings in Dublin at official and at Ministerial level.  We must also initiate proposals for common or co-ordinated action by the nine governments in relation to various world events.  This will impose a particular burden on my Department which must handle all of these arrangements because there is no secretariat and the EEC Commission has, in effect, merely the role of an observer at these meetings.  But our Presidency means that we will also have an opportunity to contribute more actively on many issues and it would be my hope to see that we do this.</P>
    <P>A particularly important area of activity for us is the United Nations.  Since we became a member of the organisation in 1955, our delegation has worked in every way open to us in that body to ensure that the aims and ideals of the charter are given expression in practice in the effort to find solutions to world problems.</P>
    <P>We try to work for this aim through our actions at the United Nations General Assembly and in other related bodies such as the UN Conference on Trade and Development&mdash;UNCTAD &mdash;and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation&mdash;UNESCO. In doing so we maintain contacts with a wide variety of countries from every region of the world.  In particular we consult closely with the other member states of the Community and try, as far as possible, to work out common positions with them.  This year Ireland, during our Presidency, unlike our last Presidency which occurred in the first half of the year, will have particular responsibility for organising and steering co-ordination of the Nine during the three months' session of the General Assembly. The Irish representative will frequently have to speak in debates as <Col N="1920" /> spokesman for the Nine; and I will myself be addressing the Assembly on behalf of the Nine during the General Debate at the end of September.</P>
    <P>We are now also members of ECOSOC&mdash;the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations&mdash;to which we were elected for a three-year term at the end of last year.  This body which has 54 members is a very important organ of the United Nations.  It is responsible for the general direction of a series of working commissions which deal with a wide range of economic, social, cultural, educational and health matters within the United Nations framework.  It also has an important role in relation to human rights issues and it helps to maintain liaison between United Nations bodies and specialised agencies and other intergovernmental bodies which are active in these areas.</P>
    <P>Already in the first regular session of ECOSOC which has just concluded the Irish delegation played an active part in work on various social issues, including human rights questions.  We believe that we can play a particularly active role in these areas at future sessions&mdash;particularly during our Presidency of the EEC.  Here too, on a number of questions, we will have to try to co-ordinate positions between member states of the Community and to act as spokesman in putting forward positions of the Nine on certain issues.</P>
    <P>Of the various major issues facing the international community as a whole one of the most vital and long-standing is certainly the competition between East and West and the disastrous arms race to which it has given rise.  Ireland, which is not a member of a military alliance, has always felt that it should do what it can to work towards an end of the arms race, and a lessening of international tension and bloc-to-bloc confrontation.  In this we give expression to the concerns of the Irish people and indeed to those of a great part of mankind.  As a member of the European Community we continue to advocate these views.  In particular, in common with our partners, we strongly support the concept of <i>détente.</i></P>
    <P>There is indeed no real alternative to <i>détente.</i>  In the long term, peace can be <Col N="1921" /> assured only through the creation of an atmosphere of greater trust in international affairs.  The best way to ensure this is through the creation of a strong network of international relationships in the economic, cultural and other fields. This will allow partnership, co-operation and mutual interest increasingly to become the basis for relations between States and peoples.</P>
    <P>As part of this general process we also welcome the improved relations between China and the West.  We do not see that this should introduce a new element of uncertainty into East-West relations since, in the long run, it is in the common interest to involve all countries in a world-wide network of exchange and co-operation. A country of China's size and importance should certainly not stay apart from this process.</P>
    <P>In the effort to build up such relationships we attach particular importance of course to relations within Europe.  Here the <i>détente</i> process has been given expression in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe signed by 35 Heads of Government in Helsinki in 1975.  A meeting to review the way in which the Final Act was being implemented was held in Belgrade in 1977-78.  The next such meeting will take place in Madrid in 1980.  The Nine member states of the European Community have played an important role in the CSCE process; and during our forthcoming Presidency again Ireland will have the task of helping to co-ordinate the position of the Nine within the framework of European Political Co-operation in preparation for the Madrid meeting next year.</P>
    <P>The Belgrade meeting in some ways was something of a disappointment&mdash; but it did perhaps lead to a greater measure of realism about the limits, as well as the possibilities, of the CSCE process.  In our view it is essential that the idea that it is a process and the authority of the Final Act of Helsinki as a basic document should both be maintained. The success of the Madrid meeting will depend largely on the extent to which the participating states fulfil their commitment to the full implementation of all parts of the Final Act.  In particular, <Col N="1922" /> we hope to see fuller implementation by all of the humanitarian provisions. These are now recognised as an essential element of <i>détente</i>, and Ireland attaches particular importance to human contacts and to respect for human rights in all parts of the world.</P>
    <P>However, there are also limitations which must be recognised.  The Madrid meeting will not take place in a political vacuum.  It will be influenced by the general climate of East-West relations at that time just as it, in its turn, will affect the future development of <i>détente.</i> Ireland intends to play an active role in these matters.  I have recently discussed these questions, which are subjects for continuing discussion among the Nine, together with other issues with my Austrian, Yugoslav and Finnish counterparts. I am confident that there is a strong desire among the participating States to see <i>détente</i> develop and that they recognise that the CSCE process is essential to the realisation of this goal.</P>
    <P>Disarmament and arms control have traditionally been a major concern of this country.  At the United Nations and elsewhere we have consistently supported all proposals made in a genuine effort to further this objective.  We are opposed to the arms race because it is wasteful, because it debases human values and, above all else because we are convinced of the dangerous inadequacy of any system of international security which relies principally on a build-up of armaments and on military strategies for its success.  Our aim is general and complete disarmament.  This would mean that armaments and military expenditure would be limited to the level needed for police and internal security purposes. However, it is of no help merely to proclaim this goal while failing to take steps to meet the very real difficulties which must be overcome.  In his speech at the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament almost exactly twelve months ago the Taoiseach outlined our approach.  He said that while our long-term aim should be complete disarmament under effective control, we should welcome any serious disarmament measures even of a more limited kind. He called for a serious and comprehensive <Col N="1923" /> programme of arms control and disarmament measures which would cover the main issues of nuclear weapons, other weapons of mass destruction, and conventional weapons.  He then listed a series of specific steps which could mark a real beginning on the difficult road towards disarmament.</P>
    <P>He gave the highest priority to the conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which would prohibit all nuclear tests and called for a moratorium on testing in the meantime. The Irish delegation at last winter's session of the General Assembly of the United Nations also co-sponsored a resolution calling for a Test Ban Treaty. While some progress has been made we are disappointed that the negotiations on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, after several years of delay, have still not been brought to a successful conclusion and we hope the states involved will expedite their negotiations.</P>
    <P>We particularly stress this in view of the forthcoming Second Five-Year Review Conference of the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty.  We regard this Treaty as the cornerstone of international efforts to control the spread of nuclear weapons.  If this Treaty is to be truly a means of preventing further nuclear proliferation it is essential that, on the one hand, greater control over the transfer of sensitive technology should be achieved and, equally, on the other hand, that a more determined effort should be made by the nuclear powers to fulfil their own obligations under the Treaty.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent conclusion of the SALT 2 negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States and hope it can soon be ratified.  This is not, properly speaking, a disarmament measure since its main purpose is to set upper limits to the further development and deployment of nuclear weapons systems. But it is an achievement which should not be underestimated and without it the nuclear arms race between the superpowers would proceed and intensify in an even more dangerous way.</P>
    <P>We must not lose sight of the fact of course that, dangerous as nuclear <Col N="1924" /> weapons are, it is conventional weapons which have actually taken the heaviest toll of human life.  These weapons are in daily use in the several conflict areas throughout the world.  They cause immense human suffering.  This is due not only to their enormous destructive power but also the diversion of vast sums of money and the waste of technical skills, both of which are in such crying need, particularly in the Third World.  A Conference on Inhumane Weapons is due to take place later this year and it is our sincere hope that, at the very least, restrictions will be placed on the use of those weapons which are excessively injurious or indiscriminate in their effects.  This is a minimal aim and does not even begin to deal with the problem of the growing transfer of conventional weapons which the Taoiseach referred to in his speech at the Special Session.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to work for disarmament. We are only too well aware of the difficulties involved and we have a realistic assessment of the degree to which we can influence other nations in this regard, but we have a clear duty to make our contribution.</P>
    <P>In recent months there have been several major developments in Africa, some of a broadly positive nature and others which give rise to grave concern. Our interest in these developments is a particularly close one; Ireland has traditionally fostered its links with Africa, both directly through the involvement of many Irish people in African countries, through the expansion of our development co-operation programme and through the growth of trade; and indirectly through the strong interest that we have always shown in the process of decolonisation and in the support that we have given, in the United Nations and elsewhere, to the right of African countries to achieve genuine independence and majority rule.</P>
    <P>In view of this very close interest which Ireland, both historically and as a member of the United Nations and also of the EEC, has had in the political and economic development of the African continent, I have given&mdash;and will continue to give&mdash;special priority to the <Col N="1925" /> development of Ireland's relations with African countries.  Ireland's increased involvement in Africa has been reflected in the opening of diplomatic relations with more African states.  In addition to the embassies which already existed in Lagos and Cairo, an embassy in Nairobi was established this year.</P>
    <P>Our efforts to develop closer relations with African countries have also been reflected in an intensification of contacts at Government level.  During the past year Irish Ministers have visited a number of African capitals, and we in turn have received several distinguished African visitors in Dublin, including, in May, the Nigerian Commissioner for External Affairs.  In August-September last year, I visited five African states with which we are keen to develop closer relations.  I may say that I was deeply impressed by the hospitality which I received everywhere and by the genuine and special warmth of feeling that exists towards Ireland&mdash;a measure, perhaps, of the amount that we share in common as a result of our own historical experience. I should also like to say that it is a tribute to the voluntary efforts particularly of our many missionaries who have given so many years of dedicated service in these countries.  I was also impressed by the efforts that are being made in economic development in these countries.</P>
    <P>While the progress that is being made in many African states is indeed impressive, it is regrettable that serious difficulties arise in many others.  Severe economic strains are imposed on those who are least able to bear them by changes in world trade, increasing costs of petroleum and other essential imports, and the shortage of capital; these may be compounded by the more long-term effects of factors such as desertification, and population growth.  Against this background, the effects of political disputes of the type that currently exist in the Western Sahara, in Chad, in Sudan and the Horn of Africa can be particularly devastating.  I do not want to go into these disputes in detail, but in each case we sincerely hope that current mediation efforts, whether being carried out under the auspices of the Organisation <Col N="1926" /> of African Unity or otherwise, will prove successful and that the dangers of escalating conflicts, with all their international repercussions, can be averted.  I would like to pay particular tribute here to the mediation efforts undertaken by Nigeria in relation to the conflicts in Chad.  I had the opportunity to hear about this at first hand recently when the Nigerian Commissioner for External Affairs visited Ireland.  I would also add that we have great sympathy for the people of Uganda who have suffered so much under the Amin regime and that we wish the new Government every success in its efforts to rebuild the country for the benefit of its people.  We feel confident that the way has now been opened for the re-establishment of close relations between Uganda and all its neighbours, and that this will itself in time prove a stabilising factor in East Africa.</P>
    <P>Overhanging the whole of Africa is the shadow of an impending catastrophe in the southern part of the continent.  It is indeed ironic that the region which ought to have the most to offer appears to have set its face towards disaster&mdash;a disaster which threatens to overwhelm not only the minority regimes of southern Africa but their black neighbours as well.  There can be no long-term acceptable solution to the problems of southern Africa that does not address the core problem&mdash;the evil of racism.  White racism is not only a savage assault on the human dignity of the black people of southern Africa itself&mdash;its continuation in institutionalised forms is an insult to the black man throughout Africa, throughout the world, and, indeed, to all who believe in our common humanity.</P>
    <P>The root of the problem lies in South Africa itself.  The system of apartheid is rightly condemned by the entire world community.  It is offensive to this country in a particular way since those who profit from and perpetuate apartheid lay claim to values which are cherished in this country.  They claim to be Christians although the fundamental values of their society and the system which they practise are in direct conflict with Christian values.  They claim to be a <Col N="1927" /> democracy although they exclude the vast majority of their citizens from the political process.</P>
    <P>International Anti-Apartheid Year which had been declared by the UN General Assembly, and ended in March, served as a useful reminder of the growing urgency of the need for change. South Africa, however, appears deaf to international criticism and refuses to recognise either the inevitability of change or the fact that the longer it is delayed by savage repression the more certain it is that when it comes it will be accompanied by violence.  International concern and rejection of racism and apartheid must now be translated into effective pressure.  Ireland will continue to do what it can to contribute to this pressure both at a national level and internationally with our partners in the European Community and at the UN.</P>
    <P>Ireland does not promote trade with South Africa.  The Government have repeatedly made clear their opposition to contacts, in the sporting area for example, which may bolster the practice of apartheid.  The cancellation of the world cup golf, at great loss incidentally, to that region of Ireland and to the tourist industry generally, has been noted by our African partners as evidence of the consistent principle of this country in that area and indeed has been an example to our Community partners in the EEC as well.</P>
    <P>We called for a mandatory arms embargo to be imposed against South Africa by the UN Security Council and when it was imposed in November 1977 we welcomed it.  We believe that the UN Security Council, which has the power to make measures mandatory and therefore effective, should consider further measures such as a ban on new investment in South Africa or an oil embargo and Ireland has supported UN resolutions to that effect.</P>
    <P>We have stepped up our contributions to UN funds which are designed to alleviate the suffering for which racism in South Africa is responsible.  This year contribution to these funds shows an increase of 66 per cent on our contribution for 1978 and this year we will be contributing <Col N="1928" /> to the UN Trust Fund for Publicity against Apartheid.  In January I was glad to give the opening address to the  International Conference organised in Dublin by the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement.</P>
    <P>In Southern Rhodesia the situation is also tragic.  It is very difficult to assess at this point the possibilities for avoiding a further escalation of the conflict with all the loss of life and human suffering that this would entail: what is clear is that there can be no solution acceptable to either the people of Zimbabwe or to the international community which does not involve all major parties and groups and free and fair elections under international supervision.  We supported the Anglo-American proposals to this end, and still hope that a peaceful settlement on similar lines may be achieved.  It is not easy in my view to believe that the recently held internal elections fulfil the conditions laid down for the return to majority rule.  The United Nations Security Council does not believe that they can do so, and we fully support the Security Council's decision.  We believe that the best hope for achieving a genuine solution acceptable to all parties lies in further efforts to bring the parties together and in continued support for the decisions of the UN Security Council. Ireland will continue to abide by UN sanctions and will strongly urge others to do likewise.</P>
    <P>In Namibia, too, earlier hopes that an acceptable solution might be at hand now seem to be receding.  Despite the best endeavours of the UN Secretary General and of the &ldquo;Five&rdquo; western members of the Security Council last year, South Africa is still blocking the implementation of the decisions adopted by the United Nations for transition to majority rule and independence.  Recently there have been disquieting indications that South Africa may be conniving at an &ldquo;internal settlement&rdquo;.  Such a settlement, however, would not achieve international recognition and would simply postpone the day when Namibia finally achieves its independence.  I very much hope, therefore, that South Africa will abandon its objections to the proposals, presented by the UN Secretary General.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1929" /> The Middle East is obviously an area of great importance because of its strategic position and because continuing conflict in the area has at times in the past given rise to great dangers to world peace.  Upheavals in the area have also affected the world economy&mdash;including that of Ireland&mdash;because of their effect on energy supplies and prices.  For a number of reasons, therefore, we must be deeply concerned about developments in that region.</P>
    <P>Within the past few months the conclusion of a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt has brought considerable changes and produced new political alignments within the area.  It is too soon to see what the long-term consequences of these new development will be.  It is not easy at present, however, to be very optimistic about the future.</P>
    <P>Our own position remains that we want to see a comprehensive political settlement which will bring peace and stability at last to this very important region.  The central elements in such a settlement as we would see them were set out clearly in a common statement issued by the Nine member states of the EEC on 29 June 1977.  In particular this statement, to which Ireland fully subscribes, stressed the need for withdrawal from occupied territories, the right of all states in the region to secure and recognised boundaries and the central importance of the recognition of the legitimate rights of Palestinians, including their right to a homeland and their right to participate through their representatives in any settlement affecting their future.</P>
    <P>While the outlook is not very bright at present we note that the parties to the Egyptian-Israeli agreement, and President Carter of the United States who helped to negotiate it, have all recognised the need for a comprehensive peace settlement.  In face of the present divisions and indeed disarray in the area, we are convinced that such a settlement is more necessary than ever; and we very much hope that despite present setbacks a way will be found by all concerned to work seriously towards it.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy David Andrews, recently <Col N="1930" /> visited the Middle East to examine at first hand the functioning of our representation in the area and to make contact with Irish commercial and other interests there, in the context of our wish to improve our own relations with those countries in which we are represented.</P>
    <P>In Iran within the past year the repressive policies of the previous Government led to a popular revolt which has sought to establish greater freedoms for the Iranian people.  Recent instability in the country is, however, also a cause of some concern.  The impact of some of these developments has already been felt in Europe and indeed in Ireland.  Continued instability in the area, including the countries bordering on Iran and on the Gulf, must of necessity be a matter of concern to Europe, given the relations which exist between the two areas in the matter of energy. This area is, in addition, one in which the interests of the Great Powers could easily come into conflict.  Our hope is that the approach of outside parties will be characterised by restraint and caution so that the peoples of the region will be free to manage their own affairs in a way which will bring peace and stability to the area.</P>
    <P>The situation in Lebanon also gives us cause for concern.  Stability in southern Lebanon is essential to stability in the country as a whole, and this in turn is vital to the peace of the Middle East.  Efforts by outside interests to exploit the situation in southern Lebanon and to maintain instability in the area could bring about a highly dangerous situation throughout this region.</P>
    <P>Ireland has tried to play its part in the international efforts to achieve peace in the Lebanon.  In addition to the efforts we have made at the political level in various international fora, we have&mdash;as Deputies will be aware&mdash;contributed a contingent to the UN Interim Force in the Lebanon.  In this way we are maintaining our traditional commitment to United Nations peacekeeping.  We believe our participation in such forces is valued by the international community because of our non-involvement in military alliances and because of the proven record of courage, competence <Col N="1931" /> and impartiality shown by Irish troops in the various UN observation and peace-keeping missions with which they have served.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to dwell on the various UN operations with which Irish troops have served in four continents.  The proud record speaks for itself.  But I would like to focus on our long and continuing involvement in UN peacekeeping in the Middle East.  Irish personnel have been involved in UN observation and peace-keeping missions in the Middle East since 1958 when Irish Army observers first went to the Lebanon. Since then, we have had an unbroken link with the area through our participation in the UN Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) in Palestine in which Irish officers have held high positions. We have played our part, too, in Cyprus, maintaining a full contingent there from the inception of the UN Force there in 1964 until 1973.  The Commander of the UN Force in Cyprus is currently an Irish Army officer&mdash;General Quinn.  We have also participated in the UN Emergency Force in Sinai.</P>
    <P>It was therefore in full accordance with our views on the value of UN peacekeeping and with our desire to give continuing practical expression to those views, that the Government agreed in May 1978 to provide a contingent of troops for service with the UN Interim Force in the Lebanon (UNIFIL).  Since the 43rd Battalion was dispatched to the Lebanon in May 1978, to serve an initial six-month tour of duty, two further battalions, the 44th and 45th, have gone out in succession as replacements.  In addition to the Infantry battalion of 650 men stationed there, Ireland contributes a company of some 100 men for service at the UNIFIL Headquarters in Naqoura. These men have maintained, and are continuing to maintain, the high reputation of Ireland in UN peace-keeping operations.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Force has experienced severe problems in attempts to implement its mandate from the UN Security Council.  In summary, this mandate was to confirm the <Col N="1932" /> withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanese territory occupied during the Israeli invasion of March 1978; to restore international peace and security; and to assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of their effective authority in the area.  As the House is aware, the Irish contingent along with other contingents of the Force have faced continued harassment and, regrettably, casualties, from the so-called <i>de facto</i> forces to whom Israel handed over a strip of territory on the Lebanese side of the border after its final withdrawal in June 1978.  I view this harassment with the utmost concern. The House will be aware of the representations made to Israel in this regard through diplomatic channels and by the Taoiseach and myself.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this is a lengthy statement but I do not know if there is a precedent for this because there is only one Opposition Deputy in the House at the moment.  I should have thought that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan had to leave the House for a moment and he will be back very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but when neither Opposition spokesman is here I do not know if it is a reflection on my address or an indication of their interest in the matter being debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no discourtesy intended.  Deputy Ryan had to leave the House for a few moments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  It was strange that both Opposition Deputies left at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not dwell on the substantial issues and problems involving the Force. I would like, however, to stress the valuable successes of UNIFIL to date.  It has helped to defuse tensions, and to build up goodwill among local people because of the practical help it has given and because it is seen to be impartial.  It has also helped to avert possible large-scale loss of life and to restore some degree of normality to parts, at least, of southern Lebanon, despite efforts from certain quarters to disrupt such a <Col N="1933" /> process.  There can be no doubt but that withdrawal of the Force at the present time would lead to major adverse consequences for peace in the immediate area and, I believe, for the prospects for peace in the Middle East as a whole.</P>
    <P>The House may also be aware that, in addition to the practical problems faced by the Force, a disturbing situation has come to light concerning the financial state of affairs of UNIFIL.  Because of non-payment by certain countries of their financial contributions to UNIFIL, which have been decided upon in accordance with the UN Charter, troop-contributing countries, including Ireland, are being refunded less than is due to them in respect of the extra costs incurred in supplying contingents to UNIFIL. I am concerned about this and I am keeping the situation under close review and seeking ways and means of improving the financial situation of the Force.</P>
    <P>Despite the problems faced by UNIFIL, both on the ground and financially, I can confirm that the Government at present intend to maintain our participation in UNIFIL.  I should stress, however, that the Force was intended to be of an interim nature and that we are concerned to see steady progress towards full implementation of the mandate.</P>
    <P>Another area in which tension and hostilities have recently given rise to serious concern is South East Asia.  It is in our view ominous that there appears to be a tendency among countries in the area to regard resort to force as acceptable in the conduct of relations between states.  The dangers of such a course in an area where great powers are involved either directly or through treaty commitments are all too apparent.</P>
    <P>It will be our hope during the Irish Presidency to advance the relations which already exist between the EEC and countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). We believe that the relations already established or in course of development in the economic and other fields can be of significant benefit to both sides.</P>
    <P>On 6 April I indicated that the Government had decided to enter into negotiations with the Chinese authorities <Col N="1934" /> on the establishment of diplomatic relations on a residential basis.  My colleague, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy subsequently led a very successful trade mission to China and he hopes soon to welcome the Chinese Minister for Foreign Trade to Ireland.  The prospects of developing our economic relations with China are good. I can assure the House that our economic relations with China will be a high priority for us; and I believe that the establishment of diplomatic relations can be of help to Irish firms and semi-State bodies in availing of the opportunities for exports which the major development plans of the Chinese Government can offer.</P>
    <P>From a political viewpoint, too, we will be glad to extend our present representation abroad to a large and important country which is a permanent member of the Security Council and which has expressed a wish to develop closer economic relations with the European Community.</P>
    <P>Among the matters which are of major importance to this country are the negotiations which are taking place at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.  In this regard I would refer Deputies to the very lengthy reply which I gave to a parliamentary question on 22 November 1978 and which set out the state of the negotiations at the end of the Seventh Session of the Conference with particular emphasis on those issues which are of most importance to this country.</P>
    <P>Since that date the Eighth Session of the Conference met in Geneva for six weeks ending on 27 April last and the conference then agreed to resume meetings for a further five-and-a-half weeks in New York commencing on 19 July 1979.</P>
    <P>The Eighth Session continued to concentrate on what has been identified as the hard-core issues.  Its objective was the conclusion of informal negotiations and revision of the informal composite negotiating text.  Revision of this text is the collective responsibility of the president and the chairmen of the main committees and this collegium met at the end of the debate in Geneva and decided to <Col N="1935" /> revise the negotiating text incorporating those texts proposed by the chairmen which in their view offer a substantially improved prospect for consensus. Agreement has been virtually reached at the conference on a number of issues although further negotiation of them on foot of the revised text is not precluded and will probably continue until agreement on a comprehensive text covering all issues can be placed before the conference.</P>
    <P>The most difficult and probably the most complex issue remains the regime for the international seabed area, that is the deep seabed outside national jurisdiction.  While considerable progress has been made, negotiations on this issue are proving particularly difficult due mainly to the unavailability of sufficient data to assess properly the prospects for seabed exploitation.  The industrialised countries, which are already in a position to exploit this area, and the developing countries take opposing views.  Some progress was made at the recent session but many complex issues remain to be resolved.</P>
    <P>Among those issues which are of direct concern to this country is the status of the exclusive economic zone and access for landlocked and geographically disadvantages states to that zone.  A text which would give access for those states to the surplus of the living resources has been negotiated and is included in the revised text.  A further element of this compromise relates to dispute settlement procedures and also forms part of the revised text.</P>
    <P>The Irish delegation put forward informally at the fourth session of the conference proposals with regard to the definition of the outer edge of the continental margin with the objective of clearly defining the extent of coastal state jurisdiction over its Continental Shelf.  This text gained a considerable amount of support at the conference but was opposed by a number of countries who support a 200-mile limit to coastal state jurisdiction over its Continental Shelf and by others who, while accepting coastal state jurisdiction beyond 200 miles expressed concern that the <Col N="1936" /> proposal put forward by the Irish delegation could lead to uncertainty, to creeping jurisdiction and to unjustifiable claims by some coastal states.  Intensive negotiations took place between the delegations mainly concerned with a view to resolving this issue and the chairman submitted a compromise text which included the Irish proposal with an overriding cut-off limit and an increase in the revenue sharing figure.  The final debate on this issue showed considerable support for this compromise proposal and it is included in the revised text for further negotiation at forthcoming meetings.</P>
    <P>A further issue which is of importance relates to the provisions regarding the rules to be applied in delimitation of marine areas between adjacent or opposite states.  This has proved to be probably the most difficult issue at the conference since the vital interests of many states could be affected thereby and while many compromise proposals were put forward both by the chairman and various delegations no agreement on a provision has been reached and this matter will be negotiated further.  Provisions regarding the regime of islands, which is a related issue, were not debated and remain to be dealt with at forthcoming meetings.</P>
    <P>It was the view of the chairman that substantive negotiations on the provisions relating to the protection and preservation of the marine environment could be considered completed and he affirmed that the informal composite negotiating text formed a good basis for consensus.  This is also true of the negotiations on the development and transfer of marine technology but it appears that a further attempt at consensus in relation to a generally acceptable text on marine scientific research will have to be made at future meetings.</P>
    <P>In general therefore it is possible to say that slow but steady progress is being made in the course of these negotiations and I hope that a generally acceptable and comprehensive convention on the law of the sea will be adopted by the conference.</P>
    <P>With regard to the international economic scene, as I indicated last year, <Col N="1937" /> a special session of the UN General Assembly will be held in 1980 to assess progress towards the establishment of a new world economic order and to adopt an international development strategy for the 1980's and beyond.  In the context of negotiations on the strategy Ireland acts, of course, as a member of the European Community and contributes to what we believe is a positive and realistic approach on the part of the Community.  The interdependence of the world economy we see as the foundation for any new strategy.  We realise that this interdependence implies recognition by the better-off, developed countries of the need to accept significant changes in the structure of the world economy, if a more just and equitable social and economic order is to come about.  The developing countries, on the other hand, must accept that change will have to be made carefully.  The system, however unfair, cannot be dismantled all at once without grave damage to all.  However, we do accept that the onus is on the developed part of the world to make a genuine and urgent commitment to reform and in Ireland we see the task of bringing about this commitment as an important international obligation.</P>
    <P>The preparatory committee for the new development strategy will report through the Economic and Social Council to the General Assembly next autumn.  I have already mentioned that Ireland is a member of the Economic and Social Council.  We will therefore be in a position to play a significant part in an exercise which will have an important bearing on global economic relations for the next ten years at least.</P>
    <P>Turning for a moment to more recent events, a breakthrough was achieved in March last when agreement was reached on the basic structure of a Common Fund designed to stabilise trade in commodities of particular interest to developing countries.  It is intended that the fund, through those operations which are normally referred to as its first window, should primarily contribute to the financing of international buffer stocks in the various commodities.  A second window of the fund is planned to help finance measures other than buffer <Col N="1938" /> stocking.  This would help with productivity and marketing and would also aim to encourage diversification of production.</P>
    <P>Ireland's basic contribution to the fund will be one million dollars, a portion of which will be directed to the second window.  In addition, in recognition of the importance of these activities, especially for many African countries, the Government have decided to make a voluntary contribution also to the second window and this intention was announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, at the fifth session of the UN Conference on Trade and Development, which is currently meeting in Manila.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputies will share my hope that UNCTAD V will be a major step forward in relations between the developing and the developed countries and a turning point in the search for effective means to bring about a more just and equitable social and economic order on a global scale.</P>
    <P>The Community's own special contribution to the wider dialogue between the developed and developing countries is the ACP-EEC Convention of Lomé. This convention incorporates a number of important elements into Community-Third World relations, such as for instance financial and technical co-operation, Stabex&mdash;a scheme for the stabilisation of the ACP countries' export earnings&mdash;industrial co-operation and free access for almost all ACP exports to the Community market.  Now, in the light of experience gained over the last four years we are in the process of negotiating a new convention with our ACP partners to replace the current convention which is due to expire on 1 March 1980.</P>
    <P>The negotiations which began in September of last year were expected to be completed at the joint ACP-EEC ministerial negotiating conference held in Brussels on 24 and 25 May.  At that conference major areas of the new convention were discussed in five joint working groups co-chaired by ACP and Community Ministers.  I was spokesman on the Community side in the negotiating group charged with concluding the <Col N="1939" /> chapter on institutions.  After two days of worth-while negotiations, however, the meeting concluded with the Community's offer on the volume of aid to be provided under the new convention, approximately five billion European Currency Units falling far short of the negotiating demand of 10 billion European Currency Units from the ACP side.  We will try to take up the remaining issues at another ministerial negotiating meeting on 24-26 June at which it is hoped we will finalise the outstanding problems.  I expect again to head the institutions group at that meeting.  If, however, we fail in our objective, it will fall to the Irish Presidency to conclude the remaining areas under difficult conditions.</P>
    <P>This leads me logically on to another crucial area of our relationship with the developing world: the Government's Bilateral Aid Programme, which is administered by my Department.  This programme, for which £4 million is available in 1979, is largely concentrated in our four priority countries in Africa&mdash;Lesotho, Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia.  These countries are among the poorest in the world, with three of them&mdash;Lesotho, Sudan and Tanzania&mdash;being classified by the UN as least developed.  Lesotho in particular, given that it is completely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa, faces especially difficult problems in developing its economic independence.</P>
    <P>Within the overall strategy of the programme I have decided that the priority this year will be to introduce a better balance into the division of our assistance between the various priority countries.  In particular, we must begin to bring the programme in Tanzania and Zambia up to the level of that in Lesotho.  A major step in this direction, which followed from my own visit to the priority countries last August and September, was made with the visit of programming teams, chaired by my Department, to both countries late last year.  This visit has since been followed up actively by the sending of specialist groups of experts to each country to draw up, where a proposal proves feasible, <Col N="1940" /> project implementation documents. This month, for instance, teams from the Department of Agriculture were in both Tanzania and Zambia examining, with our partners, the possibility of, in Tanzania, setting up a centre for training in agriculture and, in Zambia, the development of three dairy farms.</P>
    <P>In addition in Tanzania, we have been urged for some time by our hosts to relate our growing programme there directly to the Tanzania integrated rural development strategy, under which partner countries or groups of countries take on responsibility for a single region or district.  As this strategy is central to the Tanzania Development Plan, I have agreed that we should examine together the feasibility of our participation in it as soon as possible.  We are at the moment, therefore, putting together a team which it is intended will travel to Tanzania late next month for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I have also been giving very active consideration to the need for an official presence on the ground in the priority countries in order to ensure the most effective possible management of our activities, including of course the fullest consultation and liaison with our partner countries.  We have in the recent past opened an embassy in Kenya, which I envisage having a general co-ordinating role for our aid programme in the area, and a development co-operation office in Lesotho.  Given the priority which we are now attaching to our aid programme in Africa and conscious of the impact and effectiveness of the Lesotho office since it opened, I am considering the establishment of further development co-operation offices.</P>
    <P>Another area of the programme to which I attach special importance, and which indeed adds greatly to its effectiveness and distinctiveness, is our cofinancing partnership with voluntary agencies.  This now stands at £1 million or 25 per cent of the total programme, and includes this year, for the first time ever, support for the administrative costs involved in projects.  Likewise, a substantial part of our development education activities here at home is implemented through the voluntary agencies. I have always believed that <Col N="1941" /> development education should be a crucial and integral part of our overall development programme.  It was for this reason that last year, for the first time ever, I introduced an element for this purpose into the programme.  The amount allocated, £35,000, was fully taken up, and in general the fund was not alone widely welcomed but also stimulated considerable interest and activity. This year it has been more than doubled, to £85,000, and will again support a wide range of initiatives and projects.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a warm tribute to the many different sectors of the economy through whom we are implementing the bilateral aid programme. And it is crucial, as I have constantly stressed, that we have this broad national support and involvement, for if the programme is to have maximum effect it must obviously, as far as possible, reflect the resources and the strengths that have made up our development.  Thus, as well as drawing on the State, semi-State, private, voluntary agency and higher education sectors, we are involving this year for the first time the local government and vocational education sectors in the programme.</P>
    <P>Within our overall bilateral effort an important role is of course played by my Department's Agency for Personal Service Overseas (APSO).  In its work APSO co-operates particularly closely with the voluntary agencies.  I believe and hope that this co-operation will lead to an early strengthening of the crucial volunteer element in our efforts, which has always been a distinguishing aspect of our peoples' service overseas.  I would like to take this opportunity also to pay tribute to the Chairman and Council of APSO for their work on our behalf.</P>
    <P>I would like also to emphasise how important the contribution of the State-sponsored sector, either through individual agencies or via its co-ordinating body, DEVCO, has been to the programme.  And, in a broader context, many DEVCO agencies have been active in showing that there can be considerable commercial advantages and opportunities for Irish concerns in <Col N="1942" /> development co-operation.  That such opportunities exist and can have a positive impact on our balance of payments position, as well as on the employment situation here at home, is fully recognised by the Government.  We have, for instance, as stated in the White Paper on the National Programme for Development 1978-81, decided to carry out an investigation of the foreign earnings and employment potential resulting from the export of services and the carrying out of project work abroad with a view to identifying what action should be taken in order to maximise the return to the country from these activities.  This investigation is now well under way.</P>
    <P>Finally, Deputies will be pleased to know that the Government recently accepted my recommendation that an advisory council to help co-ordinate our overseas development co-operation activities should be established.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the establishment of the advisory council will ensure the maximum participation and involvement of the community at large in our development co-operation activities abroad and will moreover make available to us the range of expert advice available nationally, and this is considerable. Likewise, the council will have a major role in helping to co-ordinate the activities of the many bodies involved in development, thus ensuring maximum understanding and co-operation in this important area of national policy.</P>
    <P>I realise that I have spoken at length but this is unavoidable, and is indicative of the many and complex issues with which I am involved and which assume a particular significance during Ireland's Presidency of the European Communities in the second half of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister acknowledged in his concluding remarks that his speech was lengthy.  I understand that the Minister made some very naughty criticism when for compelling reasons I left the House for a few minutes, having first of all ensured that my Front Bench colleague, Deputy Mitchell, would be here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I could see, there was nobody in the Opposition <Col N="1943" /> benches.  I did not see Deputy Mitchell. Both spokesmen left simultaneously and I thought there was nobody in the Opposition benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell was here.  No matter what personal discomfort might be suffered, I have always accepted the obligation to ensure that there is somebody on the Front Bench of the Opposition.  I am surprised the Minister did not see Deputy Mitchell.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well during the forthcoming Presidency of the EEC.  I am encouraged by some of the remarks he made today regarding the status of Parliament and relations between the Council of Ministers and Parliament.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise what I believe to be the cornerstone of our foreign policy, that is, neutrality.  Ireland has an obligation to itself, to Europe and the world to be neutral at all times and never to become involved militarily in any communal defence arrangements which may be made by any other country or countries, be they within the EEC or anywhere else.  I am somewhat uneasy about a statement by the Minister on 23 November last in reply to a supplementary question regarding Ireland's position of neutrality.  He said that in the event of the situation arising&mdash;which one would hope would never arise&mdash;in which the Community of which we were a member were under attack, then obviously we would have to face our obligations.  That can only be taken as an indication of some wavering on the part of the Minister and the Government on Ireland's dedication to an entirely defensible policy of neutrality.  Ireland should be neutral because it is right and we should declare to the world that we will not become involved in other people's wars.  We are a poor country, the least populated country in Europe.  We would be making a more than adequate contribution to our own defence and that of Europe by using conventional weapons. We are not and never will be in a position to defend ourselves against nuclear attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have colleagues in the US and in Europe who are technically and financially <Col N="1944" /> in a position to defend themselves&mdash;and in so doing to defend us also as best they can&mdash;against nuclear attack or attack by some other dreadful weapon.  It would be idle for us to become involved in the war of continents on a world scale or in any matters relating thereto.  We are not in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>When I first had the honour to represent Ireland in the European Parliament, when we joined the EEC in January 1973, I drew attention to Ireland's neutral status and the fact that the EEC had for the first time a member state which was not a member of NATO or of any other military pact.  I said we expected that our colleagues in Europe would respect our position and that it was necessary to do so in order to convince that part of Europe outside the EEC and the non-European world that the EEC was not a military bloc but an economic organisation with the objective of bringing the people of the EEC so close together economically that they would not again start a civil war within Europe which would be a menace to Europe and the outside world.  I emphasised that it was necessary that Ireland's neutral position should be respected so that the rest of the world would be convinced that Europe had no hostile intent towards them.  I am glad to say that the Minister acknowledged last November that no attempt was being made at any level in the EEC to compromise Ireland's neutral position or to request Ireland to abandon this neutral stance.</P>
    <P>If the Europe we want to see is ever to be a reality, that is, a united Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals, it must include countries like Switzerland, Austria, Sweden and ourselves who have a commitment to neutrality, and if there is any attempt or any readiness on the part of an Irish Government to compromise our neutral position, we will be weakening the status of Europe in relation to the outside world in stimulating fears that others might have that Europe might launch a war against them.</P>
    <P>Very properly the Minister condemned the East-West conflict, the continuing <Col N="1945" /> arms race which is being accelerated at a time when the world's resources are shrinking, when there is immense poverty and human misery because of want of resources.  If we believe that this armaments race must be condemned, then we must without apology or qualification, even if it causes political embarrassment, assert our absolute intention to remain neutral, because it is not right to get involved in the wars of others.</P>
    <P>I have said that to my knowledge, both as a member of a Government and of the European Parliament, there has never been any attempt to compromise Ireland's position.  I can go a little further.  The European Parliament quite recently in a report dealing with the employment aspect of the European arms industry, an industry concerned with the defence of Europe and not introducing arms to make war on others&mdash;the report was prepared by the Christian Democratic Group&mdash;made specific reference to the fact that Ireland's position as a neutral country would have to be respected.  It is good that the European Parliament adopted that report, and I hope it will reassure people here and abroad that our commitment is towards the maintenance of neutrality.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why we should remain neutral.  It makes Ireland acceptable as a country to contribute to UN peacekeeping activities.  This has helped to provide political stability and peace in some regions of great tension. As the Minister properly pointed out, this has brought great credit to Ireland, because the people involved in such regions have accepted the neutrality of the Irish troops and their anxiety not to get involved in the disputes of others. Even in our own society, but throughout the rest of the world, if people minded their own business there would be less conflict among humanity, and minding our own business is a very sensible thing for this country.  Therefore I hope nobody, no matter what may happen in the political development of Europe, will at any stage try to compromise our neutral position.  We will be making a more than adequate contribution to the defence of Europe if we defend this little <Col N="1946" /> island against conventional attacks. That is more than sufficient for us to do. Already we have the burden of the largest army in peacetime because of security, or the insecurity that exists on this island through British mishandling of the Northern Ireland situation.  That is a cross we have to carry.  It is in our own interests to maintain peace and security here, and that is something Europe should take cognisance of.</P>
    <P>Another aspect I should like to deal with arises from a lot of public debate at the moment.  It is the respective responsibilities of the different institutions in Europe.  We practitioners in the art of politics both here and in Europe are familiar with the different institutions&mdash;the Commission, the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament&mdash;but the general public here so far are not aware of the situation.  The information campaign conducted by the Commission and the European Parliament has not got through to people the varying responsibilities of the different institutions in Europe and that is a pity.</P>
    <P>We are about to have direct elections when more than 180 million people will be entitled to vote for the first time for a parliament to represent 260 million people and which probably during the lifetime of that parliament will be representing 300 million people when Greece, Portugal and Spain join.  It is an occasion of great promise, but unfortunately one that cannot guarantee anything.  The Minister's party belong to a group in the European Parliament who appear to be anxious to limit the influence of the European Parliament.  I prefer to use the word &ldquo;influence&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;power&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of limiting the influence of the European Parliament.  I do not know where the Deputy got that idea from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get that reassurance from the Minister.  I suppose he knows that what he has said is completely at variance with the view of Monsieur Chirac, who believes the European Parliament should meet only twice a year and at these two meetings each <Col N="1947" /> year they should not discuss anything that has not been put on their agenda by the Council of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>And on both occasions it would be in Strasbourg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This happens to be an issue which is being posed in the campaign by Fianna Fáil here and the Gaullist party in France.  If it is being pushed as an issue, it is important that people should understand the realities.  I wonder did the Minister understand the realities on 23 November last when he pointed out in the House, quite rightly, that the powers of the European Parliament cannot be increased at the expense of national parliaments or national governments without there being another formal international treaty which the nine member states of the EEC, soon 12, would sign.  As far as Ireland is concerned, such a treaty would require the endorsement of our people in a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, when we are discussing the influence of the different institutions in Europe and the distribution of power within Europe it must be clearly understood&mdash;I ask the Minister, as the responsible person in this area, to confirm what I am saying&mdash;that there is no question of taking powers from the Dáil, the Seanad or this Parliament or the Government of Ireland or of any member state in the EEC, when we are discussing what should or should not be the influence of the European Parliament. The European Parliament professes to be a democratic organisation.  It says it will not admit to membership of the EEC any country which does not practise parliamentary democracy.  How in heaven's name can such an organisation tolerate what has happened in the EEC where national parliaments have surrendered powers to the European institutions? Those powers are not being exercised as they ought to be in a democracy by lively parliamentary debate but by technocrats, bureaucrats, experts in Brussels, or by Ministers of the sovereign Governments who meet in Italy about once a month or <Col N="1948" /> thereabouts, led along by the same technocrats and so called experts without an adequate parliamentary voice being heard or acknowledged.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that we are committed to strengthening and developing the policies of the Community.  The present arrangements and distribution of power in the EEC, power already surrendered, have led to the situation in which the Community are being weakened.  It is the Council of Ministers who are responsible primarily for the sense of frustration throughout Europe at the lack of progress.  We are talking about the failure of Europe to provide sufficient funds for the poor regions such as Ireland.  The Parliament have voted again and again for more money for the poor regions.  Parliament's voice has been ignored by the Council of Ministers, and the result is that we have not sufficient regional funds, a fact acknowledged by the Minister in his speech.  Again and again Parliament have called for more expenditure in the social fund but the Council of Ministers have again and again said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  So Parliament are frustrated.</P>
    <P>Parliament have asked for an effective energy policy which would ensure that any country in difficulty in relation to its petrol and oil supplies should receive supplies from its Community partners, but the Council of Ministers have said, &ldquo;No, we will not treat the oil and petrol of Europe as a Community reserve, we will treat it as the possession of individual nation states.&rdquo;  If Parliament's voice was heeded by the Council of Ministers Ireland would not be suffering the most acute petrol shortage in the whole Community and we would be no better or worse than anybody else.  But the Council of Ministers have said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Parliament have endorsed the very effective and worthwhile consumer protection proposals of Commissioner Burke to give protection to consumers throughout the Community, but the Council of Ministers say that they will not allow the Commissioner and the Parliament to provide this protection for the common people of Europe.  The Parliament have asked for a Community driving licence so that we, the ordinary <Col N="1949" /> people of the Community, could drive from one country to another with the minimum of bureaucratic procedures and documentation, but the Council of Ministers have said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to such a simple thing as a driving licence.  The people of Europe, sharing a common heritage, through their parliamentarians have asked for a Community passport.  Accepting that without the Community it might be necessary to have a national passport, then people should be left free to choose a Community passport or a national passport or preferably to have both.  Once again the Council of Ministers have said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to such a simple thing as treating all citizens of the Community as citizens of a common Community.  The Parliament have asked for a worthwhile industrial policy to match the agricultural policy to provide money and means to retrain people in industries affected by modern technology or changes taking place in world trade. Once again the Council of Ministers say &ldquo;No&rdquo; and so Parliament are once again frustrated.  Parliament have asked for special Community measures and special, worthwhile Community funds to relieve the crying problem of 2,000,000 unemployed youth in Europe.  Parliament's wishes have been ignored because the Council of Ministers say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is what we are talking about when we say that the influence of the European Parliament must be respected. The Minister will have a very special responsibility as President of the Council in the second half of 1979 because he will have to be responsible in the Parliament for relations between the Council of Ministers and the Parliament.  It is in the first six months of the new Parliament's life that the pattern is going to be set for the future.  I hope that the Minister will persuade his colleagues that they will have to accede to the mandate which the directly elected Members will have.  Some system will have to be worked out to end the blockage which exists in the progress of the Community, which can be illustrated in so many ways.  I have mentioned only a few of them.  There are many other ways in which one can point out the way in which Europe is being prevented from <Col N="1950" /> going forward.  It would take a decade or more to exercise existing powers in a democratic way without any need to consider whether there should be a further ceding of powers by the nation states.  That is not at issue now.  What is at issue is whether the people of Europe through their parliamentarians can get what they want implemented or whether they are going to have their wishes frustrated continually because of the obscurantism of the Council of Ministers and their advisers.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged somewhat by the Minister's remarks.  I hope I interpret them correctly when I say that he seems to recognise that the new Parliament will have an authority which was not enjoyed by the nominated Parliament.  I believe that the new Parliament will have that authority and that they will be impatient in exercising it.  The Minister has said in his speech that the Parliament &ldquo;will not require any extra powers by virtue of being directly elected&rdquo;.  He says here &ldquo;powers&rdquo; but he does seem to acknowledge that they will have extra influence. I believe that respect for that influence is all that is required.  In other words, the Council of Ministers must say, &ldquo;If Parliament wants this or that we must do something to respect the wishes of Parliament&rdquo; instead of, as was implied so often in the past, &ldquo;They are a bunch of do-gooders, they have no responsibility for Government.  Ignore them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know the attitude of some Ministers in the various councils.  I served for about four and a half years in the Council of Finance Ministers and, as Ireland's voice, naturally I was asking for more money for the Regional Fund.  Even if I sometimes lost the argument there I was always able to say, &ldquo;That may be your attitude but Parliament will condemn you properly for not providing sufficient funds for the regions&rdquo;.  I know that the attitude of some Finance Ministers &mdash;and probably it is not peculiar to Finance Ministers&mdash;is, &ldquo;It is all very well for Parliament to be generous with the money of the citizens in my country but politically I will not be able to defend that at home&rdquo;.  I am not making light of the personal and political problems of Ministers in relation to their own electorate, <Col N="1951" /> but if Europe is to mean anything it must mean a Europe that is democratic and not one which has a pretence of democracy while Ministers continually frustrate and ignore the demands of Parliament.</P>
    <P>If the need should arise I will be reminding the Minister that he said that the Parliament must be accorded their due weight as a democratically elected institution.  I will be waiting to see what the Minister regards as due weight.</P>

Jacques Chirac is in the Parliament and believes that the Parliament should meet only twice a year to put up whatever the Council of Ministers shall dictate to them.</P>

      <P>The Members of the European Parliament are very disgruntled that the consultation process, which is now recognised as a proper feature between Parliament and the Council of Ministers when disagreement arises, is not being conducted at a proper level.  Parliament goes to the trouble, quite frequently, of selecting some of the most able and senior members for the purpose of having consultations with the Council of Ministers and then they find that the Minister they ought to meet has sent along a junior Minister or sometimes only an ambassador.  This is not good enough.  When the Minister considers the matter he will see the need to give senior ministerial presence when these consultations take place.  I sympathise with the Minister about the immense workload he will have in the course of Ireland's presidency this year. Not only has the Minister to be in Europe to stir the work of the European Economic Community and its constitutions, but he also has a three months session with the UN in New York.</P>

      <P>I assure the Minister, on behalf of the Fine Gael Christian Democrat Group, that we will co-operate in every way we can and will not be involved in any criticism of the Minister if he is unable to be in two places at the one time.  The Minister's problem will be understood as will the problems of the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the historical fact that we will once again, very fortunately, as a result of the European elections have parliamentarians from all parts of Ireland in the one Parliament. Next Thursday is quite an historical day because for the first time since 1918 people from all Ireland will come together for the purpose of electing public representatives to the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to interfere in the affairs of Northern Ireland but the people here <Col N="1953" /> and in the North are entitled to know what Mr. Ian Paisley did when he visited the European Parliament in Luxembourg some months ago.  Mr. Paisley pre-occupied himself at the various meetings by asking members of the Parliament to identify the religion of members of their group.  I was asked to meet him and refused to do so because I regard him as an evil and mischievous man.  I felt there was no point in meeting him because whatever I said would have been misinterpreted.  When Mr. Paisley returned to Belfast he said that he had been proved right, that the European Parliament was an instrument of the Papacy.  It would be appalling if that gentleman were to represent any element of the Irish people.  There is a danger of that, and it is an appalling state of affairs that this island, in which the vast majority want to forget sectarian bitterness, may be represented by a person whose contribution to Europe will be mischievous at best, even though it will not have any material significance in the decisions of the European Parliament or any other European institutions.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder whether the Council of Foreign Ministers is the best organisation to have responsibility for the progress of European co-operation because by their nature foreign departments tends to project the selfish interests of their country and not thoroughly understand the advantages which can arise from fundamental practical economic co-operation.  If Europe is to progress it will be necessary to have in all Governments a very senior Minister concerned with European Affairs who shall have the responsibility of being the main link between national governments, and not foreign ministers whose interests will stretch across all the continents.  I have seen so many cases where progress has been inhibited by national chauvinism that I fear that this will continue as long as relationships between the European countries are conducted at senior level by the foreign Ministers who are not concerned primarily with worthwhile European co-operation.  No doubt that is something that will be looked at in the light of further developments following the direct elections.</P>
    <P>I endorse what the Minister said in <Col N="1954" /> relation to Northern Ireland.  I am glad from what the Minister said that it appears that there is a very substantial area of agreement between the Government and the Opposition.  We cannot too strongly or too frequently say that there is no desire on the part of the Republic to oblige the people of Northern Ireland to coalesce with us.  We have no desire to take over the people of Northern Ireland or force them to accept our point of view, but it is highly desirable that people understand the common interests and see the advantage of working together.  When they consider that the people of Northern Ireland have only about a 2½ per cent voice in policy-making decisions of the United Kingdom, whereas if they join with us their voice would represent more than one-third of the voice of Ireland, they would see that they had a great deal to gain by working with us.  I look forward to co-operation between members from Northern Ireland in the European Parliament, except for Mr. Paisley, because I cannot honestly think that one could have meaningful or sincere contributions from him in relation to the policies of the Parliament or the institutions of Europe.  With the other Northern Ireland representatives I hope that we will work out, as members of the European Parliament do, a common line on many policies.</P>
    <P>A frequent question posed by our people is &ldquo;Why do not the Irish people form one group in the European Parliament and not divide themselves amongst different political groupings?&rdquo;  I would regard the ideal result of the election as 15 Fine Gael Christian Democrat members but I accept the reality that this is unlikely to happen.  The probability is that three political groups will be represented after the election next week and the Irish members will take their position in three political groups. That is the right thing for us.  Nothing could be worse than to set up a group of 15 green hibernians groaning and moaning about the problems of Ireland with no interest in the problems of others. They would soon bore the rest of the Parliament to tears and would get little sympathy for the Irish cause.  If Irish representatives are in a number of <Col N="1955" /> groups they can through persuasion and friendships persuade their colleagues in the numerically strong groups to support a line which is in Ireland's interests and in so doing they can produce a majority vote in favour of a policy line which is advantageous to us.  On the basis of my experience in the European Parliament I assure the people that whenever matters of vital interest to Ireland have arisen, Irish members, although they are in different political groupings, never allow their group loyalties to take precedence over their obligations to Ireland.  Even when I was not in the Parliament I understood that that was the practice.  The rigidity of party discipline there is not as great as it is here.  It is more like the United States system where democratic members of the parliament will vote against a democratic president like President Carter and so on.  The people may be assured that this practice in the interests of Ireland will continue in the new Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is most regrettable that for the last few years we have seen a most damaging inaction in relation to the production of a solution in Northern Ireland.  It is no use now blaming anybody.  The realities are, as the Minister recognised in his speech, that the British Government put their own survival in the Westminster Parliament before the interests of the people of Ireland, the people of Northern Ireland in particular.</P>
    <P>However, I believe that historically the British Labour Party will be condemned for having surrendered to a fascist protest because that in fact is what brought down the Government in Northern Ireland in which both the minority and majority were working together.  I heard a member of the British delegation in the European Parliament recently say that governments could not ignore the wishes of the people, as, he said, the British government found in Northern Ireland when the power-sharing government was brought down. The power-sharing government in Northern Ireland was not brought down by the will of the majority of the people in Northern Ireland because the majority of people in Northern Ireland accept <Col N="1956" /> the need for power-sharing, accept the need for the minority and majority to work together in political structures.  It was brought down by a small extremist fascist group.  The British Government failed to exert their authority in defence of the majority will in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I believe that whatever solution is to be produced in the future it will have to be backed up with force, if necessary, to ensure that no fascist minority obstructs the will of the people of Northern Ireland, the will of the people of Ireland, indeed the will of the United Kingdom as well.  When I say &ldquo;force&rdquo; I do not desire to say &ldquo;a confrontation&rdquo; but at least steps will have to be taken to ensure that no fascist minority ensures the continuation of violence, misery and injustice in Northern Ireland, and unfortunately, that is exactly what has happened, not merely in the 1970s but, as we know, way back in the 1920s and 1930s as well.  Unless that reality is faced, then I am afraid Northern Ireland and ourselves may be condemned to a long period of violence and insecurity, and costs arising therefrom.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is increasing the amount of the grant-in-aid for cultural relations and that we are to have a Festival of Irish Culture in London in February 1980.  I do not know the form of that festival and I shall be very interested in hearing what form it is to take.  But I would suggest to the Minister that a great deal of the activities of the Cultural Relations Committee, whose voluntary contributions I respect and praise, are pitched at an upper-class market.  I believe we ought to be expending a great deal more money in the promotion of Irish cultural activities abroad which would generate an interest in Ireland at a somewhat lower level of intellectual interest.</P>
    <P>For instance, I regret very much that in most years no contribution is made towards the cost of sending Irish dancing teams abroad.  Despite the degree of coming together in Europe, one of the great things about it is that local dances, costumes and so on are encouraged and promoted.  It is an appalling tragedy that in Ireland so much effort is put into training young children to dance Irish dances but that the overwhelming majority <Col N="1957" /> of them abandon the activity by the time they reach 12 or 14 years of age.  I believe it would help to stimulate an interest in adult performance of Irish dancing, and adult involvement in Irish culture, if the Department of Foreign Affairs&mdash;through the grant-in-aid for cultural relations&mdash;were to provide very generous sums for the encouragement of Irish participation in folk dance festivals particularly throughout the European Community.  I said this when in government to my colleague, Dr. FitzGerald, and I say it now to the Minister, I believe that one of the most effective ways of promoting a good image of Ireland on the continent, one of the most effective ways of helping us to generate, stimulate and maintain our identity would be to give a massive subvention to the cost of sending Irish folk dancing troups abroad.  There is a considerable cost involved for us here because of the fact that we are an island on the fringe of Europe but I believe we ought to do it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is a very good activity.  I should like to encourage it because of the cultural relations which would be strengthened with other countries and also because I believe it would be a great injection of encouragement to people who have acquired great skill in Irish dancing, as children, to maintain that healthy and wonderful activity in their adult life.  Is it not dreadful to think that there is so much competition amongst children in Irish dancing that sometimes a dancing competition may stretch beyond 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock at night, having begun at 10 o'clock in the morning, over 12 hours of competitors dancing away, yet that it all comes to nought by the time they reach 12 or 14 years of age because they have some inferiority attitude towards it? However, I shall not dwell too long on it. It is more a cultural effort than a matter that needs to be dealt with at length on an Estimate for Foreign Affairs.  But I want to emphasise once again that we will not have the strongest cultural relations simply having exhibitions of treasures of early Irish art in museums, excellent and all though that idea is and I entirely support it.  It is not the way of getting through to the masses of people or indeed of getting our people to be fully involved in and proud of their heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to some EEC matters &mdash;although the other one is not unrelated&mdash;the regional fund, as the Minister said, is quite inadequate.  It represents less than 1½ per cent of Ireland's domestic investment in regional development.  Therefore it cannot be seriously treated as a worthwhile Community contribution towards the development of a poor region like Ireland.  But it is very important to recognise that, in this year's allocation of £38.5 million the European Parliament is responsible for having put in between £13 million and £14 million but that only after a fierce row between the Parliament and the Council of Ministers. This is a classic example of the importance of giving the European Parliament <Col N="1959" /> more power, more influence.  Last year, 1978, the Parliament succeeded in adding £1 million to the Regional Fund&mdash;which was hardly worth talking about&mdash;but they added it as a matter of final, defiant protest against the unwillingness of the Council of Minister to put in sufficient money.  This year our regional fund would be about £25,000,000 only had not Parliament insisted on increasing the allocation for regional fund purposes, as a result of which an additional £13 million was added, giving an allocation of £38.5 million.  It is still very small in relation to our requirements but it would not have got to this point if Parliament had not been defiant of an unwilling Council of Ministers.  It is encouraging to see that the Commission have taken this new base as the starting point of their proposals for 1980.</P>
    <P>It is important also to recognise, when people criticise the Community budget and the 75 per cent of it which is spent on agricultural policy, that&mdash;as the Minister very properly said&mdash;this is not due to the fact that agriculture is being privileged but simply due to the fact that other areas of necessary expenditure are not being met at all.  If the Community had a worthwhile industrial policy, then expenditure on the common agricultural policy probably would be no more than 10 per cent of the total Community budget.  But the Community budget, about which there is so much talk, a great deal of which is over-emphasised, represents no more than 0.8 per cent of the Gross National Product of the Community.  It cannot be said that a budget so small has much possibility of producing Community solutions to Community problems.  That is why there is such great disappointment with the Community at present.  The Community budget represents no more than, I think, 2.5 per cent of the gross national budgets of the Nine member States. Such a small amount cannot possibly provide European-scale solutions to European problems.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the common agricultural policy to which I should like to refer briefly.  I believe the Government are very wrong to generate further disenchantment <Col N="1960" /> with the common agricultural policy by the abolition of food subsidies.  We are right to get the highest possible price for all Irish products, whether industrial or agricultural, and nobody, whether they work in city, town or country, should have any doubt that the most sensible policy for Ireland is to sell our products and services for the highest possible price.  That is good for our economy as more money comes into the country and our standard of living rises.  More money is spent here and more jobs are generated by having greater income.  In a situation, where there appears to be an idea of two nations arising here, with country against city and city against country, the Government ought to syphon off some of the additional money coming into the country as a result of the CAP for the purposes of reducing the cost of our food subsidies.  I am afraid that some of the disenchantment which has been generated in urban areas in Ireland in relation to the EEC will be further fermented.</P>
    <P>I join with the Minister in his compliments to our Army for their wonderful contributions in many parts of the world to United Nations peacekeeping efforts. The Minister said that certain countries are not paying their share of financial contributions.  I know that, but I am not quite certain who are the defaulters.  I would appreciate if the Minister would name the defaulters and the amount of money involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew those because they are the major ones.  I would like to hear the names of the others from the Minister.  How far short of our costs are we in relation to what we are getting from the UN at the moment?  What percentage of the cost of the Irish contingent has to be paid for by the Irish taxpayers?  Is there any indication from the defaulters that they are prepared to mend their ways?  What reasons have they advanced for not contributing their <Col N="1961" /> share of the cost?  When there are large countries like the Peoples Republic of China, the Soviet Union and the rich resources of the Arab States involved if they were to make a contribution it would obviously provide a great easement of the burden for us and others involved.</P>
      <P>It is sad that once again in a Foreign Affairs debate we must condemn the continuation of apartheid in southern Africa.  I have said on other occasions, and I repeat again, that no matter what view one may have about the saga of political development the creed of apartheid is so totally repugnant that it must be condemned without qualification. I now want to say something which I realise is somewhat against the tide of popular comment and against the tide of UN opinion.  There have been developments recently in Zimbabwe.  Elections of a kind have been held.  It seems to me that whatever doubts or worries one might have about their perfection they amount to a step forward.  I believe it is wrong that the international attitude should remain as hard as it used to be before the election was held.  There ought to be a recognition that a step has been taken in Zimbabwe which gives the people of that country a government which has a majority of people in it who are black.  The election may have been imperfect. I believe that many of the people who have refused to adjust their attitude know little about the matters I know of. It seems to me that the change that has taken place in that country is a lot more democratic than some changes of government which have taken place in other parts of the world, which have received international recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope there will be an adjustment of attitudes and that there will not be a continuing absolute refusal to accept that any change has taken place in Zimbabwe. Perhaps one of the reasons why some people are refusing to acknowledge any adjustment is because Ian Smith's government were involved in it.  There appears to be in Zimbabwe the possibility of a comparatively peaceful transfer of responsibility for government. That is a lot better than the transfers which took place in some other countries which involved those countries <Col N="1962" /> in appalling civil wars.  I am not saying that all elements are adequately represented in the new Government.  I suggest that the continuing intransigence on the part of international opinion is providing an encouragement for people of violence to maintain and indeed to step up their violence.</P>
    <P>What would we say if there was an internal settlement in Northern Ireland which was not acceptable to the IRA and other paramilitary organisations and if the rest of the world refused to recognise an internal settlement because it did not involve the people of violence, that they were not ready to lay down their arms?  I know there are some differences in this situation.  I am not a simpleton suggesting that the two cases are entirely similar.  There is no doubt that the present state of international opinion provides encouragement to people of violence in Africa.  I am not condemning those who condemn the Ian Smith regime.  I did also and I am on record as doing so, but I cannot see that it is wise to pretend that nothing has changed in Zimbabwe.  It has.  I realise as I am saying this, that many of my friends in the anti-apartheid movement would disagree with what I am saying, but I would prefer to be honest and speak out what I sincerely believe rather than take the easy path of simply joining with the crowd because the crowd do not want to see that anything whatever has happened.</P>
    <P>We are all delighted that the tyrant Amin is gone.  It is strange that he was toppled by one of the poorest countries in the world, Tanzania, a country which is so poor that, as the Minister said, it was classified by the United Nations as one of the least developed and is one of the countries to which we give direct bilateral aid.  It is good that Amin was toppled by his neighbours and not by the intervention of any government outside the African continent.  I share with the Minister the great hope that Uganda may now return to sanity and to progress.</P>
    <P>We are involved in negotiations between the European Community and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries for a new Lomé Convention.  I hope that the stalemate which has arisen <Col N="1963" /> where Europe says it will only give five billion units of account and the ACP are looking for ten will be resolved by Europe agreeing to the ten billion units of account sought by ACP.  It is in Europe's interest to do it.  I am not putting forward that as the major reason why it should be done.  Unless the purchasing capacity of the poorer countries of the world is substantially increased Europe will not be able to maintain its own standard of living, still less improve it.</P>
    <P>The prospects of employment for the six million people unemployed in Europe will increase if ten billion units of account are given to the ACP countries.  It will diminish if we are mean about it, because the fundamental economic law is that you must increase the purchasing power of the people with whom you want to trade.  This cannot be done without a very substantial transfer of resources from Europe.  In relation to Europe's wealth, what we are talking about is a mere pittance.  If Europe does not do this, Europe will be the sufferer and the tensions of the world will be all the greater.  I say that, having suffered all the disadvantages of having my own outlook constrained by being Minister for Finance.  I preached this as a Minister and I do so now that the economic facts support what I say.  It is in Europe's own interest to be extremely generous.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by referring to the European Monetary System.</P>

      <P>If you have something worth saying you can usually say it in a short time.  I do not believe in spreading myself at undue length, and I must acknowledge that there are people outside the House who want to see me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have drawn attention to the profiteering which is going on in relation to Ireland's currency and other currencies, particularly those of small countries, where an exorbitant commission in handling charges has been made by certain financial institutions and <Col N="1964" /> traders.  The purpose of the EMS is to reduce the margin of fluctuation between currencies.  It has not merely an economic objective, it is supposed to encourage the people of Europe to respect one another's currencies so that we would move towards the day when there would be one common currency in Europe.</P>
    <P>The rule of the EMS is that currencies have to be stablised so that they will not vary from a central point more than 2¼ per cent.  We now have the appalling situation in which the Irish punt is being devalued by traders who are charging as much as 5 and 6 per cent above the normal charges for handling that commission. Internationally the appropriate acceptable charge for handling currency exchanges, for insurance against the risk involved and for commission on the transaction is ½ to 1½ per cent, and our own banks are making a charge of about 0.7 per cent on transactions, which is acceptable internationally and relates to the cost of the operation.  It must be remembered that the element of risk is much less than it would be without the EMS because the risk element is set by the rules of the EMS which prevent a variation of more than 2¼ per cent from the mean.</P>
    <P>I have already initiated in Parliament the procedures to get a parliamentary view, which I with confidence anticipate, that the Council of Ministers and the Commission should take steps to lay down rules for universal application throughout the Community which would ensure a standard charge for the exchange of any Community currency and which would also ensure that Community currencies would be freely exchanged. We have for a long time in the past, and even more in the present, suffered the ignomy of traders and bankers, sometimes, in the United Kingdom refusing to handle Irish currency.</P>
    <P>Luxembourg also suffers the insult of having her currency rejected in Belgium although both currencies, as the Irish and British pounds used to be, are at a common level.  There is total parity between the Luxembourg franc and the Belgian franc.  If we are a Community I cannot see any reason why there would not be a Community standard charge <Col N="1965" /> and a Community obligation to accept as totally convertible the currencies of the Community.</P>
    <P>It is not a very difficult task in these days of ample copying facilities to circulate throughout the Community to every institution, trader and hotel if necessary, specimen copies of the paper currencies of the Community countries. I therefore hope that when, as I expect, Parliament will pass a resolution on this matter on the lines I have suggested, that the Council of Ministers&mdash;hopefully under the Presidency of Minister O'Kennedy&mdash;will be sympathetic to the parliamentary view and provide for a standard charge and total convertibility of Community currencies within the Community.</P>
    <P>There are technical difficulties, in relation to currency matters there are more technical difficulties than there are in relation to other matters, but they are not insuperable.  If we want to generate confidence among the Community citizens that they belong to one community, we should provide this regime of a standard charge and stop this intolerable profiteering which is going on at present.</P>
    <P>Unless the Community act in the matter, we will continue to suffer unfairly at the hands of traders, particularly in the United Kingdom.  The Irish punt has not devalued against European currencies other than the pound sterling.  That relative devaluation is primarily due to a possibly temporary enhancement of the British pound, but I share the Minister's concern that we may well be behaving in such a way which would lead to a market devaluation of the Irish punt.  We cannot have a higher rate of inflation, worse industrial disputes and a deteriorating balance of trade without market forces looking at the Irish punt and saying it is overvalued.  If market forces take that stance and the EMS reach the point where they find they can no longer support the Irish punt at its present value, our punt will be deliberately devalued and the result will be much greater inflation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately one of the aspects of the EMS which is a great disappointment is the gap which has arisen between the Irish and the British pounds. <Col N="1966" /> Traditionally most transactions between Irish people and people abroad were between Ireland and Britain.  The stability we wanted to show people that would arise from being in the EMS appears to be further away than ever before.  If we behave sensibly we could have great prospects of introducing stability and a lower inflation rate.</P>
    <P>Because of this gap of 5p between our pound and the pound sterling as a result of the changes that have taken place, we will be importing more inflation.  With more than half our imports coming from Britain, we will have this additional 5 per cent to carry.  I can only hope that that gap closes in the very near future, but it will yawn the other way unless we adopt certain policies here.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get on to the domestic front, but I was glad to hear what the Minister had to say.  I wish he could spread in the domestic area the wisdom he appears to be exhibiting on the foreign scene.  I wish him well during his period of the Presidency.  I shall treasure the speech he delivered today and keep it close by me.  I hope I shall not have to quote it against him in the European Parliament or elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we had this exchange last year.  I regret if my temporary absence from the Chamber caused the lack of an attentive audience to throw the Minister off his speech.  I did scan it before I left and I hope my disappearance was not misconstrued.  I was not going to look for ammunition to throw at the Minister.  Not having the retinue of back-up services accorded to a Minister, the ammunition will not have the sharpness it might otherwise have.  I am formally speaking on behalf of Deputy Kavanagh, who unfortunately <Col N="1967" /> cannot count on such a secure vote as the official spokesman for Fine Gael next Thursday.</P>
      <P>I want to speak on both Estimates. Listening to the Minister's speech one would think that we were only talking about one.  In a long speech and an interesting review of the international situation in relation to Ireland, I think Development and Co-operation, which account for £8 million, came in towards the end of the speech.  I should like to deal with both Estimates, taking them in the order the Minister used.  The major contribution in the moneys the Minister is asking us to vote is for salaries and staff expenditure, as one would expect.  I am perhaps a little disappointed, unnecessarily as I now realise that this is only the second Estimate debate that we have had since 1974.  The House is, however, grateful for the fact that we are having an Estimate debate for two years in a row.</P>
      <P>The expansion of our diplomatic services and the role of the Department will as a consequence create internal personnel and staff problems of overload, stress, rotating personnel, moving people from different embassy positions outside the normal western democratic system to countries with different cultural, economic and social systems.  This changes considerably the working conditions of the staff whose salaries we are being asked to vote today from a period as recently as 1971-1972 when we were not a member of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss industrial relations here, nor am I suggesting that there is any problem in that regard, but I think expansion of our diplomatic services must hopefully in the Minister's office and in the Department create recognition of the need for a programme of training and accommodation and recognition of the difficulty this increased workload will put on all our staff.  I have evidence to suggest that that is partially there, and I welcome it.  This party fully recognise the importance of Foreign Affairs and of extending and increasing its role and that consequently the working conditions and particularly the stresses that will fall on that Department are unique compared with any <Col N="1968" /> other Department and that due recognition should be given to them.  I am prompted to make that remark because the first item of the estimate is such an enormous amount.  It is not a contentious one; it is a reasonable one and self-explanatory. But unless a Minister can quote open support in the House when dealing with the Minister for the Public Service&mdash;I am talking of any Minister&mdash;and realise that there is full bipartisan support for this approach he is at a disadvantage.  I should like to think, in so far as it can be any help, that this support will strengthen the Minister's hand in those endless discussions that go on with the Department of the Public Service.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the position in Northern Ireland and the role of the Government in the past year, and has correctly referred to the change in the administration in Britain at least giving it a Government with a clear majority and therefore not being in a position to have the excuse which the previous minority Government had&mdash;we tend to forget that it was a minority Government&mdash;in relation to Northern Ireland.  This party share with the Minister the hope that there will now be recognition by the British Government that they have a positive role to play in Northern Ireland. Today all we can talk about is the hope. Given the nature of the problem and our understanding of it here, silence at this stage in anticipation of the announcement of what action the British Government are likely to take could be more helpful than long-winded speeches.  All Parties in the House have time and again indicated their position on Northern Ireland, and a repetition will not necessarily add to that or make the task any easier.</P>
    <P>One comment should be made in regard to the role of the Minister and the Department and particularly in regard to our diplomatic representation in North America, and it is that it would be right and proper for this side of the House to recognise the achievement by our combined democratic efforts in relation to the way in which influential democratic politicians of both parties, but particularly of the larger party, in the area of North America that particularly concerns <Col N="1969" /> this country, the way in which they have been&mdash;not harnessed, because that would be a misconception of their interest in the problem and in the role of our diplomats and Ministers&mdash;but the way in which they have been accurately informed about attitudes here.  That is an achievement especially for a small diplomatic service in a small country, a country that operates with enormous pressures of various kinds.  That should be recognised and, on behalf of the Labour Party, I formally recognise it and put it on the records of the House.</P>
    <P>I turn now to what will be the major workload of the Minister and his Department for the next six months and which has probably been the major workload for the past six months also.  In his speech, the Minister rightly emphasises the importance of the presidency and says:</P>
    <P>... I must stress the importance of presenting a favourable image of Ireland to the world in the highly publicised period of our Presidency. The achievements of recent years and the growing interest and goodwill towards Ireland can be given further impetus if we show ourselves as a responsible and progressive people.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to play smart politics with the Minister.  I know many of the difficulties in this city and the country generally are totally outside his departmental control and in some instances outside Government control, but a favourable image of Ireland which will cost a lot of money by way of information services and a lot of diplomatic time, will be very much undermined if the image of Dublin city and of many of our services ranging from hotel accommodation through transportation and telephones and so on cannot be in some way improved and co-ordinated in the next six months.  It is easy to identify the problem and not so easy to point out a solution.  The inter-departmental committee set up by the Department of Economic Planning and Development, which proposed certain inner city measures for Dublin in particular, published a report two or three weeks ago calling for certain action.  While little <Col N="1970" /> can be done in six months, some attempt should be made to improve these facilities and services.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of hotel accommodation. Casual hotel beds are almost non-existent in Dublin between St. Patrick's day and October, and this can make life extremely difficult. Dublin has not a monopoly of these problems.  I share the Minister's concern about a favourable image.  That image can frequently be distorted because of some apparently minor point. In pursuing this objective I hope the Minister will be able to convince his colleagues in Government of the importance of being consistent.</P>
    <P>The Presidency will afford the Minister and the Government certain opportunities which they would not otherwise have to bring items to the agenda for discussion.  In his reply the Minister might indicate what action or initiative, if any, he is in a position to take.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the energy problem, and the EEC energy policy has taken on much more relevance now than at any time during the past three years. We should have learned from 1973 the importance of an energy crisis.  We have not done so.  Members of the Government appear to have differing perceptions of the importance of energy considerations. It is to be hoped that the inconsistency displayed domestically by the Government will not impede the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his position as President of the Council in attempting to pursue a coherent energy policy.</P>
    <P>We also want real action in relation to the Regional Fund, which is now quite a joke.  The Minister has said that Ireland has pursued vigorously its attempts to get more money from the EEC and this year we will receive £38.5 million from the Regional Fund.  This amount is only £8.5 million more than Dublin Corporation will spend this year on housing.  In the context of all the verbiage used in the EEC campaign prior to our entry, this is &ldquo;micky mouse&rdquo; money.  When one considers the poverty within the EEC, particularly in the peripheral areas, it is a sick joke to talk of the Regional Fund as <Col N="1971" /> anything other than wallpaper of the thinnest kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister has frequently said that he has sought support for an increased proportion of the Regional Fund, that the Government have renewed their efforts and that the Taoiseach at various meetings with heads of State has sought an enlargement of the Regional Fund. That is the least we would expect.  What kind of fund is it when we are still talking in terms of £38.5 million?  What is the extent of the Government's influence in this regard?  How seriously can people take the assertion by Government Ministers that they have influence with their European colleagues and that they are in a position, by virtue of their situation here, to enlarge the fund to such an extent that Ireland will benefit greatly?  I have no intention of urging that the £38.5 million should be given back, nor do I make this suggestion in regard to the £25 million from the Social Fund. We must recognise, however, that people were promised during the referendum campaign on entry into the EEC that there would be great benefit from these funds.  Proportionately we are now poorer per capita than at the time of our EEC entry and, as is natural in an open capitalist economy, there has been a shift of resources from the poorer to the richer regions.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister's obsession with the fixed status of the CAP, particularly prior to 7 June.  He fails to recognise that in many areas the CAP has as much to do with regional and social development as with agricultural produce and price support levels.  While the CAP has been consistently supported by the Labour Party, contrary to the lies published in some newspapers, let us recognise that in many instances the CAP must be seen as an instrument for economic and regional development. There is not much evidence of the Minister's recognition of that dimension. He talks about the increased allocation from the Regional Fund and the fact that we are getting so much from the Social Fund.  As Deputy Ryan pointed out, the entire budget is very small relative to the national budgets of the members states.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1972" /> Those comments are relevant in view of the failure of the EEC to meet their social obligations.  In fact, they never had any social obligations.  The EEC is a capitalist creation to provide a harmonised capitalist market which was set up by conservative economic forces after the war.  It has worked perfectly from that point of view.  We are now trying to put some kind of social face to an economic organisation.  The measure of our success in terms of the Regional Fund is £38.5 million.  That is the measure of the Government's diplomacy at the Council of Ministers, £8.5 million more than Dublin Corporation can spend on housing.  The Community is to be enlarged by one member State with an economic profile similar to ours, and fairly soon afterwards by Spain and Portugal, enlarging the Community by approximately 35 million people all sharing our economic profile.</P>
    <P>The words we get from the Government in relation to these funds very soon will have to be matched with performance and action.  I hope that in his reply the Minister will indicate the initiatives, if any, he proposes to take during the Government's six-month Presidency to get realistic levels for both the social and regional funds, perhaps integrating them in some positive way with CAP so that we can begin to talk about the redistribution of wealth within the Community, which is what the Community should be about.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that the moral position for a Fianna Fáil Minister for Foreign Affairs arguing for the redistribution of wealth in an EEC Council of Ministers is zero considering that there is a Tory Government in this country and that domestically they have abolished wealth tax and any attempt at redistribution.  We have the farcial situation of a political party dancing on one foot in one Chamber and on the other foot back at home.  Therefore, when I put the request I did so rhetorically because I know the Government cannot deliver on it.  Let us measure in hard cash what the performance will be of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the next six months and not in 75 pages of an Estimate speech of well-meaning words.</P>
    <P>That may be taken as harsh criticism, <Col N="1973" /> but it is the political reality, the test to be passed.  The Presidency will give the Minister an opportunity to develop the Community institutions.  There was a time when the Minister was a committed European.  There was a time when the idea of an integrated Europe was attractive. I can understand readily the constraints that are now placed on Fianna Fáil, and particularly on a progressive European like the Minister, and it will be interesting to see the relationship the Minister, as President, will attempt to develop between the directly elected Parliament and the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan, a member of the indirectly elected Parliament and likely to be a member of the directly elected Parliament, gave us a short list of requests that the present Parliament had made to the Council of Ministers.  I hope that the kind of influence, as distinct from specific power, that Deputy Ryan spoke about will be supported actively by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The measure of the success of the Minister's support will not be in an Estimate speech next year of the number of items he supported but in his delivery of those items which the European Parliament sought and which he, as an influential Minister, was able to convince his European colleagues to accept.</P>
    <P>I have no illusions about the difficulties that confront the Minister and the Department, or about the personal workload that will fall on every member of the Foreign Affairs Department, and the Minister, and his wife, and the wife of the Minister of State, and the Minister of State.  Sometimes we tend to forget the workload and the role people related to it have to play, and indeed the personal-relations stress that will fall on the wives of civil servants who will have to work unsocial hours.  In relation to the Presidency we must mention again the staff pressures that will exist in the Department of Foreign Affairs, but at no stage should the reality of that workload be such that for the want of adequate resources important jobs will not be done properly.  If this Estimate should have on it an additional £200,000 to cover staff shortages, the request should now be before us for that extra money so that we will not have to talk in <Col N="1974" /> terms of the reasons why we were not able to deliver this or that aspect of our objectives.</P>
    <P>The Presidency will not be easy.  It is occurring at a difficult time and it is very important for this country and for the Minister personally.  We recognise that, and from the point of view of Ireland's interests this party will fully support the Presidency.  However, we will not participate in something that might be turned into a political jamboree with other intents.</P>
    <P>There is one item with two components to which I wish to refer, the CFP and the role of this country in regard to it, and its specific application later to Madrid.  A fisheries policy is of importance to us but it is especially important to eastern Europe, particularly to COMECON countries, excluding the Soviet Union.  I should like to see the Minister develop proposals, individually for Ireland and collectively for the Nine in relation to matters of economic co-operation between east and west Europe. There have been suggestions from the east with regard to co-operation.  We had a Hungarian proposal for integration of the electricity grid between east and west Europe.  There are possibilities for coordination and harmonisation of policy in relation to passport, pollution control and other problems.  To paraphrase words used by the Minister, the world is becoming a smaller and a more crowded place, depending on which way you want to look at it.  Small nations in a crowded place tend to feel the cold shoulder of unfriendly neighbours all the more.  Inevitably, eastern and western Europe are going to be drawn closer together because of the overall development of world economies.  A country like ours which is consciously neutral and positively maintaining its neutrality is in a much stronger position morally and politically to take the initiative in terms of co-operation between eastern and western Europe.  It is an opportunity that exists in the context of the Presidency and of preparation for the CSC conference in Madrid.  I would like to think that some of the resources of the Department of Foreign Affairs are being devoted to that.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the question of EEC matters, <Col N="1975" /> the Minister might be able in his reply to clarify one point that he made. In relation to the economic development of this country he said:</P>
    <P>Our economic policies are not formulated in isolation from current European and world conditions.  Accordingly, the Government have kept the Commission and our Partners fully informed on our programme for economic development.  These have been endorsed by the Community as appropriate to our position and potential within the EEC.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could furnish me with details of the exact nature of that endorsement.  Did it come from the Prime Minister of England, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher of the Conservative Party there?  Did it come from Premier Raymond Barre?  Did it come from the Christian Democrats in Italy?  What was its form?  Was it an after-dinner toast? Was it a formal assessment of the green and white papers?  What does the phrase mean?</P>
    <P>I turn away from the EEC and economic matters to areas of information and cultural relations.  The Minister referred rightly to the importance of Ireland's image generally and instanced cultural relations and information services as being important components in developing that image.  It sounded very good in his speech.  A look at the figures as to what has been prepared and made available takes away somewhat from the rather elegant prose.  Out of an estimate of £9 million, an increase of £1.444 million on last year&mdash;when we spent £51,000 under subhead E.&mdash;cultural relations with other countries account, (grant-in-aid)&mdash;we spent £90,000.  It is a paltry sum.  Dublin Corporation spent about the same in their cultural budget.  This is the test of the Minister's commitment to promoting cultural relations.  The Minister's speech contained many words, good words, nice words, but the money is not there.  Why talk about it?  If you do not believe that it is important do not say that it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister said also:</P>
    <P>Several European countries are interested <Col N="1976" /> in having formal cultural agreements with Ireland and we wish to be able to respond positively to them.  To make a worthwhile impact exhibitions, musical performances and so on must be planned in advance and be on a reasonably large scale.  This requires the commitment of some resources but it is money well spent. The enhancement of the country's image abroad is a worthwhile objective for its own sake but in the long run it can also yield economic returns in the form of tourism, investment and exports.</P>
    <P>We would all agree with that, but £90,000 is a joke.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House know that what the Minister should have said was that several European countries have been continually pressing this country for cultural agreements for the last few years.  Their interest is not cocktail conversation.  It is not a casual exchange of views.  We may not have the full resources of the Government's backbenches, but at least credit us with some degree of information, interest in foreign affairs and awareness of what is going on.  In a Department of Foreign Affairs Estimate in which the Government stress the importance of culture, of links with other countries and of the independence of Ireland's relationship with other countries, it would be interesting to get a breakdown on the state of negotiations with each country which has expressed a positive interest in having a cultural exchange agreement.  Many of these countries are our own partners within the EEC.  In the Minister's reply we might get some facts and figures instead of opinions on this matter.  If the Minister wants more money for cultural development and for information let him ask the House for it.  This still is the Parliament.  We may be out-voted but we still have the right to vote, usually on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of each week.  Let him come to the House and make the case and see what support there is for it.</P>
    <P>Subhead F of the Estimate&mdash;information services&mdash;increased from £135,000 last year to £187,000 this year.  I may not be interpreting this correctly and if I <Col N="1977" /> am wrong I will be properly corrected.  I assume that some of that is to provide for additional information services during the six-month period.  If that is the case I am wondering if an increase of £50,000 or so, which is far less than Fianna Fáil have spent on publicity during this campaign, is an appropriate sum to match the tone of presenting a favourable image of Ireland.  Before I turn to other aspects of my responsibility I must stress the importance of, and I quote the Minister:</P>
    <P>... presenting a favourable image of Ireland to the world in the highly publicised period of our Presidency. The achievements of recent years and the growing interest and goodwill towards Ireland can be given further impetus if we show ourselves as a responsible and progressive people.</P>
    <P>I share that view, but if the commitment to achieving that is an increase of £50,000 on what was spent last year when we were not going to have the Presidency and is far less than Fianna Fáil are spending in the election campaign, it begs the question as to which image is the more important, that of this country or that of Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <P>I agree with the Deputy. This whole question of control is bound up with the as yet non-existent EEC Common Fisheries Policy.  As the Deputy is aware, the difficulties which have been encountered in the achievement of that over the past 12 months have been almost entirely due to the intransigence of the last British Government. There are signs that that is changing rapidly, and I hope for substantial progress towards such a settlement being made at the June meeting of the Council of Ministers.  There are already indications that the present British Government is taking a more positive view than the negative view consistently pursued by the last British Government.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware I have done reasonably well in getting £30 million for surveillance activities.  I sought to get money for research but research is regarded by the Commission as a national endeavour.</P>
      <P>This vessel is a modern Norwegian designed vessel.  We purchased the design and the drawings from Norway. The vessel will measure 150 foot long.  I hope to have the construction of the vessel put in hands very shortly at the cost of about £3 million and I hope to have it finished within the next 18 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision was made some months ago and I decided that the quickest way to get some action in the matter was to purchase the drawings and the design from a Norwegian firm in Bergen, who had constructed a number of up-to-date fishery research vessels for the Norwegian Government.  Therefore, we are assured of having a top-class, modern design.  It will, of course, be built in an Irish shipyard.  There is no question about that&mdash;the order will be placed in an Irish shipyard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to question the Minister's priorities.  I know protection <Col N="1984" /> is vitally important and that the Minister is getting £30 million for protection vessels, aeroplanes and so on, but surely £3 million for research is extremely little in comparison?  As we know so little about our fish stocks in that area surely we should be spending a far greater amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that research is important.  We are making a start now&mdash;we have got one&mdash;and I would hope to have another one.  In the meantime the more urgent necessity was to ensure the protection of our 200-mile limit.  We could not have afforded that protection out of our own resources having regard to the costs involved.  We are now proposing to spend £40 million on the construction and purchase of protection vessels, helicopters and planes by 1981.  It was a substantial advance to secure £30 million from the EEC. Research is really outside the scope of this.  Research is our responsibility, and is the responsibility of every member country of the EEC.  The surveillance aspect was different because there we are protecting, if you like, our part of general Community waters.  Therefore we could make the case very strongly that our protection there against third country vessels was performing a Community function as well as a national one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Catches of fish by the Irish fleet are not recorded in a way which would enable me to say whether they were taken inside or outside our 200-mile limit.  As I indicated in reply to Question No. 4, total allowable catches <Col N="1986" /> are not calculated by reference to national fishery limits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do actually.  On the west and south coasts, what the Deputy says is correct&mdash;all the fish taken by Irish vessels are caught within the Irish 200-mile limit.  But on the north coast and in the Irish Sea Irish vessels habitually operate on both sides of the median line between ourselves and the United Kingdom.  Quite a substantial catch is taken in UK waters by Irish vessels off the east and northern coasts; off the west and southern coasts the position is as the Deputy said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I still think the Minister should be able to give an estimate.  The last part of the Minister's reply is really an indictment of our lack of research.  It is obvious that we do not know what lies out as far as the 200-mile limit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Deputy that our research does need to be strengthened and that is what I am at at present.  Just as a matter of interest, the total catch of sea fish recorded in Ireland was in the region of 100,000 tons.  To a fairly large extent that would be caught within the 200-mile limit, if that is any indication to the Deputy.  But there is a proportion of catch taken on the UK side of the east and north coasts.</P>

If these talks come to fruition, which I hope they will fairly shortly, I will be announcing a scheme on the lines mentioned by the Deputy which will set definite targets and offer incentives for that type of scheme.  Candidly I think we have been very neglectful of private planting here over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Expert veterinary advice on this subject is that the mite which causes sheep scab does not become generally active until the late autumn or winter and that the only effective way to control the disease is to have compulsory dipping in that period.  It was for that reason that the twice-annual compulsory dipping régime which was in operation up to 1976 was discontinued and replaced by a single dipping period from mid-September to the end of January.  I have no plans at present to alter this arrangement.</P>
      <P>By virtue of Article 16 (1) of the Sheep Dipping Order, 1965, each local authority is empowered to impose a compulsory summer dipping in the area under its jurisdiction if it is of the opinion that such a course is desirable.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>An examination of the problems of the cooked beef industry has been carried out in consultation with representatives of the meat industry and a number of proposals aimed at solving these problems have been put to the EEC Commission.  No final solution has yet been agreed upon but I am continuing to pursue the matter with the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems arise from the non-application of MCAs to cooked beef which puts Irish manufacturers at a disadvantage <Col N="2007" /> as compared with British manufacturers.  The disadvantage has been reduced considerably in recent months as a result of the devaluation of the UK Green £ and the appreciation of sterling on foreign exchange markets.  In the case of exports to most other countries the absence of MCAs is, of course, an advantage to Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that the problems mainly affect cooked beef products with a high meat content.  In the case of products with lower beef contents there has in fact been an increase in production and exports over the past two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured that in my treatment of the price package of this year this matter will be a very important consideration which will be present in my mind as being of primary Irish interest.  I have no intention of conceding ground easily on this matter.  We must bear in mind that the greater portion of our actual exports of these products are to the United Kingdom, and while there is the absence of an MCA on these products, this is actually of assistance to exports to the other countries of the Community particularly the hard currency countries.  In the light of our existing exports to the <Col N="2008" /> UK it is important that the position be corrected, as I am sure it can be.</P>

Indeed such a policy would also be unacceptable to most other Community member states.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that a levy on the products the farmer has to sell amounts in his terms and in real terms to a reduction in the price, but I am aware above all of the enormous problem of disease eradication.  This system will provide in a full year about £9 million towards pursuit of an accelerated disease eradication programme.  I am confident that herd owners, while they would prefer if this bill were defrayed from central funds, are prepared to face the music because the music must be faced. It would be impossible to complete our disease eradication programme without the co-operation of herd owners and without their recognising that they are the first beneficiaries of the existence of <Col N="2010" /> the Irish cattle herd which provides such a source of income for the country as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion. This method of raising finance for the disease eradication scheme is related to cattle in the national herd and will have to be paid by herd owners.  There is a certain logic in that.  I do not quite appreciate how Deputy Bruton would envisage the making of a loss by herd owners on slaughter cattle.  Since our entry to the Community, cattle prices have been at a very satisfactory level, particularly of late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the problem is very widespread.  It occurs in pastures which have been mowed as a measure of pasture maintenance and which contain mature seed heads of grasses.  In my experience it is only on mature grass heads that the ergot organism will prosper.  No serious person would fail to recognise ergot if he were harvesting a fodder crop which contained ergot infected heads.  It is primarily a matter of good husbandry.  It is not a very serious problem.  There have been serious cases of ergot poisoning in silage making but they are very scarce.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £9,042,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 1st day of December, 1979, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of certain services administered by that Office, including certain grants-in-aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I will not be accused of misinterpreting the Estimate.  I calculate that the increase in subhead F., Information Services, has been from <Col N="2018" /> £135,000 last year to £187,000, and this has been designed to cope with our information requirements during the term of our Presidency, a matter of about £50,000.  I suggest that Fianna Fáil are spending more on their own publicity in this election campaign than the Government apparently propose to spend to provide additional information services. Earlier I referred to the Minister's statement in his speech in which he stressed the importance of having a proper information service to develop the image of this country abroad so that the position of Ireland will be highly publicised during the period of our Presidency.</P>
      <P>There may be additional matters, additional costs, to which the Minister may wish to refer later, but now that I am becoming aware of some of the costs of modern publicity I regard this as a paltry sum.  It seems to be exceptionally small in relation to the importance of the political objectives involved and the overall size of the Estimate.</P>
      <P>I was referring earlier to the increase in the Estimate for cultural relations, subhead E.  It does not seem to tally with what I perceive to be the thinking of the Minister when he spoke earlier.  Though I found his 75 pages interesting, I would have been much better informed if I had been brought up to date on the exact position of requests for cultural agreements, now either in the Taoiseach's office or that of the Minister, from various countries, including some of our fellow EEC member states.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will remedy that lack of information later because there is great public support for such activities, much more than politicians on all sides tend to assume.  A request for such sums, properly brought by politicians before politicians, would get a much more favourable hearing than some civil servants, with all due respects to them, think about what politicians might wear. This has been my experience in Dublin Corporation and it has been more than vindicated by the public response to any expenditure made in that area.  I do not think this is a party issue.  It should be brought to the floor of the House.  There would be more public support for it if the real costs were brought before us.  Let us try it and test the reaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2019" /> I do not wish to go into the merits or demerits of the quality of Irish dancing, but I should like to know the arrangements, if any, that have been made by the Department to have some exhibitions of Irish cultural activities held here during the six months of our Presidency. Many visitors will be coming here between June and December.  Do the Department have a programme?  For instance, if we have visitors can they be told that such an activity will be on here, and so on?  The House should be informed in this respect.  The Arts Council and the local authorities in Dublin and elsewhere in the country should help to try to achieve the objective set out by the Minister to present a favourable image of the country.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the amount of money proposed to be allocated to achieve these objectives.  Perhaps this would be the tip of the iceberg of a complicated and complex system of accounts and maybe the Minister in his reply will be in a position to point out that certain other items would be used to the effect but would not necessarily appear in the form that they are here.  I would welcome that clarification and I will be in the House to hear it if I get a reasonable opportunity and notice from the Whips.</P>
    <P>I want to move now to the general run and review of international affairs to which the Minister referred.  The Minister and I have a common and shared view on a lot of international issues and I find most of his assessment of international positions compatible with mine.  Most of the positions which he advocated on behalf of the Government are acceptable politically to my party in matters such as apartheid, Southern Africa generally and the Middle East position.  In so far as a country can develop a tripartite approach to international matters, that strengthens the voice of whoever happens to be the Minister of the day in dealing with other nations.  That voice is strengthened all the more when people realise that the Minister comes from a democracy which it is to be hoped, is responsible and healthy and which will be changing its <Col N="2020" /> Minister frequently, in other words at the next general election.</P>
    <P>I may have been cynical earlier about the length of the Minister's speech, but I am glad that he has covered a broad field.  In many of the areas on which I am not expert and therefore can have only a limited opinion we would find ourselves not in disagreement.  On behalf of the Labour Party, and I am speaking personally, I am not sure that I would share Deputy Ryan's attitude to the internal settlement of Southern Africa and to Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, but these matters will take time to develop.  The attitude of this House to such matters is no longer a mere debating point because daily our diplomats and our Ministers are being asked to formulate a common position with eight other member states in the EEC.  As the Minister pointed out in his speech, his role as President of the Council will also involve him in coordinating the political European co-operation which is a much more informal alliance than one which does not have the sort of back-up resources that the EEC, Berlin and Brussels generally provide.  Therefore, it is useful and important that attitudes to foreign affairs, which may have been somewhat academic four or five years ago prior to the EEC, be now expressed in this House.  In whatever way the Labour Party, as distinct from representatives in this House, can be of help to the Department of Foreign Affairs in the next six months, we will be very happy to do so.</P>
    <P>I move now to the question of development co-operation.  When in Opposition the Minister supported a common approach to advancing Ireland's contribution to the UN objective of the target of GNP.  He has also been a positive supporter in Opposition of our bilateral aid programme which was created and developed by the last Government.  That bilateral aid programme was long overdue and was not so much a credit to the last Government as a shame to this House that had not demanded such a programme for many years previously.  We tended to rest on the laurels of the great spiritual empire, as we used to describe it, of the missionary efforts of various members of the Irish community overseas.  The <Col N="2021" /> Minister admitted that his speech was a long one.  Perhaps there was not enough time, but I find it somewhat disturbing that this House was given less information today about the new advisory council which at last has now been agreed, than the AGM of APSO was given last evening if my information is correct.  I am aware from the AGM of APSO that the council will have up to 30 members, that it will be used as a forum as described in its terms of reference and will be represented at the various functions. Why was this House not given the same degree of information as were APSO, who were perfectly entitled to it as they are the central agency?  The Minister stated that an advisory council had been established and then he went on to say:</P>
    <P>Likewise, the Council will have a major role in helping to co-ordinate the activities of the many bodies involved in development, thus ensuring maximum understanding and co-operation in this important area of national policy.</P>
    <P>I would expect and understand such vagueness&mdash;and I am not being antagonistic when I use the word &ldquo;vague&rdquo;&mdash;if this council was set up fairly quickly but, as the Minister knows, I probably more than anybody else in this House, asked consistently when the council would be established.  The option was on the Minister's desk when he became Minister nearly two years ago and only now are we being told of the formation.  I would have hoped that we would have got more information about the advisory council in an introductory speech on the Estimates and that we would have got some indication of the kind of representation that would be on it.  I request the Minister respectfully to give in his reply a full and frank explanation of how he and the Department see the role of the advisory council.  My understanding is that a number of the agencies in this area want some clarification on it.</P>
    <P>We can get obsessions about institutions and councils and the way they are going to relate to one another.  They tend to become a substitute for the primary concern which is the bilateral aid programme itself.  I do not wish to <Col N="2022" /> labour the matter about the council or to let them become an issue in themselves. They should be set up, given adequate funds and their own secretariat and told to get on with the job.  This House must get back to the basics of the size and shape of the bilateral aid programme and the priorities within it and let the professionals and the volunteers get on with the job of implementing them.  I do not want to attempt to play politics on that issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>For clarification, I thought the Deputy might have been aware that the statement I made when the council was being established on 30 April went into much greater detail than I did today, indicating many of the matters to which he has now referred.  That statement was issued through the Government Information Service.  We are in consultation with the organisations involved at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I welcome in the sum for international co-operation the item about education at home.  That side of the bilateral aid programme is very important.  It could very easily be misinterpreted because it falls close to the accusations that some aid programmes devour too much money in administrative costs and that some aid programmes advertise themselves on the basis that 100 per cent of the money given is given to the people who need it. That would make sense if we were talking about a charitable organisation and charitable donations, but a bilateral development co-operation programme is not charity.  It is a conscious step towards achieving some form of new international economic order, which has been demanded by the group of 77 among others and to which the Socialist International feel particularly committed for the reasons Deputy R. Ryan referred to earlier.  We ignore the absence of a consciously created international <Col N="2023" /> economic order at our peril.  The necessity to educate our people about the importance of development co-operation is in many respects as important as it is to get an effective programme on the ground in the five states we have selected for special action.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the sum involved is enough.  I know that the Department of Foreign Affairs have appointed a Secretariat to handle this side, but I wonder what integration will take place between that Secretariat, the Department of Education, the RTE Authority and the rest of it.  How will we get over this question of the legitimate campaign of organisations such as Trocaire, on the one hand, and the necessity to convince people of the interdependence of economic development in the north-south dialogue contest?  This is a big problem, because in essence what we are trying to do at the end of the day is to explain why leather workers in Gorey because of a changed economic pattern must lose their jobs in an industry that they thought was indefinitely secure. That is not an easy task and it is not made easier in times of economic difficulties which are now facing us and the difficulty is undoubtedly compounded four days before an election.  However, these are temporary short-term difficulties which should not deflect us from what will be the reality for most of the people in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year 2000, which is closer to us than the year 1950, I will be 54 and will have to live in a world that will have been totally transformed from the world we are now in.  If we do not consciously set up some form of humane international economic order as required and demanded by the late President of Nigeria, the alternatives will be unacceptable to all of us.  I would like to see both the advisory council and the development education component of our overall bilateral aid programme moving away from the concept of charity and guilt associated with the former colonial past, which in reality became cleverly entwined with a form of neo-colonialist exploitation, to the use of this money as the contribution of a small neutral republic tangibly attempting to redress <Col N="2024" /> the balance between north and south.  It is easy to enunciate that as a principle but it is totally different to make it begin to happen on the ground.  I appreciate that and the difficulties of Iveagh House in attempting to provide staff, on a permanent basis, in full-time development co-operation offices in the countries where we should have them.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate speech last year we talked about the question of the embassy representation in Nairobi and all of that. In relation to the DFA, the new role for the DFA evolved because of the changed relationships we have with the rest of the world and the changed attitude of all three political parties to foreign affairs.  We support the development of this, because in the final analysis it is also in our own interests.</P>
    <P>I am not adequately briefed to refer to other areas which I would like to refer to, but I will have another opportunity to refer to, for instance, the whole question of the role of our contribution to the fifth EDF and the way in which the EDF works.  As this is to be signed in the Sudan we will have to get used to calling it EDF.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to my concern about bureaucratic delays in spending the money, I compliment the Minister on the way he moved sideways, money that was not picked up under one heading last year and used it in the co-financing. That was a useful exercise that should be supported.</P>
      <P>We will have another opportunity to discuss this.  I will need more time to go into it because it is a complex area. When the final conditions of the EDF are seen and the relationship of the 77 nations comes back to the EEC, then we can look at it in a different light.  We can look at it in a proper discussion of the eleventh and twelfth reports which the House will have to discuss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the bilateral aid programme, what is absent in this speech, although it may be elsewhere, is a breakdown of the priorities for that programme in terms distinct from the contribution of personal services.  It is easy for us to simply step in and provide professionals or to subsidise personnel rather than subsidise specific projects or materials.  I would be interested to know how the Minister would see the bilateral aid programme taking off over a number of years.  It is right that we have concentrated on a couple of countries.  It would be very useful if the House were given a good up-to-date report on how the bilateral aid programme is working in Tanzania or in Zambia.  We tend to vote the money and we do not get a lot of feedback.  This is the one area that we cannot measure ourselves.  Any other moneys spent in this House tend to be measurable by direct experience of the Deputies in the House.  Bilateral aid, of its very essence, cannot be subjected to the same sort of test.  So it should be reported back to us in whatever form is appropriate.  The more we see of what is being done the more support there will be in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to move from that side of it, not so much to the aid programme but to the question of the activities of the semi-State sector overseas.  In the last debate on this Estimate Deputy Woods spoke at length and raised the question of the role of the State sector and its involvement in overseas commercial activities. That was on 31 May last year.  I will not take up the time of the House quoting it.  But, in essence, he talked about setting some proper framework within which the State sector would <Col N="2026" /> operate, and was moving very close to the idea of some sort of guidelines.  I have raised this matter with the Minister before.  Without cutting off our commercial nose, without endangering the obvious commercial activities in which the State sector must engage&mdash;because as Deputy Ryan said earlier we should get the highest possible price for our products and services overseas&mdash;the State sector is not and cannot be treated the same as a privately-owned company.</P>
    <P>As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we do not treat it the same; it is an organisation established by the people through the agencies of the State for very definite reasons.  It is not a form of State capitalism; it is not something that is given free rein.  Therefore, it is subject to the same sort of constraints as a local authority or the State itself.  Lest I be mistaken in this area, what I am talking about is complex, difficult to define, and certainly there is no instant panacea, because one could very quickly draw up a list of countries from which the State sector was excluded which would more or less close the door to any overseas activity. That is not the point nor is it the intention.  The Minister has at all times simply stated&mdash;if I am paraphrasing him correctly&mdash;that if the United Nations have not come out with a specific sanction against relationships with a particular country, he and the Government are not prepared to give directions to the State sector <i>vis-à-vis</i> such a country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has said he is paraphrasing.  I know he is doing it in good faith but that is not the full story.  If I might just refer the Deputy to the attitude of the APC States in relation to the attitude, as they perceive it, of the Community on human rights, then he will begin to see how complex is the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  But the APC countries are making a claim for a greater share of the cake on the grounds of morality because the division between wealth in the north&mdash;south line is unethical and unacceptable.  But if one introduces moral arguments one way, they go across the line the other way.  Part of the Trócaire seminar back in January <Col N="2027" /> this year was getting very close to that kind of thing.  I do not think the APC States have the right to simply say: We want far more of what you have got and you have absolutely no right at all to tell us what we do at home.</P>
      <P>Reverting to the State sector, suppose a particular State company that wanted to make money, came out aggressively looking for money and was given a clear mandate to do so, came back to this country with a contract six or seven months ago to undertake the rural electrification system in Uganda, or to get the aeroplanes into the air so that their former president could have a more efficient service, I suggest that would provoke serious question and comment in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an extreme example. But there should be some guidelines. I have asked Aer Lingus and the answer given by their chief executive&mdash;and I feel happy to quote it because it was a presentation made to Deputies and Senators of these Houses&mdash;was that while they had continuous contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs, there was no formal framework as such.  I believe there should be.  I recognise also that the drawing up of such a framework is not an easy matter.  But these companies belong to us and there should be some framework set up within which they operate.  There are at least a number of countries in which one could query their involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the day one must balance that kind of attitude with the commercial realities of the world.  I recognise that but I do think there is a need for it.  One of the Minister's own colleagues referred to it.  It is a view that I and the party have held for some time. I should like to see some work done on it.  I presume DEVCO would have some role to play in that through the advisory council&mdash;and do not forget that at all times I am talking about activities totally outside the bilateral aid programme.  But if the bilateral aid programme has the objective that I and my party believe it should have, the positive activities undertaken <Col N="2028" /> by a bilateral aid project in one country could be seriously undermined by the commercial activities undertaken by a semi-State company in an adjoining country.  This is new territory for all of us in this country.  We should endeavour to foresee some of the difficulties or even attempt to minimise them.</P>
    <P>I want to revert now to the point the Minister made before Question Time, a point that struck me at the time, about his attitude to the Parliament and about Ireland's attitude generally.  As the Minister who will be president of the Council when the directly-elected Parliament takes office, more than anybody else, he will be in a position to set the tone of the relationship of the Council of Ministers on the opinions voiced by that Parliament.  What disturbs me&mdash;I am not now wishing to be partisan and party political, but we are at an election time&mdash;is the statement attributed to the Fianna Fáil Party on page 9 of <i>Hibernia</i> of 31 May 1979 under an advertisement headed &ldquo;There are four real issues in this election&rdquo;, the second issue reading</P>
    <P>The Socialists.  The Irish Labour Party's Group in Europe have continuously sought to destroy the Common Agriculture Policy which has benefited not only Irish agriculture but our villages, towns and cities as well.  Our economy could not withstand the destruction of the CAP.</P>
    <P>This is the Dáil, and that is a party political broadcast; all right.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech this morning:</P>
    <P>The Government are fully committed to resisting any tinkering with the essential principles of the CAP and are convinced that this is in the interests not only of the country but of the process of European Economic integration.</P>
    <P>While I recognise that resources in Mount Street are fairly limited, they do have two full-time officials in the EPD, in the European Parliament; they have direct and ready access to the common appeal published by members of the Confederation of Socialist Parties.  What they actually stated in Brussels in January, what was actually published in <Col N="2029" /> the appeal is as follows, and I quote now from the Labour Party document entitled &ldquo;Ireland and the European Community&rdquo;&mdash;the Labour Party European Elections 1979, Policy Statements, paragraph 16 of the appendix:</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy must be adapted so as to achieve a better balance between production and consumption, more stable prices and an equitable development of agricultural incomes through greater efficiency and better structural policies.  The consumer interest must be taken fully into account in the evolution of the CAP.</P>
    <P>That is what the Socialist Group&mdash;the biggest group with which the Minister will have a relationship after he becomes President of the Council of Ministers &mdash;actually stated.  I suggest that that is not a tinkering with the essential principles of the CAP, which was a stabilisation of prices.  It is certainly not a policy which would continuously seek to destroy the CAP.  The second item is a political lie.  The Minister should read the document: what the Labour Party have said continuously, what the French Socialist Party have said and what the SPD, the Belgians and the Italians have said in relation to the CAP.  We have at the moment in the House a candidate whose name is on the same page as the quotation I have given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about an Estimate for Foreign Affairs and what will be the major event for that Department, the Presidency.  We will have a directly-elected Parliament, people elected on various policy positions.  We will also have the Minister's commitment to such things as an increase in the size of the Regional Fund which will be immensely strengthened by his relationship during the Presidency to the directly-elected Parliament.  I am concerned about the opportunities the Minister will have as President.  Those will be totally destroyed if what I have referred to is the level of Fianna Fáil's perception of the political groups in the European Parliament.  I say that with due respect to Deputy de Valera.</P>
      <P>My concern about this matter is not as a member of the smallest party in this House but as a participant of what will be the largest group in the European Parliament, a group which was able in the final analysis to deliver the votes to Senator Yeats in his bid for the Presidency of the Parliament.  This level of misrepresentation is not in the interests of Ireland.  The Minister and the Government have quite clearly stated in paragraph 68 that they are committed to the essential principles of the CAP.  The Socialist Group are also committed to it and always have been.  The author of the CAP is now a Senator in the French Parliament and a member of the European Parliament.  He was a former Agriculture Minister in the Gaullist administration in the early sixties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This side of the House know the origin of the CAP and the way it has evolved.  It took a long time to evolve it. Provided the essential principles are retained it is always open to adaptation, reinterpretation and relationship to new changes.  It was, by definition, changed when the first enlargement took place and will change in some shape or form when the second enlargement occurs.  I am concerned about the position the Minister will now have by being President in the next six months.  He has a potential to use that position to win the <Col N="2031" /> support of the European Parliament to increase the Regional Fund and the Social Fund in a way that he has, regretfully, been unable to do within the Council of Ministers.  As Deputy Richie Ryan indicated, the support for the Minister which will come from the Parliament will be endangered by that kind of nonsensical attack we have had.  The short-term party political requirements of a party under siege at the moment has, as publicised in that document allegedly in the interests of Ireland, will do more harm to the real interests of Ireland than anything else.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats did not refuse the votes of the Socialist Group when he was running for the Presidency of the European Parliament.  The members of the European Parliament have at all times recognised the position of Ireland and the contribution of Irish members.  The quality of the 15 southern Irish members who will be elected next Thursday and of the three Northern Ireland members who will be elected on the same day will continue to enhance the European Parliament.  The influence this party have had within the Socialist Group has been totally disproportionate to our numerical size at party level and at public representative level.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity of changing the actual influence of the directly-elected Parliament with the Council of Ministers by virtue of the Minister's Presidency.  While the political lie I have referred to may in the short term copper-fasten the votes of the majority party in this country it will in the long term do more harm to this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister's contribution was a long one and covered a very wide range. It has informed the House on the Government's attitude over a large range of issues.  He emphasised the relationship the Government will now have with the new Tory Government in Britain.  I am sure they will find the Tory Government very accommodating.  We sincerely wish that, when the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has become properly acquainted with the situation, a positive framework will emerge in the North of Ireland along the lines of the policy we have identified in <Col N="2032" /> the past and put forward, which our leader, Deputy Frank Cluskey, enunciated yet again in Killarney.  We share the Government's commitment to making the EEC institutions work, to make the EEC become something more than what it was originally created for.  We feel, because we opposed entry in 1972 on the grounds that it would not work as well as it was projected and because our projections were right in relation to such things as the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and industrial jobs, more qualified to criticise the EEC.  But that criticism is completely from within and completely committed, unlike our counterparts in the British Labour Party, to reforming and changing the thinking from within rather than sniping from the outside and having a dog-in-the-manger attitude to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his officials have a hard task ahead of them in the next six months.  I hope this Estimate will raise the necessary resources and that the questions I have raised and the criticisms I have made will be seen to have been made not only by a political opponent but by someone who shares with the Minister very similar objectives for the role of foreign affairs in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Síle de Valera Síle de Valera">

      <P>In support of this Estimate I want to talk about two specific elements which were raised this evening&mdash;one on the North and the other the implications for Ireland of the direct elections to the European Parliament. I will not be able to resist making some comment about Deputy Quinn's remarks about the position of the Labour Party in the Socialist grouping in the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the new British Prime Minister and said that she had asked for time to consider the position on the North.  I wonder if this is an excuse to hold off making any final decision, or is it an excuse to do nothing policy, or is it even an excuse to maintain the <i>status quo</i>?  These questions immediately come to mind when I hear of her asking for time to consider the position on the North.  If this is an excuse to maintain the <i>status quo</i> there is a real danger because the British Prime <Col N="2033" /> Minister's colleague, Mr. Airey Neave, shortly before his death, said that Britain's main interest in the North was that it was a military base.  That was the reason why Britain was interested in holding on to the Six Counties.  Here again we see the selfish British interests with regard to the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>There has been talk about a devolved Government.  I believe if that came about it would be nothing more than a back door to restore Stormont.  At this stage I would like to see active goodwill by the British Government, indeed a commitment, not just a showing of goodwill, to an ordered and phased withdrawal by the British military forces and a positive declaration of their interest in and their commitment to Irish unity.  That is what I hope to see.  If this is not done, what will be the position in the next 20 years? I believe the agony will still be prolonged or, it might even be worse than it is at present.</P>
    <P>Much reference has been made over the past few years to such terms as &ldquo;majority&rdquo; and &ldquo;minority&rdquo; within the Six Counties.  We must remember that we are talking about the Irish people as a whole and the majority of the Irish people look for an independent Thirty-two county republic.  Therefore, it is inaccurate, indeed untrue, to talk about a situation of a minority or a majority within a region, namely the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Mr. Humphrey Atkins and his statement on the legitimacy of a number of political aspirations.  I would like to see the British Secretary explain what he means by &ldquo;political aspirations&rdquo;.  Would it be to restore Stormont?  Perhaps it would be a much more positive step, even recognising the wrongs of Partition and bringing about a situation and assisting reunification?  May I suggest that the Minister press the British Secretary and the British Government to clarify and expand their attitudes and intentions towards a just solution to Partition? Anything else would be a sell out because when considering a solution we must consider the wishes, the aspirations and beliefs of the majority of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the RUC and <Col N="2034" /> H Block.  How could any section of society, whether a majority or a minority, hold allegiance to a force which has a reputation of brutality and ill-treatment or to a State whose prisoners, in a prison like H Block, were ill-treated?  This is one sure way of alienating any one section of a community.</P>
    <P>I come now to another very important facet, and this is of worldwide publicity with regard to the question of the North. We are under a grave obligation to put our case to all nations, and in particular to the United States of America, that great democracy of the west.  We all know the great help and support the USA has given Ireland throughout our history.  It is vital that we counter malicious propaganda which has been so skilfully perpetrated by the British news media, that we put the truth of the situation across at every given opportunity and establish that what the majority of the Irish people are looking for is an independent thirty-two county republic.</P>
    <P>This leads me to Ireland's forthcoming Presidency.  We will have a wonderful opportunity because both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be in positions of power. They will hold those positions for the next six months and will be able to put our case not just to members of the Nine but to the world at large.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something about the direct elections and their implications for Ireland.  These are the first direct elections of their kind.  They are historic elections.  It was necessary that such elections should come about because as a result of these elections the European Parliament will be a much more democratic body and will gain in influence. The Minister referred to the greater influence this Parliament would have because from now on it would have to be consulted much more simply because it had a direct mandate.</P>
    <P>It is also of vital importance that we maintain the balance between the European institutions and the national Parliaments. When we talk about the powers of the European Parliament we will have to be very careful where we thread.  If one looks for the extension of the powers of the European Parliament, the <Col N="2035" /> legislative power will have to come from somewhere else.  Where will it come from?  It will have to come either from the Oireachtas or from the Council of Ministers.  This issue has arisen over the past few weeks because there happens to be an election in the air, but that is not the only reason.  There is a much more sinister reason.  If you analyse the situation you will find that those who are pushing for greater powers for the European Parliament are in opposition in their national Parliaments.  These people might believe this is a backdoor to power.  Because they are not in power at home they are not in a position of power in the Council of Ministers.  They hope for a change to get this power.</P>
    <P>This question has come up a great deal in the past few weeks and will probably continue to crop up in the next few days.  For any change to come about with regard to the powers of the European Parliament it would need the support not just from Ireland but from the other eight member states and I believe that support is not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The function of those elected to the European Parliament will be to act as watch dogs for the people who elect them, to be able to channel back information about what is going on in Europe and to create a link between the national Parliament and the European Parliament. This link unfortunately has not been created to date but I feel that after the direct elections this should change.</P>
    <P>In regard to the regional policy, Brussels looks on Ireland as one clearly defined area.  Here again there will be a chance for the 18 members who will represent Ireland to work together for the good of Ireland not only on the regional policy&mdash;because we have very similar problems as is natural in one unit and one country&mdash;but I would hope it would not stop there and that full co-operation would begin to evolve on other matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn spoke of the Labour Party and its influence in the European Parliament, but one must be realistic.  It is all very well to say that the socialist grouping is a very powerful one since it has a very large number in the European Parliament, but when one realises that <Col N="2036" /> the Irish Labour Party represents only about 1 per cent within that grouping we can see how ineffective the say the Labour Party have.</P>

      <P>I must stress that the grouping to which the Irish Labour Party have allied themselves in the European Parliament is one which holds multinational interests and cannot therefore have the Irish interest to the forefront. That is why we have allied ourselves with the RPR and the Danish Progress Party because, while we are a small <Col N="2037" /> grouping, by that very fact we are a cohesive and unified one.

As we have seen, Deputy Quinn does not want to accept the policies or perhaps the outcome of the policies of the group to which he or his party belongs within Europe.  But I think it is about time, especially when coming up to the election, that they should face reality.</P>
      <P>I have stressed only two points in the Minister's Estimate, the position in the North and the implications of direct elections.  In conclusion, it is my ardent hope that the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government will find themselves making steady progress with the British Government towards bringing about a solution to the Irish question, namely to achieve a 32-county republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of taking part in this debate.  I pointed out to the Minister last year that I felt it was rather inconsistent to be referring at length to Northern Ireland under the aegis of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I think his Department and Ministry should be renamed and possibly referred to as the Ministry for Internal and External Affairs or Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Northern Ireland.  It is inconsistent to <Col N="2038" /> speak at length on Northern Ireland under the heading of &ldquo;Foreign Affairs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>However, I concur with most of what the Minister said on the Northern Ireland issue.  We welcome the fact that there is a strong and, we hope, stable Government in Britain and that as a result the lack of political will so evident under the previous Government will be replaced by some political initiatives shortly.  I would not feel as uncharitable as Deputy de Valera, who made some rather scathing remarks about the new Minister of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Atkins, and the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher.  It is only fair to give them an opportunity to formulate a policy and put it into operation.  It is far too soon to criticise them and we may lose their goodwill by being premature and expecting miracles overnight.  We look forward to an early statement and formulation of policy.</P>
      <P>In reference to Northern Ireland I wish to raise a point already mentioned at Question Time and never satisfactorily answered by the Minister&mdash;at least in my presence.  If possible, I should like the Minister to state the extent of our jurisdiction in regard to the waters around the Six-County coastline.  That specific question was asked recently by Deputy Blaney and he did not get a direct answer to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appreciate it if the Minister would clarify that matter.  We are probably the envy of most nations of the world in that we are entirely neutral, in that we have a democracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Most countries are either under a dictatorship or are bound to major states by means of military alliances. Ireland is rather unique in being entirely neutral and independent and free from any such tie.  As a result we are in a position to speak our minds freely and openly on matters of world concern.  But we do not use our privileged position in a proper manner.  We should speak more openly and more often.  We seem to be afraid of our shadow when it comes to referring to injustices on an international scale.  We should come to the defence of some of the underprivileged and crucified small nations and the minorities within certain countries who are enduring persecution.  We have opted out recently in regard to the executions in Iran.  I know we are under an obligation to Iran in that they supply about 14 per cent of our oil requirements, but we have a duty to object to the cruel and vindictive regime inflicting such hardship on former politicians and civil servants. We were quick to protest to the Government of Pakistan in regard to the death sentence on the former President, Mr. Bhutto, but we seem to hide behind the EEC banner and say we are making protests in private instead of publicly condemning acts being carried out against supporters of the former Government in Iran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might have taken some initiative in regard to Southern Rhodesia.  The Minister speaks of this situation in terms which he might just as readily have used one or two years ago.  The situation there has changed dramatically during the past three months and we should recognise that fact.  The Minister in his reply might state whether he has any new thinking on the matter.  We have received reports <Col N="2040" /> of the recent elections and the handing over of power from the white minority to the black majority under the premiership of Bishop Muzorewa.  We have a certain duty to give the incoming Government a chance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has referred to reports which have been received.  Does he mean that he has received them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to reports which have been carried by the media.  The official Government approach does not seem to have changed.  If it is true that 65 per cent of the population in Southern Rhodesia voted overwhelmingly in favour of the new regime, then we should recognise this fact.  If the new system is working, why not support it? If the figures published are not correct, I should like an explanation from the Minister of the situation as he sees it. This matter has implications not just for Southern Rhodesia.  This type of changeover could be adopted in other areas, such as South Africa, where there is a domineering white minority who have no intention whatsoever of surrendering power to the black majority.  If the present arrangements work in Southern Rhodesia we should recognise that fact and press for a similar transition from white minority to black majority Government in South Africa.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greece is to become the tenth member of the EEC, although full membership will not be formally granted until January 1981.  Spain and Portugal are now negotiating to join the Community. While the Regional Fund seems to be shrinking and there appears to be a lack of commitment on the part of the wealthier members to enlarge that fund, it does not seem to make good sense to invite countries to join the Community whose regions are greatly underprivileged. Many of the areas within these three countries would qualify for assistance from the Regional Fund and their combined population approaches 100,000,000.  The entry of these three countries to the Community must militate against our getting an increased <Col N="2041" /> share of the Regional Fund.  Perhaps there is a rational explanation as to why we should back the entry of these three countries.  It defies me at present because we seem to be cutting our own throats. Aid is not being increased for the existing underprivileged areas within the Community.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly put down questions to the Minister in recent months regarding claims on territory around our coasts.  The Minister has made reasonable attempts to answer these questions.  Because of our present energy and economic difficulties, these claims should be pressed with a great deal of urgency.  We must make every possible effort to find fuel, especially oil, off our shores as soon as possible.  It is not very wise to have protracted disputes with Britain regarding who owns territory off our coasts.  Such disputes should be settled as quickly as possible so that exploratory work can be carried on in an attempt to find mineral wealth and oil.  I specifically refer to the area off the south-east coast.  The Minister said in reply to a recent parliamentary question that he was making arrangements with his British counterpart to have a tribunal set up to delineate the exact areas involved for both countries.  I have also asked why there has not been a decision on who owns the territory around Rockall.  The Minister said he was seeking a third party to mediate in the dispute. These areas are likely to be rich in oil and it is in our interests that these disputes should be settled sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>I have never been very happy with the UN resolution passed in 1970 regarding the deep sea bed.  That resolution stated that the areas outside our jurisdiction are there for the good of all mankind.  It has emanated from more recent sessions of the Law of the Sea Conference that the landlocked countries are endeavouring to divide up these areas among themselves.  We would be selfish if we claimed these territories, but we have a right as a nation to fight for them.  I feel sure that the great powers, Russia, the US and China, will not settle for 150 or 250 miles.</P>
    <P>In reply to questions recently, the <Col N="2042" /> Minister said we are seeking jurisdiction over the outer limit of the Continental Shelf.  That is a reasonable claim, but will the major states be satisfied with similar claims?  I suspect that in the case of the Arctic or the White Sea, Russia will be looking for 500 miles or 1,000 miles, or the whole lot.  Therefore I advise the Minister to hold his fire, not to give any concessions on this point until he knows the attitudes of the major powers.  We would be foolish to give away millions of square miles in mid-Atlantic and then find the major powers refusing to give similar concessions to the landlocked countries.  If we do so our posterity will never forgive us for having made such a monumental mistake.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the lack of public concern here in regard to this matter because these sea areas comprise a much greater area than the entire land mass of Ireland.  With improvements in technology and exploration facilities, the seabed in these territories could be far richer in terms of oils and minerals than the same areas of land.  I hope the Minister will not sign away any of these rights at the Law of the Sea Conference until he has seen the overall position.</P>
    <P>In our search for oil I should like the Minister to tell us of the diplomatic approaches he is making abroad, particularly to countries which have not previously supplied us.  There have been reports about close relations with the Nigerian Government.  Have such new links been used to try to find fresh sources of oil supply?  Finland and China have been mentioned, but what about Venezuela, which is very rich in these resources, and Peru, which probably has greater resources than its home needs?</P>

He may remember that six months ago I asked on the Adjournment that an attempt be made to give aid to Irish centres in Britain which cater particularly for young emigrants.  This has become increasingly important since our rate of emigration began to rise again.  Young people of 15 and 16 years of age have been emigrating and they have no place to go, <Col N="2044" /> no jobs.  They are liable to fall into the wrong hands.  The centres in Britain have done tremendous work.</P>
