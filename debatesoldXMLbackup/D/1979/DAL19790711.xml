    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I sought permission to raise on the adjournment the question of the administration of the conservation grants which the Government introduced in relation to substitution of solid-fuel back boilers.  I was informed by your office that I could deal with the matter under section 5 of this Bill.  It is in that context that I am now raising the matter.  I have been contacted by a number of constituents over the last four weeks who told me quite clearly that when the Government announcement was made&mdash;it was not unrelated to the fact that the local and the European elections were taking place&mdash;that there would be, as the title of the GIS statement stated, a house improvement grant scheme and energy conservation.  When they sought clarification from the Department on this they were told they would be eligible for this grant.</P>
      <P>They went ahead and commissioned builders and contractors and got an estimate for this work.  They were subsequently told by the Department that they no longer qualified, because they had been in receipt of a grant within the last ten years.  I asked the Minister to clarify the situation last Wednesday.  The indications from the official channel then were that the matter should be properly dealt with on Committee Stage of this Bill.  We got to Committee Stage yesterday and, despite the request from Deputy Fitzpatrick, the Minister indicated that he was not yet in a position to clarify his scheme but that he would be making a statement within the next couple of days.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be doing it tomorrow since he said that yesterday. The Minister is pretty good at organising administrative schemes.  Will he be able to tell us tomorrow how this scheme he <Col N="1943" /> has designed will work?  Is it too much to ask him to bring the announcement of that forward by one day and tell us now how it will work since the Ceann Comhairle has ruled me out of order twice in trying to raise this matter on the adjournment?  The official White Paper that accompanied the GIS statement reads as follows:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Grants for conversion from oil to solid-fuel heating.</P>
      <P>A grant of up to £600 is available for the installation of a fireplace, stove or other solid-fuel burning appliance in a house which has not got one.  In determining the amount of the grant, the cost of installing a back boiler is taken into consideration.  A householder who has an oil-fired central heating system but no fireplace could qualify for this special grant, which is not subject to the normal limiting periods for further grants. If he is able to connect central heating radiators to a solid-fuel burning appliance, the Department will raise no objection but the cost of central heating connections and elements will not be allowed for grant purposes. Where a house has already a fireplace but no back-boiler, the cost of installing a back-boiler including plumbing connections will reckon for grant.</P>
      <P>That is the official Government information slip which I obtained.  If there is additional information which the Department have, which was issued at the same time, perhaps the Minister can clarify that for me.  There is, unfortunately, no date on the GIS statement that I have. As I already stated the title of the statement is House Improvement Grant Scheme and Energy Conservation.  The first paragraph states:</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment, Mr. Sylvester Barrett, T.D. is concerned that effective measures be taken to conserve energy in domestic housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose, as an Opposition Deputy, that one should be grateful that at least some of the noise we have been making <Col N="1944" /> on this side of the House penetrates to the other side of the House.  The second paragraph states:</P>
    <P>To this end, he has already laid down thermal insulation standards for local authority houses commenced on or after 1st July, 1976.  These standards will apply in full to new private houses in July, 1979.</P>
    <P>That is about three years overdue.  The statement continues:</P>
    <P>Where existing houses are concerned, the position is that under the house improvements grants scheme, a house on completion of the improvement work must be provided with adequate heating facilities, including a solid fuel fireplace.  The cost of providing these facilities, including a back-boiler, if one is being installed, is taken into account in calculating the amount of the grant.  Where a house has no solid fuel heating facilities and no other improvement work is required, a special grant is available for the installation of a fireplace or solid fuel burning appliance.  This special grant does not prevent a householder from getting a further improvement grant at any time.</P>
    <P>As a further contribution to energy conservation in existing private houses, the Minister has decided that a house, after completion of grant-aided improvement work, must comply with certain standards in regard to attic insulation, cylinder lagging and draught elimination.  The cost of these works will be reckonable in calculating the amount of the grant. This requirement will apply to work commenced on or after 1 April 1979.</P>
    <P>There is no date on this statement from the Government Information Service and when Deputy Fitzpatrick yesterday said it had been reported in the papers before 7 June, the Minister replied that the newspaper story was reported on 14 June.  When people rang the Department at the numbers 684169 and 684411&mdash;I believe there are three telephone extensions for the Dublin area in O'Connell Bridge House&mdash;the interpretation of that statement by officials in the Department was that first there would be a delay of <Col N="1945" /> six to nine weeks before an inspector could call and that the staff were completely snowed under in trying to cope with the applications which makes a nonsense of what the Minister said yesterday about a more efficient operation of the grant scheme from a centralised Department.  The real point at issue is this: the people who inquired if they would qualify for a grant despite the fact that their house was built within the past ten years or that they had received a general improvements grant, were told initially that they would qualify.  Then on last Friday week a directive appears to have come from Government sources saying the Government had changed their mind and that there was going to be a re-jig of the terms of the scheme.  The Minister would appear to confirm this by saying that he will be making a statement on the new terms of the scheme.</P>
    <P>This appears to me to imply two things.  First, it was an election gimmick that did not even have the merit of being properly thought out but which had at least the merit of being a good idea in terms of energy conservation and for that the Labour Party welcome it.  I am not party to the operation of administration in the Department and I can only put together the experiences of my constituents and people in the Dublin area, but it appears to me that somebody in the Department thought the scheme was a good idea but they did not work out the implications or the cost.  When the applications started to come in and when somebody calculated what it might cost, the Department appear to have backtracked.  That is the construction I am putting on the experiences of people who responded to the Government press release when they contacted the Department.  I was unable to raise this matter on the Adjournment and perhaps the Minister would give us a trailer of what he is going to say tomorrow in relation to the new terms.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1946" /> Deputy O'Brien and I raised this matter yesterday and Deputy O'Brien suggested that a ministerial announcement or advertisement had been made in connection with this matter.  The question arose as to whether such an advertisement appeared in the newspapers and, if so, the date on which it appeared.  The Minister was adamant that he did not cause any advertisement to be published in any newspaper but he said on more than one occasion that he answered parliamentary questions on the matter. The question then arose as to whether these parliamentary questions were before or after 7 June.  I have a very clear recollection that the Minister stated yesterday that he answered these questions in the House on 14 June.  Am I correct in that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The suggestion now is that the announcement made in regard to these grants has been changed and the Minister proposes to make what he calls a definitive statement on the matter tomorrow or the day after.  I repeat my invitation to him and I join with Deputy Quinn in the request that he would make that statement now so that we may have an opportunity of discussing the position on this section.  It is the least the country would expect from the Minister on an occasion like this.  I will check the Official Report for 13 June and will come back to that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister has not been able to make a statement.  Whether 13 or 14 June is the relevant date it is a month ago since the announcement was made and there is still considerable ambiguity whether the grant will be payable where a person had received a grant within a specified period.  The longer the delay the more anxiety will be caused and the more suspicious we become regarding embargos. <Col N="1948" /> The Minister has not given any indication of his views in relation either to the £1,000 grant or to the improvements grant during this debate.  He has a closed mind on the matter.  This is regrettable particularly when this legislation is to be operated in future by way of regulation.  Having regard to the extent of power that the Minister will have by reason of that situation, one would at least have expected him to give his views regarding the grants.  I understand that the Department of Finance would have the last word regarding the amounts of grants but we might at least have the views of the Minister for the Environment. Instead, he is dodging all the issues. The original statement from the Department gave a clear impression that the grant we are talking of here would be paid without there being any strings attached provided that it was for the type of work specified in the section.  Now, however, we hear that a couple of days must elapse before the Minister can give us the details.  In other words, he is not master of his own destiny but is awaiting instructions from elsewhere.  That is a disgraceful situation.  The Minister ought to be ashamed that he, as Minister, is not in a position to make a statement regarding this grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to clarify the position regarding accusations made last evening by Deputy O'Brien and repeated here today, but not by him, to the effect that this grant was an election gimmick.  I answered a parliamentary question regarding this grant on 13 June and my reply was reported in the press the following day. That was the first mention by me in this House of this grant and, consequently, I fail to understand how anyone could think that the grant could be related in any way to the elections which took place some days earlier.  This type of charge, therefore, can be seen for what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I said that within a couple of days I would announce details of these grants.  That promise stands and the announcement will be made within the shortest time possible and when the details are ready to be announced. Regardless of whether the announcement <Col N="1949" /> will be made in this House, in the Seanad, or in another place it will be made.  It may even be made during the course of the discussion on this Bill depending on how long we continue to debate the measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be made tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister entered this House in 1968 and he has been a Minister now for more than two years. Having regard to that background is he serious in saying that in respect of a scheme which he referred to first in this House on 13 June, he has not yet worked out the details?  Is it the position that a scheme was decided on, that valuable civil servants' time in the GIS was spent on the preparation of a press report in relation to that scheme but that the details are not known yet?  From what one might refer to as the half statements and half explanations and the teasing replies that we have had from the Minister, is it reasonable to deduce from what we have heard now on the penultimate day before the dramatic announcement of the details of this scheme, that the Minister still is not aware of what the scheme is about? Four weeks ago he used valuable GIS time for the preparation of a press statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I replied to a parliamentary question on this matter on 13 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about a matter that I was prevented from raising here on the last couple of occasions that I endeavoured to raise it.  On the first occasion that I attempted to raise the question of this conservation grant the Department denied that there was any such grant but I went down personally to the Department with the relevant press release.  What is at issue here is something far more important than an election gimmick.  What is at issue is the basic incompetence of the Minister and the Government.  What happened in effect was that after two years of inactivity regarding conservation in the building industry, the Minister said that something was being done in this area, <Col N="1950" /> that there would be a maximum grant of £600 and that this grant would not be related to the normal conditions applying to a grant whereby if a person had received a grant for improvements in the previous ten years he would not be eligible and also that if a person having obtained this conservation grant applied for another type of improvement grant within two years, he would not be disqualified from receiving that other grant. Four weeks later the Minister tells us that the details of the grant are not available yet but that they may be available tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make the announcement today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We would expect a better answer than that the Minister might make the announcement today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the Minister to meet some of the people who have been in touch with me about this grant or to take him to some of the harassed officials in the Department who have had to deal with telephone inquirers and to explain that what was said last week does not hold now and that the directive that came from the Government this week makes liars of the officials. People were told that they qualified for this grant but when they set about organising matters they were told that because they received a grant nine years ago for improvements they are not now eligible for this special energy conservation grant.  How much more incompetence must we accept from this Government with 84 seats before the public realise that the people hiding behind the benches opposite do not know their job?</P>
      <P>In a way I would be more reassured if the announcement had been an election gimmick because that would suggest some degree of cunning or administrative competence.  Through I might not agree with that I could at least be comfortable about it.  The Minister indicates now that he may tell us the details today despite the fact that half-an-hour ago he indicated that this would not be the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Chair. This legislation was circulated in late April or early May but was not brought forward until recently.  The provisions in regard to new house grants and improvement grants in this section, and in section 4 which we have just dealt with, relate to the terms under which regulations for these grants can be drawn up. Therefore we cannot discuss the specific schemes of grants currently in operation.</P>
      <P>By virtue of a decision of the Ceann Comhairle's office, we can discuss the specific grant scheme announced by the Minister through the GIS in June in a GIS statement which is not even dated. The House is now being asked to accept as normal competent Government administration that the Minister who introduces this grant scheme and puts facts and figures on paper still does not know how it works, and his Department do not know how it works.  People who have applied for this grant and who have looked for contractors are supposed to accept that this is a reasonable state of affairs, that this kind of bungling is a reasonable kind of Government activity and an acceptable level of performance by a Government with 84 seats in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to tell the House if the details of this scheme have <Col N="1952" /> been finalised.  If they have not been finalised and he is waiting until the Government meeting on Friday, fair enough.  We will accept that is the state of play, and he cannot give the House the information.  I accept that as something over which the Minister has no control, irrespective of his responsibility for announcing a scheme the details of which have not been worked out in advance.  If the details have yet to be finalised, and will not be finalised until the Government meeting tomorrow or on Friday, so be it.

    <P>The Minister is not showing sufficient respect for our democratic institutions if he refuses to make the announcement here, and seeks the refuge of the Leinster branch dinner of the CIF, or some other hospitable body who would be in a position to accord hospitality to him, in return for which he would dignify them by issuing a Government statement so that the occasion would be noted in the newspapers as a venue at which the Minister made an official announcement.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I have secured the Official Report of the debate on 13 June, the day on which the Minister answered this controversial question.  A number of supplementries were asked.  I asked the last supplementary because I had received a number of queries from constitutents of mine on this very topic.  As reported at column 238 of the Official Report I said:</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister to say that the grant is available for the purposes of converting from oil to solid fuel.  Is that correct?</P>
      <P>Mr. Barrett: Yes.</P>
      <P>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Without any regard to the age of the house or when a previous grant was paid?</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised a question in relation to a final supplementary question put by him to the Minister on 13 June to which the Minister replied that the grant was available to people irrespective of the fact that they may have been paid grants in the previous ten years.  I should like to know if, irrespective of the details the Minister intends announcing tomorrow, such people do not qualify for a grant? Can we deduce that much from the Minister's statement?  We are not accusing the Minister of deliberately misleading the House but we are saying that, for whatever reason, the answer given on 13 June to Deputy Fitzpatrick misled him and many other Deputies.  I <Col N="1956" /> am aware that it also misled a lot of young officials in the Department of the Environment.  Can we get confirmation to the effect that people who got a grant within the previous ten years do not qualify for the grant I am speaking of? Many of my constituents would like to know if they qualify for that grant.  Is the Minister in a position to say that for a variety of reasons, some of which we understand because we recognise that government is not easy, something which Fianna Fáil did not recognise in May 1977, the situation has changed and that those who got a grant within the previous ten years are not eligible for the grant announced by the Department recently?</P>

However, they would have had to wait a long time because, as officials of the Department stated, it would take up to nine weeks before inspectors could investigate applications. That is another indication of administrative overloading and incompetence. I regret that an official spokesperson for one of the three parties here has been misled.  Although the fact that the Government party have 84 seats may indicate that the Opposition do not have any rights we have certain rights.  I would have thought that a minimum right was to obtain a simple reply to what I considered to be a comparatively simple question.  I regret that a winner-take-all attitude here enables a Minister, backed up by 84 pairs of marching feet, to sit and tell us to wait and that he is not able to tell us anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The matter we are discussing arises out of a question asked by Deputy Collins and supplementaries to that question, as reported at columns 236 to 238 of the Official Report for that day.  In the course of that the Minister drilled out in the clearest detail that the <Col N="1957" /> grants were available.  He was questioned by Deputies E. Collins, Mitchell and myself about this matter and his mind was crystal clear that the grants were available.  He also stated that if a person has already two forms of central heating he would not qualify for a grant but he told us that the grants were available for a person who wished to convert from oil to solid fuel central heating, whether or not he got a grant before.  The Minister also stated that the grant would amount to a maximum of £600.  Why all the uncertainty now? Why is it necessary to clarify that?  If the Minister intends changing that, he should say so.  We are asking the Minister to confirm that, irrespective of what he intends announcing in his definitive statement, he intends standing over the statement he made on 13 June. I do not think any self-respecting Minister should come here and say that what he said on 13 June was his own imagination, his own wishful thinking and that he cannot now proceed with that.</P>

I should like to ask the Minister whether in the case of a person who is in poor circumstances a local authority is authorised to carry out repairs for that person to his private house.  I am aware of some people who live in their own homes on a hand-to-mouth basis and who are not in a position to carry out repairs.  In those cases a grant is not of <Col N="1958" /> much use.  Housing authorities should be authorised to carry out repairs in such cases.  Will the Minister tell us how it is proposed to work it and who will provide the money?  Will the Minister also deal with the question I raised about people who may want a toilet, for instance, repaired or installed but who cannot make any contribution?

Some people would not be able to get a contractor or to arrange for the repairs to be done even if they were given the cost of the repairs and in those cases the local authority should move in and do the repairs.  An old person could be living in a house worth a good few thousand pounds but because he is living from hand to mouth on social welfare benefits he would not be able to spend £50 on essential repairs.  It is difficult to get local authorities to do the work quickly.  It is a long drawn-out process and the Minister would be doing a charitable thing if he circularised local authorities with reference to this section and told them to operate it as it is intended to operate.</P>

I refer specifically to the refusal of a grant of £600 in relation to the construction of an extension which cost £2,130.  I will give the Minister details later on.  The specification for the construction of a single storey extension at the rere was 11 inch cavity walling, <Col N="1961" /> concrete flooring and three layers of mineral felt on a flat roof, and Beauty Board as a lining to the internal walls was not allowed and must be removed.

      <P>I want to say a few words about grants for the housing of elderly people, most of which are channelled through local authorities.  We should examine this whole area.  A couple of voluntary housing bodies have developed housing for elderly people. <Col N="1962" /> But more people could be so encouraged if all of the grants and assistance were made more attractive and publicised.  If an elderly person cannot get a local authority apartment they are then subjected to the market forces outside and very often forced to pay very high rents, and of course they are in receipt of an old age pension only.  The Minister should examine the private sector in this respect to ascertain whether or not there could be some means of subsidising such housing.  It may not be his Department that would be involved, but since we are talking about grants for the housing of elderly people, where people are living in private accommodation some way should be investigated of subsidising them, be it by way of rent subsidy or otherwise.  They are very vulnerable, helpless people in lots of ways if a local authority cannot provide housing for them.</P>
      <P>Some hostels in this city have been the homes of many elderly people for very many years.  The whole area of grants for these people should be examined taking into account where they are residing and endeavouring to uplift the standard of their accommodation.  We do not seem to take this matter very seriously. A number of such hostels in this city are doing a great job, but because of financial constraints on them they are being run down, thereby not providing the type of accommodation or service elderly people require and to which they are entitled.  I would appeal to the Minister to be generous in this area, first of all, in encouraging voluntary bodies to provide housing for these people, with greater drive being shown by him through the local authorities to build more.  In the last administration that was done and it is important that it be continued.  There are many elderly people living in very poor conditions and paying high rents they cannot afford.</P>
      <P>Reverting to the hostel situation it is important that we be generous with grants to ensure that the living standards there and the services provided are of a high quality.  Generally these hostels provide housing for men.  If such grants were made available it would render their accommodation so much more satisfactory.</P>

      <P>A vastly improved scheme for elderly people and for voluntary bodies involved in their housing was initiated recently&mdash;improved grants, £1,000 grants and, for the first time, loans being made available as well as various subsidies.  Therefore, there has been a much more generous scheme available to such voluntary bodies in recent months.  It has been made the business of local authorities to operate these schemes, not the Department; the local authorities are the bodies responsible. That package was received very well by all of the bodies concerned and considered to be a vast improvement on what had obtained heretofore.</P>

      <P>I know that grants for hostels are being administered by local authorities.  But these local authorities have financial restraints placed on them and they must refer back to the Department to know what they should do.  It all reverts to a matter of £sd.  While the package is reasonably generous, in a lot of ways it does not go far enough. However, I suppose one can never go far enough in the area of housing of elderly people or in doing things for them.  I believe we are not doing enough.  In this respect we should be genuine and give generous grants to hostels in Dublin, all of which are in need of a major facelift and refurbishing.  But that cannot be done because the finance is not available.  If we did so we would have done a good job, retaining a particular type of housing stock for a certain sector of the community.  Only a couple of years ago one of the major hostels in this city threatened to close down, putting up to 300 people out on the street overnight. Fortunately a grant was forthcoming but it is one given on a day-to-day basis only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should prefer to see a positive, long-term policy in this respect so that these hostels could be rendered places in which men are proud to live rather than being considered somewhere with less than an ordinary standard of living. Great credit is due to the people who run these hostels.  They are fantastic, dedicated people.  We are fortunate to have them but they are not getting the back-up service they need.  The amount <Col N="1964" /> of money involved here would be substantial and not merely that necessary for keeping them going on a day-to-day basis.  I want to see these places completely refurbished, with proper living accommodation and cooking facilities being provided, having also areas to which men can retire, relax in, have discussions and which generally can be regarded as a home rather than an institution.</P>

The type of grant being paid at present is on a day-to-day running basis.  I should like to see a grant being paid for the purposes of refurbishing, rendering such places more comfortable and liveable, requiring more financial aid than has been forthcoming to date.

The grant would be to improve the housing stock in the hostel which would be the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10a:</P>
      <P>In page 7, after line 4, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  A housing authority may, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, make a loan to a person under the age of 21 and at least 18 years of age purchasing a house or carrying out improvements to a house.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The background of this amendment is in response to a constituency representation in which a number of young people applied to Dublin Corporation for SDA loans or low rise mortgage loans but because they were under the legal age of 21 they were not eligible to get a loan.  I inquired from the housing officials in Dublin Corporation and they clearly indicated that they were bound legally by the majority laws that relate to contracts and the signing of contracts by minors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if this amendment is acceptable to the Minister or the Department, but it will not involve any additional expenditure as such.  As we have lowered the voting age from 21 to 18, we might amend other legislation to lower the legal age to 18.  A large number of people are discriminated against when <Col N="1966" /> they go to a local authority for a loan.  I do not know what the position is in relation to building societies.  The Minister might tell us if this amendment would be extended to building society loans.  I am dealing specifically with SDA loans and low rise mortgage loans.</P>
    <P>We have a very young population, which will increase in the years to come. The marriage rate for young people is increasing. I know of a number of young people who got engaged and want to get married but cannot get a loan.  They then decide either to spend their savings on a holiday, because there is not much point in saving for three or four years, or they decide not to buy a house but to rent a flat.</P>
    <P>This is a simple proposal.  I looked through the Bill to see which section would be the most appropriate for this amendment.  This seemed to be the most appropriate section, although it is described as dealing with loans by housing authorities to improve houses.  My amendment says that a housing authority may, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, make a loan to a person under the age of 21 and at least 18 years of age purchasing a house or carrying out improvements to a house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is tied in with the overall position of minors&mdash; namely, persons under the age of 21 years&mdash;under the law relating to contracts. I will try to explain briefly. Generally speaking, a minor may be a party to a contract but at any time he may repudiate the contract.  If a minor mortgaged a property to the local authority, for instance, and the authority made a loan to the minor on the security of that mortgage, should the authority wish to repossess the property in the event of default in repayments by the minor or otherwise, he could simply repudiate the mortgage contract and the council would be left without any security for their loan or any effective means of recovering the loan.  This type of situation would not be satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions whereby a person who was party to a contract as a minor may repudiate the contract at any time are <Col N="1967" /> enshrined in our legislation, primarily for the protection of minors, that is, to prevent unfair advantage being taken of persons of immature years.  It is unfortunate that a person who may be quite responsible and of good earning ability should be hindered from entering certain desirable contracts by provisions which are intended for his protection.  The only exception to this general rule is that a contract for necessaries may be enforceable against a minor.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, at the request of the Attorney General, have carried out research into the law relating to the age of majority and have published a working paper and proposals to reduce the age of majority to 18 years.  Copies of these documents have been published and widely circulated and the commission are awaiting observations on them.  Pending action in regard to these proposals, the present position is that local authorities, like all mortgage lending agencies, are generally unwilling to accept a loan application from a minor unless he was within, say, a few months of reaching the age of 21 years.  Furthermore, where a lending agency accepted a loan application from such a person and approved the loan, it could only be done on the strict understanding that the purchase of the house in question and the completion of the mortgage would not be effected until the person had reached the age of majority. The amendment of the law contained in the proposals of the Law Reform Commission will meet the objectives Deputy Quinn is aiming to achieve and his amendment would not.  Legislation to rectify this position is now being considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is noncontentious and I appreciate the Minister's reply.  In the interim period before the Law Reform Commission's proposals are turned into legislation does the Minister see any way the position can be changed so that young people aged 18 and over who apply for an SDA or low mortgage loan can be accommodated by the local authorities?  If the Minister accepts that a local authority <Col N="1968" /> can sign on in principle an application from a young couple, indicate that they would pay rent on a mortgage for the first three years and that when they come to their majority they sign the contract and it can become legal&mdash;therefore meeting the requirements pending the reform of the majority legislation&mdash;then perhaps the Minister could indicate this by way of circular to the local authorities.  There may be some other way to go about it.  My objective is clear. It could take up to three or four years before the necessary legislation is effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It could.  Perhaps we cannot amend the contract law in this thing and anyhow that would not be the way to do it if major reform legislation is coming through.  There may be some administrative procedure that would enable the local authority to get over this problem.  One suggestion I made to the law agent was that one of the parents of the couple undertook the mortgage contract for a period of three years, the maximum period, and when the person came to the age of majority the contract reverted back to him.  That, I understand, was applied in County Meath.  It seems to suggest that there would be double stamp duty and all sorts of other things.  It is an administrative problem of which the law makes nonsense at the moment because of the majority age.  If there are any suggestions as to how the objective can be attained I will withdraw the amendment on those grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This difficulty arises because the age of majority still remains at 21 years and, of course, that is entirely outdated.  The Succession Act, 1965, provides that a person of 18 can make a will and a subsequent measure conferred the vote in general elections and local elections on people of 18.  I think a constitutional amendment was necessary to do that.  I know about the report of the Law Reform Commission and the recommendation that the age be reduced to 18.  There should be no delay in implementing that recommendation.  It is <Col N="1969" /> universally accepted that young people are maturing earlier, working earlier, and marrying earlier, and therefore, require houses earlier.  They are purchasing expensive items such as motor cars and houses and they should be able to enter into a contract.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that there is only one exception to the rule that an infant is not bound by a contract and that is in the case of a supply of necessaries. Speaking entirely from memory, I think there is another exception and that is if the contract is held to be for the benefit of the minor or infant.  I speak subject to correction in that but I think I am right. If that is right, purchase of a house could even be deemed to be a necessary and it could also be deemed to be for the benefit of the minor.  A simple change in the law&mdash;it would be a piecemeal change in advance of the reduction of the age of majority from 21 to 18&mdash;a simple, one-section amendment deeming the purchase of a house to be a necessary or deeming a contract for the purchase of a house to be for the infant's benefit, would get over the difficulty, would bind the infant, as we call him, and would safeguard the lending authority.  There is also the administrative suggestion by Deputy Quinn whereby the house purchaser would be the tenant of the local authority for three years at a sum the equivalent of the repayment of the loan and at the end of three years he would have the option of purchasing the house and would get benefit for the instalments paid over the three years.  The argument against that might be that if he did not pay the instalments they could not be recovered from him.  If he were married a house would be a necessity and any court would hold that a house is a necessary for a person who is married. I agree with Deputy Quinn that this should not be put on the long finger even for two or three years.  It should be dealt with immediately if there is a solution to it.  I am satisfied that the law could be changed by even an amendment of this Bill for housing purposes.  The long title would justify it.  It says:</P>
      <P>An Act to amend and extend the Housing Acts, 1966 to 1970, and to provide for certain other matters in relation to housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1970" /> That long title is adequate to amend the law and we could either state baldly that a person can enter into a contract to mortgage a house at the age of 18 and that is all we have to say, or we could use one of the other devices saying that the purchase or mortgage of a house would seem to be a necessary or is deemed to be for the infant's benefit.  I support Deputy Quinn's amendment and suggest that the Minister have a look at it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the heading &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;, I understand that one local authority operate for people under 21 under that heading as a necessity of life.  I am not familiar with the other provision on which the Deputy referred to about it being deemed for the benefit of the person.  It is quite possible that in the event of it being tested the loan under that heading may be found to be valid and recoverable if necessary, but there is no experience of it.</P>
      <P>When this Bill becomes law I will certainly bring to the notice of local authorities the question of whether it should be dealt with under the heading of necessity or necessary.  I will also bring to the attention of the Law Reform Commission without delay what has been said here by Deputies with a view to trying to get any changes in the law brought forward.</P>

      <P>The fact that one authority are doing it sets a precedent and that is important.  The Minister should look at this precedent.  Local authorities will tend to take the easy way out in the sense that normally it is not done and there may be a risk in recovering the loan if repayments are not made. There may be some risk, but, given the size of the problem, it would not be too great and a calculated risk is worth the taking.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, people now have the vote at 18.  They are putting us into this House and putting people on to local authorities but when they seek local authority SDA loans they cannot obtain them.  There is an anomaly here.  I know that the Minister is sympathetic and I ask him to have a look at this and see what can be done.  If something can be done I hope he will instruct local authorities forthwith to implement this where possible. I do not think that the demand is astronomical but even a small demand should be fulfilled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Minister has undertaken to communicate with the housing authorities when this Bill becomes law and to draw their attention to the possibility of their treating a house as a necessity.  I do not think that will work because the decision will ultimately lie with the county manager and he will have to make up his mind whether a house is a necessity or not.  He will have regard to the fact that an auditor will examine the accounts and if a minor were in default the auditor might say that the loan should not have been given and that a surcharge will be imposed.  The county manager will err in many cases on the side of security and safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should reframe this amendment and insert a simple section providing that a contract by an infant for the purchase or mortgage of a house shall be <Col N="1972" /> deemed a necessity.  That would remove from the housing authority the possibility of surcharge but they would continue to act with prudence and treat each case on its merits.  It would not oblige them to give a grant to a young person of 18 if he were not otherwise reasonably creditworthy and responsible. The Minister has said that one local authority have got over the difficulty by treating housing as a necessity and operating in that way.  That is a precedent established by a broad-minded county manager who believes in giving as much as he can under the regulations. Some other believe in withholding as much as they can.  If we free housing authorities from the possibility of surcharges it will operate perfectly.  On Report Stage we should insert a provision such as I have outlined.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (7), line 55, to delete &ldquo;the sum of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to amend the definition of ownership in the section. Section 8 enables housing authorities to grant loans to householders for the improvement of their houses.  The present level of the loan is only £2,500 and we will discuss that later.  The loans are usually secured by a mortgage on the house which is being improved.  It is stated that the housing authority may secure the loan on the ownership of the house or by vesting the ownership in the housing authority.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (7) states:</P>
      <P>In this section &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; means such interest or combination of interests in a house as constitutes either a fee simple interest in possession or a leasehold interest (including fee farm grant) in possession of such number of years unexpired at the date on which the loan under this section in respect of the house is authorised by the housing authority as is equal to or greater than the sum of the term fixed for the repayment of the loan and fifteen years.</P>
      <P>In simple language this means that a person cannot get a loan on the ownership of a house if it is a leasehold unless, if the repayment is 25 years, he has a lease for 40 years, or, if the repayment period is 20 years, he has a lease unexpired for 35 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is unreasonable in respect of an improvement loan.  My amendment proposes that he should be entitled to a loan if the unexpired term of his lease equals the term of years over which the loan is to be repaid.  If that man applies for a loan of £2,500 which is to be repaid over 20 years and he has an unexpired lease of 20 years or greater, he <Col N="1975" /> should get the loan.  If he applies for a loan which is to be repaid over 25 years and he has an unexpired lease of 25 years or greater, he should get the loan. The term of years specified in section 8 (7) is too long and is not reasonable in the case of a loan for improvement works.</P>
    <P>Surely the local authority would be adequately safeguarded with a lease which would extend over the term of the repayment of the loan?  In most cases the lease would be renewed.  If it was not renewed it would fall to the owner in fee simple, who would then have a very valuable asset.  Perhaps liability could be placed on him.  If that could not be done and if the applicant for the loan is otherwise creditworthy the amount could be recovered from him during his term of occupancy.  I would like to hear the Minister on this because I believe that the added 15 years is unnecessary and far too long.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The loan at the moment is £2,500.  It can be changed by regulation. I hope the Minister intends increasing it considerably because £2,500 will go very little way at the moment towards repairing a house if the repairs are substantial. I know of a case at the moment where the applicant got a loan from the county council of £2,500 and he had to go to the bank to borrow more.  It is in the national interest that houses should be repaired and that existing stocks are <Col N="1976" /> preserved as long as possible.  The best way of ensuring that is to make money readily available for repairs at reasonable interest.</P>
      <P>The means test is written into this.  It is fairly rigid.  The amount of the loan and the ceiling for the means test should be increased, because I cannot too strongly recommend the necessity for repairing houses.  New houses are necessary because old houses are allowed to deteriorate long before the end of their expectation of life has been reached.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, the loans are totally inadequate. We must retain our housing stock.  We should look at grants and loans for people who want to convert their houses.  This will increase our housing stock.  Substantial grants and loans should be given for this work.  A sum of £2,500 is very little for repair work today and deters people from doing repairs and improvement work to their houses.</P>
      <P>We should not have any means test in relation to loans for improvement work to houses.  It is most important to encourage people to improve their property.  We see property, particularly in cities and urban areas, becoming more and more dilapidated because there are not incentives for people to improve their property.  The amount of the loan should at least be doubled and the means test should be abolished in relation to repairs to houses.  It is in the interest of the Department that housing stock is kept in good order.  On the Continent people get tax concessions for improving their property.</P>

I am sure the Minister will accept that £2,500 today is not sufficient.  The means test makes it so prohibitive that people are not qualifying for the loan.  The Minister should abolish the means test in this area and improve the loan by at least £5,000. This is not a substantial sum for any kind of home repairs or improvement works.  The Minister has only to walk around the city to see the amount of dilapidation there is because his Department and local authorities are not prepared to face up to their responsibility of making it worthwhile for people to do the necessary improvements to their property.</P>

      <P>Does that now mean, in conjunction with section 5 and section 14, that the Minister can draw up a scheme to enable people who are tenants of a rent controlled property in the inner city area of Dublin and other cities to qualify for a loan, that under that rehabilitation scheme for certain inner city areas people who have an ownership, as defined in subsection (7), which gives them a leasehold would qualify for a loan plus whatever special rehabilitation grants there might be on the basis that their ownership of the property was sufficiently secure to get the loan?  If it does not mean that, we can throw our hat at making loans <Col N="1978" /> available for inner city rehabilitation programmes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>A grant can be given to the owner of a house or to the tenant with the consent of the landlord.  In addition to the £2,500 secured loan, there is an unsecured loan up to £600.  I appreciate it would not do much, but it is there.  With regard to the limitation of £2,500 and the income limit, it is only a coincidence that it happens to be the same income limit as for the SDA loan. It does not have to remain tied to this definitely.</P>
      <P>This Bill makes it possible by regulation to change the amount of loan and the income limit from time to time.  I appreciate the points made about the necessity to save the existing housing stock throughout the country, particularly in the larger towns and in the cities.  This is under active review at the moment with a view to considering the possibility of improving the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one system that operated for some time which might be more acceptable to the Minister and to the Deputies who have spoken on this matter, namely, that, instead of an income limit being set, the loan or grant is payable on the basis of the rateable valuation of the house.  The only reason for an income limit is to allow the Government to control the total amount of money drawn by way of loan. Nevertheless, the point made by Deputy O'Brien and others is a valid one.  It might be more acceptable to the Minister if he would consider setting a limitation for loans for reconstruction purpose on houses with a rateable valuation of £40 or less.  In that way the vast bulk of houses that people would seek to extend or improve would be covered irrespective of the income of the owner or tenant.  It would be regarded as more equitable and designed to improve the housing stock in a sector where it is most needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point made by Deputy Boland but since <Col N="1979" /> derating the valuation is not really as relevant as it was in the past.  I agree there are still valuations but they have not the same relevance as in the past. However, the Deputy's suggestion is something that will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Section 8 (2) (b) provides that a form of security may be by way of a charging order, charging the house under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, with repayment of the loan together with the interest.  The point I want to make is that there can be quite unreasonable delays in regard to this matter.  Some law agents will not clear the title or authorise payment of the loan until registration has been completed in the Land Registry.  I think that is unreasonable. Once the deed of charge is signed and is handed to the law agent, once he is satisfied it is in order and lodges it in the Land Registry, he should clear the loan for payment.  Some law agents do this, but some do not.  Where they do not, there can be a delay of up to six months.</P>
      <P>The situation is even worse in the case of a new house.  Very often the site has to be subdivided in the Land Commission, a new folio has to be opened in the Land Registry and this takes a long time.  Once the documents are accepted in the Land Registry the law agent should be encouraged to clear the title.  I suggest that the Minister and his Department take up this matter with the housing authorities in order to get some uniformity on the matter and to have it expedited.</P>
      <P>In the recent past Deputies had an opportunity of inspecting nearly all the houses in the country.  In some local authority housing estates some of the houses have been bought by the tenants, they have been reconstructed and they are like little palaces.  There are other houses that are not reconstructed and one would not think the houses were in the same country never mind the same estate.  Anything we can do to encourage local authorities or private individuals to reconstruct their houses should be done. It would be money well spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if the Minister had an opportunity to reply to the question I raised with regard to inner city rehabilitation and actual ownership. With regard to grants, the Minister indicated something that perhaps is potentially disturbing in relation to people who own or occupy a house that has been in the family for one and a half generations, where the landlord derives less income from it than what used to be the cost of the rates and where the rent is infrequently collected.  There are a number of such houses in my constituency. In those instances it is quite probable that the consent of the landlord for a grant would not be obtained.</P>
      <P>We are talking now about the framework within which this Minister and any subsequent Minister can draw up a scheme for inner city rehabilitation which would be a combination of planning by the local authority and a scheme of grants and loans.  Here we are dealing with loans.  The Minister introduced the question of grants.  I would be very concerned that the consent of the landlord would be required as a qualification by the tenant in respect of a grant application. We cannot realistically aim at financing inner city rehabilitation by direct grants exclusively.  Some system of loan and repayment is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, under subsection (7), the definition of ownership is constructed legally so as to exclude people who hold title to property on the basis that they have occupied it for many years, that it is a rent-controlled property and that their rights of succession are secure in the normal way, then these people may not qualify for a loan under this section, and a programme of inner city rehabilitation in the area that I am familiar with&mdash;Dublin <Col N="1981" /> south-east&mdash;will never get off the ground.  The matter involved is legal and technical and may require certain consideration by the Minister and his officials but perhaps he would indicate whether he would be prepared to consider the point and to comment on it on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point regarding the issuing of loans and that is that very often people extend their houses and either do not seek or are exempted from having to seek planning permission by virtue of the size of the extension but subsequently if they try to sell the house a potential purchaser's solicitor may seek evidence of the issuing of planning permission in respect of the extension.  The person selling the house is then obliged to seek permission for the retention of the extension.  In some local authority areas there is a system whereby building bye-laws permission is necessary for additions or extensions. This system operates in Dublin, in Cork and in one or two other local authority areas.  While it is possible for a person to succeed in obtaining planning permission for the retention of an extension it is not possible for one to succeed regarding permission in respect of building bye-laws approval for a structure already completed.  This is because of the condition whereby it is necessary in respect of bye-laws approval that building control inspections be carried out at the various stages of the construction work.  This is to ensure that proper materials and standards are maintained.  In these circumstances it would be useful if the Minister would include in any regulations a requirement to the effect that wherever necessary building bye-laws permission is issued in respect of any extension for which a loan application is being made.</P>
      <P>On the more general basis it would be useful, too, if the Minister would draw the attention of the public to the fact that in those local authority areas where building bye-laws approval is necessary, approval should always be obtained even in respect of extensions that would be exempt.</P>

      <P>If, say, a person wishes to build an extension that is less than 190 square feet in area, he would not have to apply for planning permission and, consequently, it might not occur to him that he should apply for building bye-laws approval.  Consequently, the construction work is completed without any reference being made to the local authority but subsequently the person concerned may seek building bye-laws approval in order to be able to sell the house as reconstructed.  The point is that the local authority are not then in a position to give their approval because the necessary inspections have not been carried out and one of these inspections takes place at the foundation stage.  Obviously, it would not be possible to carry out that inspection after the building had been completed.</P>

      <P>Permission is not necessary in respect of the £600 unsecured loan but in respect of a local authority loan of up to £2,500, naturally some form of security would be sought regarding the recovery of the amount, should that be necessary.

      <P>I am not talking about any existing scheme of grants.  I am talking about a future scheme of grants to which a number of people in this House would be committed.  Would the Minister look at this question and see if under subsection (2) of section 8 some future Minister or the present Minister could devise a scheme whereby people who have rent controlled properties would be able to get a mortgage from a local authority and the local authority would be able to take a lien on the property to secure the mortgage?  I am not familiar with how this could be best done legally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the definition of ownership is not checked so as to secure a local authority <Col N="1985" /> in doing that, any subsequent strategy we may devise collectively for inner-city rehabilitation could fall flat on its face in large sections of Dublin city.  The nature of occupancy of the houses which badly need repair is such that the landlord and the tenant are governed by rent control legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Deputy Quinn has raised a very important point which needs attention. There are many houses in the city of Dublin and throughout the country which have been held by tenants for long numbers of years as weekly tenants. They have acquired the protection of the Rent Restrictions Acts and they are controlled. The landlords cannot acquire possession of them.  The rents are small. These people would not qualify for loans under this section other than the paltry £600 by way of an unsecured loan which, as the Minister says, would not do very much.</P>
      <P>The securities outlined in subsection (2) on which a local authority can lend money are: (a) an instrument vesting the ownership of the house in the housing authority, (b) a charging order under the Registration of Title Act, (c) a deposit with the housing authority of the land certificate, and (d) a second mortgage. All those presuppose the ownership of at least an unexpired lease equal to the terms for the repayment of the loan.  I thank the Minister for cutting out the 15 years.  If a person has a weekly tenancy only, notwithstanding the fact that he has the protection of the Rent Restrictions Acts and cannot be ejected from the house, he will not qualify for a loan other than an unsecured loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that there is no provision for a guarantee.  The Minister might consider adding a qualifying paragraph (e) to subsection (2) and providing that the local authority could make a loan on a satisfactory guarantee by an acceptable guarantor.  That is accepted in many other walks of life and I do not see why it could not be accepted here.  Alternatively he could confer on the local authority the right to charge the fee simple interest in the house if they were satisfied the tenant had the benefit of the <Col N="1986" /> Rent Restrictions Acts and could not be evicted.</P>
    <P>That was suggested by Deputy Quinn. It is a good suggestion.  It could be operated if this Bill were suitably amended by giving the local authority the right to give the loan and they would see that the loan was applied to repairing or improving the house.  That would be adequate security for the local authority because they could follow the fee simple interest in the house.  Notice might have to be given to the landlord.</P>
    <P>This amendment would take some thought and some consideration.  It shows the inadvisability of rushing legislation through the House.  When an amendment like this is proposed hands are thrown up and we are told this Department and that Department would have to be consulted and that would take far too long.  Ultimately that leads to bad legislation.  The houses Deputy Quinn is talking about are houses in which people have acquired the benefit of the Rent Restrictions Acts.  They are also houses on which the landlords are not prepared to spend a penny.  Because of the nature of the tenancy or the nature of the ownership the tenants are not prepared to spend a penny with the result that the houses deteriorate and run down until they are acquired by some enterprising building contractor in the hope that he may clear the site and build an office block or something else.</P>
    <P>We should do everything we can in a Bill like this to preserve these houses. Unless something such as that suggested by Deputy Quinn is done, they will continue to deteriorate.  The landlord does not think it is in his interest to improve them and the tenant has not the money or the security to improve them.  This should be attended to when a Bill like this is going through the House.  It will be years before another Bill like this is put through the House.</P>
    <P>This shows all too clearly the inadvisability of bringing a Bill like this before the House at a time when it has to be rushed through it.  If the Minister were to accept the amendment or the spirit of the amendment, he would have to get working on it, and it would have to go to the Attorney General or some other <Col N="1987" /> legal person for advice.  I heard whispers around the House that the Minister might not complete this Bill now.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I do not mind whether he does.  It would be a pity if the Bill were to be less effective because it is being rushed through.  We know that when it goes to the Seanad it will not be amended there because the golden rule at this time of the year is that the Seanad are wasting their time making amendments which must come back to the Dáil and the Dáil will not be recalled.  That is the sort of farce we are engaged in at the moment.  Whatever amendments are made here are all right because they can be cleared in the Seanad.  If amendments were made in the Seanad the week after next when the Dáil will possibly have risen, it is unlikely that the Government would be anxious to recall the Dáil to ratify the Seanad amendments.  That is not doing the country's business as it should be done.  It is not good enough.  It goes on at this time of the year, year after year.  The suggestion made by Deputy Quinn is worthy of consideration. I hope the Minister will incorporate it in the Bill on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I agree that Deputy Quinn's suggestion is worthy of consideration. The question of time comes into it.  A more effective and quicker way of dealing with the type of problem Deputy Quinn mentioned would be by way of regulation&mdash;which can be done in this Bill&mdash;governing the increased amounts of unsecured loans for specific houses or areas perhaps.  It could be done under this, and we would not have all this paraphernalia about charges and so forth.  That would be far quicker and a more effective way to get over the problem for specific houses and areas.  It is something I will consider when the legislation goes through.  The other way would be far more complicated, because we would still have to put a charge on title and all that sort of thing.</P>

      <P>The unsecured loan is a good way out of it.  Where people are living in rent-restricted houses they are not always on good terms with the owner of the house who would want them out of it so as to be able to make more money.  It is very hard to get agreement about the tenant getting some sort of security from the owner.  It would be useless to talk about grants and loans here unless we could give an unsecured loan which would amount to what a secure loan would amount to.  The unsecured loan should only be given in certain circumstances where the local authority or the Department are satisfied that the person in rented property cannot get the type of security required from the owner of the house.  If that were the case, the property we are trying to preserve would be preserved.  Deputy Fitzpatrick says that at present the unsecured loan amounts to about a quarter of the ordinary loan which makes it of no consequence.  If we are giving it, it should be the same as the ordinary loan. That should not create any problem.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The object of this whole exercise is to make it possible for people either to build their own houses or to ensure that the local authority builds houses for them.  Although section 9 is short it is one of the most important sections. It deals with the provision of sites for private houses by private people.  It authorises the local authority to provide sites for private houses and to sell these sites to house builders, and it authorises the Minister to pay subsidies to housing authorities who engage in providing these sites.  We all know that one of the major contributors to the increased price of houses is the cost of sites and until we do something to make sites available to house builders at reasonable prices the price of houses will continue to soar.  It will be beyond the capacity of the ordinary householder to pay for them, and <Col N="1989" /> the dream enshrined in the Fianna Fáil manifesto of making it easier to own ones house will be gone, like the snow that fell last year.</P>
      <P>In many parts of the country apart from Dublin sites are costing £6,000 and in many cases they have no sewerage or water facilities.  If a person buys an unserviced site for £6,000 it would probably cost him another £2,000 to install water and sewerage facilities.  It is not difficult to understand why house prices have reached such a height.  When local authorities acquire from 20 to 100 acres of land it lies there for a number of years, they then develop the sites and proceed to sell them on a commercial basis.  That does not solve any problem. This land should be made available to house builders at nothing more than the cost of the land and the cost of developing it by the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): They should not be allowed to do so.  They should be told to sell it at no more than the cost of the land to them.  In that way they could help to keep down the price of other sites in the locality and would be doing something to control house prices.  As long as the price of sites continues to soar the price of houses will continue to soar. Agricultural land has become more valuable and land around towns becomes extremely expensive when sold out in single sites.  If a local authority acquires farm land and develops sites and provides sewerage and water facilities, the sites should be sold at a reasonable price.  In some cases sites are fetching £6,000 or more and that is inexcusable. Instead of helping to decrease inflation they are increasing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Kenny Report has been lying in the Custom House since before the Coalition Government came to office and it is still there.  I suppose it will be there when we come back.  Even if something is not going to be done about the Kenny Report we have a golden opportunity on this section to do something if sites are subsidised by the <Col N="1990" /> Department.  Local authorities should be given generous financial support.  What have the Government been doing to bring down the price of houses since they took office?  We had an argument yesterday as to whether the cost of houses went from £11,000 to £22,000 since the Government came into office or whether they went from £12,000 or £14,000 to £22,000, but does it matter a lot?  Is the increase in either case not outrageous? Orders were made last August by the Minister to control building assets, and certificates of reasonable value were introduced.  It all added up to nothing.  Prices are still going up.  They came down in the last quarter of last year but they rocketed in the first quarter of this year.  The Government have done nothing to control them.</P>
    <P>One of the major reasons for increased house prices is that the cost of building sites continues to go up.  The only way this can be curtailed and avoided is by local authorities getting into the market and buying large tracts of land so that developed sites can be made available at a reasonable and subsidised cost.  That would do a lot to curb the cost of house building.  In my view, even after the passing of this Bill nothing will have been done to curb the rising price of houses if the Minister does not do something to curb the price of sites. The Minister has an opportunity to do something about those costs under this section.  It is no use in having the section if local authorities are not told to acquire the land and develop it.  They should be encouraged to do this.  In this connection I am talking about county managers. The Minister should encourage local authorities by way of financial assistance or otherwise to do this work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the House that the subsidy to local authorities was increased from £300 to £500 by me and I vastly increased the amounts made available to them to make more serviced sites available in the last two years.  With regard to the performance of local authorities in making sites available to people to build their own houses I should like to state that those authorities are only obliged to <Col N="1991" /> charge a price which is equivalent to the cost of the land, the cost of any development that takes place and administrative costs.  They must also take into consideration the subsidy which is made available by my Department.  A circular was issued to local authorities in 1972 advising them to adhere to this.  Obviously, many of them have not acted on my advice.  The performance of local authorities in making these sites available is an absolute disgrace.  Since 1967 only 5,000 building sites were made available.  There is no necessity whatever for local authorities to rush out frantically to buy more land&mdash;they can do so if they wish&mdash;because they have a total of 51,751 sites on hands.  Many of them are serviced sites which could be sold on the basis I have already indicated, but local authorities insist on holding on to those sites.</P>

      <P>Time and again local authorities have been asked to make such sites available to people and also to buy more land by way of overdraft with the cost being taken into consideration in due course.  The fault with regard to sites lies with local authorities, who have been given every encouragement by the Department.  They have been exhorted not to charge more than the cost I have indicated.  In fairness, it must be said that a lot of land is in the hands of the local authorities in the Dublin area who have not been over-active in making sites available.  I agree with the Deputy that more sites should be made available and that such action would reduce the cost of housing.  We have repeatedly circularised local authorities with a view to getting more sites made available.  They have also been told about the price they must charge.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to pursue his objective of releasing serviced or unserviced land owned by local authorities by enabling such authorities to recover the cost of the site&mdash;the original cost of acquisition and the carrying charges plus development, if it has occurred&mdash;by charging that at a simple interest rate over a period of 25 years to the builder, the occupier or a voluntary housing association? It has been my experience that the capital cost of the site, which is a once-off payment, can be too expensive. On a number of occasions inquiries were made to know whether local authorities would accept phased payments of the cost of the site; it is not the cost which is at issue but the method of repayment.  The method of repayment could take two forms.  For example, if the site cost £4,000, the local authority could accept repayment on that sum over 25 years as an ordinary mortgage with compound interest or, alternatively, they could accept repayment over ten years without interest being charged. The practice seems to vary from local authority to local authority.  It appears that, if one gets a local authority loan for housing, a loan will not be given for the site also.  Will the Minister indicate whether he is prepared to make it clear if local authorities can subsidise the cost of housing sites to applicants, particularly to voluntary housing associations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the section gives the Minister great scope.  The Minister has indicated that local authorities are not doing enough in regard to providing serviced sites and I hope he uses his muscle to get local <Col N="1993" /> authorities to make more sites available. There is no doubt that a move in that direction would mean cheaper houses, but it would also mean that small building concerns would be kept in business.  Such concerns, because they are in competition with big building industries, must pay huge sums of money for sites.  If local authorities are not active in this regard, the Minister should pursue them.  The Minister must also carry out an investigation to see if they are charging exorbitant prices for sites.</P>
      <P>I am aware that such racketeering does not take place in the local authority of which I am a member.  If that does operate in local authorities the Minister should take them by the scruff of the neck and tell them exactly where to get off.  What we are endeavouring to do is to keep the cost of housing down.  If local authorities are flouting the Minister's wishes here they should be taken to task very quickly, and I hope the Minister will do so.  These sites for small builders have proved to be very successful.  They have kept a number of houses within the reach of the type of people in that bracket.  If we lose out on this aspect of housing development it will mean that house prices will go up and a lot of small builders will go to the wall because they will be unable to withstand the competition.  If builders have to compete for sites on the open market it means they have to up the price of a house they are building in order to have money at the end of the day to buy more sites.  It is a Catch 22 situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously the Minister is not satisfied with what is happening in this area.  He is now dealing with it by way of legislation and it is his duty now to use muscle on local authorities, giving them firm instructions, getting after them to ensure that they allocate as many sites as possible to small builders.  I can assure him that if he does that there will be no need for him to talk about CRVs or anything else because it will act as a great restraint, keeping house prices down. While local authorities have a lot of land, the more they can buy the better because it will tend to keep house prices down.  There was a time when labour <Col N="1994" /> and material accounted for 65 per cent of the price of a house; now that figure is 35 per cent.  That illustrates that the cost element of housing is shifting from labour and materials to the other side, which is basically the cost of land and site development.</P>
    <P>There is very little in this Bill about this aspect, which worries me when we talk about endeavouring to control house prices.  In that respect it is high time we began examining the area of cost and took the matter seriously.  If we are engaging in an exercise to keep house prices down then obviously one must start at the very foundations, the land.  There is very little in this Bill that I can find in regard to controlling land prices.  Rather it is generally a bricks and mortar situation, even with regard to the CRVs.  We have put down an amendment on section 18 to which we will come later.  Unless we occupy ourselves with the whole area of land, its control and price, then the exercise of keeping house prices down will have proved wasteful.  Some large builders are not now interested in building.  They are interested in buying tracts of land, selling them to small builders with a higher profit and no capital risk.  They merely buy the tracts of land, hold them for a while and sell them to small builders who have to produce the CRVs and all the rest of it in order to reap their profit.  The others are glorified speculators creaming off the real profit in housing.  That is where housing profit is to be found, in land and land speculation.  It is in this respect that this section is so important. I would fully support the Minister if he takes on these local authorities, ensuring that they make more serviced sites available to small builders which, in itself, would have a very beneficial effect. I believe we are not really tackling the overall problem but there are other sections on which we can discuss this further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, thank you, Sir. There are two different methods by which a subsidy can be paid on sites; it can be paid either to an individual who is building a house on the site provided by the local authority, or to the small builder, as has been outlined by other speakers here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a third situation&mdash;the Minister and/or his officials may have some knowledge of it&mdash;that is, where a local authority not alone develop the site but decide to act as agents for the person to whom the site has been sold to build the house or houses.  If I may give an example: in the local authority in which I am involved some years ago we developed approximately 60 sites.  Those sites were then sold to individuals, mainly the people who qualified for the local authority housing list.  Because the people themselves were slow to commence construction of the houses the council decided to design a standard-type house, inviting the 60 site holders to allow the council act as their agents, to advertise for tender and employ a contractor to build 60 houses to a good design.  In that way the houses were efficiently constructed and much more cheaply than if all the persons involved had had to seek individual planning permission.  The houses were occupied and about 60 people removed from the local authority housing list.  The upshot of it was&mdash;and there might even be people who like myself, were technically outside the House, but listening to this debate, people somewhere within the confines of the Chamber this afternoon, who remember this very well&mdash;that the Department of Local Government, as it was then, refused point blank to pay a subsidy in that case.  They contended that the houses had been built by the local authority and, consequently, did not qualify for subsidy purposes.  That row raged on, there was blue murder in the <Col N="1996" /> Custom House because of that development, to such an extent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Early 1970s&mdash;that the local authority involved dropped the idea of pursuing similar projects in other locations.  If one can find a council prepared not only to make sites available but to act as agents for the site holders and employ a contractor to build houses for them, that would constitute a project worthy of encouragement.  I cannot remember the eventual outcome, whether or not the site subsidy was eventually paid; I have a suspicion it was not. Certainly it delayed the building of the houses and put off the council from carrying out similar projects at other locations. I invite the Minister to say whether or not he envisages allowing councils to act as agents in the construction of houses on these sites and still have subsidies paid.  That would be a worth while project.  The houses to which I am referring were sold at the time for £5,500, which was about £1,500 under the market level at the time.  They are now being sold at more than three times their initial price.  In the town in which they were built they are regarded as being some of the best houses available on the market.  The Minister should give some consideration to encouraging councils to go to that stage if they see such need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I appreciate the remarks of the Minister and Deputy Fitzpatrick in relation to local authorities not engaging in this type of operation to a sufficient extent, I agree with them, but the figures given by the Minister paint a false picture to some extent.  For instance, I can point to certain areas in County Dublin where there are a large number of sites available.  But were they to be offered on the market at the same time to the small builder&mdash;because of the distance of the town from the city&mdash;it would be uneconomic for all of them to commence developing all of the sites at the same time.  Over the past two years we have released sites to small builders in that town at the rate we felt the market would bear.  Therefore, to some extent, the figure of 51,000 sites being available throughout the country may not paint <Col N="1997" /> an absolutely true picture.  If all those sites were put on the market at the same time I do not believe the small builders would be capable of building and successfully selling all the houses.  In the remote areas this would create particular difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if there were 500 sites a year, it would be a big help.  There would be no question of 51,000 sites coming on the market together because we could not get that many houses built in one year.  The main point made by the Deputy dealt with the local authority acting as agent.  There is nothing to stop a local authority acting as agent in the manner described by the Deputy, but the experience of some local authorities has been that the houses worked out more expensive.  If it is established&mdash;and is easy to do&mdash;that the local authorities are acting as agent, there should be no difficulty. I do not know when or how that difficulty has occurred, but if it has not been resolved I will look into it.  I would appreciate it if the Deputy in his capacity as chairman of Dublin County Council would make more sites available at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Section 15 of the Principal Act, which is being repealed, enables the Minister to pay a grant to a person, including a housing authority, for the provision of a house.  Grants were paid under that section in respect of certain houses which were provided for sale by a housing authority.  Grants were not paid, however, in respect of houses provided by a housing authority for letting, as subsidy was available in respect of such houses under section 44 of the <Col N="1999" /> 1966 Act.  The expression &ldquo;the provision by a housing authority of a house in respect of which a grant under section 15 of the Principal Act&rdquo; is used in this paragraph and in section 44 of the 1966 Act to distinguish between houses provided for sale and houses provided for letting.</P>
      <P>Whereas section 44 of the 1966 Act enables subsidy to be paid in relation to the annual loan charges incurred by a housing authority in respect of money borrowed for the provision of houses for letting, this paragraph would provide a basis for the subsidy arrangement which applied between 1 April 1973 and 31 December 1976 and which was based on the deficit on a local authority's housing revenue account.  These latter arrangements took account not only of the annual loan charges incurred but also of current income and other expenditure in relation to local authority rented houses, that is, rents, maintenance and management costs, together with a proportion of the proceeds of sales of local authority houses.  The deficit on local authorities' housing revenue accounts was being transferred to the Exchequer on a phased basis over the period 1 April 1973 to 31 December 1976.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  In the financial year 1973-74 the Exchequer generally recouped 25 per cent of the local authority housing deficit to local authorities, 62½ per cent in 1974, 75 per cent in 1975 and 87½ per cent in 1976. Recoupment of the housing deficit in 1975 and 1976 was, however, subject to limitations on certain categories of expenditure&mdash;maintenance and management expenditure.  In 1977 and subsequent years the subsidy payable to housing authorities in relation to houses provided for letting relates to the annual loan charges only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (b) provides that a subsidy under this subsection shall be subject to such conditions, if any, as the Minister <Col N="2000" /> may specify and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the conditions may include conditions relating to rent, purchase of the house concerned, standards of construction, contributions from the housing authority concerned towards the expenditure on the volved and expenditure on the maintenance, management and improvement of the house concerned.  In 1973 and 1976 the subsidy was based on a deficit.  It is now based on 100 per cent of the loan charges on houses provided for letting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very complicated section.  It is validating a date at the end of 1976.  It has cost every local authority money because one local authority decided to be extra smart and tried to roll up all the charges and throw them back on to the Department.  The change was made at the end of 1976 and every local authority in the country have suffered in their revenue account as a result ever since.  In the interest of charity it might be better if we did not name the particular authority.</P>
      <P>What is the situation now in relation to the senior administrative and technical staff employed in housing construction? At the time of this change an argument went on for quite some time as to whether the cost of their salaries and the expenses of the operation of their department should be included as part of the capital charge of housing construction or whether it should fall into the other category of being financed partially from rent and sale receipts.</P>

If that is the case it is most unfair.  These are legitimate charges which should be included as part of the capital cost of housing construction and should be charged against housing construction.  I ask the Minister to re-examine that position. It was a contentious issue at the beginning of 1977 and it was not resolved equitably from a local authority point of view at any rate.</P>

      <P>Section 11 covers the subsidies particularly with regard to the low-rise mortgage.  The low-rise mortgage is a first-class innovation which has helped a large number of people out of financial problems.  However, these aids and the constraints placed on the people receiving them should be reviewed from time to time.  There are a number of such restraints.  People awaiting these loans must be on a waiting list for 12 months and must have a child for that period.  We should limit to six months the period of time for people on the housing list and in overcrowded conditions it should not be necessary for them to have one child.  If there is not a family the possibility of <Col N="2004" /> them being in overcrowded conditions perhaps would not exist but they may be living in very poor conditions.  I ask the Minister to look at this.  There are income restrictions and we are not talking about giving low-rise mortgages to people in the high income bracket.  We are talking about helping people in need. This is an area in which we can encourage people to buy their own houses. Because of the high costs now that is important. People in receipt of £4,000 per annum or less cannot possibly meet high repayments initially and the only way to help them purchase their house is through the low-rise mortgage system.  It is better to help people by giving them a low-rise mortgage as attractive as possible so that we can remove people from the housing lists.  There is a very wide area of development here and commitment to it from the Minister can achieve very satisfactory results in the number of people coming off the list.  A lot of people on the housing list are not there of their own volition.  They are on it because they cannot meet rising costs and the repayments being asked of them. We should assist them in every way possible. This section can and will do that but it is an aid which we are trying to play down rather than play up.  The Minister should cut out as many of the constraints as possible.  We all want to see people being housed and it is all the better if they can house themselves with assistance from the Department.</P>
      <P>There was some commitment from this Government to pay back money to people who bought houses between 1970 and 1972.  I think the amount involved was one-quarter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should examine the whole area of the low-rise mortgage scheme.  It has worked well but could be improved by the removal of a number of <Col N="2006" /> constraints.  A number of people are being forced on to the housing lists because they cannot afford mortgage repayments. Because of the restrictions many of these people cannot avail of the low-rise mortgage scheme and I would ask the Minister to lift these restrictions to ensure that the people who need housing can avail of the scheme.  It should not be necessary for a couple to have children. They may have to pay very high rents for tenement rooms and they are condemned to this unless they have a child for a period of one year.  The Minister should issue instructions to local authorities to be more liberal in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this is a very worth-while scheme.  To date it has worked very well.  Up to 31 March 1979 a total of £8.77 million had been advanced in loans under this scheme and over 1,170 families were able to acquire their own private dwellings.  In 1978 alone 427 families were accepted as eligible by the local authorities and were enabled to house themselves, while a further 291 families surrendered their local authority dwellings and received loans under the low-rise mortgage scheme for private houses.  In the first quarter of this year 189 loans were approved to the value of £1.7 million.</P>
      <P>This scheme is constantly under review.  It was improved in February of this year when two-person families consisting of a parent and one child were brought into the scheme.  The scheme has been very attractive and it will be reviewed constantly with a view to extending it to as many people as possible.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I join with Deputy O'Brien in making a special appeal on behalf of childless couples.  I appealed on behalf of this category on another occasion when I pointed out that many housing authorities had a system of allocating houses which virtually denied them to childless couples.  I said that was heartless and inhuman and I now understand that the terms of the low-rise mortgage scheme exclude childless couples. Very often these couples have personal problems arising out of the fact <Col N="2007" /> that they do not have children and these problems should not be added to by making it impossible for them to acquire houses.  It is fundamentally wrong and socially bad to exclude them from this scheme.  It is right to include the one-parent family&mdash;an unmarried mother and her child&mdash;but it is very difficult to see why a married couple who have no children should be excluded.  I know of four childless couples who have been married for about seven years and they have been deprived of housing.  One couple are now expecting their first child and the fact that they have not at present a child might have something to do with their living in unsatisfactory housing conditions.  I give the strongest possible support to Deputy O'Brien's plea for the inclusion in the scheme of childless couples who are otherwise qualified.  I would like an assurance from the Minister of State that they will be included.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a very good point.  As the House is aware this scheme was introduced by the previous Government and has been a success.  It was improved in February 1979 when the Government approved the Minister's proposal to allow two-person families, which consisted of one parent and one child, who were otherwise eligible, to qualify under the scheme.  The problem about accepting in full what Deputy Fitzpatrick has asked for is that if one includes every childless couple it would cost a lot of extra money.  A good case could be made for childless couples in special circumstances who are otherwise qualified and who are married a few years.  It may be necessary to have an application based on a medical certificate or something like that.  The point the Deputy made will be taken into account when the scheme is being reviewed.</P>

      <P>This section deals with people who could not get loans from local authorities and the local authorities went as guarantors to the building societies so that those people could get their loans.  The Government are now honouring something they promised.  Would the Minister consider people who went to local authorities at that time and were told they could not get loans and who then went and made their own arrangements with building societies?  Those people would have qualified at that time for local authority loans if the local authorities had the money.  They now appear to be penalised.  It would be easy to check out if the people I am referring to were on a certain income at that time and fulfilled the necessary qualifications for local authority loans.  I believe they should be covered under this section.  As far as I can see, they would not be covered unless their loans from the building societies were guaranteed by the local authorities.  Would the Minister comment on the case I have been talking about?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): As far as I can see it appears from the explanatory memorandum that this section is to indemnify borrowers who borrowed from building societies and who were qualified for local authority loans but did not get them because no local authority loans were available between 1969 and 1972. Those people then borrowed from building societies at much higher rates of interest.  The Minister is now indemnifying the borrowers against the increased rate of interest they had to pay.</P>
      <P>The Minister is inserting this section to implement a promise his party made to indemnify those people against their increasing interest.  I ask him to avail of this section to include in it local authority tenants who bought their houses prior to 1973 on much less favourable terms than were afforded in the 1973 scheme.  There are quite a number of those tenants in this city. They have an organisation known as PACT, Purchase Association Corporation Tenants, who, in June 1977, issued a circular to their members advising them to vote for Fianna Fáil candidates because the Fianna Fáil Party promised to introduce a scheme which would compensate them for the unfavourable terms on which they purchased their houses and would apply the 1973 scheme to them.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): We oppose this section.  At the moment if a local authority sell their houses to occupying tenants there is an obligation on them to put the houses in a sound structural state of repair.  I know that the term &ldquo;structural state of repair&rdquo; is often very narrowly interpreted to include walls and the roof.  It does not include windows but it may include doors.</P>
      <P>The completion of the sale of these local authority houses to tenants is sometimes held up for years because structural repairs are not carried out. That does not reflect great credit on the local authorities or the Department of the Environment.  I would have thought the Minister would introduce some new machinery to speed up the repairs so that the sales could be completed but he is not doing that.  He and the local authorities are doing a kind of Pontius Pilate act by washing their hands of the whole business, enabling the local authorities to enter into agreements with the tenants that they will carry out the repairs themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fearful that if this amendment is allowed and if these schemes are entered into the repairs will not be carried out at all.  Instead of improving the houses they will continue to deteriorate.  There will be a file in county council offices on each case.  After two years somebody will inquire <Col N="2015" /> if the repairs have been carried out, it will transpire they have not, a reminder will be sent to the tenant and the story will go on and on.  If the repairs are carried out another wrangle will commence about the cost and that will go on and on.  There is no merit whatever in the proposal.  I know that there is provision for appeal to the Minister under section 13.  It is a lengthy provision and what it is really dealing with is putting local authority houses into a proper state of repair before they are sold to the tenants.</P>
    <P>The necessity for this amendment emphasises the length of time it takes to have a house built by a local authority for somebody badly in need of housing.  I know of a family in which there are several children, one of whom is delicate. It is admitted that these people are living in housing conditions that are totally unsuitable and that they will never be able from their own resources even with the assistance of grants to build a house for themselves.  It is accepted also that this family wish to continue to live on their ten or 15 acres of land but it is taking years to have a house built for them. However, I am not surprised at that situation when the Minister and the local authority are throwing up their hands hopelessly and saying, &ldquo;we cannot have these houses that we are selling put in a structural state of repair within a reasonable time and because we are so helpless and have given up the attempt to put the houses into a proper state of repair, we will hand the matter over to the tenants in order to facilitate the completion of the purchase&rdquo;.  This is really an example of the frustrating delays that occur in local authorities.  I am opposing this section <i>holus bolus</i> because it is an attempt to avoid doing something whereas the Minister should give tenants some immediate rights against local authorities who do not put houses into repair.</P>
    <P>The moment I read this section I realised that it was an instrument for further delay, an instrument for local authorities to wash their hands of this responsibility.  It is evidence of the <Col N="2016" /> hopelessness of local authorities in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this section is to provide a means for overcoming the long delays that can occur, delays of the kind that have occurred before a rented local authority house can be sold under the existing statutory arrangements. Section 13 re-enacts largely section 106 of the 1966 Act which requires a local authority to carry out all works necessary to put a house into good structural condition before it can be sold to the tenant, subject to a right of appeal to the Minister.  In order to facilitate the sale of council houses the Bill provides for the introduction of a new optional arrangement whereby the local authority and the tenant could agree on the nature, the extent and the costs of the works.  The tenant would carry out either some or all of the work or arrange to have the work done with the agreed costs being paid to him by the housing authority on the satisfactory completion of the work.</P>
      <P>I should like to stress that the section is not intended in any way to relieve a housing authority of their responsibility to carry out all necessary pre-sale structural work.  The optional alternative proposed in the Bill can operate only where the purchaser wishes to carry out the necessary work and the housing authority agree to allow him to do so.  In such cases the work must be completed to the satisfaction of the housing authority and within a specified time. Where a purchaser fails to carry out the necessary work the housing authority is empowered to undertake the work. There is a further safeguard whereby a housing authority would be precluded from giving their consent to the alienation of the house until all necessary works had been completed to their satisfaction.  Where a tenant purchases a council house the consent of the authority for resale is required within a period of 25 years of the date of purchase.  The section provides also for rights of appeal to the Minister by the purchaser both under the existing procedures and under the proposed alternative arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to understand the <Col N="2017" /> reasons for the opposition to this section. The proposed alternative arrangements could be of particular benefit in the case of houses located in isolated areas where much money could be spent by a local authority in transporting men and material to such houses under present arrangements.  The optional arrangement provided for in the Bill is based on a non-statutory arrangement which has been operating in limited cases in recent years in areas such as Sligo and Galway.  That arrangement might suit also both a local authority and a prospective tenant purchaser where there was a serious backlog of unprocessed tenant purchase applications and where the necessary works had not been carried out.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that sales of council houses be speeded up.  Consequently, I would commend section 32 to the House.  There is no reason for progress not being monitored under this arrangement. We could see how it worked but it is a genuine attempt to speed up the type of long delays that have occured in recent years.  In some cases it has taken up to three years to complete a purchase. Such delays were being experienced long before we were returned to office.  It is only with the consent of the tenant purchasers and of the local authority that the alternative arrangements could be utilised.  It is an optional arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to a large extent with the Minister on this matter because he is regularising a practice that has been in operation for the past five or six years and which was introduced while I was Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It operates in two areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It operates in two areas in particular but also in other areas where the sanction of the Department has not been sought.  It began in Galway in a big way where for some extraordinary reason there was a scheme in respect of which there did not appear to be any desire on the part of the corporation to carry out the necessary repairs.  It was in the area of the new road to Salthill.  The Minister is right in stating that the long delays have been occurring for much <Col N="2018" /> longer than the past two years.  One of the reasons for my introducing the practice that the Minister is now legislating for was that when I assumed office I found arrears dating back for many years.  These applications to purchase had been lying in county council offices for a long time but could not be dealt with either because the repairs necessary would not or could not be carried out.</P>
      <P>But I think the Minister has missed something there because he could have made two very important improvements. He could have improved on the definition of repairs to be carried out under the 1966 Act and he could have indicated that the repairs to be carried out in many cases are not necessarily structural repairs.  He could have proposed that it is not structural repairs which are needed to be carried out.  A round tower is structurally sound&mdash;I made this point on the 1966 Act&mdash;but nobody would suggest it is fit to live in.  The Minister should have done something about the definition of the type of repairs to be carried out.  In many cases old or handicapped people would like to have repairs carried out to their houses.  They are not in a position to do them themselves and the local authority will not do them.  In no time at all a fairly reasonable house becomes a hovel because repairs which should be carried out are not carried out. I suggest this is one mistake the Minister made in the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of financing. We all know local authorities have always claimed they had not enough money to carry out repairs.  The Department are now mainly responsible for the financing of housing.  Why do they not do something about making the necessary money available?  There is no point in the Minister saying he is very much in favour of the purchase of these houses, if the houses are withheld from purchase because repairs are not carried out.  The local authorities say they cannot carry out the repairs because they have not got the money.  We could go around in a circle. This matter could easily have been dealt with in this Bill.  When it was being drafted I thought some change might be made, but it was not.  The Minister must consider this whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2019" /> Deputy Fitzpatrick is perfectly correct in saying there are far too many people who want to purchase a house and are not allowed to do so because, when they apply, they are asked to state whether or not the house is in good repair.  Some people say the house is not in good repair.  Recently people referred to small structural defects and the application was dumped in a file with other applications practically for a new house.</P>
    <P>The scheme as recommended has been in operation but, with the exception of a couple of areas, it has not been a big success for two reasons.  In some areas there are objections from trade unions.  If craftsmen are unemployed they will resent the fact that the local authority decide to allow somebody who is not a craftsman to do repairs to a house.  That is genuine enough.  That has not been a big obstacle.</P>
    <P>The big obstacle is the fact that because there was not legal backing, even though the Department said it could be done, the local authorities have not taken much interest in having it done.  The Minister mentioned outlying houses and said the council would have to send people to do the job at big expense. There are what we call the flying squads, people who are employed by local authorities to do repairs to houses. In addition very often contractors are employed to carry out repairs.  If a tenant is asked to do the repairs and if he cannot, he may employ a contractor. The intention of the section is to regularise what has been the practice, or what has been permissible over a number of years, but it has not quite covered the whole field.  If the Minister is really serious about having these repairs carried out, the local authorities will have to get a pretty big shake up.  They will have to be told it is their job to see to it that the houses are repaired so that the purchase can be completed.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a reference to something which I did not quite catch. He referred to 25 years' permission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not let us make it more complicated than it is.  This is one of the reasons why I objected to racing this Bill through the House.  As the law stands, if somebody wants to sell a vested council cottage, the cottage must be redeemed and the redemption may be less than 12 months away or a number of years up to 44 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the order was not redeemed the council would have to sanction the sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They can only prevent the sale up to the period of the redemption, not for 25 years.  People will not be allowed by the local authority to buy a house without restriction.  They have the right to refuse permission for the sale of the house as long as there is an annuity payable.  That annuity might be payable for less than a year or anything up to 44 years.  If the annuity is payable for five or six years, the council have no right to say the house cannot be sold for 25 years.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to ground rent which is an entirely different matter.  He and I have a difference of opinion on that subject.  The Government ground rent on local authority houses should be purchasable.  I felt that there was no reason why ground rent should be retained.  It has a very slight effect and it would at least retain the sites.  The property could only be used for housing. A whole row of houses could not be purchased and sold to a supermarket or something like that.  I do not think the Minister was talking about that.  If he was talking about the sale of the houses, he should be able to explain that.  Either I misunderstood what he said, or something is being introduced in this Bill which is not in the existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The last point Deputy Tully made was about the resale of a purchased house.  While it was still subject to repayments to the council, in other words, if the purchase period had not expired, the council had to sanction the sale of the house regardless of the <Col N="2021" /> number of years.  Once the repayment had run out it became a freehold and the council had no say in the purchase.  The 25 years provision I am speaking about was introduced in the Ground Rents Bill. The 25 years will date from the date of purchase.  From now on it becomes effective from the date of purchase.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main elements of the Commission's proposal are (a) annual fixing of a basic price, (b) aids for private storage of sheepmeat, (c) a levy against imports of sheepmeat from third countries equal to the difference between the free-at-frontier offer price and the basic price subject to a maximum of 20 per cent and (d) a transitional arrangement providing for compensation for producers disadvantaged by the operation of free intra-Community trade in sheep and sheepmeat.  The Commission proposal was forwarded to the Council on 29 <Col N="2023" /> March 1978 and was published in the Official Journal No. C93/5 of 18 April 1978 a copy of which is in the Library. At its meeting last month the Council of Agricultural Ministers agreed to intensify discussions on the proposal so that decisions can be made before 31 October next.  In the discussions in the Council the Irish objective is to secure the best deal possible for Irish sheep producers, but as the matter is still under negotiation I do not propose to make any further comment at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Outline planning permission for a zinc smelter at Ballylongford, County Kerry, has been sought but, as I have indicated on previous occasions, it has not been irrevocably and finally decided that the smelter will be built at Ballylongford.  It is possible that during the course of ongoing studies and discussions there might be reasons to decide to locate the smelter elsewhere.  As I indicated recently in reply to a question by Deputy Kelly, discussions are continuing with a number of companies about participation in the zinc smelter project.  These discussions have been influenced in a <Col N="2032" /> positive way by the trend in recent months in the price of zinc metal.  Since the zinc smelter project is energy intensive, the prevailing energy situation will have some bearing on the final outcome of the discussions and this aspect is under continuous examination.  I cannot at this stage say when the discussions are likely to be completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that the price for zinc on the world market is to some extent influenced by the demand for motor cars and that if there is an increase in oil prices this will reduce the price paid for motor cars and hence the price paid for zinc?  Has the Minister made any estimate of the likely effect of the recent increase in energy costs and electricity on the economics of this question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Motor cars are one of the areas in which zinc is used.  For some years past there has been a tendency, especially in the US, to phase down the amount of zinc used in cars, principally because of the weight of that metal, and to substitute for it alloys which are much lighter and which are claimed to be equally strong.  If there is a downturn in the world automobile market, obviously it must have some impact on the zinc market and accordingly on zinc prices, but the effect would not be as great as perhaps it might have been some years ago before the trend towards substitution of alloys had commenced.  So far as energy costs are concerned, obviously increases in energy costs must have a bearing on the economics of this or any other smelter proposal because it is relatively energy intensive.  The capacity needed to supply it is about 40 megawatts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that, in the year to 31 March 1979, the proportion of electricity generated through milled peat was 16 per cent of total output of electricity.</P>
      <P>The locations of milled peat power stations are: Lanesboro, Co. Longford; Rhode, Ferbane, Shannonbridge, Co. Offaly; Bellacorick, Co. Mayo.</P>
      <P>Production of milled peat by Bord na Móna in 1978/79 amounted to 2.9 million tonnes.  2.7 million tonnes was sold to the ESB for the generation of electricity with the balance being utilised for briquette production.</P>
      <P>The third development programme now being undertaken by Bord na Móna will provide for the production of an additional 2.75 million tonnes of milled peat per annum of which 1.75 million tonnes will be sold to the ESB.  The ESB plan to utilise most of the additional milled peat to be made available to them under the programme in two new 40 megawatt extensions to the existing stations at Shannonbridge and Lanesboro. These are scheduled for commissioning in 1982/83 and 1983/84 respectively. The balance of the ESB allocation will be used to improve the load factors of existing units.</P>
      <P>The remaining production of milled peat under the programme will be used for the manufacture of briquettes.  Present production of briquettes by Bord na Móna amounts to approximately 360,000 tonnes per annum.  The increased production will be at a new factory at Littleton, Co. Tipperary which is scheduled to commence production in 1981 and at a further new factory at Ballyforan, Co. Galway, which will commence production in 1984.  When all the additional factories are in full production the total Bord na Móna briquette production will be 750,000 tonnes or more than double existing production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bog development under the programme which involves drainage, levelling and construction of railways, which is now in progress and which usually takes <Col N="2036" /> five years, should be sufficiently advanced to enable the additional milled peat production to commence on a limited scale in 1980.  Full production should be achieved by 1985.</P>

In the light of the current energy crisis&mdash;which as far as we can see will be ongoing&mdash;is the Minister satisfied with the current rate of progress based on the development programme initiated prior to the present energy crisis; is he happy that that is adequate or, in the light of the current crisis, will he be suggesting any further expansion of that development programme using this natural resource of which we have a fairly plentiful supply?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the major potentially commercial bogs which Bord na Móna can develop will all be virtually developed under this third development programme.  The remaining peat supplies in the country, in general terms, at that stage, will be confined to the western seaboard counties where the bogs, as the Deputy knows, are of a different nature, are incapable of development by the means Bord na Móna have used in the large midland bogs, which are of considerable extent, depth and are also as a general rule, free from obstructions and difficulties.  The next, and perhaps the only remaining, step that can be taken in relation to the further development of peat resources&mdash;beyond the third development&mdash;is an effort to intensify the use and production of turf from some smaller western bogs.  But it would be misleading to suggest that <Col N="2037" /> there are vast resources in those bogs. They tend to be small in extent, to be shallow and of a much lower quality than the peat available in the midlands. Nonetheless I would certainly encourage the development of these smaller bogs to the greatest extent I can.  Bord na Móna will be unable to do so by the means they have used traditionally.  But the western development fund is available to give substantial grants, for example, for the purchase of small turf-cutting machines suitable for use in these small western bogs, and a number of such machines have already been purchased. That is the kind of development I should like to encourage.</P>

      <P>In the circumstances outlined by the Minister, in which the western bogs are shallow and in extent and volume not as good as the midland bogs, is he prepared to commission research into the best use of the remaining resource in the west?  There seems to me to be, not unlimited but a fair volume of bog there, though much of it may be shallow.  Is the Minister prepared to consider the commissioning of research into the way in which this can best be used for energy purposes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Without being able to say precisely what is the research, I am confident that Bord na Móna have already done a good deal of work on what are the possibilities.  For example, there is no possibility of producing milled peat from those bogs.  What would be produced would have to be sod turf which is generally much less satisfactory than milled peat.  Nonetheless no doubt some reasonable quantity could be extracted from those bogs by a major effort. Up to now it has tended to be done by private interests.  It is a matter I would have to discuss with Bord na Móna as to whether they would be anxious to become involved in the development of those bogs.  Many of them are at present utilised way below their capacity by private interests who own them, and the advent of Bord na Móna might not be universally welcomed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the ESB that this link has been out of action since September 1975 due to malicious damage.  Earlier this year, an attempt to restore the link was frustrated by further damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2039" /> The absence of the interconnector is a serious handicap to both utilities in maintaining continuity of supply.  If it were feasible to restore the link, the ESB advise me that it would take about six weeks to carry out the necessary repairs. As the damage is in the south Armagh area, all repair costs fall to be borne by the Northern Ireland Electricity Service. I have no information on what these costs would be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister effectively writing off the possibilities that this interconnector link will be restored, even though we have been warned already that there will be electricity cuts this winter?  Is he kissing it goodbye as a source of electricity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I became responsible for energy I have urged the ESB to encourage their counterparts in the North to repair the link which has already been repaired four times this year.  As a result of my suggestions to the ESB and theirs to the Northern Ireland Electricity Service, efforts were made to repair the link again.  Within a day or two of the work commencing certain terrorists arrived on the scene and threatened the workmen in the south Armagh area.  They said that if they persisted in repairing the link they would be shot.  Unfortunately, but understandably, the workmen desisted.</P>
      <P>The breaks in this interconnector have always been outside our jurisdiction and there have not been any unrepaired breaks in our jurisdiction.  If it were possible for the authorities in the North to maintain the link it would be an enormous benefit to us and would be a considerable benefit to the Northern Ireland Electricity Service who have surplus generating capacity which they could very conveniently sell to this part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the additional capacity which the ESB had to put in in recent years was the direct result of these continuous explosions caused by terrorists.  These people, who generally like to describe themselves as patriots, have cost the Republic tens of millions of pounds <Col N="2040" /> directly as a result of their activities in breaking this link and may well contribute in a significant way to possible power cuts, and have already contributed to power cuts in recent months. These power cuts would not have taken place if the ESB had been in a position to call on the 300 megawatts which are potentially available on this interconnector.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concern expressed by some people living in the vicinity of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta's ammonia/urea plant at Marino Point, which is currently undergoing commissioning, due to two recent incidents involving the escape of ammonia gas, one of which occurred from the plant and the other of a more minor nature from a ship berthed at the jetty.</P>
      <P>The first incident was an accidental release of ammonia vapour which lasted for one to two minutes due to an equipment failure which has since been rectified. The second was a very minor incident involving a leak from an incompletely sealed valve on a ship at the jetty which allowed some ammonia to pass into the atmosphere which, although small, would have caused a smell.  In this case, corrective measures were taken by the ship's command.  I understand that NET have made a strong protest to the ship's command and to its owners and have been given an assurance that the ship will be fully checked before it returns to Marino Point.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to carry out a special review of the performance of this company in the light of their annual report for 1978.</P>
      <P>Since the 1973 energy crisis, the production of fertilisers from an oil feedstock and from imported ammonia has not been competitive with imported fertilisers based on natural gas.  This fact has been basic to the poor performance of NET in recent years.  The new ammonia/urea plant at Marino Point, based on natural gas supplies from Kinsale Head, is designed to overcome this drawback and to place the company in a competitive position in both the domestic and export markets while, at the same time, bringing them to a profitable position.</P>
      <P>Serious delays have occurred, however, in the bringing on stream of the Marino Point plant and these have resulted in the unforeseen extension of the company's loss making phase.  The losses in 1978 were worsened by a strike at the Arklow factory for three months of that year.  The causes and effects of the increasing cost of the Marino project are being examined with a view, <i>inter alia</i>, to ascertaining what implications this experience may have for public sector projects.</P>
      <P>The production of ammonia on a commercial scale at Marino Point commenced in May this year and the Arklow factory is now using some of that ammonia.  From now on, therefore, there should be gradual improvement in the performance of the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I never mentioned a lack of demand.  There is no lack of demand for nitrogenous fertilisers; there is a growth market.  The main cause of NET problems has been the 1973-1974 energy crisis which gave an enormous advantage to those who were producing fertilisers from natural gas as against those who were producing it from oil feedstocks and from imported ammonia. NET are now themselves manufacturing ammonia and urea from natural gas and using that ammonia in the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilisers.  They should, therefore, be in a much stronger position in the years to come than they have been in the past.  Nevertheless, I am very concerned indeed at the poor results from the company over the last few years.  A major factor in it has been this very prolonged strike in Arklow.  The other major factor has been the fact that Marino Point is a very long time behind schedule in coming onstream and is coming onstream at a cost which is roughly double what was originally budgeted for.</P>

      <P>They have been done for quite a long time now and we have had no difficulty in general terms in interpreting <Col N="2048" /> them.  However, seismic surveys are not of themselves conclusive.  If they were, everyone would know exactly where to drill.  All they give is a general indication of likely reservoirs and that some areas are obviously much more prospective than others.  The precise evaluation of seismic data as opposed to data actually coming out of a well is a matter of somewhat subjective judgement and one cannot make readings with precision.  It is a matter of skill, experience and judgment.  There can be no question of our being misled in regard to seismic data because that is an area where the companies themselves will try to be as accurate as possible so that they will drill in the most prospective place.</P>

      <P>I confirm that such a visit did take place.  For reasons which I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, I would not deem it desirable to make a detailed statement about the countries visited or the results achieved.  The main purpose of the delegation was to establish initial contacts with the relevant people in the ministries and other organisations concerned with petroleum production and sales.  It is the intention that these contacts will be followed up by our own national oil company which has just now come into being.  The delegation was received in a friendly manner and I am satisfied that this was <Col N="2049" /> a satisfactory beginning in our dealings with the oil producers concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy whether he proposes to publish the agreement between himself and Aran Energy Ltd. to which he referred in his statement of 20 June 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No detailed, formal agreement has yet been concluded.  Having considered the request by Aran Energy Ltd. for support of their application to the Norwegian authorities, the Government agreed to lend support on certain conditions.  Subsequently, these conditions were expressed in a draft letter which was discussed between officials of my Department and the managing director of Aran Energy Ltd. Following these discussions, I received a <Col N="2050" /> letter from Aran Energy Ltd. indicating that the company accepted the conditions. That is how the matter rests at the moment.  It has yet to be settled whether the arrangements agreed will be incorporated in a more formal exchange of letters or in some other form of agreement. In any event, what is envisaged here is an option which may or may not be exercised by the State.</P>
      <P>The principal features of these arrangements have already been indicated to the House.  The nature of the representations to be made by the Government to the Norwegian authorities in support of the application was not specified but there had been some discussion of this with the company. In consideration for such support the State would be entitled to hold up to 51 per cent of the shares of the company formed to hold any licence granted by the Norwegian authorities and to exercise all voting and other rights appropriate to such a shareholding.  The ownership of hydrocarbons accruing to each party from any discovery in the licensed area would be in proportion to that party's percentage interest in the licensee company.  The State would have the right to purchase at prices to be negotiated any oil becoming available to Aran Energy Ltd. unless that company proposed to market such oil for consumption in Ireland.  I would have the right to require that all available oil should be refined in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Exercise of the rights afforded to the State would be open for a reasonable period from the date on which a licence participation might be offered by the Norwegian authorities in response to Aran's application.  In this way an opportunity is reserved for the Government before undertaking financial commitments to review the position in the light of the block or blocks in which participation might be offered by he Norwegian authorities and the work obligations or other conditions applicable. If the State decided to exercise its right to participate, it would be liable for its proportionate share of all expenditures and other obligations incurred by the licensee company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were certain supplemental <Col N="2051" /> provisions.  It is contemplated that, notwithstanding the State's controlling interest in the licensee company, Aran Energy would have some involvement in the management of the venture.  Aran would be free to pledge its share of any production as security for the financing of its proportion of any development costs arising, but the State would have no obligation to assist in this regard. Finally, it is made clear that the association between the parties in the joint venture would be limited to operations under the Norwegian licence and that Aran will have no special rights in respect of any other activities which may arise in connection with any licence that may be taken up.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister starts might I say I had a difference of opinion with him before we adjourned.  It was a misinterpretation on both sides.  The Minister referred to the date of purchase which I assumed was the date on which somebody became the owner of the house.  He has assured me in the intervening period that he was referring to the date on which vesting of the house was made in favour of the tenant.  In that case my argument does not stand up.  I was under the impression he was talking about what is normally accepted, the date on which it was purchased.  Would the Minister let me have one other comment? In the case of the people who under the 1973 scheme and since have been purchasing their houses outright does the 25 years apply?  If it does I have never heard of it.</P>

      <P>The 25 years applies from the date of the Landlord and Tenant Bill.  The 25 year period was brought in then.  In effect, it means that where a local authority sell a house to a tenant the sale might be in fee simple but special conditions regarding the consent to resale of the house operate for a period of 25 years from the date of the vesting.  The 25 year period starts, as the Deputy said a few moments ago, from the vesting.</P>

      <P>With regard to people who purchase houses now under the low rise mortgage scheme or any of those schemes and pay £7,000, £8,000 and maybe £9,000 for them, is it now intended that there will be a 25 year ban on the resale of those houses?  That appears to be what it is and I do not think that is what the Department would intend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Sales prior to the Landlord and Tenant Act were subject to the same conditions as they had been before that.  This 25 year period applies after that Act.  It is necessary, because of that Act, to ensure that over a period of 25 years if a tenant purchaser sold his house he would have to have the sanction of the local authority for the same two reasons as heretofore.  The first is that the purchaser would be an acceptable person to the local authority, that <Col N="2062" /> he would not be capable of going out and providing for himself.  By purchasing a local authority house he is purchasing a heavily subsidised house.  The second reason is that the person who sells that house would not again be a liability on the local authority looking for a further house.  It is to ensure the same protection as previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am hearing the Minister correctly there appears to be something introduced now which we knew nothing about.  Shades of the clawback.  I know the row that was kicked up, particularly in Dublin Corporation, particularly about the five-year clawback period. Now we have a situation when, apparently, the Minister is saying that, if somebody becomes the tenant of a local authority house and purchases that house from the local authority, he will not be allowed to resell it for 25 years unless he gets the OK from the local authority.  In other words, he can only sell it to somebody who would normally qualify for a council house.  It is being restricted to a class of people who might not be able to pay the full market value.  I was not aware of it, whether the principle is right or wrong.</P>
      <P>I was responsible for the arrangement under which houses are purchased and the change in money values is taken into account in order that people who are now purchasing houses are purchasing them at the price of the erection of the house updated to present-day values.  In other words, they are paying full price for the house.  Surely the Minister is not suggesting that only they and nobody else, Land Commission farms or anything else, are to be restricted in this way?  I am under the impression that the Minister is misinterpreting the thing.  If that is so I would like him to say so; or, perhaps, as he said, he would prefer to wait until later on this evening, whenever the next Stage is being taken.  I do not want to be told afterwards that we cannot now deal with it because it has already been passed by the House.</P>

The Minister has said that this Bill deals with the housing end of the matter and he is objecting to Deputy O'Brien bringing in some matter dealing with the Landlord and Tenant Act.  In this Bill the Minister proposes to alter the legislation dealing with building societies which is only three years old.</P>

      <P>There must have been some kind of collusion between the Department of the Environment and the Department of Justice to get this type of legislation.  I am sure the Minister's Department were consulted on this matter. The Minister should do something to rectify it because I do not think it would stand up in a court of law.  The Minister is seeking to impose an impediment <Col N="2064" /> regarding the sale of a house and restrictions are being placed on the kind of person who will buy the house.  I doubt the constitutionality of the provision.  It is not good enough for the Minister to wash his hands of the matter and to say that the provision is contained in the Landlord and Tenant legislation.  We are dealing with local authority houses and the Minister and his Department have a responsibility in the matter.  It is not good enough for him to say that it is the Department of Justice who are responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We oppose the section. Because of a backlog in the local authorities a person buying a house will have the option to do repairs and he will get some compensation from the local authority.  This may happen in a few local authorities but I should not like to see it legalised because it will give many of these bodies a way out of undertaking their responsibilities.  When they sell a house it should be in good repair.  If they cannot repair it I suggest they employ a <Col N="2065" /> local contractor.  If a tenant agrees to carry out repairs, eventually he will have to get a contractor to do the job and the local authority will not meet the cost.  It will be the start of the run-down of good housing stock and I object to that.  Once local authorities know they can do this, overnight all of them will be so busy with other matters that they will not be able to carry out any repairs.  There will be general decay in local authority housing.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that if the person does not carry out the repairs the local authority will have the right to carry them out but we were told in the beginning that the local authority cannot do that.  That argument does not stand up. If the local authority do not carry out the repairs themselves or get a contractor to do it, there will be a rapid deterioration in the condition of the housing stock.  It is up to the local authority to have the work done.  There should be no problem.  We can put in any kind of provision about what will happen to them if the repairs are not carried out but it will be ignored.  There will be a run-down of the housing stock and that is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this section the cost of the structural repairs will have to be agreed beforehand by the local authority and the tenant purchaser. There is no question of not refunding the money to the tenant purchaser if he carries out the agreed repairs.  If he carries out only partial repairs and the local authority complete the job, the tenant purchaser will be refunded for the repairs he carried out.  As far as I am aware, this arrangement to speed up purchase schemes has been welcomed by local authorities.</P>

      <P>I must disagree with the Minister.  If the local authority concerned are so busy that they cannot do the work themselves why not engage a small contractor to do it?  If the Minister persists with this arrangement there will be a gradual deterioration in our stock of houses.  That is why Deputy Fitzpatrick and I are opposing this section.  All the Minister is doing is legalising a practice that has been followed in several areas. Big bodies will shed their responsibility if we legislate for them to do so, and by legislating in this way we are opening the floodgates for local authorities to shed their responsibility in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The more one thinks about this situation, the more amusing it becomes.  The device of entering into an agreement with a tenant to carry out structural repairs is recommended because of the delays that have been experienced in the past in having this work done by the housing authorities.  We would be better engaged in pressuring the housing authorities to do the work rather than to provide for the remedy <Col N="2067" /> that is contained in this section whereby if the tenant fails to do the work it is handed back to the people who are not doing it now.  The subsection reads:</P>
      <P>If the tenant fails to complete the specified works to the satisfaction of the authority within the specified time, or such further time, if any, as may be allowed by the authority, the authority may carry out the work or such part thereof as has not been carried out and shall deduct from the sum otherwise payable by them to the tenant pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection the reasonable costs of any such works carried out by them ..</P>
      <P>That is amusing.  If the agreement is entered into and the work is not carried out by the tenant he will be given an extension of the time limit and, presumably, if he applies for yet another extension he will get that, too, but if at the end of all that time he has not carried out the work, the local authority are to be asked to do it.  We would be far better engaged in providing in this statute that the local authority should put the house in repair within a time stipulated at the time of the sale and that if they fail in that regard, they would pay a penalty of £x per week for each week of delay in putting the house into repair.  In that way we would be pressuring the local authority to do the work rather than acting as we are acting here by adopting an attitude of despair and saying that the situation cannot be dealt with in that way.  What we are saying here in this legislation is that the local authorities are not competent to do the work.  The reason for the uproar and frustration among people regarding these repairs is the failure of the local authorities to carry out the work.  In the same way there is despair and frustration on the part of people who have been promised isolated cottages because the local authorities are not building such cottages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It might shorten the proceedings if I say that there was no necessity whatever for this provision. This is because the onus is on the local authority to carry out the repairs and it <Col N="2068" /> does not matter whether those repairs are carried out by a contractor or by the tenant so long as the local authority are satisfied that the work is completed satisfactorily.  The responsibility rests ultimately with the local authority. Perhaps if there had not been any reference to this arrangement in the Bill we would not be spending a couple of hours talking about something that is in operation already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to now there was a statutory obligation on the local authority to put houses in order before purchase.  Under the optional arrangement situation it will be possible for the repairs to be carried out after purchase and the local authority can ensure that the work is done properly whether by the tenant, by the authority or by a contractor. The local authority can move in if necessary to finish a job that has not been completed.  The problem of delays in bringing houses up to the necessary standard is not general.  It relates mainly to Dublin and Cork.</P>
      <P>I have heard criticism here at Question Time regarding the Dublin situation. I do not know whether the difficulties in this area stem from a failure on the part of the corporation to find the type of small contractor to which Deputy O'Brien referred, but perhaps if a tenant opted for this other arrangement he could, with the agreement of the local authority, find a contractor to do the work.  The important point is that there is provision for this optional arrangement and this should result in this type of work being speeded up.</P>
      <P>Regarding the point raised by Deputy Tully about the statutory obligation on local authorities to carry out work before the house is purchased, the point has been made that in one instance the work was done without the involvement of the Department of the Environment auditor.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister who would finally determine when the repairs to the local authority house were satisfactorily concluded.  I have seen total disagreement in too many cases.  When contractors complete <Col N="2069" /> repairs prior to purchase, for many months and maybe years afterwards the dispute goes on that the local authority did not complete the repairs satisfactorily. Would the Minister think of having a independent engineer, or some person apart from the local authority engineer, or clerk of works as the case may be, to arbitrate in the case of indecision about a satisfactory conclusion of the repairs?</P>
      <P>I could not agree that a specified length of time should be imposed on the local authority in areas where it is difficult to obtain contractors.  In some areas there is not a suitable pool of labour, and there are not all that many people who are anxious to engage in this type of work where payment might not be sanctioned for quite a period.  I should not like to impose on the local authority a specified time for the completion of repairs.  How is it finally determined that the job has been completed satisfactorily? To date the local authority housing engineer and those who are assigned to the job in the housing department determine it.  Can we get away from the never-ending dispute that the local authority did not do this and should have done that.  People say: &ldquo;You see the condition of my house.  You see the dampness.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is yes.  It has always been possible to do this.  As the Deputy said, the local authority decide whether it is done properly, but the tenant purchaser always had the right of appeal to the Minister, and will still have the right of appeal, if dissatisfied.  Even under this optional scheme he will have the right of appeal.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I should have laboured this point more earlier on, but I should not like to let the section pass without making the statement that, before the houses are sold, they should be put into a reasonable state of repair.  &ldquo;Reasonable state of repair&rdquo; should be substituted for &ldquo;good structural condition&rdquo;.  The <Col N="2070" /> wrangle Deputy Taylor is talking about is a wrangle about what is structural and what is not structural, and the very minimum of repairs is carried out.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 6, after &ldquo;by the&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;insertion in subsection (2), after &lsquo;annulling&rsquo; of &lsquo;or amending&rsquo; and after &lsquo;annulled&rsquo; of &lsquo;or amended&rsquo; and by the&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section deals with regulations.  It amends section 5 of the 1966 Act.  Section 5 of the 1966 Act deals with the laying of regulations before this House.  I do not have to tell the House that this Bill is pickled with regulations.  Everything that will be done will be done by regulation. The grant will be fixed by regulation. Sections 4, 5, 18 and 20, which are four principal sections in many respects, are all operated by regulation.  The Bill is an enabling instrument giving authority to the Minister to do many things by regulation.  I will not go through every section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 4 he can fix the amounts of new house grants and the conditions on which they are paid.  In section 5 he can fix the amount of the grants for house improvements and the conditions on which they are paid.  In section 18 he can regulate the terms on which certificates <Col N="2071" /> of reasonable value will be given.  In section 20 he can virtually take control of all the building societies and other lending institutions so far as their lending operations for housing purposes are concerned.</P>
    <P>If section 5 of the Principal Act is amended as the Minister proposes to amend it, these regulations will come before the House and we will have to deal with them on a take it or leave it basis.  Deputies will have authority to annul them if there is a majority in support of annulment, or they can confirm them if there is a majority in support of confirming them.  They will have no authority to amend them.  The proposed regulations are so far-reaching and so unique that this House should have the power and the authority to consider them and amend them.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to confer on this House the right and authority to amend the regulations and to provide that, if the regulations brought in by the Minister are amended by the House, they will operate as amended.  That is reasonable.  The Minister is asking for very far-reaching authority and power.  He justifies that by saying the House will have an opportunity to look at the regulations and annul them if Deputies like.</P>
    <P>If a new house grant stands at £1,000 and the Minister decides to put it up to £1,200 and those regulations come before the House, Deputies will have an opportunity to accept the £1,200 or the £1,000.  Of course they will accept the lesser of two evils.  They are not likely to annul a regulation increasing a grant from £1,000 to £1,200.  They should have the right to raise it to £1,500 or £2,000, or whatever they think fit, or to change other regulations in regard to means, and so on.  That is what is involved in this amendment and I strongly commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important amendment.  We are getting the happy knack of introducing orders and regulations into legislation.  The House is being deprived of a function.  There are <Col N="2072" /> so many regulations in this Bill that it will be handy for the Minister to make a regulation and lay it before the House and the House can accept or annul it without having the power to amend it. That deprives people who are involved of their right to have somebody to speak on their behalf and suggest the amendment of whatever is brought before the House.  In section 14, subsection (5) reads:</P>
      <P>Regulations under this Act may provide for compliance by houses with conditions as to site, aspect, planning and number per hectare and with such plans as may be approved of by such Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister may make a regulation that we can build only eight or ten house to the acre.  That may be fine in certain areas but it would not apply in all cases.  Some regulations may have far-reaching effects.  I have no doubt that the Minister will introduce income limits for the £1,000 grant but, because of this provision we will not have an opportunity of suggesting amendments.  This is dangerous legislation and if we are not given time to put forward reasonable amendments we are in trouble.  It will be bad for the House to drift into the lazy attitude of changing legislation without considering reasonable amendments.  It is possible that the Opposition may not be anxious to amend a regulation but they at least should be given the opportunity of suggesting the amendments. This amounts to jackboot-type politics which I oppose strenuously.  I cannot see any reason why the Minister should object to our amendment because it is only right that the House be given an opportunity of suggesting amendments.  I hope the House will not end up as a talking shop.  Ministers should listen to reason in this regard.</P>

      <P>Since 1970 a number of changes in the system of grants and subsidies were made without any recourse to regulations.  Those changes were made by way of announcement.  After regulations are made they will be placed before the House for 21 days and the House has authority to annul such regulations.  I am advised that legally it is <Col N="2073" /> not possible to amend such regulations in the way suggested by the Deputies. For that reason I cannot accept the amendment.  I should like to make it clear that if the House considers that specific provisions in regulations should be amended I will give sympathetic consideration to revising such regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always felt that legislation by regulation was not good for a number of reasons.  Apart from anything else, if the Minister wanted to make a regulation now he could not do so until about next Christmas because of the 21-sitting-day provision.  If certain matters can be specified in legislation it is wrong that they should be introduced by way of regulation.  The Minister has stated, like all Ministers, that if there is a reasonable case made he will be prepared to consider it but the only proof that a Minister is prepared to consider a case is if he is prepared to accept an amendment.  I am not saying that the Minister is not being honest but to say that if a fair case is made he will consider it has no bearing on the issue.  The Minister has simply to say that he does not consider the case reasonable.  He is the judge.</P>

      <P>In relation to a point made by Deputy Tully on the making of regulations I should like to state that many changes took place without regulations.  The Public Accounts Committee drew attention to this fact.  If we had to legislate for all the changes since 1970 we would have had a total of ten Bills dealing with housing since then. <Col N="2074" /> Adopting the procedure I am proposing means that there will be more flexibility as well as a tightening up of the system. The method suggested is the best one. Amendments suggested will be given sympathetic consideration.  This amounts to a vast improvement on the position that has existed since 1970.</P>

The House should be made responsible for alterations and this is where I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that it is not the function of the House to make regulations. It is the function of the House to make law, and to voice their disagreement with a regulation if they wish.  The Minister, but not the House, makes regulations.  The House should have the right to say in which way regulations should be changed.  For that reason, while it is a bit late in the day, the Minister would be well advised to have another look at this aspect.

      <P>Deputy Tully would be the first to admit that when in Government he concentrated on inner city housing.  As it was costing more to develop this area it could be said that additional funds and grants were made available for that particular area.  When an area is decaying, as parts of the Dublin inner city are, special grants are required.  An inter-departmental committee were set up to deal with the inner city of Dublin and I presume the Minister will act on their recommendations.  Is that correct?</P>

On Second Stage I mentioned that some of this might be my fault and suggested that the Minister should have a look at site costs in the inner city.  By preventing people who bought sites for a few hundred pounds from selling them for £1 million, the Minister would be giving better grants, without any cost to the public purse, than he would by including this section.  I am not objecting to what he is doing.  While using this as a temporary expedient, the Minister must face the fact that somebody must deal with this question, otherwise we will have to pay a million a foot in that area before very long.</P>

      <P>I want to make two points.  While appreciating the merits in the amendment, as outlined in the examples given by Deputy O'Brien, I believe this amendment is potentially dangerous. While it gives the Minister power to introduce special additional grants&mdash;for instance, for Dublin inner city&mdash;it also gives the Minister or his successor power to exclude certain parts of the country from benefiting from a grant scheme of any kind.  A Government might decide to introduce a special grant and exclude Dublin city.  The way this amendment is worded will give a Minister power to exclude, say, the inner city of Dublin from any grant scheme and from the building any further public authority houses.  I am not suggesting the present Government will decide to do that but I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, if this amendment is accepted, the Minister will be given this power.</P>

      <P>The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>(4) Regulations under this Act may be expressed to apply either generally or to specified areas or to areas, houses, loans, persons, works or other matters . . . .</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Specified areas&rdquo; means that the Minister may make regulations which say that no further public authority houses are to be built in Dublin inner city because it is too costly, or particular loan schemes are not to apply to Dublin inner city because we do not want to see people living there, or no further works in relation to public authority housing should apply in Dublin inner city because it is too costly.  I am not suggesting that this Minister would decide to use the subsection in that way, but if the House accepts this amendment this power is being given to the Minister and his successors.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that there are grants which are applicable to rural areas as opposed to urban areas.  He gave as an example the essential repairs grants. Even in the implementation of that scheme there are grave injustices.  For instance, in Deputy Tully's constituency the essential repairs grant would apply because it is a rural area; but my unfortunate constituents, who live next door to Deputy Tully's more prosperous constituency, who live in areas like the Bogo'-The Ring, the Nag's Head, the Man-o'-War, Quick-a-Penny, not exactly urban areas and hardly congested districts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Experience in the past has shown that designating areas with special needs has been a good practice. One example that comes to mind immediately are the areas designated for special grants under the IDA.  There is nothing unusual about it.  On the point made by Deputy Boland that they might decide to go in the other direction with regard to the inner city, I am sure he does not really believe that, because, as was announced recently, there is already a commitment of £1 million to the new inner city area.  With regard to the inner city, the inter-departmental committee have been working for some time.  We are involved in that and we have made recommendations with regard to the inner city.  It does not necessarily have to apply only to the inner city.  There may be other areas such as those which the Deputy mentioned which could be included, like Deputy Tully's area, under this amendment.</P>

      <P>An example which is equally valid is that, if some Government were to decide that they did not particularly like the way the population of County Clare were inclined to vote, under this amendment they could decide to exclude County Clare from the provisions of a regulation that applied to the <Col N="2083" /> rest of the country.  At present if the Minister makes regulations they must be enacted in the country generally.  Now under the amendment the Minister has the power to exclude any area.  I was at pains to point out that I was not suggesting seriously that this Government might try to interfere with plans to revise Dublin inner city, neither am I suggesting that any Government would consider seriously excluding County Clare. However, I am making the point that a Government under the amendment would be empowered to do that.  That is a dangerous power to give to anybody.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Again by regulation we are putting in things that might have far-reaching effects. This could be lawfully written into a Planning Bill rather than a Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  It would be more pertinent to planning.  With regard to regulating the density and the number of houses that should be on a hectare or an acre, the Minister should be careful.  He should leave these matters to the planning authority because they are the people best suited and able to <Col N="2084" /> know what is good for their authority.  If the Minister makes regulations on this it may tie the hands of certain authorities. We in Dublin city would not be as concerned about density as would county authorities because we are caught up for land and land usage.  In inner city housing now we are building 20 and 22 houses to the acre.  That would have been heresy a few years ago, but it is now deemed good planning.  With what we are paying per acre in the inner city it is important that we use land wisely and well.  I am worried that the Minister may put in regulations that could upset this type of planning.  While is it good to have ten or eight houses to the acre, land is now becoming a scarce commodity, particularly in Dublin.  We will soon be down to Wicklow in building for Dublin city, and that is wrong.  We must have prudent use of land.  The people best fitted to make decisions on this are the planning officers in the local authority because they are aware of what the needs are.</P>
    <P>I would be afraid that this would be a general regulation which could have this far-reaching effect.  People would see eight houses per acre as an acceptable density which makes better living for everybody.  When we have the problem of a scarce and very expensive commodity, that is land, then we must design and plan our houses prudently and fit in as many as we reasonably can.  If our hands are tied with regulations, as would appear in this Bill, we could be running into some trouble.  I ask the Minister for his comments on this.  It has always been a problem in the city and also in the county, and we are building now basically in the county.</P>
    <P>We are constrained by the regulations under which the county operates.  We may want to build, say, 13 or 14 houses per acre and the county will say that their regulations and their planning department say that we can build only ten.  That is fine, but the day is coming when we will have to conserve land. With good planning and good architecture we can do both.  We can have a reasonably high density with good housing and we can maximise open spaces, but it is important that we do not abuse a very scarce commodity.</P>

This legislation, being the most recent, will take precedence over all the previous Acts.  I would hate to think that was the case.

      <P>If it is so aimed, should this not be stated?  As it stands, it has much wider implications and gives the Minister power to make regulations which seem to impinge on the housing and planning functions of the local authority.  It would also give him power to decide the maximum acceptable densities per acre in any area.  Surely it is the function of the local authority to decide on the housing density in their administrative area.</P>
      <P>With the amount of development taking place in County Dublin, we believe that any density higher than 10 per acre would result in overcrowded conditions which could easily reproduce the ghettoes which exist in certain other areas. We decided upon a figure which we regarded as being fair and reasonable from the point of view of the developer who wishes to get a reasonable return while allowing an acceptable amount of open space with the necessary facilities and amenities.  If the section is passed as it stands, it will allow the Minister to order an increase in housing density to 20 or 25 per acre and he would have power to override the decision of the local authority.  However unacceptable that might be in relation to local authority housing, where the Minister pays the piper, it would be too bad if the authority were to be told they were not allowed to set the maximum density for private housing in their area.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> As I understand it, this section is to validate certain rates remission given in respect of new houses as well as reconstructed houses and other houses. If the Minister would tell us briefly what is in it we might be able to agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Liability for the payment of rates in respect of domestic premises was transferred in full to the Exchequer as from 1 January 1978.  This section is necessary both to validate rates relief enjoyed by certain householders prior to that date, which is not provided for by section 33 of the Principal Act, and to ensure that the basis on which the Exchequer liability for the payment of rates is determined is the same as that which applied when householders were individually responsible for payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1979, section 3, required rating authorities, as and from 1978, to make an allowance against the rates payable on domestic properties, the domestic portion of mixed property, <Col N="2090" /> secondary schools, community halls and farm buildings not already exempted from rates.  Section 4 of that Act authorises an allowance of one quarter of the rates payable on such properties in respect of 1977.  Section 9 of that Act required the Minister to make a grant to a rating authority equal to the aggregate of the allowance made by them under the Act.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) validates the rates relief given in respect of new houses for which grants were not paid where a certificate of reasonable value or a certificate of exemption was granted in relation to the house, and a certificate was granted by the Minister stating that the house had been satisfactorily completed.  In effect, the section would confer the nine-year rates remission available under section 33 (1) of the Principal Act on houses in respect of which grants were not paid if, but for the income limits imposed between the period from January 1976 to July 1977 in relation to State grants for new houses, such a grant would have been paid.</P>
    <P>The benefit of rates relief under section 33 (1) of the Principal Act was confined, in the main to new houses in respect of which a grant was paid under sections 15, 16, 17, 18, or 20 of that Act.  In the case of grant applications received on or after 1 January 1976 where a certificate of reasonable value had not been granted prior to that date, eligibility for new house grants was confined to persons who were eligible on an income or valuation basis for supplementary grants from local authorities.</P>
    <P>These arrangements were, of course, superseded by the introduction on 6 July 1977 of the £1,000 grant scheme for first-time owner occupiers of new houses.  It was not intended, however, that persons who were ineligible for new house grants only because of the restrictions should also lose the benefit of rates remission.  This subsection, therefore, validates the granting of rates remission to such persons even though grants were not paid in respect of their houses.</P>

      <P>Yes.  This subsection also ensures that the Exchequer liability for the payment of rates on such houses consequent on the transfer of that liability as from 1977, partially, and 1978 in full, does not exceed the amount which would have been payable to a rating authority if the householders involved were liable for payment of rates.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides that where a grant was or is paid under section 6 of this Act in respect of improvement works to a house for the accommodation of a physically disabled person or a severely mentally handicapped person, section 33 (4) of the Principal Act shall apply, and be deemed always to have applied, in relation to the valuation of the tenement consisting of or including the house.</P>
      <P>Section 33 (4) of the 1966 Act provides that where a grant is made by a housing authority under section 21, 23, 25 or 32 of that Act to a person carrying out improvement or reconstruction works to a house, account shall not be taken of any increase in the value of the hours due to the improvement works in any valuation or revision of the valuation of the house coming into force within seven years after the completion of the improvement works.</P>
      <P>The benefit of this seven-year remission was also applied to improvement works which were carried out to facilitate physically handicapped or severely mentally handicapped persons and in respect of which grants were paid under the schemes introduced as from 1 February 1972 and 1 July 1975, respectively. Section 6 of the Bill provides the statutory basis for any such grants paid since 1 February 1972, and this subsection validates the application of section 33 (4) of the Principal Act to improvement works, in respect of which such grants were paid.</P>

      <P>This provides for a continuation of the remission situation and a validating of remissions previously granted.  Did the Department not come to an agreement with the local authorities in relation to the Department's funding of the domestic rate element of the local authority's revenue whereby certain remissions which still <Col N="2092" /> had time to run would be frozen at the level they were at at the time of the agreement?  In return for this certain other remissions, which would come on stream in the normal way, were to be disregarded and the Department were to pay the rating authority on the basis of the full valuation.  It strikes me that the provisions of this section and allowing this section to continue into the future in respect of future remissions could affect the amount of moneys payable by the Department on foot of that agreement to the local authorities on their revenue account. I would like the Minister to clarify the situation in that important regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right in what he says about the freezing of those remissions.  The primary purpose of this is to validate those very special cases, such as those I mentioned.  If we did not validate those special cases the people would apparently be liable for the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that entirely everywhere in the section where it says &ldquo;a grant was&rdquo;.  When it says &ldquo;or is&rdquo; that appears to seek to continue that provision into the future.  If that remission is being continued into the future when it is now the Government who take up the domestic rate element of the local authority's revenue account, the local authorities will suffer a reduction.  They accepted that existing houses, which had remission, were to have their valuations frozen at that stage of remission, six-tenths, five-tenths or whatever it was in perpetuity in return for that apparent loss to the local authorities because those houses should have been going on year by year in further one-tenths until they came on to the full stream.  The Department undertook that no further remissions were to be granted and the Department would pay on the basis of full valuations on all new houses.  This section appears to disagree with that agreement between the local authorities and the Department on foot of the Government deciding to take on the domestic rate element of the local authorities' budget  <Col N="2093" /> to validate this with regard to the physically handicapped people referred to.  They must have accepted the situation but we will check the point made by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it in relation to what has already occurred but I am concerned about the future financial arrangements and what might occur in the future.  The householder is no longer interested because as far as he is concerned the domestic rate element is picked up by the Government.  This section appears to be granting to the Government a remission on the domestic rate element in the case of certain tenements or hereditaments.  The only ones who would suffer would be the local authorities.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I understand the Financial Provisions Act last year froze the remission of rates at the fifth year.  It also provided that in respect of new houses they would be subject immediately to full rates and that would compensate the local authorities for the loss they sustained under the other Act.  Deputy Boland's problem is that this Bill seems to continue the remission and the local authorities will be losing money, which was not the intention.  The Deputy's suggestion is that the full rate should be payable on this immediately and refunded by the Department to the local authority.  This would seem to amend what we did last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 50, to deleted &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 60 (8) of the Housing Act, 1966, provides:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of determining the order of priority to be followed in the making of lettings to persons in accordance with the relevant schemes under this section the housing authority shall obtain and have regard to a report from their chief medical officer.</P>
      <P>This deal with the allocation of houses. We know this is a very sensitive operation and that local authorities and local representatives want all the assistance and protection they can get in discharging their obligations in this regard because otherwise they will be accused of being unfair or of discriminating in the discharge of their duties.  I have always thought that a great safeguard for a local authority was to have a report from the medical officer and the 1966 Act so provided.  The allocation of houses was done on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister proposes in section 16 to make optional the obtaining of a report from the medical officer.  A points system that operates in all local authority areas is invariably based on a number of matters including the health of the applicant and his family and the condition of the house in which they are living.  When the health of an applicant or of some member of his family is to be taken into account, in my opinion the only person qualified to report confidentially on that&mdash;and this is very important&mdash;is the county medical officer.  He does not have to specify that a child of the applicant is suffering from a certain disease; he simply certifies that in his opinion and on medical grounds the applicant is entitled to a house.  If we take <Col N="2095" /> this function away from a medical officer and hand it to a lay person, whether he is an executive of a housing authority or a health inspector, I think we will be going too far.  I understand there has been a demand for it from executives of some housing authorities.  One of the reasons given is that some counties do not now have a county medical officer of health&mdash;I think the title now is director of medical care.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about this matter. I think the report of the medical officer should be obtained in all cases because the points system invariably operates on matters which include the health of the applicant and of his family and the suitability of the house.  To take this away from a medical officer is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments mean a continuation of the existing system.  I must oppose the amendments.  The provisions of section 16 stemmed from discussions on certain aspects of housing policy which took place in April 1977 involving county and city managers, assistant managers and senior officers of my Department.  In reviewing the operation of section 60 (8) of the 1966 Act in the light of the transfer to health boards of functions previously exercised by local authorities, the city managers generally considered that it was still desirable to have the advice of a medical officer of health of a health board for the purpose of letting houses and in that event the local authority should be required to have regard to the advice.  On the other hand, many county managers referred to lengthy delays in getting reports from health boards under section 60 (8).  They pointed out that in many cases the staff of housing authorities could perform these duties effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16 meets both points of view. The housing authority can either adhere to the present arrangement, which is in line with amendments Nos. 9 and 10, or alternatively they can perform the function themselves.  I am anxious to facilitate both arrangements.  I have every confidence in the ability of local authorities to decide on the arrangements best suited to their local needs in <Col N="2096" /> the light of their own experience.  Where a local authority decide to perform the function in question themselves, I feel I can rely on the integrity of the officers of the local authority and the elected representatives.</P>
    <P>There have been delays with regard to the allocation of houses because the health officers are no longer officers of the local authority and it can be that from time to time they have what they regard as more pressing duties to perform than doing the necessary reports. Possibly this has been happening.  If city managers, for instance, so wish they may continue to request a medical officer to make a report.  However, we may be placing too much emphasis on the medical officer aspect because those of us from rural areas in particular know that these reports are not always made by medical officer, that they are made sometimes by health inspectors who are not qualified medically but who, nevertheless, are health inspectors. Therefore, the medical reports that local authorities have received in the past have not always been prepared by medically qualified persons.  However, the option is there to use either system. In the main rural county managers say they are in favour of using an officer of their councils while the city managers seem to favour the medical officers, but both situations are covered in the section.</P>

      <P>I can accept what the Minister is saying but I would be concerned regarding the provision that evidence submitted shall go to the medical officer.  I submit that every medical certificate or report must go to the chief medical officer.  That might prove a little awkward but medical evidence should not be dealt with cursorily by some official who would not have medical knowledge and who might say, on reading a report, that the medical officer would not have any regard to the type of illness involved.  We <Col N="2097" /> must be careful to avoid that sort of situation and that is why I should like to hear the Minister on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put more doubt in my mind.  I am asking that in the event of a medical report being submitted, it should go to the chief medical officer rather than that an official of the Department should read the report and say that Mrs. X is suffering only from so and so and that a doctor would write off that certificate.  That would be a dangerous situation.  Where a medical report is submitted either with or in pursuance of an application for a house I am asking that it should go to the medical officer.  Officials in the Department are not competent to deal with medical evidence.  If a medical report is submitted it is not for a local representative to ensure that it goes to a medical officer.  That would be loading the public representative with further duties and that is why I say that the wording should be changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; in respect of a report being sent to a medical officer of health. Deputy Boland put a doubt in my mind about the amendment, but I am glad now that I tabled it because the Minister seems to be of the opinion that a medical report may not be forwarded to the medical officer because some official in the Department might so decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that in Dublin city once a <Col N="2098" /> report from a medical doctor is received either with or in pursuance of an application, it is referred automatically to the chief medical officer of health and that officer in Dublin is a very busy man, but at least he examines such reports.  The danger in the provision here is that some official in the Department, may decide, for instance, that Mrs. Murphy has bronchitis or is suffering from nerves and that, therefore, her right to a house is not furthered on that account. Lay personnel are not competent to assess medical reports.  I am sure that the medical profession would object to any provision whereby lay personnel would adjudicate on medical reports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We could have a situation in which a medical certificate was submitted with every housing application and we all know that, regrettably, it is not very difficult to obtain a medical certificate.  I would visualise a situation where the local authority could request a seperate medical report from an applicant if they so wished apart from employing the health officer, but apparently it is the intention in Dublin and Cork in particular to continue to use their health board officers.  Perhaps many other local authorities will do likewise.</P>

      <P>Yes.  He is not asked to report on the actual living conditions. Having examined the health inspector's report, and having looked at the file, he then looks at the medical certificate and makes a report.  Up to quite recently, the chief medical officer of health did this on his own.  He now has an assistant.  He did it on his own with all his other duties, and it did not seem to impose all that much hardship on him.  We must consider the size of the local authority we are talking about and the number of people on the housing list.  I am aghast to think that, in other areas, they want to opt out of their responsibilities and be lazy, and decide they will not take action for one reason or another.  I take a very serious view of this.</P>

First the medical certificate is submitted and then he looks at his files to see where the person is living and allocates so many points.  What is to prevent an officer of a council from paying the same attention to the medical certificate&mdash;which seems to be the important thing in this issue&mdash;and looking at where the person lives and, having been there himself, allotting, say, seven points?  He has a greater knowledge because he has visited the actual location.</P>

      <P>Medical people use a shorthand for certain diseases which have certain specific physical consequences which I would not be aware of, and which no lay person would be aware of, but which would be instantly and automatically recognised by a medical officer.  Doctors differ in the way in which they deal with medical certificates. A doctor might write down the Latin name of a disease which neither the Minister, nor I, nor any official would be aware of, which would have specific muscular side effects affecting whether a person was capable of going up and down the stairs and therefore was eligible to be housed on the top floor of a block of flats or required priority to be rehoused on the ground floor.

      <P>My recollection is that the Minister said an official in a local authority housing department who has the file and the medical certificate, and who is familiar with the area and may have visited the home, is better able to evaluate and adjudicate on the medical requirements of that person than a medical officer.  I suspect the Minister does not fully understand the implications of what he is saying.  If that is what he is saying, he should consult with the Irish Medical Association, the Local Government and Public Services Union and the other people directly involved, because the implications are horrendous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister apply the same logic with regard to certificates of <Col N="2102" /> reasonable value if he had no quantity surveyor?  I know he has only one quantity surveyor.  Would he apply the same logic to certificates of structural worthiness for buildings?  Would he say a lay person could look at the building, the steel and the specifications and determine whether the structure was safe? The Minister is tearing up the whole basis of technical expertise upon which a modern technological society like ours depends.</P>
    <P>What is the role, if any, of a medical officer in allocating medical points for someone seeking a transfer or the allocation of a local authority house?  The effect of the amendment proposed by Fine Gael, as distinct from section 16, is to make the obtaining of a medical report mandatory as distinct from optional. The vast majority of transfers are brought about as a result of medical factors. I dealt with two transfer cases this morning at 9.30 a.m. with the CMO in Riverside House.  I brought them to Dr. O'Donnell and he carried out a physical examination of one applicant, an elderly man, and made an assessment of his capacity to go up and down the stairs.  Is the Minister saying anyone in a housing department could do that?  They could not.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about medical people becoming allocating officers in local authorities.  Some officials of housing departments may feel they are being replaced by a CMO or a medical officer, but that could be got over by redesigning the scheme of letting priorities, and not by saying lay people can do the job of medical people.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at this between now and the Report Stage.  It should not be contentious.  At local level in the largest local authority Deputy O'Brien and I have more experience than the Minister.  We are former chairman and vice-chairman of the housing committee and I can say modestly we know what we are talking about in this area.</P>
    <P>Medical factors are very important in large urban areas in relation to transfers of local authority tenants.  I shudder to think of a manager using section 16 to the extent that he would refuse to obtain medical reports because his reading of it <Col N="2103" /> would be that he does not have to get them because the Act states that he &ldquo;may&rdquo; obtain them.  That would mean a lot more work for local representatives who have too much to do and are voluntary. It is not possible for every local representative to be at Riverside House at 9.30 on Wednesday mornings because they must work also.  It is putting too much of a load on a voluntary local democracy to put the onus on local representatives.  It has been suggested that we could use a section 4 to get a medical certificate but there are only 12 occasions in a year when a council can use a section 4.  It must be remembered that council meetings in Dublin conclude at 10 p.m. and that county councils finish late in the evening.  That is sledgehammer work for representatives. I cannot understand why the Minister is resisting the acceptable amendment.  At least the Minister should look at all the implications of it before Report Stage.  I am disturbed by the Minister's comments in reply to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan):</i> For the second time during the Committee Stage debate we are changing procedure because things cannot be done by local authorities.  We changed the method of putting houses which are sold into a state of structural repair because it takes local authorities years to do that work and now we are approaching the sensitive operation of letting houses.  It appears to be the intention to take the consideration of sensitive medical matters, which may involve a discussion between a medical person and an applicant on the state of the applicant's health out of the hands of doctors and put them into the hands of a lay person who is unqualified and does not understand medical conditions.  It appears that that is being done because there are delays at local authority level. That poses the question: are the public getting the sort of service they should be getting from officers and officials?  In my local authority area a doctor visits the house concerned but I accept that in Dublin that would be impossible. However, it is strange that in the cities of Dublin and Cork where there are thousands <Col N="2104" /> of houses to be let the county and city managers want to retain the system laid down in the 1966 Act which we are now being invited to change.  The number of houses being let in counties like Clare and Cavan are very few and it is not a trojan job for a medical officer to inspect the houses involved.  It must be possible to inspect all applicants within a short period.  There are also very few rural cottages to be let.</P>
      <P>I do not want this job entrusted to health inspectors because they are inclined to take the view that Establishment is right and the applicant is not. This is not a task for a lay person.  It involves more than a medical certificate.  I was perturbed to hear the Minister treat medical certificates very lightly; he seemed to regard them as confetti.  An assessment of an applicant with a medical problem involves a discussion between the doctor and the applicant. Such applicants cannot be expected to discuss their medical condition, or the medical condition of their children, with unqualified lay people.  That is not reasonable.  Applicants should be able to discuss in confidence such matters so that all matters can be taken into consideration in an application for a house. As far as I am aware, the existing practice has worked well but if certain medical officers are not doing their job that is not a reason for taking this duty from all medical officers.  It is however, a reason for ensuring that all medical officers do their job.  I am convinced, having listened to the debate, that &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be replaced by &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>They were in favour of continuing the existing system.  Most of the county managers favoured the change while city managers wanted to continue the existing arrangement.  All applications for rehousing at present are referred to the medical officer.  However, <Col N="2105" /> since the change over to health boards, and due to a number of other factors, we have had exasperating delays in regard to the allocating of houses.  In many applications for rehousing there is no reference to medical grounds.  The small percentage who would be claiming rehousing on medical grounds could be looked after in a different way.  This could be catered for by way of amendment on Report Stage which would leave the choice to each local authority as to which system they would operate.  We can include a provision that only where an applicant is claiming rehousing on medical grounds the local authority should request a report from the medical officer rather than have every application going to the medical officer which would lead to further delays.  This would cover the medical point.  I suggest that I bring in an amendment on Report Stage to cover a claim for rehousing on medical grounds.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This section gives the Minister authority to direct local authorities to sell or not to sell a specified class of house.  I take it that the direction not to sell is meant to protect special classes of houses such as houses for invalids or old people.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>Section 90 of the Principal Act shall apply, and be deemed always to have applied, to a building consisting of a house and a shop, together with any outoffice, yard, garden or other land appurtenant thereto or usually enjoyed therewith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection is intended to remove doubts as to a housing authority's powers under section 90 to sell a house which includes a shop.  Section 90 of the Principal Act enables a housing authority to sell or lease any dwelling provided by the authority under the Act, of which they are the owner. <Col N="2107" /> Doubts were raised by Dublin Corporation as to whether that section would apply to a house which included a shop. The Minister was advised in 1977 that a house which included a shop would come within the terms of section 90 and the corporation were informed accordingly. It was also indicated that in order to remove any ambiguity in the matter, provision would have to be made in the next opportune legislative proposals to meet the point.  This subsection provides accordingly.  In the case of any dwelling provided or to be provided by the housing authority, the authority is empowered under section 56 of the Principal Act to provide roads, shops, playgrounds, places of recreation, parks, allotments, open spaces, sites for places of worship, factories, schools, offices and other buildings or land and such other services as will in the opinion of the authority serve a beneficial purpose in connection with the requirements of the persons for whom the dwellings are provided.</P>

The object of providing a house plus a shop is to provide an amenity in the housing estate for the residents.  There seems to be some doubt as to whether authority was given under section 90 to sell these houses.  Is there a provision for ensuring that these buildings will continue to be operated as a shop or to provide the service which they were built to provide.  If a house cum shop were sold and the new owner decided to discontinue the shop and use it as a private house, the area might be deprived of this convenience or amenity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure why the Minister is introducing this section giving himself the power to direct a housing authority to sell or not to sell any class of local authority housing.  I would refer the House back to what the Minister <Col N="2108" /> said on this section on Second Stage at column 1112, Volume 315, of the Official Report of 27 June 1979:</P>
      <P>At present, a housing authority have discretion under section 90 of the 1966 Act as to the sale of any of their houses.  I want to ensure, however, that special, purpose-built houses which would normally be unsuitable for family use&mdash;one example would be elderly person's houses&mdash;are not lost from the rented local authority housing stock.  On the other hand, I should like to make sure that most local authority tenants will be afforded an opportunity of purchasing their houses.  Towards this end, section 17 of the Bill enables the Minister to direct an authority to offer for sale, or not to sell, as the case may be, houses of specified classes.</P>
      <P>That is what the Minister indicated as being the reason for it.  I commented at that time that it seemed to be an extraordinary lack of trust in the local authority to decide whether they should retain that stock themselves or whether it would be in the best interests of housing in that area to sell it to the tenants or the occupants. The decision to sell or not to sell ten or 15 local authority specially-built houses for disabled or elderly people would be much better made on the ground by the local housing authority than by the Minister and his officials in a central Government Department.  I do not see why the Government need this power, and the Minister has not justified it.  Are there any instances in the files of the Department which indicate that a local authority have behaved irresponsibly in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil policy is to sell without a clawback, without any kind of adjustment, as much local authority housing as possible.  Most councillors, and indeed the Labour Party as well, agree that when people have a degree of ownership in their property it is better maintained, is of a higher standard, that the housing stock, as such, benefits, as do the occupants from living in a better maintained property.  Indeed every specialist housing conference I have ever attended has clearly validated that viewpoint, of giving the occupants some degree of <Col N="2109" /> ownership over and above their weekly tenancy.  That would be the alternative at issue.</P>
    <P>The critical point is contained in subsection (1) (b) under which the Minister will now have power to direct a local authority not to sell housing on the grounds that they may be selling off specialised housing which should not be lost to the local authority area.  Unless the Minister can refer to specific examples that have come to the notice of his Department, I feel this is an unnecessary power.  It is further centralisation, further bureaucracy, increasing the process of alienation&mdash;under which an inspector will drive down for the day to, say, Deputy Fitzpatrick's constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, inspect a small housing scheme in a town there and, on that basis, return to Dublin, draw up a report which will land on the Minister's desk advising him to direct the local authority not to sell the houses to the people involved. This could apply equally to any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>It is my view that the officials and local representatives on the ground are in a much better position to decide whether or not those houses should be sold.  I do not see why this extra power should be given.  It erodes further the powers of local government and the authority of local representatives and their officials.  I should like the Minister to justify, in much more specific terms than he has done already during the course of the Second Stage debate why he wants this power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is designed principally for the purpose of ensuring that specially built houses for specific people, or elderly persons' dwellings are not lost to the housing stock of any local authority.  In that way there would be a loss to a local authority in regard to a house built for a person in that category. The Deputy asked if there were specific examples of that having happened.  I cannot give him any specific examples but there have been inquiries made from time to time.  In every housing scheme it is intended that a number should be built specifically for elderly people.  It is desirable to ensure that those houses are <Col N="2110" /> retained in the housing stock, thereby being available for other elderly people.</P>
      <P>It is not really a matter of trusting or distrusting a local authority.  There are no examples of it having happened. There were some inquiries, not many, made over a period of years.  Therefore, it was considered desirable to ensure that such housing would be retained by local authorities at all costs for the purpose for which they were built.</P>

      <P>That is a clear indication that it is not the intention, nor do I believe it would be the intention because of the very nature of the dwellings.  I fail to understand why we must stitch into this Bill power to the Minister or his Department instead of delegating that power to the local authorities, leaving them to take the decisions which, because of their knowledge, I believe would be the right ones.  Subsection (1) (b) reads:</P>
      <P>direct a housing authority not to sell a house of the authority of such class as may be specified in the direction,</P>
      <P>and, while speaking about this, the question of the sale of small flat schemes arises.  Has the Minister any particular views in this area given that he has taken upon himself power to make orders in other areas?  Has he a particular view on what should be done in this area of housing stock, bearing in mind that one section of housing stock can be sold and another cannot?</P>

      <P>Flats can be offered for sale.  As I have said, it is not a matter of trust or mistrust of local authorities.  I fail to understand what is wrong with copper fastening a situation in which one retains houses built for elderly people, ensuring that they are retained specifically for that purpose.  I do not see what objections there can be to so doing and I doubt if any local authority will object to having it written into this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have an objection in principle.  I do not see the point of having a dog, then spending a lot of time barking oneself, and paying officials in the Custom House to do so, when they could be better employed administering other parts of the governmental system for which the Minister is responsible and which are not being as speedily tended. It would be the view of the Labour Party in relation to our general attitude to local government, that in a matter like this, it is absolutely gratuitous to take upon oneself the power to direct a local authority to sell or not to sell a house.  If one wanted to be in the position of expressing one's interest, there is a system of housing circulars which could be used or, alternatively, it could be re-phrased that the Minister may advise a housing authority to do this, so that the validity of a circular could be seen in the context of one's overall concern, because the capital provision for such housing comes from central Exchequer funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It constitutes a further erosion of the power and responsibility of our local government representatives.  It is little wonder that, in many instances, they have been reduced to being a spectacle of fun in Hall's Pictorial Weekly and others.  In every instance a man must be sent to Dublin to ascertain whether or not this or that can be done.  In my view the Minister has not justified it.  It is basically a question of trust.  Either one has public representatives elected at local level who know what they are at, who give a service to the community, who are better advised and informed, more capable of judging and, in the final <Col N="2112" /> analysis, accountable in a way that no official from the Custom House is for any decision they take.  In a sense that is being taken away from them.  Now a directive will be issued from Dublin: sell or do not sell, bringing us back to more and more centralisation.  I cannot help thinking that there is steamed into the plaster of the Custom House&mdash;and it was not burnt out in 1921 when the IRA did burn it down&mdash;a colonialist attitude imbued with the spirit of: do not trust the natives with anything for fear they would make a mess of it.  This is just another example of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any evidence of a colonial attitude in the Custom House&mdash;and I have been around there now for two years&mdash;I fail to see where it exists in the area for which I am responsible.</P>
      <P>With regard to directing&mdash;as the Deputy puts it&mdash;a local authority not to sell a certain type of house, the type about which we are speaking are those built specifically for elderly people.  It is not the first time something like this will have happened with regard to local authorities and this type of house.</P>
      <P>During his term of office my predecessor insisted on sending a circular to all local authorities advising them not to dispose of this category of house.  I do not know if it was his intention to have this embodied in the Housing Bill but I wanted to draw the Deputy's attention to that fact.  I fail to see what objections there can be to copper-fastening the situation to ensure the retention of these houses by local authorities for elderly people.</P>
      <P>I have no evidence of any of these houses being disposed of but inquiries were made from time to time.  Perhaps that was why my predecessor saw fit to issue a circular.  We are not interfering with local authorities by doing this.  If it is written into an Act we are enabling them to retain these houses rather than subjecting them to pressures to sell to a tenant or anything like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The circular to which the Minister referred dealt with the sale of local authority houses and had the clawback recommendation.  That clawback <Col N="2113" /> was accepted by every local authority with the exception of Dublin.  I vigorously opposed that view and felt that the clawback was morally right.  However, the majority of the councillors&mdash;wrongly, in my view, but they were democratically entitled to make the decision&mdash;made a decision in that area. Because one local authority went against a decision of the Custom House this section is being introduced.  It will make it possible for a Minister to direct whether the sale of local authority houses will take place.  This is unnecessary.

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 18</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  The Minister shall make a decision on an application for a certificate under paragraph (a) of this subsection and notify his decision to the applicant within 21 days of the receipt by him of the application and if he refuses the application, he shall specify in the notice of refusal, particulars of his reasons for such refusal and should the Minister fail to make a decision on the application within the said period of 21 days, the application shall be deemed to have been granted.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 18 deals with certificates of reasonable value.  The object of a CRV is to ensure that house purchasers get reasonable value for their money.  We are 100 per cent in favour of a policy which will provide more houses for more house purchasers and which will provide those houses at a reasonable price.  We do not want to create a situation that may in one way or another make it more difficult for people to get houses.  By increasing prices and creating a scarcity of <Col N="2114" /> houses on the market instead of providing houses at a reasonable price, the CRV could have the effect, if not properly operated, of driving numbers of building contractors out of the housing market.  If it does that the result of the operation will be the direct opposite to that intended by the Minister and the drafters of this Bill.  The system of certificates of reasonable value must work in a reasonable way and must be seen to work reasonably.</P>
    <P>My information about CRVs is that in some cases there have been inordinate delays in obtaining decisions from the Minister on these certificates.  It will be no answer for the Minister to suggest that the average delay is so and so. Averages prove nothing in the end and they certainly prove nothing where one is dealing with a large number of individual applications, because the number which sail through as a matter of form will pull down the average time and make the waiting period look reasonable.  I am told, and I accept, that there have been cases where there were months of delays and there may have been a large number of houses involved.</P>
    <P>The next thing I am told which causes frustration and makes it impossible for building contractors to operate the system in a reasonable manner and to get on with their work is that when a CRV is refused no reason is given by the Minister.  When the applicant asks the official why it was refused he is not given any reason.  That seems to place the applicant in an intolerable position.  It would appear that if the Minister refuses an application for a CRV he or his own officials must have considered, broken down the price and come to the decision that something was wrongly priced, or that some item was too highly priced; but that information is not given to the applicant.</P>
    <P>I am also told there are apparent inconsistencies and inequities in decisions where different builders have applied for CRVs in respect of similar houses in similar locations and the Minister refused to discuss them or give reasons for them.  Reasons are much more necessary and important now than they ever were before.</P>
    <P>I understand that under pressure the <Col N="2115" /> Minister is bringing in an amendment to give the right of appeal to the Circuit Court by a person who has been refused a CRV.  I will deal with that later.  How in the name of goodness is a judge of the Circuit Court or any other appeal tribunal to deal with an appeal from the Minister if he does not know the Minister's case?  In his amendment the Minister has set out that an officer of his Department may appear before the Circuit Court and be heard there, but I imagine that a judge of any other appeal tribunal going to adjudicate on the refusal by the Minister of a CRV will have before him the applicant's case. Surely he will want to know the Minister's case and why he refused.  Up to now CRVs covered only about 33 per cent of the houses that have been handled by building societies.  As from now the proposal is that they should cover 100 per cent of these applications. However, if they do not work, that will create chaos rather than bring down the price of houses.</P>
    <P>Section 18 (1) (a) enables the Minister to grant a CRV on an application from an applicant.  The amendment in my name and the name of Deputy F. O'Brien proposes to add a paragraph (b) which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  The Minister shall make a decision on an application for a certificate under paragraph (a) of this subsection and notify his decision to the applicant within 21 days of the receipt by him of the application and if he refuses the application, he shall specify in the notice of refusal, particulars of his reasons for such refusal and should the Minister fail to make a decision on the application within the said period of 21 days, the application shall be deemed to have been granted.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The effect of that will be two-fold.  It will speed up the process of application for a CRV and will ensure that the Minister or his Department will deal with it within 21 days.  Secondly, it will provide that if the Minister refuses the application for the CRV he shall specify to the applicant <Col N="2116" /> his reason for so doing.  The effect of that will be that if the application is refused the applicant will get reasons for that refusal and he will know where he stands.  He can then consult his quantity surveyor or other expert and decide whether the Minister is right or whether he himself is right.  He can decide whether the Minister's proposal is fair. In the light of the information which he then has, he perhaps would go back to the Minister and say &ldquo;I still do not agree but I am prepared to come down to so and so if you are prepared to increase the estimate to so and so&rdquo;.  If all else fails then they will have the homework done for an appeal which can be brought and which, I hope to suggest to the Minister later, shall be processed quickly.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt at all that if the present unsatisfactory system of dealing with applications for CRVs is continued it will not be in the interest of house buyers or house builders because there will be fewer houses on the market and the prices will perhaps go up in the long run instead of coming down.  There does not seem to be any good reason for the attitude of the Minister in refusing to discuss his reason for refusing a CRV.  I think that what I have said is fairly clear and I would welcome the Minister's views on it when he thinks fit to intervene in this discussion.  I do not want to talk just for the sake of talking.  I have put the case as clearly as I can and I will deal with the Minister's objections if he does not tell me that he is prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that this amendment is designed to help builders who are applying for CRVs by ensuring that they get decisions inside three weeks or, if they are refused CRVs, particulars of reasons as stated.  While I sympathise with both those aims I am not convinced that the acceptance of the amendment would in the long run be desirable as far as the builder is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal first with the question of imposing a statutory time limit and I will give the reasons why I am opposed to the idea.  Firstly, timewise a satisfactory standard of service has been provided to date and this is due partly to the absence of rigid time limits and the consequent <Col N="2117" /> flexibility which the present system allows. Last year almost 2,400 decisions were issued and the average time taken for a decision was only 15 days.  In May of this year the average time taken was only 12 days.  The number of cases taking more than a month is very small &mdash;about one in 20 according to a recent check&mdash;and would normally involve some abnormal aspect which might necessitate a site inspection.</P>
    <P>Secondly, even if one were to accept the idea of a time limit, it would have to run from the date of receipt of all necessary information, not from the date of application since applications are frequently incomplete.  The level of information may vary from one case to another depending on the amount of detail needed to justify the price, unusual aspects and so on.  At present many of the requests for further information and clarification are made on the telephone or during interviews when it is easier to explain what is involved and quicker than making a formal written request, as the amendment would require.  For example, during the recent postal difficulties the informal approach was of great benefit to the builders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I hope that is not going to be an annual occurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirdly, a time limit like 21 days might in exceptional circumstances be impossible to meet, with resultant granting of CRVs by default, which I am sure the proposers of the amendment would not welcome.  I am talking about a short-term situation which might arise following a decision to extend the CRV system with a resulting increase in the volume of applications. We have to be realistic and recognise that it is extremely difficult to recruit the professional staff needed, particularly quantity surveyors.  In any event the Minister is answerable to the Dáil for any undue delays.</P>
      <P>To sum up in regard to the question of having a statutory time limit, I would suggest that the imposition of such in this section would not improve on the present standard of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2118" /> The second part of this amendment would require the Minister to give details of reasons for refusing CRVs.  At present the only reason given is the obvious one that the price exceeds the amount appearing to the Minister to represent reasonable value.  I am aware that many builders feel they should be given particulars of the reasons but it is not as easy as it may seem at first sight.  I might mention that my predecessor, Deputy Tully, resisted similar requests.  Strictly speaking, the concept of the house and site as one unit being reasonable value for a certain price does not permit one to give a specific reason, such as that the land was too dear or overheads too high. In the final analysis the cost of the various elements is irrelevant as long as the total price is reasonable.  It often happens that a builder has paid over the odds for a site but, because of economy of building and management operations, succeeds in getting a CRV.  Indeed, the information given by builders is often so inadequate or the price breakdown so different from the Department's approach to the calculation of reasonable value that it is not possible to pin-point accurately which elements are making the price higher than that which appears reasonable.  A builder's actual costs plus overheads and profit need not necessarily represent reasonable value.  Other factors such as efficiency and good buying practices are also relevant.</P>
    <P>A further point is that to go into detail about reasons for rejection would be tantamount to publication of the Department's criteria for the assessment of reasonable value so that builders would know the Department's figure for reasonable value before applying.  This would, in effect, put the Department in the position of fixing prices and this would not be a desirable situation, especially since the majority of prices applied for are lower than would be approved by reference to these criteria and the net effect might well be to push up prices.</P>
    <P>To impose a statutory requirement about particulars of reasons would mean that the Department would in every case have to look for much more detailed information from the builder than he has to submit at present or even than he may <Col N="2119" /> have at his disposal, though such information may not be necessary at the moment to enable a CRV to be granted, as is the case in the vast majority of applications. The provision of such information would add to builders' expenses, impose additional disciplines in their operations and delay the whole process. It would not improve the position for the vast majority of builders.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would suggest that the need for such a concession, if one could call it that, is now less acute in view of the additional safeguard being proposed in amendment No. 23, namely, the granting of the right of appeal to the Circuit Court against the refusal of a CRV. Also of relevance is the fact that the detailed basis of the calculation of reasonable value is at present being reviewed with the involvement of a prominent quantity surveyor nominated on a confidential basis by the Irish House Builders' Association.</P>
    <P>Having said why I am not in favour of making the giving of reasons a statutory requirement.  I will consider in the context of forthcoming discussions with representatives of the house builders the possibility of indicating to applicants in a broad and less formal way which particular element appears to be making prices unreasonable.  I would stress again that in the vast majority of cases being examined at present it is not possible to say why the price is not reasonable because of the lack of information from the applicant.  These discussions will be relevant only in cases where sufficient information is available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asking that the decision on these applications be taken within 21 days.  The Minister has informed us that the time taken is generally less than 21 days but still he will not accept the amendment.  Builders to whom I have spoken have all stated that they have experienced much longer delays.  In my opinion the Minister will not accept the 21 -day situation because the number of CRV applications would flood the Department.  He has admitted that it is difficult to get trained and competent staff.  He knows that he would not be able to fulfill the terms of the amendment. <Col N="2120" /> The Minister says that the average time taken is 15 days and the 21 days provided for in the amendment must be adequate.  We are saying that this should be the maximum statutory time and house builders, together with the CIF, would accept that.  We are in favour of CRVs but we want the system to function in an orderly way which does not cause hardship to those within the building industry.  The Minister talked about the right of appeal to the Circuit Court and we will discuss that further later.</P>
      <P>With regard to the giving of reasons for the refusal of a CRV, it is quite easy for a person within the Department to refuse the application because he has not taken into account the full facts of the case.  That is bureaucracy at its worst.  A person who has invested his capital in housing development deserves better treatment.  The National Prices Commission do not treat an applicant in such an arbitrary fashion.  They listen to the case put forward and give reasons for refusing price increases.  If a division of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy can operate in this way, I do not see why the Department of the Environment should be exempt from treating people in a fair and just manner.  People would know where to begin in amending their prices.  They would know what the problem is and would not be in the dark. It is not good enough to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  When the Minister gave a decision on a planning appeal he gave his reasons why it was turned down.  A person can look for CRVs for 100 houses at a tremendous cost and after a few weeks he can be just told that he will not get the CRVs because the price is too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have put in this amendment to get a quick decision.  The Minister says that his decisions are quicker than what we are looking for.  Because you have to wait 21 days does not mean that the decision is not made until the 21st day. The decision could be taken on the second day or the third day.  The onus is on the Department that if they do not make the decision within 21 days by default the CRV has to be issued.  This is the same as in a planning application to a local authority.  If the decision is not made within the statutory period it goes <Col N="2121" /> by default.  The Department are being made responsible for their actions by making them give their reasons for refusing to grant a CRV.  If they are not made give their reasons they are not made responsible for their actions.</P>
    <P>A number of people have said to me that many small builders may go to the wall as a result of this arbitrary method of dealing with this.  They say they are not against the CRVs, so there is no quibble about CRVs.  If builders go to the wall because of this, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, we will have less house building.  It is supply and demand which controls prices regardless of what the Minister or his Department might like to say.  If the Minister because of actions he will take forces people out of building houses, obviously houses will become a scarce commodity.  The question of scarcity, regardless of what type of CRVs the Minister devises, will cause prices to rise.  They are high enough today without going any higher.  The cost of housing now varies from one area to another.  It used to be 65 per cent for labour and materials and it is now roughly about 35 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I am asking that the decision be taken within 21 days, is because, despite what the Minister says, long delays are causing undue hardship on many builders.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, averages are all right; but many people have had to wait six weeks and eight weeks for decisions. We put the 21 days into the amendment to ensure that the Department are forced to make decisions in a fairly quick way. When this Bill becomes law, because of the upsurge in applications for CRVs, they will not be dealt with in 21 or in 28 days.</P>
      <P>There is no reason why the Minister could not accept our amendment.  He did not give us a clear reason other than saying that our amendment would mean that decisions taken on CRVs would take longer.  The builder is in the dark if he is not given the reasons why the CRV has been refused.  I do not believe the Minister's Department have any criteria. I believe they only have a rule of thumb in relation to this matter.  The Minister is not wise to turn down our amendment. People who invest large sums of money in housing are doing a public service by providing houses.  They do not appear to be getting fair play and justice.  That is all they are looking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agree with the principle of CRV but we consider the administration of the system is wrong.  Although the Minister did not say so, he appeared to consider that there was some merit in what we were saying.  The CIF issued an advertisement in the newspapers last week indicating that there was lack of communication. One would have imagined the Minister would have consulted them before bringing in the legislation.  If he <Col N="2123" /> did that it might not have been necessary for us to put down this kind of amendment. We proposed a period of 21 days but they might have advised him on a better course to adopt.  I shall deal with this and other matters on the section later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment relates specifically to the administration of the system of CRVs.  We should be clear about this.  One weak but understandable line of defence for the Government would be to attack Deputies on this side by saying we were against the system of CRVs.  I said on Second Stage, and I wish to repeat it now, that the Labour Party are not against the principle of the certificate of reasonable value.  It is a form of price regulation as distinct from price control and, consequently, it is a form of consumer protection.  The principle of the CRV is not at issue and I understand that it is not an issue with the CIF either.  What is at issue is the administration of the system.  Because of subsection (2) and because of the implications of section 20, the lending agencies will be directly concerned with the administration of CRVs and the whole question of the administration of the system is central to this discussion. For that reason the amendment is very important.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes to replace what the Minister considers to be the reasonable legislative framework for the administration of CRVs.  The section states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... the Minister, on the application in writing of a person who appears to the Minister to be providing for sale a new house, may, subject to compliance by the person with the provisions of this section, grant to the person in respect of the sale of the house a certificate (which shall be known as a certificate of reasonable value and is in this section referred to as &ldquo;a certificate&rdquo;) stating that the house appears to the Minister at the time of the granting of the certificate and on the basis of the information available to the Minister at that time to represent reasonable value for the <Col N="2124" /> amount specified in the certificate, and specifying such other matters, if any, as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Minister may simply indicate that it appears to him to be of reasonable value. It does not indicate the form, the time or the framework within which such communication should take place.  The amendment attempts to put some kind of framework for the communication of that comment by the Minister.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister referred to section 18.  At column 1114 of the Official Report of 27 June he stated:</P>
    <P>Broadly, section 18 has two main purposes: first, to empower the Minister to require that certain loans by lending agencies for the purchase of new houses cannot be made unless a CRV is obtained; and second, to impose clear obligations on builders in relation to the construction and sale of houses for which they have obtained a CRV and to enable the Minister to take effective action against those who fail to fulfil these obligations.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody would disagree with that, but we are disagreeing with the manner in which the CRVs are currently administered.  The effect of this legislation will make the application of the CRV system more critical and central to the provision of housing.</P>
    <P>We can only fully understand how important the administration of the CRV system is if we recognise that since this Government came into office and since they adopted a particular housing strategy designed basically to reduce local authority housing to the level that the then Leader of the Opposition referred to in December 1976, they have concentrated their efforts on the provision of housing in the private sector.  Consequently, they have pegged money for local authority housing and they are depending on the private sector to provide the balance of the housing.  I hope the Chair is not concerned about the relevance of this on the section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to facilitate the Chair by coming quickly to the point of the amendment.  The experience of the last two years, as evidenced by the report of the Central Bank and by others, is that the private sector housebuilder because of difficulties in the administration of the CRV has tended to build more expensive houses, has tended to move up-market to such an extent that the sector of middle-income housing is not being adequately provided for by the private sector.  This is specifically because the administration of the CRV system was so apparently difficult for the builder to work with. Moving to a more expensive kind of house enabled the builder to get a CRV or to convince the Department that the house concerned qualified for such a certificate.</P>
      <P>That shift in housing policy, which has been regretted by Government spokesmen, which has been referred to in the last report of the Central Bank and which I have put on the record of this House in a housing debate, has brought about a shift in the allocation of housing resources for middle-income people largely because of the administration of the CRV system.  This amendment proposes to change the framework within which that system must be administered so that two things will occur. The builder can calculate the time in which he will get a reply from the Department and he will know that there will be certain categories under which the reasons for refusal will be indicated. I cannot see why the Minister will not accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The costing of a house is done on the basis of taking into account the various elements of the structure so that the categories as set out in a bill of quantities are already there.  There is no question of having to invent those categories. <Col N="2126" /> The categories of costing as sub elements and as major elements are understood by the industry, so that a builder looking at a price under any such system of building elements will understand it readily and be able to relate it to estimators or to quantity surveyors that he might engage.  Therefore, the system for categorisation of the breakdown of the cost of an application for a CRV exists and is not in dispute.  Perhaps the eminent quantity surveyor to whom the Minister referred operates on some such similar system.  There should not be a problem there.  I suggest that some system of approch of elementary costing such as the one I have described is being used already by the Department in relation to CRVs.</P>
    <P>The other factor relates to time.  If, as the Minister assures the House continually, the average time involved is only 15 days, one might ask what would be the problem in respect of 21 days and, and if 21 days is too tight a time perhaps on Report Stage we could talk in terms of 28 days.  What is being sought here is the principle of a builder knowing that he will definitely have a reply within a fixed period of time.  That fixed period of time where it applies in relation to planning applications is a very important factor because people know exactly where they stand and can do their sums in relation to bridging finance, of closing dates of sale and so on.  Time is money and there is nothing more horrendous than going to a lending agency or to a bank and presenting them with a situation in which there is no control over the time involved.  That is the sort of situation that is being maintained by the Minister in this instance.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions I have castigated the Government on their management of the housing market.  In relation to this amendment specifically I would say that, if the Minister failed to satisfy the House and refuses to accept the spirit of this amendment, there will be chaos in the house building industry. I use my words carefully because nobody can estimate what the form or shape of that chaos is likely to be. However, we know that if an open market situation is distorted, as the private house building market is distorted, <Col N="2127" /> with these kind of controls, the effects of that distortion can be severe. In previous experience in an open mixed economy such as ours those people who are weak economically and who are vulnerable and who, in the context in which we are talking would be perhaps desperately in need of housing without adequate resources to rented accommodation, are the ones who will suffer most.  They will suffer in a variety of ways because of the maladministration of the Department in relation to the CRV system.</P>
    <P>The Minister's long and prepared response to the amendment in the names of Deputies Fitzpatrick and O'Brien has not dealt with the central issue.  On the question of reasons for refusal, the Minister states that if the Government were to indicate the reasons for refusal on a category basis and by implication to suggest certain upper limits or maximum amounts for certain categories, whether in respect of external walls, internal partitions or whatever, these maximum figures would automatically and immediately become the minimum figures and that consequently the price of houses would increase because builders, through their own contacts and associations, would discover very quickly that the maximum price being allowed for substructure under the CRV system was so many £ per square metre and that, therefore, a CRV application in respect of that figure would be successful.  That is a very naîve argument.  I assume that that is the argument for justifying the refusal to give itemised reasons for refusal, but that argument is not sufficiently strong and will not necessarily stand up.  The whole question of price regulation is one that has been monitored and considered in a major way by the NPC.  There is sufficient experience in this country as well as in other countries to enable us to devise a scheme that would make it possible for the Department to give reasons for refusal without inflating the market price of houses.</P>
    <P>On the question of time the Minister has not responded to the right of a person to be notified of refusal within a certain period.  He has simply reassured <Col N="2128" /> the House that the average delay is 15 days.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, averages do not mean much to those people who must wait a long time for notification.  The Minister has justified the delay in those areas by saying that the applications were drafted inadequately, that they did not contain adequate information and that, consequently, it was impossible for the Department to evaluate them.  However, the Minister is responsible for planning as well as for housing in this context and he knows that, in respect of an adequately drafted application for planning permission which operates within a fixed legal time frame, the application can be, as is the case often, referred back to the applicant on the basis that it did not contain sufficient information.  The simple application form that one receives from a local authority states clearly what items of information are required.  There is no reason for a similar approach not being adopted in this instance and that such information as cost per square metre, elementary cost and so on would be sought.  That sort of information could readily be supplied.  The problem of the possible inflating of the market could be overcome by giving specific cost reasons for refusing an application.</P>
    <P>The time question is such that many builders who operate on bridging finance lent by the short-term money agencies need desperately to know what the time factor is in relation to their operations. Fianna Fáil are supposed to be the capitalist party in this House.  They are supposed to understand how the system works.  Many Deputies in Fianna Fáil are involved directly in house-building organisations of one kind or another.  I cannot understand that they seem totally unaware of the constraints and difficulties under which private &ldquo;spec&rdquo; builders are operating.  It is not my brief to defend private &ldquo;spec&rdquo; builders.  They can do that very well themselves.  It is my job as an Opposition Deputy to assess the administration of a Government policy for which the majority of the Oireachtas have voted.</P>
    <P>The refusal by the Minister to entertain the Fine Gael amendment seems to display a total lack of understanding of the real problems which confront a section <Col N="2129" /> of the house building industry upon which the industry greatly depends.  The two requirements of this amendment, the reason for the refusal and the time framework, are eminently reasonable and would lead to a much clearer scheme within which the Government's strategy of relying upon the private sector of the housing industry could operate.  I cannot help thinking that the Minister's refusal to entertain these amendments shows that his reasoning is clouded by administrative difficulties for which he is responsible and which have nothing to do with the principles of the amendment.</P>
    <P>If it is a matter of staff shortage, and therefore the implications of a 21-day time limit could be quite serious, the Minister should say so.  He has indicated that he has difficulties in getting trained personnel.  I know he has only one quantity surveyor servicing the CRV applications. If that is the problem we can deal with it as a fact.  We can say that people are not necessarily in the right grade, or getting the right money.  It might be done by way of consultancy, or making extra money available, or transferring the matter from the Department of the Environment to the National Prices Commission with a joint industrial and departmental committee overseeing it.  The fees which we will be dealing with in a later amendment could be used to fund it.</P>
    <P>One is drawn to the conclusion by inference, because the Minister has this difficulty, that the Department are still hung up in a 19th century belief that all technical grades must be locked into the status of the highest engineer and that, if you change the status of any technical person, everybody from the janitor upwards will automatically seek an improvement to maintain the differential. That system of engineers rising to the top of the pile and holding down grades with special skills in the Department should not be used, as it has been used all too frequently in the past, to deprive local authorities and the Department of essential skilled personnel.</P>
    <P>I have made a detailed and rational case in favour of a framework which would give the builder the time within which he could plan his operation for CRVs, organise his bridging finance and <Col N="2130" /> his working capital, and also a system whereby if a house was becoming too expensive in certain areas he could decide to change the standard of finish or reduce the floor area.  No serious arguments have been put forward by the Government as to why this amendment should not be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given my reason in some detail as to why I cannot accept these two amendments.  They are valid reasons, and they are valid now as they were before these further contributions were made.  Deputy O'Brien alleged that the Department had no criteria for the assessment of reasonable value.  I want to say quite clearly that, as the Minister responsible, I would not stand over such a situation, nor indeed would my predecessor, Deputy Tully, or his predecessor, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Molloy.</P>
      <P>There are very definitive criteria and they are applied uniformly without fear or favour right across the board.  I mentioned that in my original contribution and I said also that the Coalition Government consistently refused to give reasons.  At least I am now making two important changes.  I am providing the right of appeal against a refusal, and I intend to disclose the full basis of CRV calculations on a confidential basis to a person nominated by the CIF.  When this Bill becomes law, I will be prepared to discuss with the CIF how we can improve the administrative side of getting out the CRVs.</P>
      <P>As I said, in May the average time was 14 days.  Only one in 20 went over 28 days, which is a very small percentage. I gave reasons why some went over 28 days: inadequate information and having to seek further information.  If we were to write out to all the applicants this would add to the delays.  During the postal strike we were able to contact the applicants by telephone.  This cut down the delays which would have been involved. No major delay is involved.  The average in May was 14 days.  Last year it was 21 days.  That is an improvement. One in 20 go over 28 days.  The average is a fairly true guide there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn warned me that if I do not accept these two amendments the <Col N="2131" /> building industry will be in chaos in a short time.  I should like Deputy Quinn to explain why it has not been in a state of chaos since 1973 when the same two factors existed with regard to time.  The amount of time taken to process applications has improved drastically. Disclosures were not made over that period, but the industry did not fall into a state of chaos.  I have made two improvements. I am providing the right of appeal in a later amendment and I am disclosing on a confidential basis to a person nominated by the CIF the manner in which the calculations are made.  I cannot accept these two amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> To use a cliché, the Minister's attitude on this amendment represents bureaucracy gone mad, bureaucracy having taken control of everything and thinking they are infallible. The Minister asked Deputy Quinn why chaos did not prevail since 1973.  At the height of the certificates of reasonable value, not more than 50 per cent of houses were affected by them. For the past few months only about 30 per cent of the houses built were affected by CRVs.  The manner in which the CRV system has been operated has driven builders out of the more modest type of house building and into more expensive house building not effected by CRVs.  That is the reason why chaos did not rule supreme up to the present.  As far as one can judge, the Minister now wants to take practically 100 per cent of the houses being built into the CRV net. I am not objecting to that if it has the effect of reducing the price of houses and does not result in fewer houses being built.  I am aware that it is the Minister's policy to cut back on the number of houses being built in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential, from the point of view of house purchasers and builders, that the system proposed by the Minister works smoothly and is acceptable to all concerned.  If it does not work we will have chaos with the interests of house purchasers and builders not being served.  How can such a system work smoothly if a person is obliged to apply for a certificate of reasonable value but <Col N="2132" /> does not have a right to expect a decision on that application until such time as the machinery available to the Minister is ready to process that application. If there are complaints with only 30 per cent of new houses being subject to certificates of reasonable value how many more delays will there be when three times as many houses will be subject to CRVs?  How can the Minister expect that system to work smoothly when an applicant must wait until the Minister thinks fit to grant his application.  It must be remembered that the Minister has the necessary staff or machinery to move speedily in this regard.</P>
    <P>How can that system work smoothly if, when an application is refused, that applicant is not given any reason for that refusal but is simply told that the house does not represent reasonable value?  The only reason the Minister can give for not giving any reasons is that to do so he would have to have more information from applicants.  In my view that means that applicants are not being properly processed and that the Minister is simply coming to a decision without adequate information.  The Minister told us that he is providing an appeal procedure but we all know that an appeal to the Circuit Court may not be held for some years by which time the whole ball game may have changed.  That is a laugh; it is meaningless.  Our amendment is reasonable.  There is a precedent for imposing a time limit in the Act which deals with planning and development. Under that Act a decision must be given within two months.  It provides that the Minister may seek further information and that the time only runs from the submission of a proper application.  When an application under that Act is refused reasons are given.  That Act also provides that if a decision is not given within the stipulated time the application shall be deemed to be granted.  That has worked reasonably well to date.</P>
    <P>The Minister is adopting a new procedure to control housing prices.  We are in favour of that because prices have gone stark mad but the Minister will not benefit the purchaser by introducing a system that is doomed to failure before it is introduced.  He is aggravating that problem.  He will not encourage builders <Col N="2133" /> to stay in that business if he is going to make it impossible for them to carry on. The Minister has given a typical Ministerial reply: &ldquo;leave it to me and everything will be all right.&rdquo;  There is no doubt that within 12 months of the passing of this Bill there will be chaos in the building industry and only the very wealthy will be able to build houses without loans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a precedent for this in the Acts dealing with planning and development in that a decision must be reached within two months.  Prior to that when an appeal was referred back to the Department it could have rested there for six months or a year.  It is obvious that the reason for not accepting this amendment is that the Department will not accept any constraints that might be imposed on them.  It is time for the Department to get their house in order and start making decisions and considering people who have invested large sums of money in houses and are awaiting certificates of reasonable value. It seems that the only reason that this amendment will not be accepted is because the Department will not accept any arbitrary constraints put on them to make a decision.  That is a sad reflection on the Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister tried to justify it by giving averages, but he was not at all convincing and he will not convince the building industry.  The Minister will not accept a reasonable amendment.  This amendment would impose a certain discipline on the Department in relation to decision-making so that their <i>laissez faire</i> attitude towards decision making would be changed.  It does not matter to the officials of the Department; they do not have overdrafts on which they have to pay substantial interest.  This amendment would ensure that decisions are made quickly in the best interests of house purchasers and house builders.  I would urge the Minister to reconsider his opposition to this amendment, because if it is accepted CRV's will work in an orderly and fair fashion.</P>

      <P>The Minister is probably familiar with a memorandum from a building organisation, Lyons Industrial Estates, which was circulated on 9 July last to the Minister for the Environment, Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick the Fine Gael spokesman and to me.  In relation to the administration of the CRV's and in direct reference to the amendment put forward by Fine Gael I would like to put on the record what this organisation had to say in relation to the whole matter.</P>
      <P>Having read the Official Report of the Dáil debate on the Second Stage of the proposed Bill we would respectfully suggest that at Committee Stage the following matters be considered and provided for by way of amendment:</P>
      <P>(a)  The Minister should be obliged in notifying a builder of a refusal of a CRV to state the reasons for his refusal.</P>
      <P>(b)  A builder who has been refused a CRV by the Minister should have a right of appeal against the Minister's decision and a proper forum should be established to which the builder could appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2135" /> (c)  We suggest that the National Prices Commission is the most suitable organisation to deal with appeals. The Minister's suggestion of a right of appeal to a court seems to be impractical.</P>
    <P>(d)  Time limits should be imposed on all aspects of decision making relating to CRV including the Minister's decision and any subsequent appeals.</P>
    <P>We hope that these suggestions made in a constructive manner meet with the approval of the legislators.</P>
    <P>Presumably the Minister got a copy of that memorandum, as did Fine Gael. The matter of CRVs has been going on for a long time.  They are an instrument of a policy which is not questioned.  I would have thought that the Fine Gael amendment which takes up the points made in the submission I have just read out, and my argument would have been sufficient to persuade the Minister to consider how he might deal with this on Report Stage.  I am not looking for a great dramatic political victory, I am simply forced on to the conclusion that whatever the Minister may say in relation to the administration of the CRVs the facts are, from the representations we are getting as legislators, that all is not well.  The building industry is not in the business of making gratuitous representations and it is not in the business of getting worked up about these things or in the business of contacting the Labour Party to intervene on its behalf with Fianna Fáil to make the system of CRV administration work that much better.  I regret that for <Col N="2136" /> whatever reasons the Minister is unable to accept the amendments.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he has moved somewhat on the suggestion that the eminent quantity surveyor would make a report available to the CIF outlining the structure of costings and the items of costings that are taken into account when a CRV is made.  These renewed discussions and meetings with the CIF in some shape or form are an indication of the capacity for the Minister to sit down and talk on this question of CRVs.  There is a solution to this problem, but it is a matter of negotiating. This should not be frozen because of entrenched positions taken up by either sides.  I readily accept that on the builders' side a lot of people who do not want the CRV at all have taken up entrenched positions and refuse to deal in any shape or form with CRVs.  I accept the criticism the Minister has made in relation to builders who did all sorts of tricks to circumvent the principle of the CRV.  If we do not get the administration of this system right the housing market will be distorted.  We already saw the first evidence of that distortion by the removal from the modest house building sector of builders who were building modestly priced houses in the private sector.  As Labour Party spokesman for housing and environmental matters generally, I know that a consequence of that has been that people cannot buy modestly priced houses in the private sector and they are driven on to the local authority housing lists, which are getting longer by the day.  The Dublin Corporation list is approximately 9,000 as against 6,000 a year ago.  The overall consequence of that is that people are finding it more difficult to obtain housing, and that is my concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 13, lines 37 to 54, to delete subsection (2) and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  (a)  Regulations for the purposes of this subsection may specify the loans to which this subsection applies, and the specification may relate to all loans or to loans that do not exceed a specified amount or to loans that are not less than a specified amount or to loans that do not exceed a specified amount and are not less than another specified amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  If and whenever regulations for the purposes of this subsection specifying the loans to which this subsection applies are in force, a loan so specified shall not be made by an assurance company, a bank, a building society, or other industrial or commercial organisation or a housing authority (hereinafter referred to as &lsquo;the lender&rsquo;) in respect of a new house unless the person who made the application for the loan furnishes to the lender either a certificate in respect of the sale of the house, or a certificate of exemption in respect of the house, and the <Col N="2141" /> provisions of any regulations for the purposes of this subsection are complied with.</P>
    <P>(c)  A person who contravenes paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this technical amendment is to enable such regulations as may be made by the Minister to be applied to all new house loans advanced by the agencies concerned or to new house loans of an amount within whatever range the Minister considers appropriate at the time.  The amendment is designed also to ensure that the expression &ldquo;the lender&rdquo; applies to a housing authority.  The amendment also clarifies the point that the controls will operate only when regulations under subsection (2) are in force.  During the course of my speech opening Second Stage I said that I would like to make it clear that I do not envisage that whatever form of house price control is implemented following the enactment of the Bill will remain unaltered indefinitely. A flexible approach must be adopted and controls adjusted in consultation with the interested bodies to take account of changing circumstances.  It is conceivable that the controls could be dismantled from time to time.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> In one way I welcome the amendment because it replaces section 18 (2) (a) which I cannot understand at all.  I am not too clear what the amendment means but it is certainly an improvement on that drafting.  I would like the Minister to explain exactly what is involved in 2 (a).  It says:</P>
      <P>Regulations for the purposes of this subsection may specify the loans to which this subsection applies,</P>
      <P>I understand that,</P>
      <P>and the specification may relate to all loans</P>
      <P>I understand that,</P>
      <P>or to loans that do not exceed a specified amount.</P>
      <P>That is understood,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2142" /> or to loans that are not less than a specified amount or to loans that do not exceed a specified amount and are not less than another specified amount.</P>
    <P>I am accustomed to jargon all my life and I have digested a fair amount of it in my time, but I find it difficult to understand in plain language what that means. Perhaps the Minister could tell us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    </Speaker>
    <P>May be Deputy Quinn has a better mind for mathematics than I have.  Certainly that is beyond me.  I could understand if the Minister had said merely that the regulations may specify what loans in respect of which it would be necessary to <Col N="2143" /> get the CRV.  I would understand that, but I do not understand this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I believe the Minister does not understand it and I do not blame him in the slightest.  I sympathise with him for having to bring it in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to my mathematical ability, I probably have as much as the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, which indicates my limitations in this matter.  I do not understand the full implications of what this means other than that it means you can do pretty much all things.  That is what it is constructed to mean.  It would be up to a court and legal experts to look at any regulations that the Minister may draw up and see whether those regulations were in compliance with this.  Really it is simply enabling legislation.  Other than that it proposes to enable the Minister or a Minister to draw up regulations to determine the kind of loan that can be made by a lending agency, there is nothing much wrong with it in principle.</P>
      <P>What does concern me regarding the amendment is that on subsection (2) (b) some clarification is required at this stage by the Minister.  The subsection states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) If and whenever regulations for the purposes of this subsection specifying the loans to which this subsection applies are in force, a loan so specified shall not be made by an assurance company, a bank, a building society, or other industrial or commercial organisation or a housing authority (hereinafter referred to as &lsquo;the lender&rsquo;) in respect of a new house unless the person who made the application for the loan furnishes to the lender either a certificate in respect of the sale of the house, or a certificate of exemption in respect of the house, and the provisions of any regulations <Col N="2144" /> for the purposes of this subsection are complied with.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points there on which I would like clarification.  First, at what stage in the process of loan application-making-granting does the Minister expect a lender, in this instance, to look for the CRV?  Is it at the approval stage?  Is it at the closing of the sale?  Is it at the hand-over of the building society cheque in return for the title deeds from the previous owner? That is quite critical because it is another certificate that enters into the whole process of conveyancing.  While it relates simply to new houses, and therefore the title in most of these houses is not very complicated as compared with old houses, it nevertheless is another certificate. It affects quite directly the cash flow the lending agency would have.  I accept that the regulations would make that quite clear, but the Minister should clarify the point.  It has been raised by people directly involved in housing finance.</P>
    <P>Section 18 (2) (b) refers to the different people who may make a loan and specifies the normal categories and &ldquo;other industrial or commercial organisations&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that.  If a firm which is not a finance firm but a large company of some kind or a professional partnership, say, an architectural practice, make a loan either to a member of their own organisation or an outside person, are they subject to the same requirements as an orthodox lending agency?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to answer two questions.  At what stage is a CRV required by lending agencies in the process of making loans?  What kind of organisation has the Minister in mind apart from the type of organisation specifically mentioned in the subsection?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This covers industrial or commercial organisations who make house purchase loans available, such as ACC, commercial banks or other firms. I cannot give the name of any particular firm.  The subsection also empowers the Minister to specify in regulations other requirements concerning the operation of the controls&mdash;for example, requiring <Col N="2145" /> the lending agency to ensure that the price being paid is not in conflict with that approved by the CRV or that the copy of the CRV presented has been properly authenticated.  It is not envisaged that any other statutory requirement will be imposed on lending agencies for the purposes of this subsection.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked at what stage the lending agency would require a CRV. This is entirely a matter for the agency. They could give loan approval subject to production of the CRV at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I had intended to raise that point either on this section or later. Building societies and other lending agencies are very concerned about the time of the handing over of the CRV.  If it is not to be handed over until the mortgage is taken up it means that the building societies will not know until the last moment what their commitments are and what ready cash they will require to meet a given number of loans. They will not know until the applicant's solicitor comes to their solicitor to close the sale whether they can make the loan. That situation is quite unreasonable.  The applicant for the loan may have sold an existing house or may have made arrangements to get married and he will not know until the last moment whether he is to get the loan.  On the other hand, if he has to produce the CRV at the time of application it may be a long time before the house is built and the whole situation may have changed by the time the loan has to be collected.  That matter will have to be further scrutinised on the section and it is not as clear as the Minister seems to think.  Grave difficulties may be created for building societies if they are not presented with the CRV until the mortgage transaction is to be closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one school of thought which holds that the CRVs should be provided at planning stage and that planning permission should be given subject to a CRV being obtained by the developer in respect of each house on the site.  I know this would probably mean an amendment of the Planning Act, but there is <Col N="2146" /> much merit in this suggestion because it might control the price of land as well. This is a very complicated matter which is causing concern to building societies and other institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be difficult to justify the argument that the CRV is more appropriate to the planning application, which might be in respect of a house which would not be built for, say, two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I took the same view as the Minister when I first heard this suggestion but the provision is that the amount of the CRV would not be fixed.  It would be a condition that a CRV would be obtained in respect of each house when it was built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not seem to me to be practical.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): On further consideration it would seem practical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point about the production of the CRV to the lending agency, there is nothing to stop any lending agency approving a loan subject to the production of the CRV at a later stage.  They approve loans all the time subject to proper title.  There is ample time between approval and release of the loan to produce any documentation which would be required.  Many borrowers have to obtain bridging finance while awaiting release of their loans.  It would not present any difficulty to approve a loan subject to production of a CRV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There is now a sellers market and people applying for a loan can be told that their application will not be processed because they have not a CRV.  Deputy Fitzpatrick's point about getting the CRV as early as possible should be examined.  It is a matter of <Col N="2147" /> concern to building societies and reinforces our point about the 21-day period.  People may get loan approval subject to a CRV and the builder's application may be turned down.</P>
