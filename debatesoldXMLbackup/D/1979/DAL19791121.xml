      <P>I welcome the move by the Minister to increase the ceiling of borrowing from £350 million to the present £600 million.  This will increase the maximum borrowing guaranteed by the Minister for the same amount.  I am convinced that at this moment this is a good development.  Down the years the ACC have given an excellent service to Irish farmers at a time when commercial banks were very hesitant to do so.  I will take the mind of the House back a few years to the time when land was really value for money and when the merchant banks did not have the confidence that they should have had in Irish agriculture. The ACC at that time, with very limited resources, did tremendous work.  It was not merely a question of lending money. They had as well to provide advisory and assessment services.  This is an area where, through no fault of their own, they have been falling down.  They had to be able to size up a farmer's ability to pay and the ability of his farm to produce the necessary finance to meet his commitments.  Certainly with the limited resources they had, they have been doing a tremendous job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been fortunate that the ACC were able to recruit the right type of people into the various offices.  We have to look at the ACC as a semi-State body, and the tendency in such an operation is to be cautious, in fact to be so cautious as to do nothing.  However, in my long experience of the ACC, and I have borrowed from the myself, I have found that, on the contrary, we have men of vision who, long before the EEC came the way they have, had confidence in the Irish farmer.  We must remember that in those days we were dealing in a very limited market place, basically the English market and the home market. <Col N="2085" /> We had to get into the English market by subsidy.  Even then, at a very vital time in agriculture development, the ACC inspired farmers.  Anything we can to to provide money for farmers is a step in the right direction.  Admittedly, at the moment farmers are receiving the money at exorbitant interest rates, which is very worrying for them.  A farmer has got to pay back one-fifth of every £100 he borrows for the use of that money for one year.  If the ACC are to continue to fulfil the very excellent role of a lending agency for farmers this aspect of their work will have to be developed substantially with possibly some sort of tie in with the advisory services.  They would then have a complete picture of the requirements of farmers in every area.</P>
    <P>I believe up to this only 20 per cent of Irish farmers have availed of the facilities of the advisory services and the ACC. Those people are probably on their optimum production and there is very little further they can go.  I believe the area for development lies in the other 80 per cent. It is important to go after those people and encourage them through the advisory services and with the financial backing and support of the ACC.  The purchase of land does not enter into this matter.  It is a question of developing their resources and bringing them into line with the 20 per cent who are already fully developed.</P>
    <P>This is where the ACC can come into their own, particularly when there is a credit squeeze.  In my area there are many farmers who are in the embarrassing position of not having their cheques honoured by the commercial banks.  We need the ACC more than ever now as a second source of borrowing for farmers when the commercial banks have called a halt very suddenly.  The person who decides that a credit squeeze should be implemented obviously does not know anything about farming.  Once a farmer borrows from the banks or the ACC this money is spent on development work and buying stock.  If banks or lending agencies at this time of the year tell a farmer that he has to do something about <Col N="2086" /> his bank loan and his repayment he will have a sleepless winter.  Farmers cannot do anything about such loans until their crops are harvested, the grass begins to grow and the milk production increases in the late spring.  There is no point in telling those farmers now to halt because the decision to go ahead has already been taken.  They have to rely very heavily now on the ACC.</P>
    <P>Some years ago lending money to agriculture was not very popular. Lending money to industrial developments was the important thing.  Where would farmers have been in those days without the ACC?  Reference was made yesterday to the high interest rates charged by the ACC.  I believe the State should come to the aid of farmers who are caught in the inflationary spiral.  I do not believe that subsidising interest rates for the ACC is the fair way to do it.  Any lending agency, including the commercial banks, who are giving credit to farmers, should also be helped out by the State.</P>
    <P>Panic selling of cattle is taking place all over the country.  I have seen half finished animals being sold.  Farmers have been very hesitant to buy straw this year.  Thousands of acres of straw were burned in east Cork partly because farmers were short of cash.  This straw, which could not be given away some months ago, is now fetching unrealistic prices.  The doors of the ACC will have to be kept open where farmers are having problems.  The credit squeeze is affecting farmers very badly.  Farmers borrow money hesitantly.  When they decide to borrow money nobody has the right to cut off their source of finance or interfere with them in any way.  Even talk of a credit squeeze creates a gloomy atmosphere.  I believe that our salvation will have to come from agriculture.  The 20 per cent of farmers who are fully developed have been using the ACC facilities.  However, 80 per cent of farmers are not even in the farm modernisation scheme.  If they are not in it now, it will take a lot of persuasion to get them moving at this stage.  We need the extra milk, beef, grain, sugar beet and so on <Col N="2087" /> despite the rumblings from Brussels to the contrary.  We should tell farmers that they have a choice.  A great deal of play is made of the regional fund and developing our economy.  In many cases all we have acquired is an opportunity to produce crops which are suited to our climate.</P>
    <P>Yesterday one speaker referred to egg production.  The egg producers are a small sector of agriculture who have borrowed heavily from the ACC and other institutions.  When Imperial Tobacco, a multinational company, bought an Irish company they began underselling with the obvious intention of wiping out the small producers.  The Government should be considering how to protect the small producers from multinationals who have the necessary finance to close the poultry industry despite the heavy financial commitments of the egg producers who employ many people.  The small producers could be wiped off the face of the earth by a multinational company that has no interest in egg production.  It is obvious that the price of eggs will increase when the small producers are out of business.  Even the investments of the ACC would need protection from such onslaughts.</P>
    <P>I believe that there was a union meeting in Dublin yesterday in connection with the production of sugar beet.  It is bad that farmers can be paid to get out of milk production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The process of advice and assessment is a drawn out one.  The time lapse between the application for a loan and the granting of it is too long. There should be a closer liaison between the Department and the advisory service. If more people were involved in assessing applications the extra £300 million would soon be spent.  The taking over of the ACC by farming co-operatives has been mentioned.  It is not for politicians to decide what is best in <Col N="2088" /> this regard.  If the farmers and their organisations feel strongly about the ACC being developed on a co-operative basis, they should be heeded.  I believe that such a move would create a better atmosphere.  Unlike other State agencies, the ACC have not displayed the type of caution which can be so damaging.  They have done what I consider is a brilliant job, and they have been sympathetic. That is most important.  You can talk to the Agricultural Credit Corporation. They understand the problems of a bad year.  They appreciate the ups and downs of farming.  It is very difficult to communicate in the same way with a commercial bank who can see only black and white and red.</P>
      <P>At this juncture we are fortunate to have the ACC.  Thanks to the small extra loan they got of £25 million they are making an impact on the holding of cattle, on the purchase of fertilisers, and on the sort of development which takes place normally at this time of the year. Even the dairy farmer, who has been doing best of all, is meeting tough times at the moment.  Milk prices have levelled out and, thanks to some of the levies, in some cases they have decreased.  Some of the major co-operative societies are having their own fiscal problems and, as a result, they are talking in terms of a lower price for milk next year.  This is bad news, but it should not increase the gloom that has already set in.</P>
      <P>The ACC have a tremendous function in this regard.  When others are battening down the hatches they should be in a position to go out after business, to go out actually looking for farming business.  People who should be availing of the services of the ACC are not doing so.  If you travel by train you have an opportunity to view the countryside and you can see that our farmland is crying out for investment.  The initiative to invest does not always come from the farmers themselves.  At a time when the banks are putting on the pressure, the ACC should adopt a different attitude and literally go out after these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is where the advisory services come in.  They know the people in the <Col N="2089" /> different areas who, if they got the necessary encouragement, would invest sensibly despite the high interest rates.  It is probably on the cards that there will be a hike in the price of fertilisers in the new year.  Even at high interest rates it would be a good investment for farmers to stock up their full requirement of fertilisers now.  Their chance of getting money from the ACC at the moment depends entirely on whether the ACC knows them, and knows their history and their ability to pay.  This is a long drawn out process.  This is the job which must be short-circuited.  The only way to do that is for the ACC to link up their advisory services more effectively and to set up a better assessment division to enable them to get the loans out quickly. The Minister said he was anxious to get this Bill through quickly.  I could not agree more.  Farmers who are short of money are making rash decisions to sell off cattle, to get rid of stock, or animals, or equipment they will need badly later on.  This year there is a fairly good supply of feed on our Irish farms.</P>
    <P>The ACC are unique.  They are not a bank as such, or a hire purchase company. They were introduced by the State for a specific purpose, with very limited resources from the point of view of finance, staff, offices and facilities.  They have done a tremendous job, but I believe they have scratched the surface only of Irish agriculture.  They have been dealing repeatedly with the same people who, important though they may be, have nothing further to contribute in that they are producing the maximum they can produce.  This is why I should like the ACC to be in a position to pay the same deposit rates as any other lending agency.  They should not be limited in the amount they pay to their depositors.  In spite of all their television advertising, this has had a very bad effect on the development of the ACC.  They would take off in the morning if they were allowed to borrow freely, and if depositors were given the same facilities they can get in building societies, and so on.  The very severe limit on their deposit rates has had a very damaging effect on <Col N="2090" /> the amount of money they can lay their hands on.</P>
    <P>Looking into the eighties, and having regard to our heavy dependence on agriculture, I am very worried about the Government's whole approach to agriculture.  It has been a very negative approach.  Instead of encouraging agriculture, the question is what can the Government catch them for next.  We have levy after levy.  That is bad enough, but nothing positive is coming from the Government.  There is no word of encouragement, no promise of a new market.  Farmers are not getting the sort of backing they need.  Until there is a firm commitment from the Government, there will be a great deal of hesitation on the part of the very people who should be borrowing.</P>
    <P>Young people who are working part of their parents' farms or who are about to take over farms should be given every encouragement but such encouragement must come from the Government who must convince these young people that agriculture will flourish and prosper.  The Government must be prepared to fight in the market place for the rights of those engaged in agriculture and must ensure that there will not be any question of, for instance, a herd of cows being sold for X amount of money or of an international tobacco company being allowed to ruin our egg industry.  Simply because Tate &amp; Lyle can play Molly Bawn with the EEC sugar market, we must not allow anybody in Brussels to tell us that our farmers should produce less sugar beet. It is the job of the Government to spur the EEC into action.  The ACC cannot do this.  As a priority the Government must be prepared to say now to farmers that despite whatever problems we may have with regard to inflation and so on and despite the market not being as good this year as it was last year, the market is there and that there will be a readiness on the part of the Government to make available adequate finance to allow farmers to avail of that market.  Farmers must be guaranteed the right to produce during the next five to ten years and, if necessary, 20 years.  This is the sort of guarantee they need.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2091" /> The present policy of stop-go is harming agriculture.  If we take the case of a dairy farmer who has sold his herd of cows, there is little if any chance of that man ever again being in a position to build up another herd.  That is how damaging the lack of confidence can be but if there is the necessary impetus from the Minister for Agriculture and from the Government by way of telling the farmers that the country is depending on them, that industry is depending on them, there can be a great deal of confidence in agriculture.  In the whole debate regarding the payment of income tax by farmers it is easy to overlook the input of agriculture to industry generally and, of course, to employment.  I recall talking with a floor manager in a shop in Grafton Street and, on asking him how business was, being told that while it might sound strange coming from a city man, the situation was that a setback in agriculture was reflected right into the heart of Dublin.  Obviously, the situation will be reflected to a much greater extent in country towns such as Midleton, Youghal, Cashel or elsewhere.  The whole buoyancy of these town depends on a flourishing agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>When one hears of the major co-operative societies losing £1 million and having to reduce their price to farmers by 2p a gallon for milk, we realise that this is an area the State must move into and offer the necessary encouragement in regard to marketing.  In particular, the aid I would encourage most would be by way of aid in terms of the subsidisation of interest.  I am not talking about land purchase in this context but what I am suggesting in not unprecedented.  I would not advocate subsidising interest rates for farmers across the board.  Instead, any such subsidisation should be on the basis of the policy in the Department of the Environment in respect of local authority housing in which case a person with an income of not more than £4,000 a year is entitled to a subsidised loan for a period of years.  In regard to farmers I would not even use acreage as a yardstick.  Instead, I would think in <Col N="2092" /> terms of farmers in the development or potential development categories and give them subsidised loans over a long period.  In that way we would be ruling out those whose interests are purely commercial and who are very well able to look after themselves but we would be helping directly that 80 per cent of our farmers who have not been availing of borrowing facilities in any way and who are not likely to start borrowing now at interest rates of up to 19 per cent.</P>
    <P>I would not confine such subsidisation to the ACC but would extend it to the commercial banks if they were prepared to give long-term loans to farmers.  We have many co-operative societies, creameries, marts, slaughter houses, meat factories and so on as a result of the initiative of our farmers.  If our meat factories were developed further, increasing numbers of our cattle would be exported in cellophone bags and that is the ideal situation.  At a time when there is much development of our creameries, meat factories and so on we should not be talking about closures or about an easing off in any respect.  It is easy for the Germans and the French to talk about cutting back.  Germany in particular is heavily industrialised with relatively few farmers.  We must emphasise in Brussels that our economy will either sink or swim on the basis of our agricultural exports and that we cannot afford to allow anybody to interfere in any way with the right of our farmers to produce.  If every farmer were in full production we would not create so much as a pimple on that so called mountain of surplus.</P>
    <P>If the EEC have any regard for us at all&mdash;and I presume they have&mdash;then surely it is more honourable to say that they will not give us aids, handouts and so on but that they will help us to develop, they will help our infrastructure, roads and drainage as they have been doing in a limited way and that they will also ensure that we have the right to produce freely the crops which we are most suited to produce and which we have been traditionally producing.  That should not be too much to ask.  The former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy <Col N="2093" /> Mark Clinton, succeeded in doing this but his successor has failed miserably to keep up the impetus by making that point day in and day out to these people.</P>
    <P>This is climatically probably the most suitable country in the world for agricultural production.  We have a lot of good land.  We have a lot more land that could be excellent if developed fully.  The initial moves will have to come from the Government and not from the ACC or from the agricultural advisers and not even from the farming organisations.  Encouragement in its many facets will have to come from the Minister for Agriculture, from the Government, to get farmers to improve their farms, to develop their capacity to produce, to invest in agriculture.  Developing farmers should be given subsidised interest loans. There is a precedent for this in the Department of the Environment who help people to buy houses.  This is an excellent way of helping and it is not a handout either.  The Government would only be doing the same as they do to encourage foreign investors to come here. Putting this money into the potential development of the farmer would be an infinitely better way of spending such funds at this juncture.</P>
    <P>We are now regarded as being the producer of some of the highest quality products.  The Kerrygold name is held in esteem all over Europe.  Our horticultural products produced by Erin Foods are regarded as being second to none where they can gain a place on the market. These are the areas that we can develop and expand.  These are the areas that will give employment in our factories, in transport, in shops and supermarkets. When the Government say that we must tighten our belts they remind me of the parable of the man who got five talents. The Government inherited the State in 1977 and their own Senator Whitaker said the economy was in sound heart They got the five talents; they have squandered four and now they have buried the one.  So I appeal to them to use that last talent to develop agriculture.  There is no point in giving the ACC permission to borrow £300 <Col N="2094" /> million if the impetus is not given from the top.  There are good years ahead. Prices cannot be guaranteed but reasonable prices can be guaranteed. The Government should guarantee that they will fight for the farmers in the market place and at the Council of Ministers.  All we need at this juncture is a little bit of confidence and, if we have that, then we will solve a lot of our problems.  We will help our farmers and we will help our workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I should like to join with the other speakers who have paid tribute to the work done by the Agricultural Credit Corporation over the years.  As the Minister of State pointed out, the ACC were established in 1927.  They were then one of the first semi-State bodies in the land.  I cannot help admiring the Government and the men of the twenties who, in the midst of all their difficulties, were farsighted and enlightened enough to establish bodies like the ACC.  During last week we laid to rest another great man, one of the Ministers of the first Government, Paddy McGilligan, who established the first semi-State body, the ESB.  Again, that is a tribute to the men of those days who were enlightened enough to establish these semi-State bodies which have done so much good for the country from an economic and social point of view.  Many tributes were paid at national level to the late Paddy McGilligan and I would like to go on record here, since the Minister introduced the question of such bodies having been formed then, as expressing my appreciation of the work that Paddy McGilligan did in establishing the ESB and my appreciation of the work that the Government of that day did in establishing the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that this Bill was not introduced by the Minister for Agriculture. I am sorry that the ACC are not entirely under the control of the Minister for Agriculture.  I fear that the fact that they are under the control of the Department of Finance means that they are hindered <Col N="2095" /> in their work and that they have a city approach to their activities.  I know, for example, that the Department of Finance intend to bring the activities of the Land Commission to a halt because in their ignorance of rural Ireland they believe that the Land Commission are engaged in some sort of social welfare activity.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Land Commission have been engaged over the years in the slow process of getting land out of the hands of people who are not working it properly and putting it into the hands of farmers who will put it to work to produce agricultural products for home consumption and for export.</P>
    <P>Another glaring example of why it is not safe to have the Agricultural Credit Corporation in the hands of the Department of Finance is that that Department proved this year that they are completely ignorant of how to get agriculture going and how to get the best results from farming. The Department of Finance and their Minister early this year introduced the 2 per cent levy by way of taxation&mdash;a levy which was calculated to kill rather than encourage productivity. Nothing over the years has done more to engender a lack of confidence and uncertainty in agriculture than this levy which has no regard for the profit made by the man who was asked to pay it or for the capacity of that man to pay.  The Agriculture Credit Corporation should be controlled by the Department of Agriculture rather than the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to increase the borrowing powers of the corporation from £350 million to £600 million which is a good thing since the Minister says that the corporation have almost reached their limits in the field of borrowing.  In introducing the Second Stage the Minister also mentioned that recently he had authorised the corporation to borrow £25 million abroad; apparently we have reached the stage where the corporation cannot borrow sufficient money at home.  While I welcome that authority for the corporation <Col N="2096" /> to borrow £25 million abroad, that is an entirely inadequate sum.  It would amount to a thousand loans of £25,000 or two thousand loans of £12,500.  Some of the loans requested would be more than £25,000, so the inadequacy of the sum being made available will be seen, especially in this year which has been a very bad one for agriculture, because the budget proposals engendered uncertainty and a lack of confidence into the farming industry.</P>
    <P>Never before was any sector of the economy inflicted with a form of taxation such as the 2 per cent levy.  Furthermore, the budget was being negotiated well into the year, another innovation. Farmers did not know, when half the year had gone by, what sort of taxation was going to be imposed on them; they do not know yet.  The levy has been brought to the courts; it is proposed to bring it to the European Court and the Minister for Finance has given an undertaking that, in certain eventualities, he will refund some of the tax extracted from farmers by this levy.  Surely that is an extraordinary state of affairs.  It is no wonder that, in those circumstances, the farming community have no confidence in their own industry and are uncertain as to how they should proceed.</P>
    <P>That budget and that form of taxation brought about a credit squeeze, resulting in a drop in the price of cattle, which means that people who bought cattle this spring are now selling them at a substantial loss, notwithstanding that it was said, from the Minister of State's own constituency, that the price of cattle had increased by 50 per cent since his Government came into power.  That was the joke of the by-election campaign. Farmers are, in fact, losing as much as £100 a head on cattle bought early this year, without taking into consideration their own labour, or the feeding of the cattle.  More credit, rather than less credit, is necessary this year to enable farmers to retain cattle they wish to retain and to purchase feed for them.</P>
    <P>The £25 million, which the Minister seems to think almost warrants congratulations, in my view is totally inadequate <Col N="2097" /> when it is considered that this money has to be used by the corporation for loans for purchasing lands, for erecting farm buildings, for replacing stock, for manure and other requirements of the agricultural community.  I know of one farmer who is building a beef house at the moment, costing about £15,000.  He has put £4,000 or £5,000 of his own money into it, is getting a grant of equal proportions and cannot get a loan of £4,000 or £5,000 to complete the job, which is at a standstill.  That is not the fault of the Agricultural Credit Corporation but it is the fault of the Government in imposing this credit squeeze.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the national and local officers of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  It was very wise to select county managers and local officers who not alone are competent in the financial sphere but have experience and training, qualifications and degress in agriculture.  The sign of that experience and training is to be seen in their approach to the farmers and to agriculture.  It is not their fault that they have not more money to lend or that they cannot pay a higher interest on investments.</P>
    <P>My main reason for intervening in this debate is that I am particularly concerned about the plight of the industrious small farmers of 30, 35 or 40 acres who are making a good job of the area of land which they have but want more and cannot get it, while at the same time, they have seen land, over the last couple of years, passing into the hands of non-farmers and into the hands of speculators and large farmers who have enough land already.  I said in my opening remarks that the Department of Finance are bringing the operations of the Land Commission to an end.  So far as the acquisition of land is concerned, the Land Commission are at a standstill. I understand that the number of section 40 notices being served are reduced to a trickle.  I know that the Department of Finance are putting the screws on the Land Commission to bring their operations to an end.  I think that is a mistake.</P>
    <P>Any Bill that the Minister for Agriculture introduces to control land by <Col N="2098" /> means of some kind of tax will not work. The only way a small industrious farmer will get land that comes on the market is by the intervention of the Land Commission. I do not deny that the operations of the Land Commission may be too slow. I think they should be stepped up.  I know that a long debate on the Land Commission would not be in order on this Bill but I wish to make the point that as the activities of the Land Commission are being brought to an end by the Minister for Agriculture at the behest of the Minister for Finance, the least the Minister for Finance should do is to make more money available to the small farmer who wants to buy an adjoining farm that comes on the market.  The ACC could play a part by assessing the performance of the applicant for the loan&mdash;I know they do this&mdash;and by judging his worthiness for credit.  If they are satisfied he is a good farmer and would make a good job, credit should be made available to him.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes said that the ACC increase the price of land.  I do not believe that.  I believe it is the speculators and the man who has more than enough land and who can afford to pay who do that. If the ACC had enough money they could play a valuable role by lending money for the purchase of land on a more generous scale.  It has been said that if the ACC did that there would be the situation where two or three farmers would bid for the same 25, 30 or 50 acres with money provided by the corporation. That can be avoided.  If the ACC know that two or more people are interested in the same land and that the price is going to soar, what is to prevent the corporation telling the applicants if they are worthy of credit that the ACC do not propose to put them in competition with each other in order to boost the price of land.  They could tell the applicants to decide to buy the land between them and to divide it, with the ACC providing the money.  That would be a wise approach and it would bring two or three farms to a viable level or as near to it as possible.  It will be a calamity if the Land Commission are shut down.  It will be throwing the small farmers to the <Col N="2099" /> wolves.  If the Land Commission are closed down small farmers will have to be assisted in some other way to get more land.</P>
    <P>The reason I intervened in this debate was to highlight the scandal of the Land Commission refusing to assist uneconomic farmers while the ACC are not properly financed to help them. There is, of course, another question&mdash;that of the interest rates for money at the moment and whether farmers can or should borrow money at the rates now obtaining.  It is in the interests of this nation that as many farmers as can viably stay on the land should be kept on it.  It is not in our interests that the countryside be depleted of farmers. The Constitution states that we should keep as many people as possible on the land.  If it is necessary to subsidise interest rates in order to enable small farmers to bring their farms to a viable size that should be done.  It is in the national interest to do it.  If things continue as they are, with people leaving the land because they cannot have holdings of a viable size, this nation will rue the day. There is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>I hope the Department of Finance will cease thinking that the Land Commission are some kind of social welfare agency.  I shall give one example of what I am talking about.  I know a parish which is populated largely by small congested holders, with farms of about 25 acres.  The only decent farm&mdash;a holding of 100 acres&mdash;was put on the market in the past 12 months and was bought by a speculator who lived 25 miles away.  He never intends living there because he has more land where he lives at present.  Had the Land Commission moved&mdash;I urged them to move; I put down a question in the House to get them to move, but they did not&mdash;and intervened in that case they could have divided those 100 acres of land among five or six industrious, hard-working congests in the neighbourhood, bringing them up to a viable acreage.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of thing that is happening here and the nation will live to rue <Col N="2100" /> It unless the Minister for Agriculture, who seems to be converted by the Department of Finance if not subdued by them&mdash;I know that for years the Department of Finance have had this hobby horse of getting rid of the Land Commission&mdash;rectifies the situation.  I sincerely hope that the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance will have a re-think on this, ensuring that people prepared to make good use of land get the finance with which to buy it through the Land Commission, the Department or the ACC at a reasonable price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is clear that the ACC should be given the necessary extension of their borrowing limit to enable them to proceed with the services they are providing to Irish agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the borrowing limit be increased from £350 million to £600 million.  The urgency of the Bill arises because of the recent decision to permit the ACC to take up £25 million in EMS borrowing.  I understand that it is not because of the fact that the borrowing is from abroad, EMS borrowing, but because the taking-up of those £25 million pushes the amount of the borrowings over the existing limit.  Of course this raises the point, and I do not make it in any political context, why the limit was set at £350 million under the 1978 Act.  Suggestions were made at that time that that figure would be insufficient and those suggestions have now been proved to be correct.  I might raise one question with the Minister on that, and again I am not making any political point: is the figure of £600 million sufficient? Perhaps I might ask an even more innocent question: why is there a need for a limit of £600 million on the ACC at this stage?  It is a State-sponsored, State-guaranteed body.  I imagine that the normal way in which one runs the finances of the country requires some figure but we are not dealing with a fly-by-night corporation; we are dealing with a strong, well-established, State-guaranteed and State-sponsored body. Perhaps the Minister would comment on <Col N="2101" /> this in his reply.  Assuming there has to be a limit,  I would urge the Minister to ensure that the new figure we are now introducing less than two years after the last Bill is sufficient to cover the requirements of the ACC in providing services to the farming community.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that in the months and years ahead the ACC will be making much more use of EMS credit.  Certainly, if there is difficulty or a shortfall in funds at home, I would hope that the ACC would be given the full go-ahead to utilise EMS credit as required, so that the facilities they are making available to agriculture can be maintained and expanded.</P>
    <P>This leads me to another important point.  The need for taking-up EMS credit is no doubt a result of the shortfall in what I might term native borrowing, the inability to raise sufficient funds on the home market.  It is incumbent on the Government, and indeed on all of us, to examine the situation, the reasons therefor and whether anything can be done to improve the competitiveness of the ACC in this area.  As I understand the situation, in 1978 the net inflow of the ACC was approximately £70 million.  That sum, together with the loan repayments, permitted the ACC to make loans available to agriculture and to agri-business totalling £143 million. Another figure, which would bring home more vividly the services being provided to agriculture by the ACC, is provided by breaking down that £413 million into the 23,000 individual transactions involved in the lending of that money.  I imagine that the ACC this year would have targetted to achieve at least the same level.  The question now arises as to whether they will be able to raise the £70 million on the home market they were able to raise last year.  On checking my notes I find that the figure, as I understand it from their report, was somewhat higher than £70 million last year.</P>
    <P>If the ACC are unable to raise a sum on the home market, we must examine the reasons therefor.  Is it because their deposit rates are not sufficiently competitive? I realise that the ACC have to <Col N="2102" /> compete with other bodies in securing deposits.  They have been very successful in the past, particularly among the farming community, in getting sufficient deposits.  But the indications are that, despite their best efforts this year, there will be some shortfall in the amount as opposed to the figure last year.  There are certain competitive edges which other institutions have.  In particular one has to bear in mind that the ACC are in competition with the building societies.  Certainly, the building societies have a strong competitive edge from the point of view that their interest payments are free of tax.  On the other side the ACC are constrained by the same restriction as the commercial banks in regard to their returns to the Revenue of interest earned over the sum of £70 per annum. Therefore, there is the situation in which the ACC are subjected to the same constraints in that regard as are placed on the commercial banks, and they do not have the advantage of the building societies with whom they are in competition. Taking into account the deposit rate that can be paid by the ACC, it seems to me that this must be a factor.</P>
    <P>In the interest not alone of the ACC but of the development of agriculture in this country and in the light of the services provided to agriculture by the ACC over the years, and particularly in recent years, I suggest to the Minister that it is important that the ACC will always be left in a situation in which they are able to stand up in open competition with other financial institutions so that the deposits they need can be maintained.  Those deposits are not huge sums.  Normally they are relatively small amounts, as I know from my experience working in a rural constituency.  We must ensure that the ACC continue to be attractive to the small depositor so as to be able to maintain the income inflow necessary to carry on their business.</P>
    <P>The ACC came in for a lot of plaudits yesterday and today.  They deserved that praise because they built up their remarkable operation since 1927.  The corporation has developed in recent years to the extent that it now enjoys the <Col N="2103" /> total confidence of the farming community. The corporation was not built up by chance; it was built up by initiative, vision and hard work.  That has led to the establishment of offices throughout the country, numbering about 44, which brings the services of the organisation where they are needed, to rural Ireland.  The stage has now been reached where local offices have been given substantial authority to deal with applications.  The policies of the corporation conform to the principle of bringing services to the areas they are needed and not having them centralised in Dublin like so many other affairs of our State.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the discussions that took place in the last few days in Dublin regarding the establishment of a farmers' bank.  I suggest we look at that with our feet on the ground bearing in mind the comments of Mr. Lardinois yesterday to the effect that Ireland, in relation to its population, is the most overbanked country in Europe.  On that basis it does not appear to be a prime situation to be rushing in with further banking facilities.  At the same time I believe that in the event of such a bank being established in future years the ACC have a role to play.  In the meantime it is important that the ACC are given every support in their efforts to improve services.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to another role which the ACC may be able to play in the future.  It relates to one of the greatest problems we have in agriculture, that of land structure.  In recent years there has been an improvement in the encouragement of young people into farming. From my experience I know that the age of 66 years seems to be the regular one for handing over farms to the younger generation.  It is no coincidence that that is the age when one can apply for a pension.  My experience as a lawyer is that approximately 90 per cent of farms are transferred when the owners reach that age.  We will have to devise structures which will permit the encouragement of the handing over of farms to the younger generation at an earlier age.  Structure should be <Col N="2104" /> developed which would enable the younger generation to get involved in the control of farms before the retiring farmer&mdash;normally a parent&mdash;reaches the age of 66 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggestion is important because it may be one of the primary functions of the ACC in the future.  I must be given an opportunity to explain what I have in mind.  There should be some land structural arrangement which would permit the son of a farmer to establish some degree of ownership and control before a retiring parent reaches 66 years.  That could involve a gradual taking over of the farm by the young person when the parent is between 55 and 66 years of age.  The importance of the ACC in this regard is that the corporation may be able to provide the financial backing to permit the preservation of the balance between the two generations at that vital stage. The younger generation must be encouraged to establish some degree of ownership, to be increased annually, before the parent retires, as opposed to the present situation under which young people do not have any control or sense of ownership until the parent reaches 66 years of age.  Such a proposal would involve a new type of arrangement, but, of greater importance, it would involve a certain amount of financial backing.  In may be necessary for the young person to provide an extra house on the land and in this regard the ACC have a role to play.  Funds may also be needed by the young person to develop the land.</P>

      <P>The Chair may be wrong, but it strikes the Chair that this would involve new legislation.  It is hardly relevant to the Bill under consideration, which deals with agriculture credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it would involve new legislation and I hope the Government will give consideration to <Col N="2105" /> that.  It is important that the ACC be put in a situation where they can make an input to such an agricultural development and have sufficient funds and sufficient authority to back that type of new development in agriculture and in land structures.  They will not be able to do so unless they have sufficient funds.  The Bill before us is to extend the borrowing limit of the ACC so that they can have sufficient funds in the years ahead.  In that context we have to consider the use that will be made of these funds and therefore my point is entirely relevant to the Bill.  We will have to have some new thinking on land structures and we will have to provide new types of ownership to further encourage young people to stay on the land and to make greater use of it.  There is no doubt that the younger the farmer the greater the chance is that the land will be fully utilised.  The future development of farming requires that this aspect be carefully examined.  It arises even when one looks at the cost of land.  The average cost of land reclamation is only £500 an acre and land was costing up to £3,000 or £4,000 an acre earlier this year.  This highlights the need to look at the amount of land utilised. The credit should be available so that land can be reclaimed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will raise this again on another day.  Despite the Chair's ruling, <Col N="2106" /> the Agricultural Credit Corporation will have a major role to play in the financial backing and underpinning of any such new arrangements in that area.  In the years ahead the two most important commodities that will be needed in the world will be energy and food.  We have not a great deal of native resources to offer in the energy field but we have been favoured with a climate which makes it possible for us to develop our food resources.  A terrible contradiction exists where people are starving and yet there are surpluses of food.  Those contradictions will have to be resolved.  We as an agricultural country will be able to play our part in ensuring that our food production can be of benefit to our people, particularly to the farming population, and also to the citizens of the world. In that whole scene the ACC will have a major role to play.  I commend them for the services they have given to the agricultural community in the past and I look forward with anticipation to them continuing and expanding that role and service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is primarily designed to increase the present limit on borrowings by the ACC from £350 million to £600 million. The need for this Bill reflects the dynamic growth of the ACC and is a recognition of the important and comprehensive part they play in our agricultural and industrial life.  The growth in ACC lendings in the seventies is a reflection of the growth and prosperity of the agricultural community. The ACC lendings which were £25 million in 1970 grew through the seventies to £143 million.  The total amount owing to the corporation was £130 million in 1975 but it grew within a period of four years to £320 million. This illustrates the rapid growth of investment in the agricultural sector and is a reflection of our membership of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our membership of the EEC has had a tremendous and beneficial effect on the agricultural community and has brought that sector of the population to a modern pitch.  This is now one of our fastest <Col N="2107" /> growing sectors and is likely to remain such in the next decade.  We have heard of pressures within the EEC on the finances required for the common agricultural policy and we have heard of reservations and criticisms from some countries, especially England, about the present method of financing the CAP. We must fight for the continued expansion of the CAP because that policy was the cornerstone of our fighting a campaign to enter into Europe.  We must under no circumstances allow the benefits gained by our entry to Europe to be changed as they are threatened to be changed by some members.  It would be a serious blow to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>The reason for the vast investment that took place and is taking place in agriculture is our membership of the EEC and the existence of open guaranteed markets and guaranteed prices for our products.  We must ensure that our beef and milk sectors, particularly, are protected from any shortage of finance in Europe.  The price guarantees which were fought for over the past six years must be protected and expanded; we must fight for other products to be brought into the CAP and we must ensure that the price guarantees will continue and will be increased to take into account increases in inflation.  That basis of investment, the CAP, which is the basis of the growth of the ACC, must be recognised and protected by whatever Government are in office.  If anything happened to the structure of the CAP or to the price guarantees, many farmers would be open to financial ruin in a very short time and what might appear to the assets of the ACC would turn out to be bad debts.  None of us would like to see that.</P>
    <P>The pressures currently felt on the EEC's CAP must be countered particularly by the Minister for Agriculture. The bulk of the lendings of the ACC are in respect of livestock purchases, land purchase and improvements, building, machinery and so forth; indeed they are working capital.  I will come back to that later.  The policy in relation to loans for land purchase should be looked at.  We <Col N="2108" /> in Ireland must be coming into a time when land purchase and farm structure must be examined in this House and a policy laid down in order to protect genuine farmers from the speculators.  I doubt if any one in this House would support the buying of land by speculators where there are genuine, full-time, small farmers waiting and hoping for the opportunity to purchase land.  A policy must be laid down, if necessary in law, that will ensure the capability of small, full-time farmers to acquire land which is for sale and will give them the opportunity to purchase that land.  If we are to keep small farmers on the land of Ireland we will have to adopt a positive policy.  We cannot just let the present situation continue where small farmers are outbid time and again at auctions by people who have no roots in farming and who are merely buying land to hide money, not working the land properly and, indeed, not allowing other people to earn a family living on a farm.</P>
    <P>The future of the Land Commission has been raised here this morning by Deputy Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> who was formerly the Minister with responsibility for the Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, but there is a pool of money available for land purchase and the ACC and the Land Commission are linked together in the moneys available for the purchase of land.  I would be surprised and disappointed at any move to make the Land Commission ineffective or to weaken to any extent the well-established policy of helping congests to acquire a family-sized <Col N="2109" /> farm.  There should be a clear statement of policy by the Government on the future of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy to leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the ACC related to land purchase has been conscientious, progressive and positive, unlike that of the commercial banks who have been involved in giving large sums of money to the non-farming sector, the private people, for the purchase of land. The ACC have pursued a proper social policy in relation to finance for land acquestion. That is as it should be, because any person who has to run a farm has to earn a living and has to pay interest on the moneys he owes.  At the prices which have prevailed this year, certainly in the earlier part of the year, of between £3,000 and £4,000 an acre, unless one were very highly financed and involved intensively it would be very difficult to repay the high interest charges on loans.  I doubt whether the farms could create enough net revenue to justify present land prices.  In some cases they do when the full-time farmer is involved intensively in farming, but I doubt if the prices of many farms are economic for the people who purchase them.  Indeed, some people who bought land during the past two years may have regrets about the price paid for it at the auctions and may have severe reservations about their initial investment.  Let us hope that we can have a continued rational price level on farms which will allow existing full-time farmers to continue to acquire and develop a proper family farm which will justify a good investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This leads me to the other involvement of the ACC, that is loans to agriculture based industries, in particular to agricultural processing industries such as creameries, meat factories and grain mills.  That would be a natural area of involvement by the ACC, as has been the case.  However, there must be a conscious banking policy in relation to such investments and, while short-term propping <Col N="2110" /> up of factories, creameries and so on might be justified, I do not see a tremendous long-term benefit in propping up lame ducks.  A rational commercial policy is justified and may be needed even though the ACC are a State company and have been very successful in their investment in many projects in agriculture-based industries.  They deserve our encouragement in this area. They are extremely well based for such investment and the staff of the ACC, not only in Dublin but throughout the country, are very well qualified and professional.  That is as it should be.  Under a recent restructuring of management the area managers have now more power in relation to their own lending policy and to decisions which they can take at local level.  That is a proper approach to decentralisation and ensures that the man on the spot is able to talk to local farmers and local management people and able to make decisions on a local basis.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the ACC being allowed to become a full banking corporation. At the moment they take in deposits and grant long and short-term loans.  They are involved in hire purchase and I believe they are also involved in leasing.  This is only one step away from the status of a full commercial bank, granting overdrafts and providing cheque book accounts.  I submit that the ACC are in a unique position to become a farmer's bank.  They are well aware of the seasonal requirements of farmers, their short and long-term requirements and of their potential to develop and remain profitable units.</P>
    <P>The credit squeeze reinforces my opinion that borrowing for productive purposes, which the ACC would primarily be involved in, should be allowed.  They would be involved in productive purpose in the farming sector and would ensure that in a credit squeeze such productive purposes were protected.  There would be a unique procedure for channelling finance on overdrafts to the agricultural sector under quite clearly understood procedures.</P>
    <P>The question of a farmer's bank <Col N="2111" /> should receive serious consideration.  I suggest that the ACC are the best qualified banking institution with the best expert staff available to become a farmer's bank.  Why has the Minister not allowed them to become a farmers' bank?  Are there proposals before him to allow the ACC to become a full commercial bank?  This would be a very constructive development and would be welcomed, especially by the farming community.</P>
    <P>The Minister guarantees borrowings and the Bill allows the ACC to increase their borrowings up to £600 million.  The question of borrowing abroad has been raised.  The ACC lost substantial sums of money for two years running because of the exchange rates which worked adversely for them.  It is now a fact of life that the rates of interest in Ireland and in England are substantially above the interest rates prevailing in Europe.  If we take an average rate of interest in Ireland of between 17 per cent and 20 per cent the equivalent commercial rate of interest in France is between 14 per cent and 15 per cent and in Germany substantially less, around 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The attraction for people borrowing in Germany, and also in Switzerland which is outside the EMS, is very obvious.  It is vital that wherever foreign borrowings are undertaken by the ACC there must be some protective mechanism to ensure against exchange rate losses.  That has not been done except in relation to a loan which the ACC have from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development where it is stated that no foreign exchange profits or losses would arise on repayments under the terms of the agreements between the company and the Department of Finance.  That is a sound policy in relation to the loan of 25 million dollars which the ACC have.</P>
    <P>Some steps must be taken, in relation to any borrowings which the ACC have in Europe, either by the ACC or jointly by the ACC and the Government, to ensure against such exchange rate losses. <Col N="2112" /> The condition of international exchange rates at the moment must be a source of worry.  The American dollar is under extreme pressure and the £ sterling fluctuates like a yo-yo.  The whole structure of the EMS currencies is hinged on a very delicate balance.  If England becomes a member of the EMS what effect will that have on the present level of exchange rates between Ireland and the European countries?  The Minister should take up this question of exchange losses and guarantees against such losses in the event of the ACC going abroad to borrow money.</P>
    <P>The ACC are on the point of borrowing £25 million abroad.  The Minister should tell the House in what country this money is being borrowed, the conditions and the guarantees there are to ensure that there will be no exchange rate losses.  We all know that what was promised to us when we joined the EMS has not materialised.  We were told that membership of the EMS would mean that we would have a lower level of interest rates but this has not happened. We are still linked with the level of British interest rates.  That has been a disappointment to me and must also be a disappointment to the Government.  Of course, the image of the Government has become tarnished in recent months in relation to economic affairs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I praise the ACC. It is important to understand that unless the CAP is maintained and its benefits are seen to be unchallenged, the big investment of the farmers in this decade will be open to serious depreciation.  It is vital for us to ensure that we have a strong voice when agricultural matters are being discussed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2113" /> I have experience of dealing with the ACC, both on a private level and as a member of the board.  I have nothing but praise for their operation.  The ACC were set up in 1927.  Business was slow at the start but they have now made an impact on the development of agriculture.  I do not understand why the ACC come under the control of the Department of Finance.  I accept that the Department must control the movement of money but I have always believed that the ACC should be under the control of the Department of Agriculture.  I believe that the ACC would make more progress under the control of the Department of Agriculture.  The outlook of the Department of Finance has always been conservative.  I do not blame them for their attitude because money is always scarce and there is always a demand for it.  The Department of Finance are always trying to be strict.  No matter how long I am a member of this House, I shall continue to ask that the ACC be brought under the control of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>We are entering an era of uncertainty for the lender and the borrower.  I do not know any borrower who has the margin to pay for the present interest rate of 19 per cent.  Even a small increase in the interest rate would be the final straw.  Both lenders and borrowers will have to ask themselves how the repayments are to be made.  The present attitude of the EEC in not allowing any increase in the price of agricultural produce has made the situation worse.  In 1979 the actual cost of agricultural production was in the region of 12 per cent to 14 per cent.  The forecast for 1980 is nearly the same, which will result in an increase in the actual production cost of approximately 25 per cent.  At the same time, we are being told that there will be no further price increases from Europe.  It is clear that growth in agriculture is at the crossroads. Farmers will question the borrowing of money at such high interest rates. This year's figures are not yet available but I understand that the growth rate is less than 1 per cent.  If the present conditions continue into next year there will be <Col N="2114" /> a big reduction in agricultural growth.  In 1977 the growth rate was between 4 per cent and 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Government will have to bear some of the responsibility for the reduction in growth in agriculture.  The levy introduced by the Government aggravated the situation.  I must criticise the Minister for Finance for not avoiding the 2 per cent levy by holding back the VAT, which would have given him the same yield.  The levy did a great deal of damage to agriculture and led to a loss of confidence in the Minister.</P>
    <P>As a farmer, I am nervous of the Minister's commitment to agriculture and of the fact that he controls the ACC. At this stage I must question the interest rate of 11 per cent being paid on the deposits by the ACC.  Is this competitive? The commercial banks advertise that they are prepared to give from 10 per cent to 13½ per cent on deposits. Have the ACC asked to be made more competitive in this field?  They must be competitive.  When the banks say they will give 10 per cent to 13½ per cent on deposits they do not say you must have over £25,000 on deposit to get 13½ per cent.  Therefore they are deceiving the ordinary people.  Since I started farming 20 years ago, the policy of the banks has not been consistent.  The policy of the ACC has been consistent.</P>
    <P>The ACC should be put in the same competitive position as all other commercial money lenders here.  I question the fact that 11 per cent is competitive at present.  People are talking in terms of interest rates of 19 per cent, and the difference between 11 per cent and 19 per cent is enormous so far as profit is concerned. The banks will give a high interest rate for a short period to get in the deposits.  Then they carry out their stop-go policy by reducing the interest rates and holding on to deposits.  They have done that consistently down through the years.</P>
    <P>The ACC depend to a very large extent on the amount of deposits they can attract.  That is a very important part of their operations.  Has any demand been <Col N="2115" /> made by the ACC for an increase in that figure?  If not, is the Minister satisfied that they are in a competitive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the commercial banks?  Since 1 August the ACC have been working under certain restrictions.  They have not got the money.  We all know that.  It was never so important as it is now for the ACC to have sufficient capital available to enable people to borrow.  We saw the collapse in the cattle trade.  One factor which was responsible more than any other for the collapse in the cattle trade was the non-availability of cash to buy cattle.  There is no doubt about that.  We have seen ten cwt cattle sold for £32 a cwt.  We have seen eight cwt.  cattle sold for £28 a cwt.  I went to some of the sales myself and saw this.</P>
    <P>The ACC have not got the money to hand out to the feeders in particular.  I come from a county where there is a lot of feeding.  While people may have barley, silage, housing and machinery, 85 to 90 per cent require financing.  We are talking in terms of very big money at the moment to finance the fattening of cattle.  We are talking in terms of £45,000 to £50,000 and that would be for a small outfit.</P>
    <P>I rang the ACC and they said they were doing their best and getting out as much as they could.  Things have improved over the past fortnight and we are glad to know that, but the damage has been done.  In that situation it is the small farmer who gets the wallop.  The big farmer has the capacity and the money.  He can buy cattle at poor prices. The same thing happened in 1974-75 but the situation was different then and there was a beef mountain.  Now there is a lack of finance and a lack of confidence in the trade.  I do not want to make a huge issue out of this but I should like to know from the Minister are the ACC competitive. That is very important.  I should like to see the operations of the ACC carried on right down through the years. The present interest rates are penal.</P>
    <P>I should like to move on to another area of interest rates which should be brought to the notice of the Department of Finance, that is, the question of hire <Col N="2116" /> purchase.  The ACC have a hire purchase section, but they do not operate on such huge profit figures.  Unfortunately, when money becomes scarce other people step in and fill up the gap.  Hire purchase companies are attached to every commercial bank and they are financed by the banks.  If you require a loan to buy cattle, or cows, or anything else, they say the rate is 19 per cent on a monthly repayment basis. There should be a condition that the true interest rate must be quoted.</P>
    <P>A quotation of 19 per cent on a monthly repayment at true interest rate is 38 per cent.  That cannot be contradicted. They say the rate is 19 per cent, but you are paying back on a monthly basis and the true interest rate is in the region of 38 per cent.  No credit company, including the ACC, should be allowed to quote an interest rate other than the true interest rate.  This matter should be taken up by the Department of Finance.  People buy cars on monthly repayments. They make up their commitment and add 19 per cent.  They believe they are getting the money at 19 per cent, but they are wrong.  The Department of Finance were lax about this matter.  It should have been dealt with long ago. Imagine lending money in this day and age at 38 per cent.</P>
    <P>Over the past month interest rates of 21 per cent have been quoted but that is really 42 per cent.  They are practically doubling their money in two and half years.  This is damaging growth.  There is no area, particularly in agriculture, where those types of margins are available so far as profit is concerned.  I take this opportunity to bring this point to the notice of the Minister and the Department of Finance.  People should not be allowed to deceive the public to the extent that intelligent people believe that a rate is the true interest rate when it is not.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to the question of making the ACC a fully commercial bank with cheque book facilities.  This is important, and again we get back to the question of competitiveness.  For the commercial banks the lucrative side of <Col N="2117" /> lending money is in the current account. There they have money free of interest. As we all know, over the past two to three months the banks have been explaining that if your current account is overdrawn they have to charge you interest. When you have money in your current account, when you are in the black, they do not write to you and tell you they will pay you interest on the money they have which belongs to you. That is for their own benefit and that has been the position down through the years.</P>
    <P>I know of some cases where people in clubs had large sums of money in current accounts and they were given no interest because they did not put them in a deposit accounts.  The banks are very good at that type of business.  It may be said that I am being hard on the banks, but I have dealt with them for years. They must accept a great deal of responsibility for creating the present severe credit squeeze.  Last year you could go in to a bank and sign your name and get money.  All of a sudden the tide turned, and the Department of Finance said the banks had over-spent or over-lent, whichever way you like to put it, and the squeeze was created.  The banks created a fair share of it although I am prepared to accept that the Government created some of it as well by their consumer boom.</P>
    <P>The ACC are entitled to have full cheque book facilities.  It is well known that the ACC have what is known as gale dates, 1 November and 1 May.  Over the past two months the banks stepped in and tightened up the overdrafts. Until this year I have never seen money scarce in the ACC in the month of November.  I believe they have not got in their repayments for November 1979.  If they had got the repayments in they would have more money but the reason for their not getting the money in is that the banks have tightened up on overdraft facilities for farmers.  With the exception of one other occasion on which there was some shortage of money in the ACC, I cannot recall any time when there was a situation <Col N="2118" /> as bad as it is at present in that regard.  The tightening up by the banks of overdraft facilities has led to farmers having to request the ACC to allow them forego repayments for three months or so.</P>
    <P>Has any application been made by the ACC for permission to make available cheque-book facilities to their customers or is there any plan in the Department of Finance to make this service available? These are direct questions to which I should like the Minister to reply.  While I was on the board I emphasised the necessity for such facilities.  There was then a favourable reaction to the suggestion but I am aware that there was a problem regarding staff.  However, I trust that that problem has been resolved and that there will not be any further industrial action in this regard.  We must acknowledge that the ACC have always employed good qualified staff, staff who have local knowledge.  That is an important aspect because in the event of a farmer finding himself in difficulty, his file is available to the corporation so that an official is in a position to take that file and go out to the farm to examine the situation which may have arisen because of herd disease, bad weather conditions, low yields or some other factor.  That official will then be in a position to make a decision as to whether to give the farmer extra money.  The situation is different in regard to the banks.  They send out a representative only when the question is one of the collection of money.</P>
    <P>Down through the years the ACC have been expanding.  They have built offices in practically every town in Ireland. Hopefully, that important programme is continuing.  If the ACC were in a position to extend cheque-book facilities to their customers, farmers would not have to depend on the banks for this service. This would be to the advantage not only of the farmer but of the corporation as money lenders.</P>
    <P>Another important matter is the question of small industrial farmers borrowing money for the purchase of land.  The movement of the Land Commission to the Department of Agriculture was a very good step.  The involvement of the <Col N="2119" /> ACC particularly in regard to small farmers purchasing land in order to make their holding viable, is a very important question, but current interest rates cannot be justified.  If we are to keep the small farmer on the land we must devise a system sooner or later whereby a certain percentage of interest rates will be paid from the ACC through the Land Commission to the farmer.  The Land Commission may buy land on the open market now for about £2,000 an acre but the ridiculously high interest rate of 19 per cent means a cost of £380 per acre in terms of interest alone.  That situation is not justified in any circumstances and one can only hope that the rates will not remain at this high level for much longer.</P>
    <P>There have been various predictions as to when we may expect a relaxation in interest rates but it appears as if we must suffer these interest rates for some time yet.  If small farmers are to be enabled to bring their holdings to anywhere near a viable position the interest rates must be reduced and, if possible, subsidised.  The period of time for which money is borrowed is irrelevant in terms of repayments because regardless of how long that period is, the repayments are working out at £380 per acre in interest rates alone.  The ACC have the personnel that would be necessary to operate a scheme of subsidisation in respect of interest rates.  Farmers cannot be expected to expand or to modernise if they must borrow at these very high interest rates. In particular it would be impossible for farmers in the west to meet the cost of repaying money borrowed at such rates. Recently I spent some time in north-west Cork where the need for development and modernisation is obvious in at least every other farm.  Agriculture is our main industry.  This year we shall export more than £1,000 million worth of agricultural produce.  That represents a significant amount of exports but next year there may be a reduction if the present conditions continue to prevail. That would be very bad as far as our whole economy is concerned.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that <Col N="2120" /> the ACC will be in as viable a position as possible <i>vis-à-vis</i> other money lenders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of my responsibilities outside the country, I do not often have an opportunity of contributing to debates here but I am glad to be here today to speak on the subject before us which is one of the most important matters that we could possibly discuss.  My interest has always been related to the formation, maintenance and development of family-sized farms.  There is nothing more important for the country as a whole than this type of operation.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly the ACC down through the years have been making an enormous contribution in this regard.  The Bill is simply enabling the corporation to borrow more money and to provide the additional facilities that are being called for by reason of the developing farming situation.  Unfortunately there is an immense amount to be concerned about at present.  There never was a time, for a long period, when farming needed more assistance and support that it does right now.  The growth and development of farming here has unfortunately come to a standstill.  This has happened for a number of reasons.  Credit is one of the reasons and we should not be afraid to talk about it.  It has happened because of a general overall loss of confidence in farming at present, because of the uncertainty of the position both now and in the future.  When we are talking about credit we must also be concerned about whether or not that credit is going to be utilised if and when provision is made about it and we must be as much concerned about the things that encourage people to use credit as about the things that discourage them.  It is relevant to this Bill and we should talk about these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going back a few years I remember when we had a World Bank loan and it was one of the best things that every happened here because first of all it was at a reasonably low rate of interest and people were able to use it and make money by using it.  The assurance that they were going to do sensible things came about because of the organised way in which it was used, because it was invested in a <Col N="2121" /> way that was more or less planned and supervised.  I was extremely anxious at that time to ensure that that would continue and when the World Bank loan was exhausted I invited all the members of the ordinary banks and the representatives of the ACC in for discussions. Something worthwhile came out of that. There was an agreement that an additional £20 million over two years should be obtained.  The loan period was a maximum of 12 years.  At that time the ACC had just agreed to give development loans for a period of 16 years.</P>
    <P>I, unfortunately, was not here when the Minister was introducing this Bill, but somebody told me that there is some question of reducing the loan period to ten years.  That is a fair period and it may be enough.  I do know that the ACC at the stage I am talking about considered it essential to have a loan period of 16 years.  Why did they so consider it?  Did it enable them to have a lower rate of interest and did it enable them to give a longer moratorium period in the early years when there was very little return?  I simply do not know. When I get a chance to have a look at the Minister's opening speech I will certainly do so, but it would be a retrograde step if it was decided arbitrarily to reduce the loan period from a maximum of 16 years to ten years because there must be cases in which a longer loan period would be and should be necessary and agreed.</P>
    <P>This has been one of the worst farming years for quite some time and many of the farmers here are now in a position where they have lost money in the present year and they do not know what is going to hit them next year or the year after.  The Government have a responsibility to clear this up to the extent that it is possible.  We should take the uncertainty out of the situation.  Unfortunately in recent times nothing at all is being said to enable farmers to try to look into the future.  They are being told about all of the difficulties there are now in the EEC and that the prospects for the future are even worse.  Some of our own people <Col N="2122" /> here&mdash;and I do not exclude the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;are being influenced by British propaganda in relation to this. There is no doubt but that there is a concerted and well orchestrated attack on the CAP.  This is being done for a number of reasons.  First of all, it was always the policy of successive British Ministers on either side of the political divide to have no increase in agricultural prices and to get cheap food from any part of the world&mdash;to have a British policy only and nothing else.  That attack has been increased in recent times and since the directly elected Parliament has taken office it is for a different reason: that the United Kingdom feel they are paying an unusual proportion of what it costs to run the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair were to accept that we could have a full scale agricultural debate and that is what the Chair has been trying to prevent for the last two days.  I must admit that I have not been very successful, but we must try to keep as near as we can to agricultural credit and the involvement of the ACC in agricultural credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to do that, and I have always tried to keep within <Col N="2123" /> the rules of the House in any contributions I have made here over the years. But we cannot just have a narrow debate on this and achieve anything.</P>
      <P>I was listening to Deputy D'Arcy and he covered a fairly wide range of things. His contribution was an excellent one.  It was obvious that it was coming from a Member of this House who for years was also a member of the ACC.  He was speaking both as a farmer and as a person who was able to look at the operation of agriculture credit from the inside. The Minister responsible for Agriculture would do well to listen to his recommendations. The worst thing we can do for farmers is to give them credit that is going to bog them down for the rest of their lives.  They must be well advised before they borrow.  They could over-borrow or utilise the money wrongly simply because it is not well planned, because the people using it may not know what they are able to bear at a particular time or because of the type of farming they are carrying on.  So advice is extremely important.  This is one of the things that should become a responsibility of the ACC.  This borrowing must be accompanied by this type of plan and this type of advisory service.  They have done a first class job and they have developed to a very substantial extent in the last five or six years when it became possible for farmers to use money and to use it in such a way that it will eventually provide them with a decent livelihood and with profit on their investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately for the credit situation, at present it is the most progressive and most courageous farmers who are being worst hit, because they are the people who have borrowed heavily in the past. They are not enabled to carry the burden or, if they do carry on and carry it, we have a situation where in many cases the banks are putting on pressure to a point where people are getting out of farming or getting out of a particular type of farming because they cannot stand the weight of the overheads.  In this situation the ACC should be enabled to come to the rescue.  This is a time when strong consideration should be given by the <Col N="2124" /> Government to the possibility of subsidising interest rates in the ACC in order to allow the development and the maintenance of family-size farms, because if rural Ireland is not doing well the rest of the country ceases to be prosperous.  The sooner this is realised by people the better for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of days there has been a meeting here of the Agricultural Committee of the European Parliament. From the small amount of time these people were able to give here, and from what they were able to see, one of the things very obvious to them is the inadequacy of farm buildings on our farms. This is in stark contrast to the situation in Europe, generally.  First of all, there is the enormous and escalating cost of building.  If a farmer wants to have adequate buildings to take his cattle off the land at a time and in such a way as to carry out a proper grassland arrangement on his farm, he must have quite a substantial investment in buildings, from the point of view of the proper conservation of what he produces on his own farm and the proper storage of grain, as well as grass silage.</P>
    <P>The trend in Europe, as I read it, is more and more in the direction of not penalising people for whatever their line of production is, provided that the raw materials for that production are produced at home.  This would suit us adequately but we are very badly situated for availing ourselves of this new type of development in Europe, simply and solely because we have not the investment we need in proper farm building and a 30 per cent grant contribution is certainly not adequate. Somebody has the responsibility of trying to get that fact accepted outside the country at present.  Investment in building alone and, of course, in the development of farms, generally, is quite substantial.  The greatest need, at least at the outset, on development of any farm is, by whatever means to raise the fertility of the land, then raise the stocking rate and, perhaps, the building should come last&mdash;when there is something <Col N="2125" /> there to produce an income.  This sort of advice should be given and should be readily available, particularly for farms which are heavily worked.</P>
    <P>To get back to the European situation, at the moment farmers&mdash;in Germany, in particular&mdash;can get credit at 7½ per cent&mdash;7 per cent in some cases.  How can we compete, unless somewhat similar facilities are made available here?  It is not possible to compete and this must be realised and realised very soon.  One of the things we would be allowed to do, without interference from Europe, is to subsidise interest rates for worthwhile development.  There is at present a great need for this type of subsidisation.  Our interest rates are in the region of 17½ per cent to 20 per cent and it is impossible for people to use money, in farming in particular, where the return is quite small, by comparison with other investments that can be made in industry and in providing services here, there and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>At one and the same time as this credit is available in other countries at 7 or 8 per cent, the national aids being provided in these countries are three to four times what they are here.  There is no way that we can compete against these odds, and we are a country which exports approximately 70 per cent of our total production.  We should bear this in mind, when considering the subsidisation of credit, especially as regards the ACC.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy spoke about the difficulties facing the ACC in competing with the banks, because of the current account facility which the banks have. This is something which should be looked at very critically, because there must be an enormous amount of money in the ordinary banks in current accounts that people are careless about, which money the banks can use at no rate of interest.  This must enable them to carry on their business in a way which ACC find it very difficult to compete with.</P>
    <P>My notes are rather disjointed and I apologise for them but a point was raised <Col N="2126" /> about the salary of the Chief Executive of ACC.  If we want to have, in the ACC, or in any other organisation for that matter, people of the right quality and want to keep them, we must pay them the going rate.  There has been a great deal of controversy, rather ugly public controversy, about the salary of the Chief Executive of the ACC. Someone said that it was a farcical situation that he was the only person in the organisation whose salary cannot be decided on by the Minister.  This should be seriously looked at.  When I had some responsibility in Government, that was one of the things I thought was totally wrong&mdash;that the Minister was not able to say, when he had that responsibility, &ldquo;Look we shall lose this man and we know we shall, if we do not up his salary to the going rates, to a reasonable level.&rdquo; The Minister simply had not the power to do it because of the repercussions elsewhere.  We should not be afraid of these things.  If somebody is worth having and is doing a first-class job he should be paid accordingly and I shall leave it at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, following the decision of the Irish Rugby Football Union not to withdraw the invitation to a South African rugby team to visit Ireland, the Government reluctantly concluded that they should not allow the visit to take place.  The reasons for the Government's decision on 18 September last were outlined in a statement issued at the time, which followed an earlier statement issued by me on 4 September indicating the Government's opposition to the tour.</P>
      <P>The Government's general attitude of opposition to apartheid in sport has been outlined on many occasions; their support for the Olympic principle of non-discrimination in sport was communicated directly to national sporting organisations, including the IRFU in 1976.  As regards official communications with the IRFU in the present instance, when details of the proposed tour became known, I made known my views in the statement of 4 September to which I have referred and this was communicated to the IRFU on 6 September. The IRFU's response of 10 September was the first official communication the Government received from the union in the matter.  Subsequently, following further contacts between my Department and the IRFU, the union informed me by letter dated 14 September of their decision not to withdraw the invitation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of a direct communication related specifically to this tour the Deputy is correct.  However, I should draw his attention to what I have said.  The consistent policy followed by all Governments and the communication sent to, among others, the IRFU in 1976 and statements made on numerous occasions since by me are matters of public knowledge of which the IRFU are aware.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree, having regard to the multiracial nature of this team that it was open to possible interpretation by the IRFU that the statement issued by the previous Government in 1976 might not necessarily apply and that in order to pursue the policy clearly laid down by previous Governments&mdash;and I recognise the contribution made by them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not making a distinction. I recognise that.  I should like to add that I welcome the decision the Minister eventually made.  I am simply asking if the Minister agrees that it would have been preferable if he had written directly to the IRFU prior to 4 September indicating to them his position in this regard, which was something he did subsequently on 18 September.</P>

In view of known positions as stated on occasions and communicated to the IRFU, it might have been preferable had they been in doubt about the matter if they had communication <Col N="2131" /> with us before issuing an invitation. If they did that they might have been guided by our position.  With regard to the racially mixed composition of the team, while any developments of this kind are obviously welcome, as the statement of 18 September pointed out, &ldquo;it seems that the local organisation of many sports in South Africa, including rugby football, unhappily continue to be largely determined by the organisation of society in South Africa on the racially segregated basis of the apartheid system.&rdquo;  As the Government statement said, &ldquo;in the circumstances, the Olympic principle of non-discrimination cannot be satisfactorily observed&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland was not represented at the Conference of the Heads of State or Government of the Non-aligned Movement in Havana in early September.  Participation in the meetings of the non-aligned can take place at various levels&mdash;full participation, observer status and guest status.  Ireland has never received an invitation to participate at <Col N="2132" /> meetings of the non-aligned countries at any of these levels.</P>
    <P>Ireland has considerable sympathy with the basic objectives of the Non-aligned Movement and we have followed with deep interest developments within the movement over the 18 years since its foundation.  Though I do not foresee Ireland becoming a member of the Non-aligned Movement we will continue to maintain and to develop our relationship with individual members of the movement through frequent bilateral contacts and contacts at various international fora.  I might add that I have had frequent ministerial contact in Ireland and elsewhere with many Governments who are members of the Non-aligned Movement.  Through these contacts I have been able to establish a fruitful understanding and I have been kept fully abreast of the aims and issues that arise in the movement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the onus is on us to seek membership, be it in an official, observer or full capacity of this group of nations and that, therefore, the reply that since we were not invited we did not attend is somewhat inadequate?  Would the Minister not further agree that in the light of our developing bilateral aid programme&mdash;which the Minister has pursued and which is welcomed by this party&mdash;there is an added dimension to the relevance of his country as the only neutral State within the EEC becoming formally aligned to the non-aligned nations, and that it would enhance our position internationally and particularly with regard to the North-South dialogue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that there is not only an awareness of but respect for Ireland's position in relation to these non-aligned movements, particularly those of them who have members in Africa.  I am quite satisfied that that respect was in no small way a contributory factor in the difficult negotiations we had to conclude in Lomé, for instance.  I am equally satisfied that the regular contact we have <Col N="2133" /> had with Governments in India, Tanzania, Zambia, across the whole range of the non-aligned movement, showed that as between us and the movement, or most members of it, not all of them, there is a common respect and understanding and that we are in no way compromised by lack of membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reply to the implied question by Deputy Quinn: is an invitation needed to join the non-aligned countries?  Secondly, would the Minister not agree that while obviously there are strong leanings in both directions to NATO and the Warsaw Pact in the number of countries involved, a case could be made for suggesting that we could be more influential within the non-aligned countries than being outside?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may take the point the Deputy has just made in relation to the leanings that some might have, I should like to stress particularly that the fact that one is not a member is in no way to suggest the independence of one's position or to call it into question because&mdash;as the Deputy in fact has implied&mdash;there are members within the movement certainly who would not pursue the same independence of policy as we do.  I am very conscious of the aims of that movement.  Secondly, before one attends a conference one must be invited to attend and we were not so invited. Similarly it would apply to terms of membership.  But, having said that, Ireland is quite satisfied that it is pursuing a consistent role in the interests not alone of its own position but of relations with various groups of countries and perhaps also the bridge we can build between, and nobody elsewhere has ever questioned that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any specific invitation existing on the records of this House or anywhere in this country inviting us to join the EEC.  Yet we joined the EEC.  In view of the Minister's declared position on many occasions in relation to neutrality, would he be <Col N="2134" /> prepared now to take steps to ensure that there will be an Irish Government representative at the next conference of the non-aligned nations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat again that I do not think that membership of this movement&mdash;and there must be some clear cases of which the Deputy is aware&mdash;is, itself, evidence of neutrality in one way or another.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scale of the present tragedy in Kampuchea is so great that only a major concerned effort by the international community will be able to have an impact on the situation.  While it is impossible to give precise figures, it is the <Col N="2135" /> general belief that as many as one to two million Kampucheans could die from starvation by the end of the year, unless the relief effort proves to be effective&mdash;I should say here that this reply was formulated, I think, a month ago so it was taking a three-month scale into account.</P>
    <P>As an initial national response to this tragedy, I announced on 9 October a contribution of £50,000 from the Disaster Relief fund of my Department to the joint UNICEF/ICRC relief programme for Kampuchea, and which aims to meet Kampuchea's basic needs in food, drugs and other essentials over the next six months.  This programme is now operational, but it is vitally important that its momentum be maintained if the efforts to counter famine and disease are to be effective.</P>
    <P>Two days later, on 11 October, I announced a further contribution of £50,000 to the national appeal launched by six voluntary agencies with whom I had, at my request, a detailed discussion on the situation in Kampuchea on the previous day, and with whom I continue to remain in close contact.  In responding to the national appeal, I also indicated the Government's willingness to support programmes of emergency assistance organised by these and other organisations on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>In this regard, Deputies will be aware that the Government agreed to underwrite the cost of a plane to airlift food and medical supplies to Kampuchea, organised by the relief agency, GOAL, and which has successfully completed its mission.  We are happy also to be able to assist in the practical arrangements for this very generous humanitarian effort.</P>
    <P>Given the very great need to ensure that relief, whether provided bilaterally or through intergovernmental and international organisations, is co-ordinated in the most effective way possible, I have been maintaining close contact with my colleagues in the Community.  At the recent informal meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Nine in Ashford Castle, which I chaired, I raised the question of further and most urgent Community aid for Kampuchea.  We agreed that the <Col N="2136" /> Community should look immediately at additional ways in which it could respond and, in order to give best effect to this decision, I immediately convened a meeting in Dublin of senior officials including aid experts.  Subsequently, on 30 October, the Council of Ministers, meeting in Luxembourg under my chairmanship, decided that a further $35 million should be made available for relief from Community resources.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that this momentum be maintained.  For this reason an aid co-ordination meeting between the Commission and the Nine was held in Brussels last week.  This meeting afforded member states and the Commission an important opportunity to evaluate measures already put into effect and to examine, in the light of the uncovered needs of the international organisations and others, what further concrete steps might be taken.  Thus, for example, an immediate request from the ICRC for three aircraft to replace the Hercules, provided by the British government and due to be withdrawn on 18 November for servicing, was met by offers of aircraft from France, Netherlands and also by Australia.  This co-ordination between the Community and the international agencies will continue for it is, as I said at the beginning of my reply, imperative that we have the maximum co-ordinated effort in responding to this tragedy, if we are to make an effective and decisive impact on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the sum of £100,000 provided by the State is an adequate response from this country to the appalling situation that exists in Kampuchea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not the extent of the State's response, even though that was referred to specifically in my reply, because I also mentioned the cost of underwriting the plane to Kampuchea, which is very considerable also.  Also, as I have indicated we are ready to respond&mdash;and this purely on a bilateral basis&mdash;to any further programmes that will arise.  I want to remind the Deputy also that the State has <Col N="2137" /> already made a huge commitment in terms of anything we had done previously in respect of Indo-Chinese refugees generally, by far the biggest we have ever even contemplated, though I suppose the problem did not exist to the same extent before.  Finally, of course, there is the contribution which we make through the EEC.  Therefore, across the whole range of these, I can assure the Deputy that Ireland's position is, let us say, respectable and is seen to be such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may take the view that the Irish position is respectable. Does he not feel that in view of the critical&mdash;the only word one can use for the situation in Cambodia at present&mdash;situation there at present, in view of the numbers involved, running into million of people, in view also of the time scale involved and the probability of deaths by starvation over the next six to eight weeks, despite what he has done&mdash;and I compliment him for providing a plane for GOAL&mdash;we should be making a really special effort in this case particularly as, with the Presidency of the EEC, it may encourage other countries similarly to do better than they are doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do feel we should make a special effort and I would like to think that is precisely what we have been doing.  I referred to the Ashford Castle meeting at which we did specifically bring up this question.  The consequence of that was that within ten days&mdash;which anyone will recognise is a record for Community action&mdash;commitments totalling over 55 million dollars, more than half the total amount being sought by the Secretary General of the United Nations in the report which issued one day before the Ashford Castle meeting, was committed by the member states and by the Community.  That was effective and immediate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to the second point&mdash;this is the view of the Secretary General and not mine&mdash;the problem is not necessarily the amount of aid that is available; it is the problem of the distribution of that <Col N="2138" /> aid.  That is the area in which the international community is trying to work effectively, to get what is available through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>What guarantees has the Minister on the precise point of distribution that the aid, such as food and medicines, is getting through to the starving people?  What efforts have been made to have the overland truck route from Thailand and also the two Kampuchean airports made available to penetrate deep into the country where the starvation is worst?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be able to tell the Deputy that one had a cast-iron guarantee but, unfortunately, one does not have that.  However, from all the information we have from our regular contact which we had on the occasion of the Taoiseach's discussion with the Secretary General of the United Nations, we are informed that the ICRC and the UNICEF organisations are satisfied, to the extent that they can be, with the distribution channels at this stage.  I believe, as they believe, that there can be considerable further improvement in the areas referred to by the Deputy.  Ideally, we would expect that these roadways would be opened up to free and unlimited access.  It is a problem that can be easily identified but not so easily solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Keeffe in recognising that the distribution problems are very serious and I should like an assurance from the Minister, to the extent that these problems are eased and that the opportunity will then exist for additional aid to be given, that the Government would be willing to increase their contribution further in accordance with what I believe is the united view of the Irish people.  If necessary the Minister should seek further funds from the Dáil if the disaster relief provision is exhausted.</P>

I have also indicated that I am currently considering further support for relief operations on a bilateral basis but that can only be effective when the question of distribution is satisfactory.</P>

I should like to know if he attempted in his capacity as President of the Council of Ministers of the EEC to get a commitment that the United States will drop as many dollars in aid on the Cambodian State as they dropped dollars in bombs over the last decade?</P>

      <P>While I appreciate that the Department did underwrite the <Col N="2140" /> flight costs of Messrs.  Phillips and O'Shea, whom I compliment, so that the money they had would go directly in relief aid, I should like to know if the Minister is aware of any further immediate individual relief effort of a similar nature?  Is there any further money available in the Department to meet flight costs and ensure that the money collected does not purely go on administration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any effort such as this but I am aware that the various organisations are contemplating what they can do.  Equally, they are conscious of the fact that distribution is the problem.  We are looking at further possibilities but we are concerned about effective distribution.

As far as what the Irish people can do I should like to tell the Deputy that there are many relief organisations looking for support, particularly in terms of medicines as distinct from food.  Apparently, medicines are in great need also.  In the final analysis our people, like all Members, would be concerned to know that what is being supplied is given to those who are starving.  I hope that according as we get further assurances from the United Nations High Commission For Refugees and from UNICEF we can give further indications to the Irish people as to how they can help.</P>

      <P>To the last part of the question I can reply categorically that there was no pressure whatsoever. In relation to the decision itself, I should like to refer back to the non-aligned movement which we were being asked to join some time ago.  In my view almost 80 per cent of the non-aligned movement voted for seating the Pol Pot regime in the UN.  Therefore, that was not a perception that we had.  What Pol Pot had done we saw as being totally reprehensible and unacceptable and, irrespective of what the non-aligned movement or others might be doing, we would not vote for it.  Neither could we vote for Heng Samrin which had been imposed on the Vietnamese people by outside intereference. We could not vote for either and therefore, we abstained.</P>

    <P>The representatives of the EEC member states in Tehran have met recently with the new Iranian Foreign Minister and have expressed to him their concern in relation to the safety of embassy personnel and security of embassy permises.  They have been assured by the Iranian authorities that they will take all steps in their power to ensure the safety of embassy personnel and premises.  It is <Col N="2144" /> not my intention to withdraw the Irish diplomatic staff from Iran but the situation in regard to our embassy personnel and citizens will be kept under continuing review.</P>
    <P>There are at present 25 Irish citizens known to the embassy still living in Iran. The Irish Embassy maintains close contact with them and although they have been advised to leave there is no reason to believe that they are in any immediate danger at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately the response in relation to the hostages has not been satisfactory.  At the meeting of the nine Foreign Minister in Brussels yesterday we expressed our concern that the authorities had not fulfilled their obligations under international law.  The Irish Presidency had already made its concern known many times through diplomatic channels to these authorities. We condemned any attempt to exert pressure on Governments by taking hostages, particularly in embassies.  We considered that whatever the nature of the dispute between Iran and the US, the continued holding of the diplomatic personnel in the embassy is in breach of international law and as such must be rejected by the Governments of the Nine and by the international community.  For the information of the House I propose to circulate my statement on this at a later stage.  However, that is the position of the nine Foreign Ministers as a result of our discussions yesterday in Brussels. As far as the Irish contingent are concerned we have no reason to believe that they are under any threat.</P>

      <P>This booklet brings together details of suffering experienced by children at the hands of various governments or their agents.  The contents are shocking and distressing particularly in this International Year of the Child.</P>
      <P>In the course of my recent address to the General Assembly of the United Nations I reiterated my concern about human rights violations of various kinds. The Amnesty International Report on children indicates that many children in several parts of the world are victims of some of the violations to which I referred.</P>

The Deputy can be assured that representatives of the Irish Government will continue to participate actively in the various efforts to this end in international fora, particularly in the United Nations General Assembly.</P>

We will continue to do that.  It is from those resolutions, as adopted by the United Nations, that certain actions are taken.  I appreciate the Deputy's concern, which is shared by me.  I want to indicate that we are not just reacting or responding.  We are taking initiatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the efforts, if any, being made at national and EC level to highlight violations of human rights in the Soviet Union in view of the fact that the Olympics are to be held in Moscow next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This question relates to the implementation of the human rights provisions of the Helsinki Final Act.  The Final Act signed by the 35 Heads of Government in Helsinki in 1975 has two main elements.  First of all, it contains a series of ten principles to guide relations between states, including <Col N="2150" /> the principle of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  It also contains a series of agreed measures designed to improve co-operation between them. Although the Final Act is not a legal instrument, it is a political commitment which the 35 participating states solemnly reaffirmed at the end of the Belgrade follow-up meeting last year.</P>
      <P>From the outset, the Irish Government have attached great importance to the implementation of the Final Act and especially its human rights provisions. On many occasions, both publicly and privately, we have stressed the view that if the process begun by the Final Act is to be effective it must be based not only on the relaxation of tensions and growing co-operation between states but also a respect for human rights within states.</P>
      <P>On the issue of human rights violations in the Soviet Union, no action has been taken specifically in the context of the Moscow Olympics by Ireland alone or together with our partners in the Nine. We have however made our views known to the Soviet authorities on many occasions and they are in no doubt about our concern.  In the run-up to the CSCE meeting in Madrid next year we will continue to press for full implementation of all aspects of the Final Act and in particular its human rights and related humanitarian provisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the Helsinki Final Act is largely defective in this area, that when there are obvious violations of it by signatories to it there seems to be no procedure whereby these can be highlighted and, more importantly, where those violations can be remedied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obviously not as watertight as we would like it to be.  It is not a binding agreement as such but one element in the Helsinki package is that it has created an awareness of human rights in the countries who are signatories to it.  We get such things as the Charter 1977, Czechoslovkia and, it is fair to say, the repression against members of that group.  The welcome development since Helsinki is that there <Col N="2151" /> has been a sensitivity, if no more, in the authorities where human rights have been denied.  We have seen improvements&mdash;I am not saying they are fully satisfactory&mdash;in the situation.  It is not watertight and I would be the last to suggest it is.  That is one of the areas we will be considering in the follow up to it in Madrid next year.</P>

      <P>The Government deplore the violation of human rights wherever they occur.  The concern of the Government of the member states of the European Community, including Ireland, has been expressed to the Argentine authorities on a number of occasions. The Government have noted with satisfaction the decision of the Argentine authorities to allow on-the-spot investigation of the human rights situation by the Inter American Human Rights Commission, an organ of the Organization of American States.  The report of the group will be studied with interest when it becomes available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that representations can be made to other Government on behalf of persons who are Irish citizens.  Where persons are citizens of Ireland and another country, they are not, under our regulations, in a position to avail themselves of Irish consular protection in the country of their second citizenship.  The ability of the Government to intercede on behalf of persons of Irish descent in Argentina is accordingly limited.  I can assure the Deputy that our ambassador in Buenos Aires will continue to bring to the attention of the Argentine authorities, in the course of his regular contacts with them, <Col N="2152" /> the concern of the Government in regard to human rights violations in Argentina.</P>

      <P>Since diplomatic relations were established with Russia in 1974&mdash;and the Deputy, who was a Parliamentary Secretary at the time, will be aware of the significance of that step&mdash;the trade pattern has improved considerably in the last year or two.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty was signed by Presidents Brezhnev and Carter in Vienna on 18 June 1979.  Before the treaty can come into effect it must be ratified by both the United States and the Soviet Union.  At present two Committees of the United States Senate are examining the Treaty.  In my address last month to the United Nations, and speaking both as foreign Minister of Ireland and President in Office of the European Communities, I welcomed the signing of the treaty at Vienna and urged its early entry into force.</P>
      <P>While I recognise that the ratification of the treaty is a matter for the states directly involved, I hope that the treaty will enter into force at an early date since I believe that it will make a considerable contribution to the arms control process and open up prospects for further reductions of both strategic and tactical nuclear weapons.</P>

Is it not a fact that in any future nuclear confrontation in western Europe there will be no noninvolved people and that the importance of Salt II is that it is likely that Salt III will lead to a reduction in armaments, which is something everybody fervently hopes for?</P>

      <P>The meeting to which the Deputy refers is that of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Communities Member States, meeting in the framework of European Political Co-operation.  There are normally four of these meetings each year, two in each Presidency.</P>
      <P>The first such meeting in the Irish Presidency took place in Dublin on Tuesday, 11 September 1979.  A second meeting took place yesterday in Brussels and that was not entered in the record of this State.  Among the issues discussed by the Nine Foreign Minister were: Indochina, the Middle East, the Euro-Arab Dialogue and Southern Africa.  I am, of course, speaking of the first meeting.</P>
      <P>Two public statements were issued by the Ministers following the meeting, one relating to the situation in the Lebanon and the other on Rhodesia.  The full texts of these statements were released to the press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2162" /> As regards Indochina, the discussions touched upon the continuing plight of the refugees, the current political situation in Cambodia and the prospect of devastating famine now facing the people there.  On the refugee issue, Ministers were agreed that follow-up action to the Geneva conference, in particular the work of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and of the UN Secretary General, should be followed closely.  On Cambodia, Ministers acknowledged that a solution to the political situation in Cambodia can only be found within the context of the wider political situation in the area as a whole, while stressing that a solution should be based on an independent Cambodia with a genuinely representative government. The Ministers underlined their commitment to providing effective humanitarian aid as a matter of urgency to the people of Cambodia who face famine on a wide scale.</P>
    <P>As regards the Euro-Arab Dialogue, the Ministers emphasised that the Nine consider the Dialogue to be of the greatest importance, based as it is upon the affinities and common interests between the two regional groups and feel that it should be developed with the group of the Arab countries as a whole.</P>
    <P>That question related to the meeting of the Foreign Ministers in Dublin. There was a meeting of Foreign Ministers yesterday in Brussels at which further developments in many of these areas took place.</P>

      <Col N="2171" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £13,381,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1979, for the salaries and expenses of the Garda Síochána, including pensions, etc.; for payments of compensation and other expenses arising out of service in the Local Security Force; for the payment of certain witnesses' expenses; and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not need 25 minutes more.  I will sum up what I said on the last occasion.  I said that people who are engaged in certain types of crime seem to have a chip on their shoulder, or a grudge against society. This is true in many cases.  We should have some method of finding out why these people have a chip on their shoulder and why they have chosen to break the law.  Perhaps some of them have good reason to have a chip on their shoulder because of the kind of society we have built up here.  We should examine this and draw our own conclusions. Over the past few years&mdash;and I am not picking out any period during which any party were in power&mdash;there seemed to be more people with a grudge against society.  For that reason there may be more criminals.  I would ask the Minister to consider if there are ways and means of assessing why these people took that attitude in the first instance and why they went in that direction.  From that study we might be able to learn a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said the Garda should be well paid. They should not be in financial need and they should be independent.  They should be independent financially because they <Col N="2172" /> have to administer our laws.  They should be above suspicion.  No matter who they may prosecute, we should give them our full support in the arduous duties they are carrying out.</P>
    <P>I talked about prisons.  I want to continue in that vein with particular reference to the prison at the Curragh. The Minister had to leave the House during the debate when I was speaking about the Curragh prison.  This prison was opened in 1971-72.  It was the old glasshouse which was a place of punishment for members of the Defence Forces who committed very small crimes in the military sense.  I would not think most of them would be considered crimes in the ordinary sense of the word by the public. They were misdemeanours under the military code.  This prison was a place of punishment, usually of very short duration.</P>
    <P>The Minister said to me previously that he is as anxious to close the Curragh prison as I am.  I accept that.  I want to point out that it was introduced as a temporary measure.  I was not in this House at the time, but it was introduced in a temporary capacity because of destruction that had been carried out by prisoners in Mountjoy.  I do not want to imply that I am giving them a title but people who referred to themselves as political prisoners were transferred at that time from Mountjoy to the Curragh.  This went on through the period of a Government I supported. I am not making a political point about this.  I spoke here on Estimates during their time in office in the same vein as I am speaking now.  I fear that this military detention may become a permanent feature of our society.  I do not think it should.  There are many reasons why I feel the Curragh military prison should be closed.</P>
    <P>I want to appeal to the Minister in a reasonable manner.  There has been time, in six or seven years, to have done whatever was necessary to improve the accomodation in other prisons, or to restore it, or to provide extra accommodation if necessary, to house these prisoners.  At present, 90 per cent of the <Col N="2173" /> prisoners held in the Curragh have no political record.  They are criminals, most of them serving long terms.</P>
    <P>The Curragh is not a suitable place for detaining prisoners, particularly long-term prisoners.  I think all members of the Curragh visiting committee except myself are Fianna Fáil supporters.  That committee recommended unanimously to the Minister that this prison should be closed.  It is not a political issue.  There may be one other member of that committee, apart from myself, who is not a Fianna Fáil supporter but they are all of the opinion that it should be closed for the same reasons I have given.</P>
    <P>It is seven years since Mountjoy was wrecked or whatever was done that made it necessary at that time&mdash;and a Fianna Fáil Government were in power&mdash;to put these people there.  This was continued by the Coalition Government. A prison was built in the Curragh during the term of office of the Coalition Government but it was never used.  I have been told it is not fit for the job it was built for, but I do not know.  There should be some way of closing that prison now.  The Minister accepts that it is not a proper place to house long-term prisoners.  I am not here to raise issues that we might raise and that many other people might raise.  I have no axe to grind for any organisation or for anybody else.  It is not a fit place to hold long-term prisoners.  After seven years we should have some other accommodation.</P>
    <P>Prisoners housed in the Curragh give all sorts of trouble elsewhere.  They are bundled in together because it is a place where they can be kept easily; they are confined there.  There are armed guards. Is it the policy of Governments to make this a permanent feature of our society&mdash;military detention of ordinary prisoners who have no political connection? If it is, it is a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>The time has come when we must be able to provide the accommodation necessary for these prisoners.  There are many drawbacks in the Curragh.  We must have some deadline as to when we <Col N="2174" /> will close this prison, and when we will provide proper accommodation.  This prison is not fair to people who join the Army to serve their country&mdash;and in Kildare we are very proud of the Army and of the Curragh.  We are very proud of the work the Army have done.  I know they say: &ldquo;It is a job that has to be done and we have no objection to doing it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the reaction of our troops and members of our Defence Forces in every area at all times.  I am not saying anything against that, but this prison work is not something they enlisted to do.  When a person joins the Army he joins to serve his country either at home or abroad as directed.  It may be said that people are glad to do this because there is overtime involved, but I do not think that is true.  These people from the governor of the prison down, have not got the kind of training that is necessary for operating a civilian prison.  I am saying that in all seriousness and in all honesty, and I would say it regardless of whoever the Minister happened to be at any time.</P>
    <P>I understand the difficulties that brought about this situation.  I do not know who is to blame but I would not like to see this prison on the Curragh, which is a military detention prison, a permanent feature of our society and of our prison system.  It is frustrating in many ways to be a member of a visiting committee.  The authorities and the Minister, with all the advice available to them, probably know better than the visiting committees, but as a member of a visiting committee one is left with the impression of not really doing anything. These committees make recommendations in regard to parole or in regard to some amenity or facility that they feel might be helpful both to discipline and to the prisoners but they find their recommendations ignored.</P>
    <P>There is a particular problem in regard to the Curragh in this matter because two Departments are involved&mdash;the Department of Justice, who are the overall authority, and the Department of Defence.  I do not know how the two operate together but it is <Col N="2175" /> confusing and upsetting that the military are involved in the first instance, then the Department of Defence and, presumably, the Minister for Justice has some say in the matter.</P>
    <P>For long-term prisoners in particular some way should be devised whereby they could have visits totally in private, even if this meant the person going in to visit had to be very rigorously searched. The least we could offer these prisoners is a visit without a warder or a military policeman listening to every word that falls from, possibly, a wife's mouth.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the risks attaching to parole but parole can also be very beneficial.  I know of one person who was on a very serious charge, not in the Curragh prison, and who had been going from Dublin to Portaoise to work on the farm.  He was allowed out on parole at certain weekends and he is now in full-time employment and back with his family in his own home.  The fact that we were able to do this with one or two prisoners that I know of indicates that parole could be used more and to better advantage in a lot of cases.  I am not trying to say that parole should be granted to every prisoner.  It is probable that some of them would avail of such facility for the purpose of absconding.  But it is something that should be examined or at least tried.  Even if we should make mistakes we would be trying to do something for these people.</P>
    <P>I remember being on the board of a mental hospital where the doctor was very advanced in his thinking.  His idea was to take down walls and unlock doors.  At that time every door was locked and there was a big high wall so that going in there was tantamount to going into Sing Sing prison.  This doctor took the line that this situation should be changed, that mental illness was a sickness, and the result of the changes he brought about were wonderful.  Even if there were little mishaps on the way it was very worthwhile.  Likewise, I am saying to the Minister that even if there are little mishaps with the parole system for prisoners, it might be worth taking that risk now and then to obtain the <Col N="2176" /> benefits which I believe come from that kind of system.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the Minister but I would ask him to consider the points I have made particularly about the Curragh prison and the other ones about parole.  I shall always be in agreement with the provision of any money that is needed for paying the gardai or for prisons or prison improvements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to facilitate the House and the Minister in having this Supplementary Estimate passed this evening.  Therefore, I am not going to speak at any length.  The problem with which we are dealing not alone affects the Republic of Ireland but affects the entire island of Ireland.  I understand that the cost of security at the moment is somewhere in the region of £200 million. In the past year and nine months £4 million have been stolen by armed men. In the society in which we live, where there are so many people in need of rehousing, where there are so many people living below the breadline, it is very wrong that people, believing that they are right but misguided as they are, should continue to pursue ideals that are unobtainable through their methods.  If there is no response to asking them to leave down their guns and to come into the democratic system, surely they might at least have regard to the number of homeless people living in both parts of Ireland, to the number of elderly people living alone and in bad housing conditions, to the number of elderly people living below the subsistence level and to the amount of money it is costing this State and the Northern people to fight subversives. That in itself must be a strong appeal to them to reconsider their position. If they believe in their objectives, in the unity of the Irish people, they must realise that there are other people who, while not subscribing to their methods, share that belief also; and not all of those belong to the nationalist tradition.  I hope that this will be recognised and that these people will try to relate to the people of Ireland more through the democratic system than the methods they are using now&mdash;not all of them belong to the <Col N="2177" /> nationalist tradition.  I hope they will recognise that and will try to relate to the people of Ireland more through the democratic system than the methods they are using at the moment, which, in fact, are doing more to divide the people. But that is a different argument.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's Supplementary Estimate he refers to the Ryan Report.  I would like to join with the Minister in congratulating Dr. Ryan and his committee on the manner in which they produced this report.  I am not satisfied that the Minister has paid as much attention to certain parts of it as he did to others.  I am grateful to the Minister for acknowledging the need in the Garda force for better pay and better conditions all round.  They were very much overdue and should be welcomed by the members of all ranks in the gardaí.  The Minister referred to this matter.  There are still a couple of things he could easily have attended to and one of them is the necessity for someone joining the Garda Síochána to be unmarried.  I think that is discrimination.  Has that situation changed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad about that.  The other thing which should be brought to the Minister's attention is the provision regarding a qualifying oral test in Irish.  I am not anti-Irish or against the Gaelic language but it is time we realised that because a person is competent in the native language it does not necessarily mean that he is going to be a good garda.  Neither does it follow that if he is not competent in the native language he is going to be a bad garda.  I would like to ask the Minister how many gardai could communicate in writing or conduct a simple conversation in Irish after they have passed this test, or how much of the Irish language is used in Garda stations.  It is time that we toned that down a little.  We could make the same <Col N="2178" /> point by some other method.  It is very necessary to have members of the force who are fluent Irish speakers because they must do duty in Gaeltacht areas. That is very necessary, but I do not think it should be an over-riding factor. It militates against a certain section of our people.  If someone from the North wants to come down here and join our police force, of necessity he has to study the Irish language first, and then having studied it and passed the test he is never called on to use it from there on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of bank robberies that have been going on over the last two years is so staggering that I cannot understand why there has not been a better attempt to recruit a greater number of gardaí.  When I look at the campaign being conducted at the moment in our newspapers, on television and on radio seeking more recruits for our Army, I wonder where are our priorities.  Is it our priority to have a strong Army and a weak Garda force?  The Minister can turn around and say &ldquo;We have increased the membership of the Garda force since we came back into office.&rdquo; Yes, that is true, but he must also acknowledge the fact that his party were in government until 1969 and they allowed the numbers in the force to drop to such a low level that when the troubles broke out in Northern Ireland we had not sufficient numbers to man the installations around the State, let alone protect us against subversion on either side of the Border.  We are really getting back to square one.  We are getting back to the strength of the force 20 years ago. Ten years ago the force was at a very low level.  I remember coming into the House and inquiring from the Minister in charge in those days about the state of the vehicles which the gardai had to use and which did no credit to us.  While the Garda vehicles and their technical assistance have been increased over a number of years they are far short of what they have in other parts of Ireland. I do not want to go into detail, but I would point out that the RUC are equipped with every facility to meet emergencies&mdash;and I am not talking about the emergency of violence; I am not talking <Col N="2179" /> about ordinary accidents that happen on our roads.  The manner in which they are equipped with the facilities necessary to meet all eventualities should be noted by the Minister's Department and the Garda should be given equal facilities.</P>
    <P>Getting back to recruiting, I do not see any reason why, now that gardai are being reasonably well paid, there should not be a recruiting drive aimed at leaving certificate classes in the schools, pointing out to them that a career in the Garda Síochána is now worthwhile and inviting them to consider seriously making the force a career.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the whole position <i>vis-á-vis</i> training the gardaí.  I think a recruit is given five months in a training school and eventually because of the experience he gains in the service he will become a very competent and very efficient member of the force.  That is falling far short of the standards we require in a modern society.  Many young men who cannot get jobs work in dance bands or on their father's farm or in their businesses for pocket money, and they cannot be expected to become efficient gardaí after a five-month training course in a training school.  That is not good enough.  While it may have served the purpose years ago it no longer meets the needs of the society in which we live.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister conduct a campaign basically on the same lines as the Minister for Defence is, asking young boys in leaving certificate classes in secondary schools to consider joining the police force.  I would like to see the Minister setting up a cadet school where these boys could do a course much the same as the cadets in the Army.  We have to ask ourselves the big question: do we want a society where the civil security or force is what we all identify with or do we want a society where at every checkpoint we will see military vehicles and men in uniform armed with guns?  While these things are necessary at the moment and while people tolerate them because of their necessity, I do not think people want to see soldiers at cross-roads or at Border checkpoints asking people to open the boot or bonnet <Col N="2180" /> of their car or to be searched.  I do not think people want to see guns in our streets.  Therefore, the security which I am asking the Minister to consider at the moment is a security which is more a civil responsibility, the responsibility of the civil force, namely the Garda. Therefore, the Garda should be in greater numbers on the streets.  If one wants to keep crime off the streets one must put more gardai on the streets. There are far too many young boys running around doing nothing at the moment who are seeking a career and it would not be very difficult to educate them to the ways and means of being a good garda officer.  Let us face it, the standard of education of the teenager or young man in the late seventies is far above the level it was a decade or two ago.  They have opportunities that their fathers and grandfathers did not have, and that is a fair start for the Minister for Justice to call on.  It is a fair start for any young boy to go into a training school or cadet school and be trained in the prevention of crime.  When I say the prevention of crime I mean the prevention of crime, because there is far too much emphasis laid on apprehending people instead of preventing crime.  I have great praise for certain members of the Garda in County Donegal whom I know personally and we get involved in community work at every level of parish life.  They are involved in football teams, community games, the St. Vincent de Paul and such organisations which help young people to overcome the frustration of not having anything to do on an evening.  Many of them are doing this but there are a few of them who are downright lazy.  They should be shown a new direction about getting involved.  It is not serving any purpose to catch a young boy after he has committed a crime but it is serving a purpose if we can prevent a young boy or girl from committing one.</P>
    <P>The emphasis is not as strong on the prevention of crime as it is on detection. I would like the Minister and his Department to take special note of the amount of money it is now costing us in security, the amount of money that is now being <Col N="2181" /> stolen by subversive groups, armed men&mdash;it is not just the ordinary criminal who is doing this, some of it may be but not all.  The Minister should increase the Garda Force by realistic figures.  It is not good enough to say it has been increased by 500 men.  That is not adequate.</P>
    <P>The Minister should increase Garda numbers to a level where people can go to bed at night fairly certain that their property will not be destroyed before the morning or that they will not be personally injured.  Without being alarmist, I know of areas of the city and provincial towns where this happens, where old people are afraid to answer their door after dark.  I know of people who are making special pleas to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to have telephones installed in the homes of elderly relatives living alone so that they can telephone them to reassure themselves that there is nothing wrong.  In the Christian society in which we live we cannot close our eyes to such happenings and hope that tomorrow they will go away.  We have to do something about it. If more money is needed I believe our people will be prepared to pay.  There are too many boys and girls seeking positions in life at present, too many unemployed people anxious to make a contribution to improving our society.  I do not see why the Minister should not open his doors and say: &ldquo;Let us think afresh; let us be imaginative about the numbers we require and employ young boys in great numbers to provide better security.&rdquo;  I do not want to see military vehicles at any check-points in the Republic or in the North.  That is symptomatic of a society in which there is unrest.  Unless the civil powers do something about it, unless the Government give a lead, the necessity to have it continues.  It is so pressing and so strong that we cannot ignore it; we have to do something about it.</P>
    <P>The only way we can remove military presence from our streets is to increase the civil force.  In order to do that, it is not good enough putting an advertisement in a paper hoping to get 500 <Col N="2182" /> recruits because we would get 500 applications from people who are apathetic about what they are about to do.  We have got to sell the idea of having good police officers to the boys who have not yet made up their minds about careers. We must get career guidance counsellors to advise them on this.  Following that we must provide further educational facilities, I recommend, as other people have recommended, as, indeed, the Minister recommended when in Opposition, the establishment of a cadet school. Why we want a cadet school in the Army puzzles me when we ignore the fact that we do not have one for the Garda.  I do not see the rationale of that. There should be a cadet school for the Army, but if one is necessary for the Army it is total blindness not to acknowledge that we need one for the Garda also.</P>
    <P>The question of security also raises a matter which was reported in the press a few days ago.  I was otherwise engaged and could not deal with it but I tabled Private Notice Questions to the Minister which were disallowed.  They related to the import of a consignment of arms which arrived at the Dublin docks on 31 October last.  It is very interesting that that should have happened because about one month earlier I was on a speaking tour of the United States and I visited Massachusetts and in Boston I was queried about a statement made by a Mr. McMullin, a former Provisional IRA member who spent about two-and-a-half years in Portlaoise.  He acquainted himself with a gang called the Hughes gang whose identity is well known to the security forces, a group of bandits who were working as <i>quasi</i> IRA people, to line their own pockets.  McMullin's statement I dismissed as pure fantasy but he stated on radio, on television, and was widely quoted in the <i>Boston Globe,</i> that he was responsible for and was knowingly concerned with collecting money for the purchase of arms being sent to the port of Dublin.  He said there were friendly people working in the Dublin docks area which made it simple for them to bring arms in.  His statement was so incredible that I dismissed it absolutely <Col N="2183" /> and entirely.  I said I had sufficient confidence in the Garda, in the customs officers and, indeed, in the people who would be responsible for the goods going through the port of Dublin to reject absolutely the statement of Mr. McMullin.</P>
    <P>However, on 31 October a consignment of arms arrived from the United States.  They were not collected and I wonder why.  Is there someone of a friendly disposition working somewhere in the port of Dublin?  If there is it is the Minister's duty to get rid of him.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister doing about that? Are investigations being conducted?  In the course of my Private Notice Questions I asked if the Garda have established to whom the load of guns and ammunition recently seized at Dublin port were consigned.  I asked if there was any question of a leakage of information regarding the surveillance operations mounted by the Garda on the consignment and if an internal Garda inquiry was being held to discover whether or not there was such a leakage.  Finally, I asked if any prosecutions were pending in connection with the consignment.</P>
    <P>One could be an alarmist and say there is someone there.  One can look at McMullin in the United States and say that he is a troublemaker, that he is inventing those stories but which of us could put our hand on a Bible and say, &ldquo;it never happened&rdquo;?  I could not do that and I do not think the Minister could.  I do not think anybody else can.  If guns and ammunition are coming through the port of Dublin every step should be taken to prevent their arrival.</P>
    <P>I hope what I have said will be listened to.  I know the Minister shares my view and will do everything in his power to follow this through.  I do not want to give any credence to what McMullin said but I cannot dismiss what he said in the light of what happened since I have returned from the US and I hope that the Minister will reply when he is concluding.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the Minister's speech, when he introduced the Estimates, <Col N="2184" /> dealt with prisons.  I would like to avail myself of the opportunity to congratulate Deputy Michael Keating on his contribution last Thursday and recommend that any person interested in prison life in this State should read what he had to say.  He served on prison committees and is the son of a prison officer. He spoke with sincerity.</P>
    <P>The question of the prisons falls into two categories: the condition of the prisons and the prisoners.  The condition of the prisons cannot be the standard which modern society requires because they are ancient buildings.  Any ancient building that I have been in does not lend itself to the comforts that we would expect for human beings locked up, irrespective of what crime they have committed, for a quarter, half or all of their lifetime.  The conditions they are living in, no matter what Government are in power does no credit to us as public representatives.  The conditions will have to be looked at again.  This is a major task.  I do not expect the Minister to resolve the problem during his tenure of office.  The cost is so great that it is not possible.  But a planned programme should be agreed on that would head in that direction.</P>
    <P>There is not a great amount of money needed, when it comes to prisoners, to change our attitude towards the custody of people who have committed crimes for which they have been found guilty and sentenced before our courts.  I believe to lock someone up in a jail and to ignore the fact that perhaps it was society which caused that person to break the law is an indictment of society and not the fault, in many cases, of the person who has offended the laws which govern us.</P>
    <P>I have just listened to Deputy Joe Bermingham appeal to the Minister for a more liberal parole system.  I join in that appeal.  There are too many innocent people involved when someone is locked up in jail.  There are too many marriages breaking down because people are locked up in jail, and also too many children without fathers for the same reason.  I do not know what way a <Col N="2185" /> prisoner thinks.  I would have hated to have a childhood without the presence of my father, or to have grown up in a society knowing that that society took my father away from me in my early years.  No matter what his crime was, in my eyes he would have been innocent.  If we lock a person up in jail, we are really brain-washing his family against society.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege of listening to a black priest preach a sermon at Mass in Washington in mid-September about this subject.  Deputy Moore was also present. The priest asked the congregation: &ldquo;What do you think a man in jail misses most?&rdquo;  The priest then pointed to some of the people in the congregation, saying &ldquo;Mary, what would you think? Kathleen, what would you think?  James, what would you think?&rdquo;  He put the question to people whose faces he recognised until he ran out of names. Then he asked a few people he did not recognise.  He replied by saying &ldquo;Yes, I have been given all those answers&rdquo;.  He then said that when he went to see a prisoner, a man serving life for murder, and asked him what he missed most in prison life, the prisoner had given him all the answers that the congregation had given him.  But that was not what the prisoner missed most.  He missed the company of children and gave his reasons why.  Deprivation must be the greatest trial for anyone locked up in prison.  We will have to look at the prisoner's position whether we like it or not.</P>
    <P>Today we have a man walking into a bank, holding up the bank manager and robbing that bank.  This will have to be stopped.  There are people in prison who are being asked to pay because we are afraid to take a calculated risk.  We brand everyone with the same label, as being the same type of criminal, motivated by the same motives as the person who shoots dead a neighbour for no reason.</P>
    <P>I know one case in the North of Ireland concerning a young boy of 16, the son of a man who went out early in the morning to work and went to bed <Col N="2186" /> early.  His son was a well-behaved boy, came home from school in the evenings, did his exercises, sat and watched television and, as far as his mother and father were concerned, went to bed.  He did not stay in bed.  His parents wondered why he was not interested in playing like any other boy of his age but remained at home.  He then became restless and wanted to get out of the town he lived in.  His parents facilitated him and sent him to a relative in Dublin.  He was unsettled and went to London.  He was 18 or 19 at the time and because of his age group was lifted by the London police because of a spot check after something happening in the North of Ireland.  He was brought to a police barracks.  After convincing them he was not responsible he returned to his &ldquo;digs&rdquo;.  His conscience troubled him and he returned to the barracks and admitted to planting between 40 and 60 bombs in the town in which he lived.  His parents had no knowledge of it.  His brothers and sisters had no knowledge of it.  That young boy was taken back to Belfast and was kept in custody for ten months.  However, because of the manner in which he faced the charges, all charges were dropped and he was given a five years' suspended sentence.</P>
    <P>I have told that story because I am convinced that that boy had an opportunity to come to terms with the society in which he grew up.  It was not his fault that he planted 40 or 60 bombs.  It was the things young boys in that society did which made him do it.  Nobody would point at him and say: &ldquo;You are chicken.&rdquo;  He became the expert, so expert that he misled his parents, people whom I regard as being a couple of the finest calibre I have ever met in my lifetime.  When that young boy had an opportunity in London to think it over, he knew that he had injured society and was prepared to face the consequences. It was acknowledged that he had faced the consequences and he got a five-year suspended sentence.  I wonder how many young boys&mdash;he was a Catholic, by the way; I am not sure whether he was a Provo&mdash;in Portlaoise feel the same way and are unable to say: &ldquo;I am sorry.&rdquo;  It is <Col N="2187" /> no great credit to us to lock them up and say: &ldquo;We do not trust you because last week a bank was robbed.&rdquo;  Young men should be given a reasonable choice, not an impossible choice, to opt out of violence and to start afresh.  We are saddled with responsibility to create a society in which people can live in harmoney.</P>
    <P>We have failed to create conditions that resolve national problems and have allowed young boys to be misguided by armchair generals.  They belived they were doing right.  In the circumstances we cannot chastise them.  We cannot say: &ldquo;You are a bad boy; you are a criminal; what you have done is unforgiveable.&rdquo; The cost of keeping a person in prison is very high.  The cost of keeping a person in prison is a cost that we cannot afford to pay, that is, the cost of the deprivation of himself, his wife, if he has one, and his children.</P>
    <P>I know a number of men who are involved in subversion.  They are members of families that are very loyal supporters of my party and who voted for me long before the troubles started in the North. People living in Border areas have sons and daughters who keep company with boys and girls from the other side of the Border.  When the British Army or the RUC go to the homes of these boys and girls for reasons that are best known to them, maybe legitimate reasons, they are resented.  It would be resented if the Garda went into houses in Limerick and upset the households.  I could imagine the Garda upsetting homes in Limerick. Within hours of the event, people would be parading outside the Minister's door protesting about it.  They would accuse the Garda of brutality if a picture was knocked off a wall.  That is the way people react.  The dimension is greater if it is done by a force against which there is prejudice.  If a member of a family in Donegal is keeping company with a boy or girl from the other side of the Border whose family is upset for security reasons it is only natural that the family in Donegal will side with their own family member.  Once things get out of focus they go in different directions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2188" /> It is time we called a halt.  It is time that we looked at the need for security with sympathy and compassion.  We should spell out clearly to the men of violence that the amount of money they are forcing the taxpayers to pay to contain the violence which they are generating could be spent on providing houses and better social security entitlements, all the things which are very necessary.  If we repeat the message until we become sick listening to ourselves I am confident that somebody close enough to the hardest criminal will say: &ldquo;After 2,000 deaths in the North of Ireland, after ten years of bloody violence, you have not made headway and you are not going to make headway over the next ten years, even if 4,000 more people die.&rdquo;  It is time that we talked sensibly to the men of violence and asked them to reconsider their position, to come into the mainstream of society and try to achieve their objectives through the ballot box.  It is no good saying that without leaning in the right direction.  We can only lean in the right direction if we learn to forgive.  We have to be firm in our dealings with people who are breaking the law.  Having been firm with them and locked them up, we must learn to forgive.  Unless we do this we will never have the kind of society in which I would like to live.  The &ldquo;eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth&rdquo; approach served its purpose at one stage in our history but it is no longer relevant.</P>
    <P>No other Minister is saddled with greater responsibility than the Minister for Justice.  I think the Minister for Justice needs the support of the Opposition Parties and he will get that support from me and from the party which I represent so long as he is doing the things we want him to do.  I wish him every success in his fight against crime. He should not dismiss completely the things I have been saying.  If he has to take a risk in bringing in a more liberal parole system that would take account of the difficulties of prisoners and their families, I am sure that everyone will support him.  The Minister will have failures.  People will give him the Harvey Smith sign and say, &ldquo;We fooled the <Col N="2189" /> Minister&rdquo;, but there will be more people who will say, &ldquo;Thanks for giving us a second chance&rdquo;.  Many wives and children will be forever grateful if he adopts this course.  I appeal to him to consider again the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be a very reassuring experience for the Minister to have listened to so many fine speeches, all in their own way attempting to help him.  As somebody pointed out, his job is not simply prisons and gardaí; it is the implementation of a particular point of view, the establishment of a philosophy in relation to crime, criminality, penology.  In the pursuit of that he knows well that the boundaries of his responsibilities simply do not stop at the Department of Justice.  I should like to join with Deputy Harte in praising the speech of Deputy Keating.  It is the finest speech I have ever read on the whole question of justice, penology, crime.  It was compassionate, understanding and very well reasoned.  I sincerely hope it does not get buried in the Dáil Official Report and left there.  I hope the Minister will appreciate that he has heard a contribution from one of his own generation which is intended to help him in his very difficult job.  If it is listened to, it could greatly help him.</P>
      <P>There are a few specific points which I should like to deal with before I get on to the more general question.  First of all, the Coolock Law Centre in my own constituency gives a very comprehensive service, and has done so for a very long time, to over 60,000 people.  It is now in danger of closing down because of a lack of money.  I should be glad if the Minister would make a statement on the need to allow this centre to close down. The contribution which the centre has been getting from the Minister's Department will stop apparently in the new year.  There is also a reduction in the amount the Minister for Health gave from £5,000 to £4,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This centre has been providing a very sympathetic, well-run and desperately needed service, mostly confined to <Col N="2190" /> women from broken homes, deserted wives and women with marital problems. While I know the Government intend to provide a free legal aid service, my attitude always in circumstances like this was to welcome the fact that a voluntary service existed, and to do nothing to stop that service, but alternatively&mdash;naturally as a person who believes in the establishment of State organisations and institutions of one kind or another&mdash;to establish a State institution.  If the other withered away because the State institution was better, then it seemed to be a more natural way of dealing with the problem rather than closing down the service.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to this.  Possibly he is not aware of the imminence of a closedown in this service.  It will cause great unhappiness, hardship and consternation amongst the people who use it at present. If the Minister gave it an extended life until his own service is sufficiently well-organised to take over the work being done at present, that would be something.  The position now is that the centre will close down in the new year.  I wonder is this absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>My second point is in relation to the kind of prison which does not exist.  This was referred to in a court case in October about the young man involved in the Ballymun hold-up.  The case made by Dr. Brian McCaffrey, the consultant psychiatrist in court at the time was that there are no prison facilities or security facilities of a kind needed for this type of case.  Because of the lack of the kind of psychiatric and support services that are required, Mountjoy is not satisfactory. The result is that cases of this kind&mdash;this boy was sick since the age of nine; he was a severe depressive, threatening suicide and was a high suicidal risk&mdash;go from Dundrum to Mountjoy, and from Mountjoy to Dundrum, and neither place is suited for the care of such a person.</P>
    <P>The courts are helpless because they are dependent on the kind of institutions we establish.  People are being sent to Mountjoy with the recommendation that they should get psychiatric attention. <Col N="2191" /> The kind that is needed is not available in Mountjoy, and the result is that they go back to Dundrum.  In Dundrum one gets the kind of heavy sedation treatment which is not suitable for people who are not psychotic but just simply very emotionally disturbed, and who require a very much more complicated kind of support and care service in a hospital.  It is no good pretending we are doing something for these people when we send them to Mountjoy or to Dundrum Central Mental Hospital.  We are not.  There is an urgent need for an alternative institution. I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the absence of that kind of institution.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in the case arising out of the question I asked recently, the Aidan White case.  I would be glad if the Minister would give us his thoughts on the protection of juveniles in custody, and what he has in mind in such circumstances. It amazes me that we do not have specific judge's rules which lay down the conditions under which a child&mdash;that is anybody under 17 years of age&mdash;can be questioned while in custody.  No child is competent to defend himself while being questioned in a Garda station.  It is a very frightening atmosphere. They fear the possibility that they may respond to promises made genuinely on the assumption that they can be carried out, or made in order to get a particular admission from the youngster.</P>
    <P>We should know that when children in our society go to a Garda station they will receive the protection of the law in the form of a solicitor, and that a guardian or parent is there to listen to whatever they say, and whatever they say outside those circumstances should not be accepted in court as admissible evidence.  That is such a fundamental right to have established to the knowledge of everybody that I am amazed one should even have to assert it.  It appears that there is a confidential document giving the Garda instructions as to how they should behave in these circumstances.  I cannot see the case for confidentiality.  Why should this document <Col N="2192" /> not be made available to us all so that we can satisfy ourselves?</P>
    <P>Is it a fact that we would not be satisfied with the kind of guarantees that there are to protect children from an incident such as the Aiden white case.  I have to say how much I appreciate the obviously conscientious way in which the Minister pursued that case to the point where a number of gardai had to answer for their behaviour in certain aspects of the case.  If we knew precisely what is the position of a child who is taken into custody then, of course, we could tell the Garda that they were acting outside their powers, and we could see that they looked after the child in the way in which we decided here in the Oireachtas, and in the way the Minister who is our nominee in the Department insists they should be cared for.  I should be glad if the Minister would give his views on that particular case.  I do not wish to go into detail regarding the answer he gave me on that case the other day except to say that there are a number of features which I am still not happy about, but it is possible that these can be dealt with on another occasion.</P>
    <P>Another incident which requires more explanation from the Department and the Minister was the recent Mountjoy disturbance, as a result of which 62 people received medical attention, 26 are in hospital, there of whom are prison officers and the remainder are prisoners. The statement by the Minister was noninformative. He owes it to the public to let them know what goes on in our prisons.  It is wrong that in regard to prisons, above all places, there should be an air of secrecy.  I have been speaking on this matter for a long time and it amazes me that although various parties have made repeated requests to allow public representatives to visit prisons in order to assure ourselves that things are as everybody would like them to be these requests up to the present have been refused.</P>
    <P>Obviously there is no comparison between what went on here and what went <Col N="2193" /> on in pre-war Germany.  At the same time, the only way people can be certain that they will not be presented at some stage with facts about the way their institutions are controlled and with which they are in total disagreement is by insisting on being informed from time to time and using their public representatives to assure them that the prisons are being conducted on humanitarian grounds at least.</P>
    <P>Mountjoy prison is 150 years old.  It appears that there is presistent, perennial trouble there, or if it is not in Mountjoy it is in St. Patrick's, the juvenile prison. What is disturbing is that apparently one-sided reports are given as to what goes on in the prisons.  I know there are the visiting committees and it is no good damning all visiting committees as being indifferent to what they see or by saying that they were appointed simply by a political party and that they say what the Minister wants to hear.  It is surprising that over the years there have been hundreds of reports of visiting committees. Since 1933 approximately 300 reports and 28 riots have been recorded but very rarely, if ever, is a prison report or a complaint by a prisoner upheld by the visiting committee.  It warrants some believing that that would be the true representation, that the cause was all on one side, that it was simply a matter of the prisoners being bloody-minded.  Mr. Frank McDonnell, who is chairman of a visiting committee made the strange statement that the wanton damage to property and malicious injuries inflicted on prison officers and some prisoners could only be caused by mindless vicious individuals whose motives are solely directed towards the creation of antiprison administration propaganda.  That is not the kind of partisan statement which could be said to establish any sort of credibility in the independent-mindedness of the visiting committee.  I do not know whether it is his own view or whether he is making it on behalf of the committee but we all know that there must be a prisoner's point of view also. The Curragh visiting committee, who appear to be all of the persuasion of one <Col N="2194" /> party, except for Deputy Bermingham and another person, would seem to be discharging their duties independently in so far as they keep asking for the place to be closed down.  Broadly speaking, the visiting committees appear to believe that the only report needed from them is a report telling us that everything is well, that all are very happy and well fed and that the governor is doing his job extremely well.</P>
    <P>There was a riot in St. Patrick's in October of last year in which a number of prisoners were injured.  It was alleged that certain excesses afterwards were perpetrated by prison officers but we have not had any report of any independent Garda inquiry into precisely what happened.  The prisoners are all youngsters and it is no good turning our backs on this and saying it is not our business, that it is the Minister's business. We must question the Minister.  I would ask him to reduce the wall of secrecy there is about the prisons.  I suspect that the attitude in our prisons is changing. One can recall a debate here in which the Minister for Justice and his Opposition counterpart were discussing the merits and demerits of flogging.  I admit that was years ago but we have come a long way since then.  Anyone who has been listening to the speeches from both sides of the House appreciates that the Minister has backing.  Let him make mistakes but he will get support.  I do not think he will find himself being pilloried by any side of the House even if he errs on the side of being compassionate and humane in his attempt to administer the prisons, which is a very difficult job with security being the way it is.  I should like to emphasise to the Minister that none of us has any illusion about the seriousness and the difficulty of his job.  But jails are dreadful places.  My only experience of them has been a couple of visits to prisoners, but it is a horrifying experience even to go inside the walls.  How people live there for weeks, months or years is beyound my understanding.</P>
    <P>It is all the more reason why we should be very careful that if people have to be isolated from society in the public <Col N="2195" /> interest they are given the optimum conditions for reasonable comfort.  As Deputy Harte said, there is no substitute for socialisation with one's wife and family and other friends, with being able to go to pubs and meeting houses and so on.  There is no substitute for that.  Prison can never be anything but a terrible deprivation in many, many ways.  If people have to be isolated for various reasons then we should err on the side of accepting Deputy Keating's approach to the whole idea of criminality and the subsequent attitude should be reflected in our laws.</P>
    <P>One of the points I made before the recent visit of the Pope to this country was how little effect he would have on our society.  Alas, I have not as much faith in these things as so many other people have.  I must draw the attention of the Minister to the statement he made in Cabra about the business of the delinquent or the people who, as he said, live wayward lives.  He said, &ldquo;So often wayward lives of those who live on the margin of society&rdquo; and he introduced the words &ldquo;and particularly prisoners are due to the society's neglect more than their own sinfulness&rdquo;.  I share that viewpoint totally and it is reflected in the speeches made by a number of Deputies, particularly Deputy Keating and Deputy Harte.  Will the Minister in his concluding speech say if there is a general softening of attitude to the whole question of prisoners in general.  I suspect there is.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be in any way political but I was very shocked by the statement of his predecessor in office because I had listened to him in debates and I had a high regard for him.  Senator Cooney did many valuable things as Deputy Keating pointed out in his speech but he made one statement about prisoners having no rights only privileges.  I thought that we an extraordinarily harsh attitude to take to prisoners and it is one which I do not share.  I would be glad to know what is the Minister's basic philosophy about the psycho-dynamics of the process of a shift towards criminality.  One of my jobs <Col N="2196" /> is to look after young psychopaths and most of the literature on the subject appears to come down on the general thesis of genetic&mdash;probably genetic in its origin and then superimposed on that are the social and environmental stresses of one kind or another&mdash;deprivation of love, the institutional child, the child of the broken home, the child of divorce, of separated parents, drunken homes and so on.  I am not going to go through the literature because it was quoted in Deputy Keating's speech.  He referred to a number of authorities including very good work carried out by the Prisoners' Rights Association.  I hope the Minister will try to lessen his apparent hostility to the Prisoners' Rights Association.  They are a marvellously disinterested group of people.  They may do things from time to time which annoy the Minister or his Department but the general intent there is marvellously detached and objective and motivated mainly by a sense of compassion for people who are unlucky enough to be in jail.</P>
    <P>Most of the findings have been the same.  I am not going to repeat them in detail, they are already on the Official Report.  The general thesis is that criminality is predominantly a social illness, that there is the genetic factor which we are not very clear about.  One of the main features is overcrowding in homes.  The 50 or 100 families investigated by the Prisoners' Rights Association show that on average there were eight in a family, while the average in Ireland is 4.4.  This is why I say the Minister's job is such a complicated one because it comes back to the whole question of family planning, the optimum size of a family and so on.  There is no doubt in my mind that the very conservative attitude of the Catholic Church over the years in our society which has promoted the idea that there is something wrong or sinful in contraception has been the source of an enormous amount of suffering, hardship and unhappiness in these mainly slum areas where people still, unfortunately have many children greatly in excess of the number of children in other families.  I am referring to the city centre areas, the Liberties, Ballymun, <Col N="2197" /> Summerhill, Seán MacDermott Street, all these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <P>The Deputy is going into matters that have no relevance to the Estimates before the House which deal with payment to the Garda Síochána and prison officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The other important point exposed is that in the kind of crime that the Minister is dealing with, and for which we are considering these Estimates which will decide how much we will pay our gardaí in order to catch these criminals, is mostly petty crime or relatively petty crime, that is stealing from cars, or shoplifting.  Some 75 per cent or 80 per cent of the crimes are relatively minor crimes and the crimes which get the headlines in the newspapers and elsewhere are a relatively small part of the crimes we are dealing with.  They are crimes of assault on persons which account for 3, 4, or 5 per cent.  It is very important for us to bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important for us to bear that in mind when considering the sort of hysteria which is worked up and which led eventually to the creation of the apparent need for Loughan House and the spending of £600,000 on Loughan House in which to keep 40 or so youngsters for a maximum of three years.  It is like the enormous increase in the number of gardaí and the size of the Army.  They are all dealing with the consequences of social failure, failures in the fabric and structure of society; a gross misjudgment of the response to the real size of the problem we appear to be dealing with.  Instead of saying that the simplest thing to do is to see that people do not leave expensive cameras and radios lying around in their motor cars, that they lock them up or put in alarms or some other relatively simple solution or that shopkeepers prevent shoplifting taking place, we fall on these youngsters and convert them into criminals by locking them up in Loughan House.  Alternatively, <Col N="2198" /> we put them in Mountjoy or Limerick.  That was shown in a reply to a question which stated that we had about 30 or 40 between 1966 and 1977.</P>
    <P>If we are going to follow this general pattern of treating these relatively minor crimes as if they are sufficiently serious to take a youngster from his home, his family and his parents, and isolate him in a prison, where it is notorious that they learn more about crime than they do about anything worthwhile or useful, then obviously we are dealing with the problem from the wrong end altogether.</P>
    <P>The correct approach is a much more complicated one, but it is one which the Minister should make clear in his statement. He should have a different approach rather than this massive recruiting drive for more gardaí, more Loughan Houses, more Mountjoys, more St. Patrick's, more women's gaols, all repressing and negative, nothing creative at all or recognition that crime has social origins.  We all know the old cliché that all crimes are crimes of society, and that is substantially true as shown in the statistics quoted by a number or Deputies in this debate.</P>
    <P>Most of the youngsters in the Prisoners' Rights Organisation left school at the age of 13 even though they should have stayed on until 15 years. They were illiterate when they left school, there was no possibility of going to secondary school, AnCo or any of those places.  The result is that they are illiterate, and unemployable.  What else can they do or where else can they go? Their parents and brothers are unemployed and between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of their fathers and brothers were in gaol.  Is there anyone who would survive growing up in this social milieu and not find himself facing a district justice at some time or another because he had taken a camera, a television or smashed a window?  It is inevitable that these youngsters are going to end up in court and the origins having nothing to do with them at all, it is the social circumstances into which they were born. Ninety-four per cent of them expected to go to gaol in their lives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2199" /> It was interesting to hear people talking of apartheid today at Question Time, but this is the same segregation of a subculture in our society which is destined to end up in our gaols not because there is any essentially inherent badness in these people but simply because they grew up in families that are too big in overcrowded slum conditions, are unemployed and living on too little; are illiterate, uneducatable, untrainable and facing gaol.</P>
    <P>The interesting thing is that in those circumstances gaol becomes inevitable and, therefore, is not a deterrent. Loughan House is not a deterrent to the child who has never been there.  He cannot imagine what Loughan House could be like&mdash;the deprivation of freedom, the deprivation of social contact, a loving relationship or freedom on the streets. They are the problems we should be tackling.  That was the basic philosophy of Deputy Keating's attempt to make us think about these things, to make the Minister make his definitive statement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating stated that it was time we thought of this Estimate as a social statement which implied some basic accepted philosophy of what one believed to be right and how one believed one should act.  The Minister must admit that nobody has attempted to score any political points in the debate except to praise him wherever we could praise him.  He should try to recognise that his job is a very difficult one and that in solving his job he must be concerned with telling his colleagues in Education that there must be a much different child-teacher ratio in the schools in the centre city, with telling the housing people that we must have much better housing facilities for these people; with telling Industry, Commerce and Energy that we must have light and heavy industries to employ children, parents and brothers in these societies and with telling Deputy Haughey, as Minister for Health, that we must have a family planning centre so that these families will be brought down to the level of the rest of society by sensible family planning services of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2200" /> The Minister can, if he wants, build bigger prisons, costing fortunes.  It was reckoned that it is costing in the region of £20,000 a year&mdash;I would like to verify that because it is such an extraordinary figure&mdash;to keep a boy in Loughan House.  Would the Minister verify that remarkable figure?  It is estimated that it costs £60,000 for repairs and then with all the professional staff the total cost over three years is £2 million.  There are 45 boys there making the annual cost at £20,000 per boy.</P>
    <P>It would be better to spend all those millions on the depressed areas of the centre city.  How much more useful it would be instead of condemning these young people to the appalling existence of isolation, monosexual society and all the appalling implications of that in a closed society where everybody is miserable, including the unfortunate prison officers who have to try and work in these Victorian surroundings.  I believe that the Judiciary would prefer not to have to send people to jail.  What are they to do?  We have no community-orientated type rehabilitation schemes where the youngster could be educated to realise that he cannot go on behaving in the way he has done, that the rest of us have rights too, those of us who are fortunate enough not to be born into the conditions in which he was born and grown up, that he will be treated with understanding and will receive the support of the community if he can learn to live amongst us and adapt to the best of his ability to the general social tenets of the kind of society that we think is a good one.  Could the Minister not devise some community-orientated services, which they are attempting to develop in the dreadful British prisons?  They have nothing to be proud of in their prisons but now because of the gross overcrowding they are attempting to reduce the numbers in their prisons by getting the young people to carry out certain work for the community as an educative process as well as a rehabilitative one and an attempt to ameliorate the anger expressed by some of the Deputies here who cannot imagine that anyone could behave like these children.  Most of our <Col N="2201" /> children would respond like this if they were subjected to the stresses which so many of these youngsters are subjected to.  They are more to be pitied than anything else.  They are very sad and very distressed.  In my experience of dealing with physchopaths I have never met a happy one.  They are always unfortunate, miserable people and they never get real fun out of their lives.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion I put to the Minister is the possibility of decriminalising some of the existing offences such as prostitution, drunkenness, begging.  It might help the statistics and give him a little heart in his very difficult job.  I have referred on a number of occasions to the absurdity of treating homosexuality as a crime.  It is an attitude to sexuality which is as natural as the colour of one's eyes or of one's hair and has nothing whatever to do with moral badness or moral turpitude.  You are no finer a person because you are heterosexual than because you are homosexual.  It is the source of an enormous amount of distress and hardship, blackmail, suicide and psychiatric problems in society.  One of the things which would help greatly would be if that particular subject was decriminalised.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is now advocating legislation. We cannot do that on an Estimate.  He will have to get another opportunity to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely why I said I would not dwell on it.  I referred to it in passing.  If one looks back 50 or 60 years ago it is very hard to know whether the alleged increase in crime is true or not.  There is no doubt that the social changes create more unemployment. The changes that are coming not only in automation, mechanisation and the microprocesses will mean many thousands of youngsters out of work and they will create problems for society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to consider giving me permission to visit the jails.  I asked his predecessors for that.  All one wants to do is to see and <Col N="2202" /> report that things are improving in the prison system.  One of the disappointments of my life was that none of the Ministers of Justice who had themselves been in jail, the former Deputies Boland, McKeown, Mulcahy, seemed to have learned anything from their experience in jail.  We should have a wonderful prison system because of what they had learned but this has not happened.  It seems to me that there is a reasonable chance that this generation of young legislators appears to have a more kind hearted, understanding attitude, and we hope for changes from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody listening with half an ear could fail to be moved by Deputy Browne's compassionate understanding for this subject.  Although he often says things which lead me to interrupt him and be discourteous to him, I have to admire what I have just heard from him.  I agree very much with a great deal of it though I think that he underestimates the degree to which the State can provide rapid solutions to a problem which is an urgent one.  &ldquo;It does not matter who is to blame&rdquo;, the ordinary citizen will say when his house is broken into, or his wife assaulted, or his car stolen and vandalised. It may be that the citizen will say that society as a whole is to blame and I am willing to bear one three-millionth part of the responsibility for that.  What I want to know is what is now going to happen to the young man of 16 or 17, or perhaps younger than that, as Deputy Dr. Browne said, who has done this?  I do not want to be vindictive towards him, I do not want to make his unhappy situation into which he may well have been born, as Deputy Dr. Browne said, worse All I want is to try to prevent this happening again to myself or to any of my neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that a great deal of the talk about the roots of crime and the way the State should approach it by-passes this central question.  We are only flesh and blood.  We are an imperfect race of human beings and we will never be anything but imperfect.  There will be delinquents among us as there are in <Col N="2203" /> every system of law or society which ever existed on the face of the earth.  We simply cannot sit back.  We have to take some measures towards the control of deliquents.  They may be measures which we take in ignorance of what we should do.  I quite agree with Deputy Dr. Browne, if he would boil his views down to that simple point, that we ought to approach this subject with humility and perhaps with regret and with a sense of apology towards the delinquent who undoubtedly is a victim more than anything else.  At the same time some balance has to be struck.  As Deputy Dr. Browne acknowledged, other people have rights. The State, blundering and bumbling and certainly leaving a lot of room for criticism of the way it does it, has to move in in some shape or form and try to keep the minimum of order, even if it means applying blunt instruments to people who are not in the eternal sense to blame for their actions.</P>
    <P>Of course, I regard prison, any kind of prison, as a blunt instrument. Criminologists are agreed that it is not a real deterrent in that it does not measure up well in terms of preventing people from falling into delinquency a second time.  We could all, I am afraid, subscribe to the idea that society is to blame and that we must all carry a degree of culpability for the delinquencies of a very small minority.  I believe that is true. That really skates past the point of what the Minister sitting over there must do to protect the vast majority of citizens who, at any one time, are not conscious of having done anything wrong in regard to the misfortune which befalls them when they themselves are the victim of criminality.  So that while not belittling&mdash;far from it&mdash;the generosity and compassion in Deputy Dr. Browne's point of view, it does not offer an awful lot to a Government which is faced with these cruel problems.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure if Deputy Dr. Browne is right in thinking that a bad upbringing alone is the determining factor in the making of a delinquent.  Lots of children suffer from bad upbringings and they do not turn into delinquents.  There <Col N="2204" /> seems to be a good deal of evidence, which Deputy Dr. Browne would be better able to assess than I am, that genetic factors are very powerfully at work. There are some clinical conditions&mdash;schizophernia is one; there are others, I believe&mdash;which are sometimes associated with criminality and which are known to be genetically determined. That fact would suggest that other forms of criminality which are not associated with a visible pathological condition may equally be genetically determined.  Also studies which have been carried out for the last 50 years in various places on pairs of identical twins and non-identical twins tend to show that the concordance rate in regard to whether the twins turn out to be delinquent or non-delinquent in adulthood is far higher with the identical twins than with the non-identical sort, which suggests that since they have the same genetic composition there may be something in their unhappy inheritance which predisposes them both equally to crime.  That is so, even where the concordance rates are high, even where those identical twins have been separately brought up.  I agree that it happens in so small a number of cases that the statisticians over the last 50 years when they put them all together can barely run up more than a few dozen, but the concordance rates even there are very high. There are genetic factors and I do not know how to go about eliminating them. This is the one weak spot in what I heard Deputy Dr. Browne say.</P>
    <P>In trying to determine a eugenic approach to this subject, we are in danger of toppling into absurdities, absurdities of a kind which Deputy Dr. Browne would be the first to attack and announce as the sort of thing which was associated in the last generation with fascism, namely, the sort of racial hygiene by which that State would tailor its laws in order to achieve the kind of family size and the kind of children which were likely to cause the least trouble and be of the most benefit to the State.  Deputy Dr. Browne of course did not say that, and I do not want to misrepresent him, but I did understand him to say that the Catholic Church, because <Col N="2205" /> of its very uncompromising and inflexible teaching on birth control, had in some way a good deal to answer for on this planet by directly contributing to families of over-large size.</P>
    <P>Here again I have to offer the House what little knowledge I have of this subject, which is very much amateur knowledge.  The criminologists would disagree with Deputy Dr. Browne, if I am not mistaken.  The studies which have been done suggest that it is not the size of family which predisposes to delinquency but it is conditions which, when added to a large family, create the mix out of which deliquency results.  In other words, it is not so much large families by themselves that tend to turn out a delinquent or two, but it is large families living in overcrowded conditions. When you separate the classes of large families living in reasonable conditions and large families living in unreasonable conditions you eliminate the common factor, which is the large family, and you find that the factor which is associated with the criminality is the unreasonable overcrowded substandard conditions.  Deputy Dr. Browne would wish to eliminate them, too, I know, and so do I, but to blame large families as such flies somewhat in the face of the admittedly tentative conclusions which criminologists have reached on this matter.  Secondly, it would also remain to be explained how it is that in a country like this where large families have been very much the rule the great majority of large families do not in fact produce any deliquents among the brood.  The Irish mother is blamed by the liberation movement for spoiling her sons and giving them a view of their sex role which is injurious to their wives and, in turn, to their own sons and daughters. I know she is blamed for a great deal.</P>
    <P>The other side of the Irish mother with a large family is that she very often brings up with a struggle a large family of children who are devoted to herself and relatively devoted to each other and who do not fall foul of society in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2206" /> This topic is prone to be exaggerated and over-driven in both directions.  I do not want to do any injustice to what Deputy Dr. Browne has said, but I would very much quarrel&mdash;and it is the only thing I disagree with in what he said&mdash;with his idea that a large family size, in particular when he relates it to contraception laws or the lack of them, or to the inflexibility of the Catholic Church in this regard, is a factor in any shape or form in delinquency.  Let us not forget that there is severe delinquency in countries in which there never has been any control on contraception.  There is horrifying delinquency in countries in which there has been no let or hindrance on people in controlling the size of their families or, if they do not wish to have a family at all, they are quite free to use any means they wish up to and including abortion, or abandonment of their infants, any time over the past few generations. I could not go along with that argument by Deputy Dr. Browne, although I agree with most of the rest of what he said.</P>
    <P>I had intended only to make one point when speaking in this debate and I will make it in a relatively short time.  These Estimates bear on the Garda and the prison service.  They bring together neatly the two services which I want to speak about in a particular connection, namely, the connection of public transparency.  When we were in office, from 1973 to 1977 we went through, as I hope everyone on all sides of the House would recognise, a paroxysm of political violence which spilled into this part of the country, starting in the North, but spilling over into this side of the country. We had dozens of deaths, most of them caused by bomb outrages originating with the Loyalist extremists.  Not only did we have that, but we had a non-stop succession of demonstrations, some of them a very dangerous kind, all of them of a very emotive kind.  Because it is a free country demonstrations take place as a matter of course, freely, and as of right, and that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the House, because these things are easily forgotten, that <Col N="2207" /> there was hardly a month when the National Coalition were in office and Senator Cooney was Minister for Justice that there was not a hunger strike, that there were not demonstrations of one kind or another, that there were not chaps with sour faces and black berets marching around the country terrifying children, that there were not sieges of one sort or another, that the general atmosphere was not one of absolute headon confrontation.  Admittedly politicians, if they get into Government, are paid to put up with such things.  I remember posters around the place attacking Deputy Cooney and Deputy Donegan, then Ministers for Justice and Defence, on the grounds that they were trying to collect money in order to increase the police force and the Army.  For what purpose?  They were increasing the police force and the Army in order to protect the people who elected them.  I do not quarrel with the point of view that that is a thing which they should not have done.</P>
    <P>I am trying to draw the attention of the House to the fact that all that element of protest has faded out.  It is as though it had been tuned down on a wirless set ever since the change of Government.  When was there last a serious picket outside a Government Department?  When did anyone last see a black beret and a sour puss and dark glasses striding around the streets? When was there last a hunger strike? When was a Minister's house last surrounded by angry people?  When last were there placards or public marches? When were there last epithets applied to Minister like &ldquo;Cockroach Cooney&rdquo;? Has any one checked on the cockroaches recently in Portlaoise?  No. I believe the Minister for Justice is making as good a job of it as he can, just as Senator Cooney did, but the point I am trying to make is that for some very obscure and strange little reason that I wish I knew&mdash;I fear to think I can guess it&mdash;there is not the same atmosphere of confrontation.</P>
    <P>It may be that the IRA and their supporters recognised in the National Coalition <Col N="2208" /> a Government every single member of which was absolutely committed to putting them down so far as it could be done.  It may be, therefore, that they see in the present Government a somewhat less committed enemy.  I do not intend any reflection on the Minister or any one of his colleagues, but it may be in that party generally and in the penumbra of support, or quasi support, or half support, or qualified support which that party enjoy, they see a kind of atmosphere in which it would be easier for them to breathe than it was under our Government.  Accordingly, the confrontation has been scaled down to nothing.</P>
    <P>It is very hard for people who have to watch the news day by day&mdash;for politicians who are interested in what journalists write; and in journalists who make their minds up about what politicians say and do&mdash;to get a prespective over a few years.  I should like anyone listening to these words, or who may subsequently read them, to throw his mind back to any of the years when the Coalition were in office.  There were no laws in operation then that are not in operation now, with the single exception of the Energency Powers Act which came into force less than one year before we left office at the end of 1976.</P>
    <P>We were told from the other side of the House on that occasion that we were making the emergency up, that there was no emergency, but I do not want to reargue that matter now.  We were represented as being the enemies of liberty.  Why?  Because we were substituting for a two day arrest which had been there for the past 40 years a seven day arrest, and no longer.  Deputy Blaney and the former Deputy Boland sat as Ministers in a Government and sat, as Deputy Liam Cosgrave said, quite as mice, at a time when so-called republicans were locked up not for seven days but indefinitely, and at a time when there was a Special Criminal Court not constituted of Mr. Justice Hamilton swopping polite pleasantries with the Bar and Mr. Justice X and Mr. Justice Y, but constituted of Army officers who handed out sentences three times the length of <Col N="2209" /> what the Special Criminal Court have been handing down.  That was done under a Government which contained Deputy Blaney and Deputy Boland who sat there quite as mice, but the Coalition were the enemy of liberty 15 years later. The Coalition were incipient tyrants because, on their tip toes and with apologies all round, they introduced a seven day arrest to enable the commission of crimes to be more fully investigated.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of atmosphere the then Government had to face.  I hope Deputy Dr. Browne would be generous enough to admit that even Senator Cooney, who is flesh and blood, with a strong streak of iron in him too which I salute, perhaps showed a sense of being beleaguered, as all the Government I worked for did in those years.  Apart from ritual expressions of general abhorrence of violence, how much support did we get from the far side of the House in those years?</P>
    <P>If an English soldier or policeman so much as put his nose across the Border even by accident, Deputy Andrews, whom I saw over there a moment ago, was on his feet wanting to know why. Yet now we are supposed to buy an air corridor of a kind evidently which goes beyond anything the Coalition had, and we are supposed to say nothing about it and, for reasons of national responsibility on which perhaps my party will one day choke politically, we are saying very little about it.  That was the wind of atmosphere we had to face.  That was the kind of atmosphere in which we had to run a police force and a prison service.  It was the kind of atmosphere in which there was nothing too low, too unture, too savage, to say about our Government and about the people who worked for them, including the police.</P>
    <P>There were accusations of police brutality from the moment we entered office until we left.  I have not heard any recently.  It may be&mdash;it is a logical possibility and since I know very little about how the police function and never sought secrets in the Coalition Government which did not concern me and, <Col N="2210" /> therefore, knew very little about the internal workings of the security side only except what I might accidentally hear at Government meetings&mdash;that people were brutalised in our time and that that does not happen now.  It may be so.  I have absolutely no knowledge that it is so, but I admit the theoretical possibility is there.  Equally it may be the representations of Senator Cooney and Deputy Donegan as a pair of ogres who would eat the people if they were so allowed whereas they were men who were suffering, if anything, from an excess of zeal. That is the kind of thing we had to face, and we had to face it very much on the defensive so far as the police and the prison service were concerned.  I hope that I am not letting any cat out of the bag when I tell the House that at that time without tripping them up or getting in their way or trying to make their difficult jobs more difficult I did quietly urge on a couple of my colleagues that we ought to have an independent police authority which would receive and impartially examine complaints about the police and complaints about the prison service, I would go this distance gladly and freely with people who make complaints about the police whether they are justified or unjustified, and that is that it is not satisfactory that the complaints should be investigated in the first instance by the very force against which the complaints are made.</P>
    <P>I know that the situation was defended by the then Minister when we were in office, and we stuck together loyally as every government must, but I suppose I am not obliged to repress opinion on it indefinitely.  I thought then, and quietly said so without making a nuisance of myself to men who were overworked and trying to keep the State from falling to bits, that there should be an impartial authority with the job of determining complaints against the police, and we might as well put the prison service into the same jurisdiction while we are at it.  I agree that complaints about the prison service are much less frequent but they occasionally do surface&mdash;very occasionally&mdash;and there should be no reason for not subjecting the prison service <Col N="2211" /> to the same kind of jurisdiction.  It should be an independent jurisdiction, and it should be one which has the necessary powers and facilities for making its own inquiries and its own investigations and which is not bound by the discipline of the police themselves and does not necessarily have to follow police procedures.  That is not a revolutionary suggestion but, it is a particularly appropriate time to raise this point because of the tendency or the imminence of a Bill to set up the office of ombudsman.  There is a lot to be said for a transparent police force, one in which the people can have confidence.  I believe the people have confidence in the Irish police force and in the prison service, and I agree with Deputy Dr. Browne that in this debate, in so far as I have heard it, people have if anything been trying to express that confidence and to express their gratitude to these two services for the ugly and difficult job they do.  I would like to associate myself with that sentiment as well.  But it is a mistake, a factual mistake, a mistake of policy on the part of any police force anywhere, to resist a system which will expose it to a conspicuosly impartial system of investigation.  It is in the interest of a force like that, that it should be and should remain beyond suspicion and beyond complaint.  We can be proud that our police force is evidently free of the rampant corruption which appears to have overtaken the police in Britain.  It seems to be the case every other month that a row erupts over there which shows that some unfortunate police officer or, perhaps, a series of them have given way to the temptation to accept bribes or to do things which are flagrantly inconsistent with their duty, so that scandal after scandal is the rule of the day in Britain. So if that is not the case here, I think, we can be extremely proud of it and grateful for it.  In this increasingly difficult age, when more police are needed but when they are more difficult to recruit&mdash;and I wish there were more strains imposed on them&mdash;to keep the situation in such a way that we can hold our heads high nationally in regard to our police and <Col N="2212" /> prison service we should have an impartial system of investigation of complaints which may be made against them.  I hope these will always be few and so far as possible without justification but if they exist at all it is in the interest of the police themselves that they should be seen to be acquitted, so to speak, by an impartial investigator of any charge made against them.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House about an incident in 1967 or there abouts which had no political connection whatever.  This was before the recent waive of the IRA was ever heard of.  A man who was in police custody in Cork died in his cell. The post mortem showed that he had suffered a large number of rib fractures and severe internal injuries including a ruptured spleen which is normally fatal. At the inquest the solicitor for his relatives appeared to suggest by the questioning in which he engaged that the man had been ill treated in the cell in the Cork Bridewell and that this was the cause of his death.  That inquest lasted three days and the coroner's jury brought in a verdict of accidental death. The man was said to have fallen at a time before he was arrested and injured himself in this way and the coroner's jury, as it were, made light of these complaints. But the row went on.  It gained in volume and the Minister for Justice at the time was Deputy Lenihan.  There is nobody who can be compared with Deputy Lenihan except, I think Fouché who was a Chief of Police both under the <i>ancien regime</i> and also after the French Revolution and who seemed to pop up at all times and in all seasons with one kind of job or other but never too far from the action.  I do not know if there is any Cabinet post that Deputy Lenihan has not held except for that of Taoiseach but he certainly has made a fair run at holding most of the others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway let us flash back and pick up one of the many files with his name on it.  In this case it read, Minister for Justice, B. Lenihan and the file discloses that he was asked here repeatedly whether he would hold a proper judicial inquiry into the death of this unfortunate man in Cork and he said no.  He did not, of course, say it in one syllable.  He probably said yes but then proceeded in such a way as to make it clear that what he meant was no.  He was pursued by the Press, by the Irish Association of Civil Liberties, by a lot of other mushroom organisations which came and went, by editorials in the papers, by Deputies here, by deputations from Cork and so on but he stonewalled until he literally had the whole country shouting at him.  Everybody wanted a public inquiry into the death of this man for fear that there was anything in the charge that he had been ill treated by the police in such a way as to cause these physical injuries.</P>
      <P>In the end the Minister had to give in and he did set up a judicial inquiry which consisted of Judge Murnaghan and a couple of other judges&mdash;a Circuit Court judge, Judge Conroy I think, and a District Court Justice.  They sat not for three days, which was the duration of the inquest, but for three weeks and heard a very great deal of evidence which had not come out at all at the inquest.  A report was produced and published.  I presume it is in the Dáil Library but it was plain that the death in question had, in fact, been accidental.  There was a very rare injury involved, a kind of accident-in-a-thousand, but the judicial commission were satisfied that the death had been accidental and that the man had not been kicked or pushed or bullied in any way at all by the police.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From that good day to this no more was heard about it.  That was absolutely the end of the matter, and the Garda came far, far better out of that then if the <Col N="2214" /> matter had rested after the coroner's inquest. Both the coroner's inquest and the subsequent inquiry acquitted them.  After the proper inquiry, which was geared to investigate such a thing, there was never a whisper about that case.  It is blotted from the public memory, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>The result of that whole episode, now 12 years old or thereabouts, should bring home to everybody that the police are the principal beneficiaries of a transparent system of investigation.  If we are going to have an ombudsman&mdash;and I cannot guess what will be the terms of their Bill&mdash;I would urge them expressly to include in that Bill a provision which subjects the doings of the police and the prison service to the jurisdiction of the ombudsman.  I am saying that because it is in the interests of the police and in the interest of the public confidence in the police that there should be an impartial official, a person who is not answerable to any Minister, who cannot be fired by a Minister or by the Government, but who presumably will have a tenure comparable with that of a judge and who will have an adequate staff of assistants and adequate machinery at his disposal for investigating everything.  I urge that the Minister who is in charge of the ombudsman proposal should incorporate an express provision to that effect in the Bill.  If it is not in the Bill when it arrives, I am going to try and get my party to put down an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>I am sure everyone in the House is bored with hearing me complain about our national failing, of which the party opposite are the best examples in everything they do, of taking our tone from the English from whom we were supposed to want to be free.  The English have a Parliamentary Commissioner who would not suit Irish conditions. Local government is excluded from his purview and if that were taken out of the purview of the Irish ombudsman he would not be worth anything to us.  Matters of discretion are taken out of his purview, which would equally render him useless to us and the doings of the police and military are also outside his purview.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Supplementary Estimates which we are discussing now deal with the Garda Síochána and the prison service.  As the Minister wants some time to reply and wants the debate concluded before 7 o'clock, I intend to confine my remarks to the Garda Síochána vote.</P>
      <P>We are all very proud of our police force.  Ever since they were established they have worked well.  The force have been noted for their integrity, efficiency and for the way they dealt with the public, whether their contact with them was from the point of view of complaints or suspected criminals.  I am very pleased to be able to say that we are still very proud of the Garda Síochána, and let us hope that we will continue to get the same service from them that we have been getting over the years.  I am confident that we will and I am confident that we will still be justifiably proud of that force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Garda Síochána are asked to perform duties for which they are not properly organised numerically or from the point of view of equipment to carry out.  The number of armed robberies in this country is at a quite unacceptable level.  I use that phrase deliberately.  I have no wish to get into an argument with the Minister as to whether the amount of money involved is less or more or whether the number of robberies has decreased or increased.  I <Col N="2216" /> believe that, numerically, the number of armed robberies is on the increase and I am satisfied that the amount of money involved in these armed robberies has increased substantially.  Whether I am right or wrong on that, I want to say without fear of contradiction that the level of armed robberies, both from a numerical point of view and from the point of view of the amount of money involved, is at a completely unacceptable level.  That is to be deplored for two reasons.</P>
    <P>First of all, we know that subversive organisations who need arms for their illegal activities are financing those activities through armed robberies. Indeed, the ease with which banks or companies are robbed of large sums of money is tantamount to the financing of these illegal organisations by the State.  It is to be deplored that these large sums of moneys, sometimes in the neighbourhood of £250,000, can be collected by armed subversives for their illegal activities.  It does not stop there. Ordinary criminals, and some people who might not be classified as criminals, see that large sums of money can be collected under threat.  They have no association with subversive associations, but they are in on the band wagon.  They get in to collect this money for themselves. Ordinary criminals are embarking on this method of collecting large sums of money, and that is to be deplored.  It is lowering respect for the law and it is encouraging crime and bank robberies.  We know that if a person goes into a bank with a gun, or if he can convince the officials that he has a gun, he gets whatever he asks for.  Surely that is encouraging all sorts of people to get in on this act.</P>
    <P>Another type of crime which, I think, is detestable in the extreme, is kidnapping and holding someone for ransom in order to get money.  That is a type of crime that was foreign to this country up to comparatively recent times.  Unfortunately, it is creeping in now.  It is one of the most detestable crimes I know of.</P>
    <P>We know that when these crimes are <Col N="2217" /> committed the Garda Síochána do their best to find the culprits, and, credit where credit is due, they have been successful in recent times.  They are to be congratulated for that, but we want prevention.  We want it to be made more difficult for criminals to collect such large sums of money.  Very large sums of money in the region of a quarter of a million to a million pounds are moved about with too much ease and little protection.  There should be an arrangement between the owners of such money and the security forces.  If the Minister makes an order, or introduces a law, to the effect that such amounts of money cannot be moved without notification to him, I will support him.  On such notification adequate protection should be provided.  It should be armed protection. About one year ago I expressed the view that the only way to deal with this sort of crime was to meet force with force.  The Minister did not interrupt me in an audible manner but he seemed to be horrified that I should make such a suggestion.  It is ridiculous to send members of the Garda Síochána on bandit patrol&mdash;and that is what it is&mdash;with one arm as long as the other.  If it is not acceptable to send uniformed gardaí on this sort of duty then let them be unarmed, but if they are going out to protect millions of pounds in transit which can only be attacked by armed criminals it is not asking too much that the men that are put on that type of duty be armed. Indeed, recent history in this city has proved that when armed gardaí get on the job quickly enough they foiled the efforts of armed criminals, cornered them, collected them with the blood on their hands, so to speak, and the loot in their possession.  There is no doubt that those apprehended will be convicted.  That is evidence that arms are necessary in such cases.</P>
    <P>We are all proud of our unarmed Garda Force and, by and large, it should still be an unarmed Force.  I know the Minister has increased the armed members of the Garda for this sort of duty and that was right, but if it is necessary to bring in the Army to do this sort of protection or patrol with these large <Col N="2218" /> sums of money they should be brought in.  We can do one of two things: we can throw up our hands and say we cannot cope, let it continue or we afford armed protection when there is a danger of armed robbery.  That is sound sense and I do not think it is unreasonable.</P>
    <P>There should be more patrols in towns where there are banks and, particularly, where there are banks which are conveniently situated from the point of view of armed robbery.  We know that banks situated in the middle of long narrow streets are seldom attacked because of the hazards of getting away.  The banks that are usually attacked are those that are peripherally situated in towns with the opportunity for a quick getaway. Those banks should be kept under surveillance by an armed patrol at certain times.  The vulnerable times for these armed robberies is shortly after opening. The first customers are usually people who are not properly introduced but who want large sums of money.  More attention should be given to the protection of those banks.</P>
    <P>If it is going to take a lot of money to do this work it will have to be found.  The Minister can throw anything he likes back at me, but if he comes into the House looking for more money for this sort of protection he will get it as far as I am concerned.  It is bad for the morale of the people and it encourages criminals as well as financing illegal organisations. Then we have the other crime&mdash;I am not so sure how it can be dealt with&mdash;of kidnapping and holding for ransom.  The Minister and his professional advisors should, as I am sure they are, direct their attention to whatever way that can be checked and dealt with.  Naturally, if a bank manager is told that his wife or his child have been kidnapped and if a certain amount of money is not left some place within a specified time, that person will be murdered, he will, understandably, comply with their request.  There should be direct communication between banks and Garda Stations.  There should be some alarm that can be set off immediately and one that would indicate whether there was a kidnap involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2219" /> I feel very strongly about the increase in the robbing of large sums of wages, from post offices.  I have given views about the necessity for arms, and efficient arms, that will enable the Garda or the Army to carry out their duty.</P>
    <P>The Minister in introducing this Supplementary Estimate compliments the commission of inquiry which he set up to look into pay conditions of the Garda.  I join with the Minister's expression of gratitude and appreciation to Professor Ryan and those who carried out that inquiry so promptly and submitted their recommendations to the Minister.  The Minister said that not alone did he thank Professor Ryan and his colleagues for submitting their recommendations to him so promptly, but that he was proud that the Government implemented the pay element of the recommendation with a matter of two weeks.  He said that the Government were considering the other recommendations, which are quite numerous, and that they would deal with them in due course.  It occurs to me that a commission never inquires into the conditions of the Garda Síochána or the methods available to them unless a pay row is brewing.  When a pay row is brewing a commission is set up.  The pay elements of the recommendation are dealt with promptly enough.  I am afraid the other recommendations are put on the long finger.  I did not have time to go carefully into the Conroy Recommendations and Report.  I know the pay element of that was implemented. Perhaps the Minister will tell us if all the other recommendations of Judge Conroy and his colleagues were implemented. If not, the Government of which I was a member must take some of the blame.  The Minister and his Government must take the major part of the blame.  The inquiry was set up in 1968 and presented in 1970.  The Minister's party were in Government until 1973.  They have been in Government again now for the last two-and-a-half years.  It appears that the pay elements of these reports are dealt with promptly <Col N="2220" /> to pacify the gardaí and to prevent industrial action of one sort or another.  I sincerely hope that that will not be the way in so far as Professor Ryan's report is concerned.</P>
    <P>I have always thought that the Garda are not nearly sufficiently trained for the complex job they have to do and for the sophisticated type of crime they have to investigate.  Gardaí are given 16 weeks training in Templemore and after that they are sent off to an understaffed Garda station which already has not sufficient staff to carry out the work that it is supposed to do.  They are thrown in at the deep end without any adequate training from the point of view of the code of law they are supposed to enforce, court appearances and many other things.  Is there an understanding that this debate is to conclude at 7 o'clock?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I believe that young gardaí are not properly trained, that 16 weeks in Templemore is utterly inadequate.  I have thought that for a long time.  There is an elaborate recommendation here suggesting that after the spell in Templemore, the young recruit be sent to a barracks, not as a member of the barrack's party but as an apprentice, that he be trained there for a number of weeks or months and then that he be sent back to Templemore.  That sounds very good to me, and I sincerely hope <Col N="2221" /> that the Minister will tell us that he proposes to implement that immediately.</P>
      <P>The last recommendation on page 122 of the Ryan Report says:</P>
      <P>We recommend that a consultative council which was established following the recommendation by the Conroy Commission should be reactivated. Its membership should consist of representatives of four Garda associations and the Departments of Justice and the Public Service and the commissioner or his representatives.  It should discuss matters relating to recruitment, the training and assessment of personnel, promotion procedures, the disparities caused by the uneven incidence of unsocial hours, payment and a high level of overtime, organisation, personnel relations and proposed changes in the force.  It should have an independent chairman and its own secretary who should not be drawn from the courts or from either of the Departments represented on the council.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister propose to implement that?  In the long-term and for the harmonious running of the Garda Síochána it is an excellent recommendation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has increased the size of the Garda Síochána.  He was right to do that.  His predecessor also increased the membership of the Garda Síochána substantially during his term in office.  I am sure the Minister will give him credit for that.  The strength of the Garda Síochána is still not adequate.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister's comments on overtime.  We used to hear a lot of criticism about curtailment of overtime.  I understand that overtime has been substantially cut since the Minister took over.  While, normally speaking, overtime might not be desirable, it is necessary as long as the strength of the force is inadequate.  I would like the Minister to say if overtime has decreased since he became Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Crime in general is on the increase.  It was stated recently that 33,000 crimes <Col N="2222" /> were reported over a certain period.  I am told that in some parts of the country crimes are simply not being reported because the gardaí seem to be unable to deal with them.  I previously raised the matter of clerical assistance for the Garda and the position of gardaí who render clerical assistance, that is long serving gardai who have become very efficient as superintendents' clerks and chief superintendents' clerks.  These members of the force are not properly treated.  I believe they are doing a professional job.  They are at least as well qualified as a senior managing clerk in a solicitor's office.  They are not allowed any overtime, they are not getting special pay for week-end or Sunday work, some miserable sum like £65 is given to them as a bonus.  I will not go into the details. They are men of the highest integrity, doing a very skilled job, and they should be properly paid.</P>
    <P>I know that lady clerks are now employed in Garda barracks.  I am not saying that some of them are not efficient but they are the lowest grade in the Civil Service ladder.  That is not good enough. The Minister should fight with his colleague, the Minister for the Public Service, and ensure that the next grade are employed in barracks.  The girls who are sent to the barracks are usually girls who have just come into the service and they are sent out without any training. Those of us who at one time or another were running offices know that it takes nearly 12 months to train a new girl. It takes that length of time for her to become accustomed to the terms used in a solicitor's office or in a Garda barracks.  Therefore, it is not good enough to send down young untrained civil servants to garda barracks.  When they go down the country there is nobody to train them; they either do the job or they do not.</P>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions should be as well represented in court as the defence.  If the defence have a senior counsel, then the prosecution should have a senior counsel.  Otherwise, the prosecution could be and sometimes is, at a disadvantage.  I could say many <Col N="2223" /> other things but I said I would not stand between the Minister and his reply if there was an arrangement.  I accepted his word that there was an arrangement.  I have been told by Deputy L'Estrange to give the Minister at least 35 minutes to reply and he can have it.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for giving me the opportunity of replying. Deputy Fitzpatrick graciously conceded some of the time which was at his disposal and he participated in a constructive way.  I am sorry that the agreement was made because I would like to have listened to Deputy Fitzpatrick.  At a later stage I will take up as many as I can of the points raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick and all the other Deputies who participated in the debate.  I should like to thank the Deputies who contributed to what was, on the whole, a very thoughtful and responsible debate.</P>
      <P>I accept that the different views expressed are genuinely held by those who expressed them.  I, too, would like a society in which prisons would not be necessary.  I would like to think that prisons belong to the past.  However I am afraid that the harsh reality of the situation is that we have not yet reached that stage.  Please God, we might reach that stage some time and I would like to see it.  I should like to try to bring the debate down to earth in relation to the role of prisons in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating, who has been praised by a number of Deputies in the House, Deputies not belonging to his own party, talked about the philosophy of imprisonment.  In that connection he gave an impassioned quotation from a former Chaplain of Mountjoy Prison against the whole idea of prisons.  I cannot accept that we are in an era in which we can do without prisons.  We must deal with the reality of the situation as we find it.  What we are trying to do&mdash;and I am very keen on this myself&mdash;is to provide humane conditions for people who are deprived of their liberty because <Col N="2224" /> of anti-social acts.  At the same time we are trying to provide them with a range of services&mdash;education, welfare and work training&mdash;which, if they choose to avail of them, would certainly help them to cope better with life on their release.</P>
    <P>The idea of rehabilitation as the aim of imprisonment was abandoned as a concept in most countries many years ago, even in the most progressive countries like Sweden and Denmark.  The medical analogy that crime is a sickness which can be treated and so lead to reform of the criminal is no longer seen as valid.  It is important to remember that most prisoners, even recidivists, are serving very short sentences and that there is a limit to the support which can be given to them while in prison.  A great deal of support is made available to the long-term prisoners.  However, no support facilities can have any value if the prisoner himself does not wish to avail of them.  On his final release, a prisoner is free and there is no means by which the supervision of welfare staff may be forced on him.  Welfare staff are available to give support on a voluntary basis but unfortunately few prisoners avail themselves of the service.</P>
    <P>Our prison system should be seen in perspective.  The total prison population, which is just short of 1,200, is one of the lowest by reference to total population among western countries and is far lower than most.  It should be clearly recognised and accepted that more people are under the supervision of welfare staff than are in custody.</P>
    <P>I should like Members who contributed to this debate to know that we operate a liberal temporary or parole system and have recently introduced a scheme of intensive supervision designed to take offenders even more quickly out of the prison system and put them back in the community.  I am also having to examine the question of introducing community service orders which courts could make as an alternative to orders for custody.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it would be very unfair of me if I did not give credit to my predecessor and his predecessor&mdash;to <Col N="2225" /> Senator Cooney who was Minister for Justice for over four years, and to Deputy O'Malley who was also a Minister for Justice&mdash;for the tremendous work they did during their periods of office and to the staff who helped them bring about the improvements I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The impression may have been given that our prison system has remained static and that no improvements in buildings or facilities have been made. This, of course, is not correct.  In the past decade three open centres have been established. A new ultra-modern centre, the training unit, has been designed and built specifically for the training of prisoners in industrial skills such as welding and light engineering.  Arbour Hill prison has been completely renovated and extended to provide first-class accommodation facilities for longterms prisoners.  Cork prison is being renovated and is about half finished.  The reconstruction work on Mountjoy prison has started.</P>
    <P>As to the future, the House will be aware that I have already announced that the building of a new women's prison and the building of a place of detention for male juveniles on a site in County Dublin are proceeding.  A second male juvenile place of custody will be provided in Cork, and planning for a high security prison is proceeding. The House can be satisfied that the design and layout of these new plans will be in line with the most advanced thinking on the subject.  All of these developments represent very substantial progress and should convince even the most sceptical&mdash;and there are plenty of them&mdash;that the maximum progress consistent with our resources is being made.</P>
    <P>There have been some references to facilities in the prison system, and I should like to give a brief account of progress in selected areas.  Five years ago my Department recruited a co-ordinator of work and training with a view to reorganising, restructuring and developing prison employment.  It was <Col N="2226" /> clear that many of the traditional activities had been overtaken by more up-to-date processes.  It was also clear that a much greater benefit would accrue to the prisoner in terms of training for outside employment if this reorganisation took place.  Considerable progress has been made in the work training development programme.  We should not forget the valuable contribution made to this by Senator Cooney as Minister for Justice and by Deputy O'Malley when he was Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>This programme aims to provide satisfactory employment and job training opportunities for prisoners.  There are two distinct parts to the programme. First, there is the provision of employment during sentences in well-organised production workshops.  Secondly there is the provision of intensive job training for those having suitable aptitudes so that they will have a better chance of getting a good job after release.  The aim of the employment part of the programme is to ensure that each prisoner is actively employed during his sentence at work which will suit his aptitudes and interests and prepare him as far as possible for further job training, either later on in his sentence or after he is released, with an employer.  Commercial methods of accounting are used and prisoners are involved in these procedures as they would be involved in outside employment.  The work situation provides the prison officers with an excellent opportunity of helping and influencing the prisoners positively.</P>
    <P>The second part of the work training programme, the provision of intensive job training, gives opportunities to those in custody to obtain skills which will enable them to secure employment on release, or after release.  This has been introduced. Members of the House will know the training unit at Glengarriff Parade and, when fully operated, the unit will have training places for about 60 male offenders.  Intensive industrial training is provided in a range of engineering skills like welding, engineering, machine operation, general engineering operations, and domestic appliance maintenance.  The training courses are <Col N="2227" /> recommended by AnCO who assist in the selection and the training of instructors. Training is carried out in a fully equipped modern workshop in which industrial conditions are simulated.  The standard industrial 40-hour week is worked.  Trainees are prepared for employment at semi-skilled level in the engineering industry.</P>
    <P>At present Arbour Hill prison has potential to provide accommodation with satisfactory employment for about 100 offenders, whilst the training unit has potential to provide 60 training places.  When account is taken of those offenders who are unlikely to avail of employment and training opportunities, remand prisoners, those who show no interest, those in full time education, and so on, there is a need for about 800 additional employment training places. During 1980, it is planned to provide between 200 and 300 additional places.  I know every Member of this House hopes that I will succeed in getting at least 300. We will try to do that because we recognise the need for it.  We will push on and try to bring about a much-needed improvement in this area.</P>
    <P>There were criticisms of the educational facilities during the course of the debate.  During the past year or so, a number of building projects were completed which allowed for an expansion of educational facilities, particularly for adult offenders in custody.  At St. Patrick's Institution offenders can avail of a very extensive education programme which includes a heavy commitment to the teaching of basic literacy and numeracy, general subjects, and craft subjects.  There are also extensive educational services at Shanganagh Castle where each offenders spends half a day in the education unit.  In the training unit a specially designed pre-training and prerelease educational programme was introduced recently as a pilot scheme.</P>
    <P>The programme lasts for about three months, and it aims to equip offenders with some skills for dealing with the day-to-day problems of life after they are released: problems like obtaining a job, <Col N="2228" /> getting household accommodation, use of leisure time, coping with drink and leisure difficulties.  It endeavours to teach offenders how to co-operate with each other, to recognise that other people's views and ideas have to be considered as well as their own, and to improve the offender's confidence in himself and his self-image.  The first group have completed the course.  I know Members of the House will be glad to learn that it appears to have been successful judging by the initial reaction of the offenders and of the staff.  If the new scheme continues to prove successful, it will become an established part of the training youth operation and will be extended to other institutions as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>In Mountjoy male prison, three additional classrooms have been provided. Courses in English, general subjects, literacy, numeracy, arts, craft work, basic cookery, laundry and hygiene are now available to the men.  The long-term planning for Mountjoy prison includes the provision of a fully equipped education unit which will cater for the needs of those in custody there.  In the short term, another four educational rooms will be made available in the coming months.  In Mountjoy female prison, nearly all offenders take advantage of a small but excellent education unit where literacy, arts, crafts and home economics are taught in an informal setting.</P>
    <P>The long term prison at Arbour Hill has a temporary education unit where classes are provided in English, in general subjects, arts, crafts, pottery, home economics and physical education. In Limerick prison a new education unit was opened last year and four full-time teachers are employed at present teaching literacy, general English, social studies, arts, craft work and home economics.  In Cork prison, part of the classroom accommodation has been completed and four teachers provide classes in literacy, general English, general studies, arts and home economics.</P>
    <P>Portlaoise prison presents particular difficulties because of security needs. However, during the past few years, <Col N="2229" /> arrangements were made for a number of men to study for the Leaving Certificate and the Northern Ireland and London O and A levels.  All the necessary books and equipment were provided by my Department and an examination centre was established in the prison.  Library facilities have been greatly improved for the benefit of those who do not wish to follow a specific course in education.  I have introduced language tape cassettes and a video tape recording system which will allow the men to follow a range of educational programmes.</P>
    <P>I am happy that educational facilities are being systematically expanded.  The new classroom accommodation is of the highest quality and the best of equipment and teaching materials are being provided in order to help each offender who wants to improve his level of education during the period of time he spends in custody.  Teachers are selected by the various vocational education committees in counties where prisons and detention centres are located.  They are fully qualified and committed to the work of educating offenders.  We are very glad, indeed, to have their services, and thank them.</P>
    <P>Because of the rapid expansion of the education service I was aware that there was an urgent need to introduce an adequate structure for teachers which would give them the opportunity to meet the needs of the offenders more effectively. In this context it was unsatisfactory to have a 12-week summer holiday period. Men and women are committed to custody on an ongoing basis and the system of suspending classes for three months a year meant that some people completed their terms of imprisonment without ever having an opportunity to improve their education.  However, there were difficulties to be resolved, not the least being the number of bodies whose interests were not always the same&mdash;the Department of Education, the vocational education committee, the teachers' union and, indeed, the Department of Justice. But I am glad to say that these difficulties have been overcome and that in <Col N="2230" /> future years a fully planned education programme extending over most of the year will be in operation.  Though the agreement on the new structure was not finalised in time to get the full benefit of the new programme this summer, the period during which education was available was considerably greater than in previous years, and it is something we all welcome very much.</P>
    <P>Library services are available in all prisons and places of detention.  They are provided by the public libraries and I would like to take the opportunity of expressing my thanks to the librarians who have co-operated so willingly with my Department in order to provide a comprehensive range of books for offenders. Plans are at present being made for considerable expansion of the range of library facilities, in the Dublin places of custody initially, following recent discussions at official level between the Department and the city of Dublin libraries. The Department have requested the appointment of librarians who will be assigned fulltime to the places of custody.  As well as extending the present service and providing support for teaching, training and prison office staffs, it is hoped that these librarians will engage in a substantial amount of development work among those offenders who may be uninterested in or, indeed, unable to cope with conventional books.  They could, for example, show offenders how to use a library and could interview them on a one-to-one basis to identify ways of facilitating and indeed encouraging them.  They could also introduce audio-visual library facilities.</P>
    <P>Shortly after taking up office more than two years ago, I increased the established strength of the welfare service from 101 to 123 posts.  This figure has now been increased to 132.  Recruitment of additional staff is in progress and every effort is being made to fill those new posts as quickly as possible.  The welfare service provides an essential support system to persons in trouble with the law through the probation service and in the prisons and places of custody. The training of prison service personnel <Col N="2231" /> is being developed all the time.  The initial training course for recruitment of prison officers now extends over ten weeks, and this is followed by thorough on-the-job training.  Development courses are also being conducted to the limit of resources. I have recognised that a serious limiting factor is the absence of a suitable training centre exclusively for prison staff training.  Pending the provision of a purpose-built centre I have acquired premises to use as interim accommodation. Staff accommodation is being improved constantly.</P>
    <P>I should now like to move on to some of the more specific points made during the debate.  I agree fully that it is unsatisfactory to be operating the prison system by staff working overtime.  I have created the required additional posts and every effort is being made by the Civil Service Commission to recruit the necessary staff.  I am hopeful that the competition now in progress will supply a substantial number of recruits.  I do not consider that it would be wise or justifiable to depart from the normal means of recruitment to get more staff, at least at this stage.  I hope the commission will be successful and they can speed it up, but I am not prepared to change the system as of now.</P>
    <P>Some comment was made during the course of the debate about prisoner's rights and entitlements.  Let me say, firstly, that every prisoner retains his full constitutional rights while in custody.  If a prisoner has a grievance he has a number of avenues for appeal.  He may appeal to the governor, to myself as Minister, to the visiting committees and finally to the courts.  I do not see that there is any need to add to the list by creating an additional appeals tribunal. When a prisoner misconducts himself he may be dealt with under the Rules of the Government of Prisons, 1947, either by the governor or by the visiting committee. He must be present at the hearing and may say anything on his own behalf.</P>
    <P>Since the rules and procedures under which the prisons are administered can be subjected to public scrutiny&mdash;and frequently <Col N="2232" /> are&mdash;by the courts, it is difficult to appreciate the call that has been made for a more open administration.  The media&mdash;newspapers, radio and television&mdash;people have been allowed to visit the various prisons, and my Department are prepared always to deal with any reasonable inquiry about the prison system and the rights of prisoners from any organisation who display a legitimate and sincere concern for prisoners.  This concern, however, cannot be attributed to the so called Prisoners' Rights Organisation.  The actions of that organisation and its associates have not demonstrated any real interest in the welfare of prisoners but rather a determination to bring the prison system generally to its knees and to disrupt all democratic means of preserving law and order.  Incidentally, the suggestion that some members of some particular group who are critical of the prisons are contemplating legal action for defamation against a spokesman of the Prison Officers' Association must be regarded, perhaps, by some as a joke, because more than once in this House I have had to stand up and defend members of the Department of Justice from attack and defamation of character and intimidation and from their children being interfered with going to school by people who purport to belong to an organisation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating raised the case of a mother who was refused permission to visit her son in Saint Patrick's Institution following a disturbance there in October 1978.  I should like to explain to the Deputy and to the House the circumstances surrounding the particular case.  The boy in question was one of the leaders of the disturbance and was particularly difficult.  Following the disturbance all visits to offenders in the institution were stopped.  The boy's mother called to the institution on the morning after the disturbance&mdash;that was 1 November&mdash;and, like all the other visitors, was refused permission to visit. But she was told that he was all right. The solicitor for the boy requested to see him in the afternoon and was told that the prison authorities would be in touch <Col N="2233" /> with him later.  The solicitor visited the boy on the following morning and interviewed him for about an hour, but the boy was subsequently seen by the visiting committee which recommended his transfer to Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that the management of the prisons should be given over to a board of management. This is not a new proposal.  Such a development would not necessarily be an improvement on existing management and could give rise to a whole new range of difficulties.  For example, staff would not know who is running the prisons.  As thing stand, staff know exactly where decisions are taken which affect themselves and the prisoners.  Furthermore, staff input into the running of the prisons might not be as effective as under present arrangements where the staff attend local management meetings and also meetings where prisoners' sentences are reviewed.  The present system, and I have said this time and again as did my predecessor and his predecessor also, is continously under review.  The developments I have outlined are ample evidence of this.  I have just covered improvements over the last decade, and I have already publicly paid tribute to my predecessor, Senator Cooney, and his predecessor, Deputy O'Malley.  I should hope that whoever succeeds me, regardless of which party he is from, would continue with the type of work I am doing because it is something that each and everyone of us must have a genuine interest in.</P>
    <P>The developments that I have outlined are ample evidence of the continuing review of the system, and I would not be so naïve as to suggest that everything in the area of our prison administration is perfect.  I am not suggesting that at all. There is still a lot to be done.  However, I am satisfied that the standards which apply in Irish prisons compare very favourably with international standards and with those laid down by international organisations.  Indeed, our standards in most respects are far superior to those in the standard minimum rules laid down at international level for the government of prisons.  This is something <Col N="2234" /> that is not known, probably will not be mentioned by the media, but this is a fact.  Probably the only area where we fall short of those rules is in relation to the segregation of prisoners and we are not alone in this.  Might I say that countries far wealthier than ours have not been able to achieve the level of segregation laid down in those rules.  However, when our building programme has been completed we will be in far better position in this regard.</P>
    <P>Before I leave prisons I would like to thank all those who work in the prison service.  I would like also to thank the visiting committees for the very fine job that they do.  They have had a little more to do in recent years because they are normally in operation as and from the first or second week in January which I think is a good thing.  I would like to thank them all very sincerely for the fine work that they are doing under difficult circumstances and to say to them that I know that there is public support for them and the type of work that they do.  Efforts by anybody to denigrate them and to hold them up to intimidation will not succeed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham of the Labour Party spoke about the Curragh prison. My thanks and appreciation must also go to those who look after that prison. We will have more about that at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The question of armed robberies was raised.  I publicly admitted here last week that the number of armed robberies continues to give cause for serious concern and I gave information in reply to questions asked by members of the Labour Party as to what the situation was at the present time.  I said that there has been a fairly substantial decrease in the number of such robberies in the current year.  It is amazing the number of people who spoke in the debate who did not hear what was said.  I can assure the House that the situation is not one that I regard as in any way satisfactory.  I am hopeful that certain steps which have been taken by the Garda will continue to effect further improvement in curtailing this type of criminal activity.  However, the <Col N="2235" /> efforts of the Garda will not be successful unless everybody involved in the handling of sizeable amounts of cash makes a determined effort to ensure that all possible security precautions are taken.  The commercial banks have old me of various measures that they are taking and, while I am satisfied that these steps will go a long way to deal with the problem of armed bank robberies, I would like to see their implementation being pursued vigorously.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a link between armed robberies and the activities of terrorist groups operating in this country. The proceeds of the robberies in many instances go into the coffers of the subversive organisations, and they are used by them to fuel their unlawful actions, actions which have besmirched our country's name throughout the civilised world.  The measures being taken to protect cash and valuables provide only part of the answer to the problem.  Unless the armed robbers are apprehended and dealt with by the courts, we will have to commit substantial resources in manpower and equipment to combat them.  Accordingly, I appeal to the public to fully support the Garda in the difficult task which they undertake on our behalf and to give them every co-operation and assistance. Might I say that any suspicious activity, however insignificant it may appear, could be of assistance to the Garda.  I am assured by the Garda authorities that the public response to their appeals for assistance in the investigation of serious crimes is very good and I would ask that it be even better.</P>
    <P>The cost of security is very high.  It is far higher in this State than it should be because of the continued activities of the Provisional IRA and the INLA and also the armed criminal groups who are involved in the commission of serious crime.  This is a cost that the taxpayers must bear.  Let us not forget that the real cost is greater still because it has an adverse effect on economic growth in areas such as tourism and foreign investment <Col N="2236" /> prospects.  Any additional facilities sought by the Garda will be provided and I will have no hesitation in coming to this House and asking it to meet that cost.  There is an open door as far as the Oireachtas is concerned in giving them anything they want that will help them to combat the subversives and to protect property and lives.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte asked me a number of questions, and perhaps I shall read the questions so that there will be a proper tie-up.  He asked if the Garda have established the reasons why the consignees of the load of guns and ammunition recently seized at Dublin Port did not collect them, if there was a leakage of information regarding the surveillance operation mounted by the Garda on a consignment of guns and ammunition recently received in Dublin Port and if there is an internal Garda inquiry being held to discover whether or not there was such a leakage, and if there are any prosecutions pending.</P>
    <P>In replying to these questions I have to take into account certain statements attributed to Deputy Harte in a newspaper report of 19 November in <i>The Irish Press.</i>  The report suggested that the Deputy gave the impression that he may have information to support an allegation that some members of the Garda Síochána gave confidential information to people engaged in gunrunning. That was not at all what the Deputy said today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

      <P>I am glad that the Deputy has had the opportunity to correct the impression given because it was a wrong one and it is unfair to the Deputy.  It would also be unfair to me as Minister and above all it would be unfair to the gardaí.  I am delighted that the Deputy has had the opportunity of correcting it.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has information that would be of help to the Garda&mdash;and he was in America at the particular time&mdash;then arising from what the Deputy said today I hope that the Garda authorities will see the report of the Dáil debate and that they will do everything to ensure that anybody who is responsible in any way for anything that might have gone wrong does not get away with it.  Nobody in this House would want to see him getting away with it.  I do not care whether it is a member of the force, someone working in the docks, or whether it is customs officials or anybody.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully asked for the figures in respect of recruitment and wastage from the force for each year from 1970.  There is a whole lot of figures here: 1970, 147; 1971, 137; 1972, 125; right up to 1979 when the figure was 112.  If the Deputy wishes to have any further breakdown of these figures between the categories mentioned he can get in touch with me and I will let him know the details. Perhaps it would be better if I wrote to Deputy Tully because there are many details involved in the answers.  I have only two minutes or so left to speak so I think I should arrange to send it to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a number of matters raised by Deputy Harte on the Louden Ryan Report.  He referred to the test in Irish.  The oral Irish test consists of a simple conversation on ordinary topics such as salutations, food and drink, clothes, health, sickness, weather, games and pastimes.  It is not a very difficult standard to attain.  It is desirable that members of the Garda Síochána should be in a position to deal with any member of the public who might want to conduct some part of his or her business in Irish. <Col N="2238" /> It is not a very difficult obstacle to overcome.</P>
    <P>With regard to recruiting, of course there was heavy recruiting to the Garda Síochána during the term of office of the Coalition Government.  Approximately 1,500 additional young men were brought into the force and there was approximately 1,500 more brought in between 1969-1973, the period of office of Deputy Desmond O'Malley.  To date an extra 1,250 during my short time were recruited and there are another 500 on the way.  There will be more certainly.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Ryan Committee, there was a comment that only the pay part of the Committee's recommendations was implemented and nothing else has happened.  That is not so.  Discussions are taking place between the Garda Commissioner, the Garda associations and the Department of Justice on a wide range of recommendations.</P>
    <P>On parole, it is fair to say that we have by far the most liberal system of any country in the Nine.  We have more people out under the supervision of welfare officers than we have in our entire prison system.  We can be very proud of that.  We are away ahead of many other countries as far as our prisons are concerned and as far as standards in the prisons are concerned.  However, that does not mean that there is room for complacency.</P>

    <P>I am distressed that it has taken so long for the Ombudsman Bill to reach Dáil Éireann.  It is some four-and-a-half years since the Dáil resolved that there should be an ombudsman.  That was decided in May 1975.  It is deplorable that our democratic system has taken so long to produce a Bill in respect of which there was the unanimous agreement of this House.  I am worried&mdash;I have never been so worried in my public life as I am today&mdash;because I see that democracy in Ireland is at risk.  It is under attack from three different quarters, each one of them is a menace.  The most obvious one, and the least effective one, is from the Provisional IRA.  I say, least effective because there is such an overwhelming revulsion in our community against the Provisional IRA but the attack on our democratic system is nonetheless coming from there.  The second attack on the democratic system comes from non-government <Col N="2241" /> here.  It comes from the unfortunate fact that we have in office a Government who believe the best way of avoiding unpopularity is to do nothing about anything in the belief that the trouble will go away.  Fortunately we still have every four or five years a correction when that system is developing and the correction is, of course, a general election.  A reminder of the ability of people to correct in the democratic system arose recently in Cork where a very effective protest about non-government was given by the people.  That was democracy at work.  My argument in favour of the ombudsman system is that elections every four or five years, or even by-elections in between, are not a sufficient corrector to the political system.</P>
    <P>I say that democracy is under attack first, from the Provisional IRA, secondly from non-government and the distress, disaffection and frustration that non-government generates, and, thirdly, because our whole political system is unable to give rapid effective, efficient translation of the people's will into legislation.</P>
    <P>When on the proposition of Deputy Fergus O'Brien four-and-a-half years ago Dáil Éireann unanimously agreed to the system of ombudsman, one would have hoped that the ombudsman system would come into being within a year or so.  At that stage I had the honour and responsibility of being the Minister in charge of the Public Service.  It fell to me to translate the will of the Oireachtas into legislation.  I believe it was the right thing to do at that stage, to have an all party committee which would agree if possible on a set of proposals which would then have all party agreement.  As a result I recommended to the Government that there should be an all party committee.  We were satisfied that there should be an ombudsman system.  We had agreed among ourselves as to what the bones of that system should be but I felt it was desirable in the public interest to involve the largest number of people in discussion on what the ombudsman system should be.</P>

      <P>I was very disappointed at the performance of that committee, primarily due to the then Opposition who are now in Government.  I do not want to waste the time of this Dáil or the time of the people of Ireland by recriminations about things past.  I heard the Minister for Finance last night try to defend Fianna Fáil's performance in that committee.  I want to put the truth on record.  After the establishment of the committee was announced it took six months before we could have a meeting of the committee because the Fianna Fáil Party would not nominate members to it.  When the committee sat, after we had endeavoured for weeks to get agreement on a date, I as the Minister responsible to the people of Ireland decided we could not allow any further delay.  I fixed a date.  Subsequent to my fixing the date the Fianna Fáil Party decided to have their own Oireachtas party meeting. Then on the day of the meeting they sent around a note saying they could not attend because their own in-fighting was more important than the appointment of an ombudsman or the creating of a system that would give the people of Ireland administrative justice.  In an effort to use the Opposition notwithstanding their absence from the first meeting, a number of amendments were made at the second meeting because of their objection.  Decisions taken at the first meeting were amended in order to meet their objections even though they were quite unreasonable.</P>
      <P>When, ultimately the committee met to consider the final draft there was agreement on the draft, subject to the opportunity that they consider the matter away from the meeting.  It was agreed that if there were any amendments to the draft report of that committee the amendments should be in before an agreed date.  No amendments were received to the draft report.  I made several efforts for weeks and weeks to get the Bill for a final meeting to endorse the report and present it to parliament and the people.  Again, I was met with a pregnant silence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2243" /> Finally in discharge of my responsibilities as Minister, I fixed a date, as it was my duty to do.  If the last Dáil was to present a report it had to go to the last Dáil, not to this one.  If we had not produced a report in the last Dáil this report, which is a worthwhile one would never have been published.  When I fixed a date again the Fianna Fáil Party decided to have their own Oireachtas party meeting and considered their internal in-fighting as more important than the discharge of the business of the people of Ireland, the plain people of Ireland who would not be looked after by an ombudsman.  The night of the final meeting, when the final report was agreed to, admittedly in the absence of Fianna Fáil&mdash;if they were absent that was their business&mdash;when the final report was published Deputy George Colley, who came into the House now for a moment and then left because he does not want to be reminded of the truth, called a press conference when he made charges of unfair behaviour by me. Long before that committee were ever established, long before Dáil Eireann ever agreed to the establishment of an ombudsman I wanted it.  I believe in an ombudsman system.  I have argued for it for years and years.  I wanted to see the thing through.  I wanted to see it agreed. That is why I agreed to an all-party committee. We, as a government, could have brought in legislation and pushed it through with a majority.  I wanted agreement and all my attempts at agreement were frustrated by a party who do not want an ombudsman.  They do not want the administrative decisions they dictate to be exposed to the public view.</P>

That Bill is based upon a draft which was in the Department of the Public Service when I left office.  I asked several questions about the production of a Bill to translate into the law of this land the decision of Dáil Éireann of 1975 and I was told that it would come.  It was only when Fine Gael produced this Private Members' Bill that the Government introduced a motion saying they were producing a Bill.  That Bill has not yet been produced.</P>

We will have to wait may be for many many months because once this matter has reached the Dáil in Private Members' Time it cannot be resurrected again for another six months in Private Members' Time.

      <P>My conviction is that it is necessary for the survival of democracy that people have confidence in the system.  Unfortunately we have allowed the whole political system to be polluted with a cloud of suspicion that rights, which are guaranteed by law, are not obtainable unless one goes craw-thumping to a politician to obtain them. That is very bad for democracy.  That is worse than violence used against democracy when there is an overwhelming conviction that statutory rights, constitutional rights, are not obtainable unless one goes cap in hand to a politician.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this Bill, the establishment of an ombudsman, is to convience <Col N="2245" /> people that when administrative decisions are made those decisions are in accordance with the law and are right.  I know, you know and I believe everybody in this House knows that most political representations are not even worth the paper upon which they are written, because the decisions are taken in accordance with the law by officials who are above reproach.  Even people who are above reproach can make mistakes. Even people who are above reproach can have a bias of which they are unaware. Even people who are above reproach can feel a loyalty to an establishment, which is likely to create a bias against objective judgment.  The whole purpose of having an ombudsman, a judge outside the system, is to enable that person outside of institutional loyalty to look at decisions; to look at the facts which affect decisions and to look at the possibility of bias affecting decisions.</P>
    <P>Of all countries in the European Community there are only two without an ombudsman.  I think the other one is Luxembourg.  If I am wrong, I apologise to my Luxembourg friends.  Luxembourg has a population of only 300,000.  While we know well that we cannot turn up at any function without finding relatives or friends, or contacts who know one another, I am sure this is even more true in relation to Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament has already voted in favour of an ombudsman system.  It has recommended that the ombudsman system in Europe should be based upon the ombudsman system in the Community countries which is at present being studied by Parliament.  It is regrettable that Ireland is the only other country without an ombudsman system, although it is now four-and-a-half years since our Parliament decided that there ought to be such a system.</P>
    <P>Today, whether we like it or not&mdash;and most of the time people like it&mdash;the State is involved in innumerable decisions affecting the most intimate life of individuals and their families: in health, education, housing, social welfare, planning and price control.  Think of any <Col N="2246" /> human or commercial activity and you will find that the State is involved.  The purpose of an ombudsman system is to provide independent assessment as to whether a system is working correctly or not.</P>

      <P>In our Bill we are recommending the appointment of an ombudsman who will have the right to examine the files of Government Departments.  This is revolutionary in the Irish scene.  I was very disappointed today to find that the internal fighting of the Fianna Fáil Party, the difficulties in Iran and the spy stories from Britain were all regarded as more important that a Bill which is trying to give the people the right to have decisions made by the executive examined by an independent authority.  We have no control or influence over any spy stories between Britain and Russia and so on of two decades ago, but we have the right and the duty in this Parliament to try and improve the lot of the Irish people now and in the future.  That is what this Bill is about.  I do not criticise the media.  People get more excited about romance and fiction than they do about reality.  This Bill is about providing a system which will enable any person disappointed with an official decision to have the decision investigated by an independent investigator.  I do not want to excite the Minister of State into further interruptions, but by the murmurs issuing from him it seems that he is against the Bill; he is against the idea of having an independent investigator.</P>

I suspect he has a Bill because we have pushed the Government along the line for the production of a Bill.  It is not unreasonable of us to expect a Bill, we are disappointed that Fianna Fáil's lack of co-operation with the Oireachtas Committee did not enable us to bring in the Bill.  It was one of my dearest hopes and expectations when I had responsibility as Minister for Finance and of the Public Service to bring in such a Bill.  I was deeply disappointed that I did not have the opportunity of creating the office of ombudsman.</P>

We were accused of electioneering because we insisted, as was our obligation, that the last Dáil should have produced its own report.  If it had not produced the report it would never have been published.  The draft Bill was in the Minister's Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then somebody burnt it.  I have in my possession a draft Bill. The copy that I have was not the only copy in the Department of the Public Service.  If there was no other copy of that draft Bill in the Department of the Public Service then somebody in the Minister's Department destroyed it.  I say that on oath.  There was an advance draft copy of a Bill to which I personally contributed.  If that is not in the Minister's Department the Minister's officials have let him down.  I do not believe they have let him down.  With the integrity and efficiency of the Public Service, I believe there was a draft Bill in the Department and that Fianna Fáil and <Col N="2248" /> their representatives in the House are talking rubbish when they say that there was not a draft Bill.  Even if there was not a draft Bill, it should not take two-and-a-half years to implement the very clearcut decisions of an all-party committee representing both Houses of the Oireachtas that set out their recommendations in the clearest possible language in a document of 39 pages, after over two years' work.  As I said earlier, we know that we are being ruled by a Government of non-government.  They do not believe in making decisions, but hope that the issues will disappear.</P>
      <P>Very briefly I should like to deal with the elements of the Bill, all of which, with one exception, follow the recommendations of the all-party committee.  The all-party committee recommended that the ombudsman should have the right to investigate all Government departments and their activities with the exception of security issues and such issues as are properly the reserve of the courts of law. It recommended that there should be enabling legislation to entitle the ombudsman at some future date to inquire into the activities of local authorities.  We have gone further in our Bill because we are fed up with the tardiness of the Government in doing anything in this area.  We felt that if we simply brought in enabling legislation on the local government front several decades might pass before there would be an effective ombudsman system touching administrative decisions affecting the humblest people in the land and, therefore, the most numerous group in the land.  We, in this Bill, would enable the ombudsman to investigate decisions of local authorities across a wide area including the allocation of housing, the availability of beds in hospitals, a whole lot of intimate issues which vitally affect individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was always concerned, as Minister for the Public Service, that what we were proposing in this report&mdash;which was a unanimous one&mdash;might not satisfy people because a lot of the issues failed to touch a large area of administrative decisions. At the same time I wanted to avoid the creation of a large number of <Col N="2249" /> people in an establishment which could not be dissolved for a long time.  In other words, once we bring the ombudsman on stream we will have a huge backlog of demands made on him and, as has happened in other countries, we will find that 99 per cent of them are not justified. I wanted to avoid an event which would lead to a massive empire-building operation which could not be justified afterwards. That is why originally in this report it was decided that initially we should have only an examination into government decisions.  But, having regard to the tardiness of the Government in relation to that simple operation, we felt it necessary to impose the statutory obligation on the ombudsman from the very beginning to investigate other areas, because it should not have taken four-and-a-half years for the Dáil to have a Bill before it to establish the ombudsman system.  Unfortunately it appears from the Government's opposition to this Bill that our efforts to establish the ombudsman are going to be defeated and there will be a lot more than four-and-a-half years before we have the necessary legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>Last evening I heard a certain amount of petty criticism from the Minister for Finance of the Bill because it was not precise in this or that area.  He mentioned, amongst the things which he said our Bill allowed to happen, something which he could not accept.  He referred to the right of a Minister for Justice to grant pardons and remissions in respect of penalties imposed by the court.  He said that the ombudsman should not have a right to look into that.  We accept that the ombudsman should not investigate any areas which are proper to the Judiciary, that he should not have the right to look into certain security areas.  But we do not accept that the ombudsman should not have a right to look at some decisions taken in the area of remission of penalties.  I have had, I suspect, more intimate contact with the remission of penalties imposed by the court than any other Member of this House, other than any Member who was or is Minister for Justice because, for <Col N="2250" /> three-and-a-half years, I had the privilege of being personal assistant to a Minister for Justice and I know the weight of political and personal interference brought to bear on a Minister for Justice in relation to decisions of the court.  Quite frankly, some of them are quite improper.</P>
    <P>In the last Dáil we passed legislation&mdash;on the recommendation of the National Coalition Government&mdash; against interference with the Public Prosecutor.  We have made it now an offence for people to try to obstruct the course of justice.  It is equally an obstruction of the course of justice for people to bring pressure to bear on a Minister for Justice to interfere with decisions taken in an independent court.  And I speak with recollection of a man for whom I had great admiration, the Minister with whom I had the privilege of serving, Jim Everett, who introduced legislation to deprive himself and every other Minister for Justice of a right of interfering with a penalty imposed by the court in respect of a traffic offence.  He decided, quite properly&mdash;and the Government of the day and the Dáil endorsed that decision&mdash;that a Minister for Justice should not have the right of waiving the suspension of a driving licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely satisfied that it would not be proper for an ombudsman to look at remissions given in circumstances which caused pain and anxiety to the general public, or indeed to some person who was the victim of a crime committed by others. That might be regarded by some people as being a matter of detail; I do not think it is.  It is not a matter which came before the committee, of which I had the privilege of being chairman, but it is a matter which should be looked at in relation to any legislation the Government may introduce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have provided in this Bill uniquely&mdash;and this in accordance with the wishes of the all-party committee&mdash;that <Col N="2251" /> the ombudsman should be appointed by the President with a vote of two-thirds of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is no other appointment in this land which requires the support of two-thirds of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That was an argument we made to the Select Committee when it met between 1975 and 1977.  It is an argument in which we in Fine Gael completely believe&mdash;that the ombudsman must be above reproach, above suspicion, above party loyalties; he must be a person whose objectivity is totally respected.  That is why we built in uniquely in this Bill the requirement that nobody could be ombudsman without having the support of two-thirds of the membership of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I would hope, therefore, that our Bill&mdash;we do not say it is administratively perfect&mdash;would be accepted in principle, that whatever amendments the Government may have to suggest ought to be and will be made in the course of Committee Stage.  I would love this Parliament to get away from the British tradition. God knows we love to boast our Irishness, but can we not get away from the British tradition that no Bill is acceptable unless proposed by the Government of the day?  We are making an honest effort, as equal Members of Parliament, and Ministers&mdash;as I am sure the Minister of State present will accept&mdash;are equal in this House to ordinary Deputies, or should be equal and no more.</P>

      <P>The ombudsman idea is one which has become fashionable, popular and well known in western Europe in the last 15 years or so.  Had one spoken in a political setting, a social setting or anywhere else 20 years ago about an ombudsman people would not have known what one was talking about. But for some reason, around the middle nineteen sixties a couple of severe administrative scandals, in Britain I regret to say, coincided with the spread of knowledge about this Scandinavian institution in such a way that in Britain the cry was taken up; we ought to have an ombudsman.  And, since we follow British practice&mdash;as I say almost every time I get on my feet in this House, in everything&mdash;it was not long before the trendy idea in Britain became the trendy idea in Ireland as well.  However, the British introduced a Bill, which was enacted, which created a Parliamentary Commissioner hedged around with restrictions of a kind which, if they existed in this country, would make such an official perfectly useless to us.  The British Parliamentary Commissioner is not allowed to look at anything unless it is referred to him by a Member of Parliament&mdash;that is a defect which the Bill before the House this evening does not have&mdash;he is not allowed to look at any matter of discretion&mdash;again, a defect of which this Bill is free&mdash;and matters of local government are excluded from his purview, another defect this Bill does not have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind, before we go overboard in regard to bad administration, that it is an ironic fact of the late twentieth century, which perhaps some of these cosmic historians will spot when they come to write in the past tense instead of in the future about the decline of the west, that it should be precisely in <Col N="2253" /> those countries in which the rule of law is most vigorously and most generally upheld, in which there is a free press, in which the media and politicians are most sensitive to injustices and to maladministration, there should be this great cry to improve and improve up to the point where no further maladministration can take place.  Whereas in the countries occupied by seven-tenths or eighth-tenths of the globe's population, which do not have a free system, which do not know what it is to be able to choose their own rulers whether good or bad, which do not know what it is to enjoy freedom of speech, which perhaps do not even value it because more pressing human needs such as the next square meal comes first and which most desperately need liberalisation, there is no talk of an ombudsman or about liberalising a situation so as to diminish the force of the State.  In the Marxist part of the world the insistence on the dictatorship of the State is all the more pronounced the more the governments of these countries feel threatened by the western democracies.</P>
    <P>These preliminary observations are intended to suggest that we ought not, in pursuing the idea of an ombudsman, fall too far on our knees in blaming ourselves for a rotten administrative system. We have not a rotten administrative system.  This country, measured against any standards and particularly against general world standards, has a good administration. It contains about 25,000 people, too many on its payroll, and because of the cautious approach to life&mdash;which admittedly is a salvation for us in a lot of ways&mdash;inherited from the British, like the habit of wearing a collar and tie, we have stopped short of the kind of experiments which mght have been expected from a young republic.</P>
    <P>That sort of revolutionary enthusiasm was visible in the first Government of this State.  The photographs of them with their celluloid collars, buttoned boots and frock coats, look pretty old-fashioned today, but the Cosgraves and the McGilligans were revolutionary idealists who believed in trying to start <Col N="2254" /> something new, free from the shackles of the past and free from English patterns, although they were more under the burden of them because they were nearer to them in time.  We are 50 years further on, but we have lost the energy they had and are less willing to strike out for ourselves. One has only to look at the humblest and most trivial things around us to see that the most trivial aspects of life are aspects in which we tip-toe and traipse after the English.</P>
    <P>There were as many arguments for having women police here, when they were first introduced in Britain but we had to wait for the English to do it.  In the whole sphere of traffic control we waited until the English introduced traffic lights and so on.  All the reasons for doing these things were there, but we waited until the British did them to see if they were safe.  I do not intend to offend the Minister opposite, but since the party opposite are most slavish in this regard, they waited&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair will know I am not trying to flatter him when I say everyone in the House respects him as a gentleman.  I do not want to quarrel with him but, in fact, we are discussing the civil service.  We are discussing a measure to control, not their numbers, unfortunately, although I would have been very interested in such a measure, but their activities.  All this talk about an ombudsman must be looked at against <Col N="2258" /> the background of the fact, which we willingly recognise, that although far too many people are involved in them these activities are carried out honestly and effectively on the whole and in general.</P>
      <P>However, not because of malice, not because of any sort of ill-intention on the part of anybody, there is the odd mistake, misconstruction of powers, impatient decision, perhaps something which has been insufficiently considered. Something slips through the net.  It must do so.  The civil service would consist of 55,000 saints albeit 25,000 redundant saints were it otherwise.  That is not what we are talking about.  There are these occasional cases, and it is these occasional cases that I take Deputy Ryan's Bill to have been drafted to deal with.</P>
      <P>Many of the heads of maladministration Deputy Ryan's Bill mentions would render an administrative activity in the strict legal sense voidable, in other words objectionable and capable of being struck down by a court.  Section 6 (1) (b) refers to an administrative action:</P>
      <P>(i)  taken proper authority, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  taken on irrelevant grounds, or</P>
      <P>(iii)  the result of negligence or carelessness, or</P>
      <P>(iv)  based on erroneous information, or</P>
      <P>(v)  improperly discriminatory, or ...</P>
      <P>I can fairly say that administrative decision, act, disposal, determination or anything else, taken in any such way is legally objectionable.  In other words, a court of law will declare it void, will declare it invalid, and will declare anybody injuriously affected by it to be free from its effects.  So far as the authority are concerned it is back to square one with them.  They must start all over again, if it is not too late for them to start all over again, which may be the case depending on the circumstances of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among Deputy Ryan's eight articles, five are ones in which a court of law already has jurisdiction to strike the <Col N="2259" /> thing down.  I cannot quite see that there should be any straining at this gnat. There could be no particular objection to these criteria being inserted because these are already recognised in law.  I am not sure what the Minister's departmental functions are.  All I know is that the elephantiasis of the public service has spread to the political ranks, because it takes ten people with the grand title of Minister of State to do the work which formerly seven people with the modest title of Parliamentary Secretary did.  In fact, I did the work of two Ministers of State when I was a Parliamentary Secretary for far less money than one of them, let alone two of them together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The elephantiasis of the public service has gone right to the top.  I am not sure what took me into that little sub-theme or bye-theme.  It is important to remember that these are all matters which were already legally objectionable. In other words, the litigant affected by a decision taken without the proper authority on erroneous information, or taken on irrelevant considerations and so forth, could already go to the court and have the decision annulled with a variety of procedures.  The procedures might have been statutory or, even if there were no statutory procedures provided, he could go to the High Court and with <i>certiorari</i> or <i>mandamus</i> or a declaratory action have whatever the authority had done set aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a lengthy operation and a costly operation.  It may be all right for a building contractor or a building speculator&mdash;and I do not mean the term in an offensive way.  It is all very well to ask Sisks, or McInerneys, or Gallaghers <Col N="2260" /> if they are ever injuriously affected by an administrative disposition to go to the High Court to have it struck down.  They have the wherewithal to do that.  Like the centurion in the Gospel they can say to ranks of abject solicitors and barristers &ldquo;go&rdquo; and they go quickly, or &ldquo;come&rdquo; and they come smartly.  It is not quite the same for somebody who has been denied a health card, or a non-contributory pension, or some other benefit to which they feel they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I know that does not happen through malice or through wilful neglect.  At least, it does not in my experience.  In my ten years in Leinster House, under one hat or another, I have never run across a case of administrative malice.  If my little certificate is worth anything to the public service, they are welcome to it with a heart and a half.  I find that that the public service at all levels consists of people who are anxious to help.  Sometimes they are overworked, depressed or impatient just as very often I am.  Basically they are anxious to help and anxious to do a decent honest job.  They make mistakes just as I make them, and just as Deputy MacSharry makes them, and we all make them.</P>
    <P>I have run across cases where people, through an over-hasty or insufficiently reflected review of their case, have been denied something like a non-contributory old age pension, or some benefit to which they were entitled.  The normal recourse in cases like that is so go to a councillor, a Deputy or a Senator.  That is why this type of thing has crossed my path.  In case the Minister opposite does not know it, in 1966 I was present on the occasion&mdash;looking much younger no doubt, and less wise I suppose&mdash;in the Incorporated Law Society's premises when a paper was read which had been prepared for the Minister for Finance to read on the subject: &ldquo;do we need an ombudsman?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was hard to say who the Minister for Finance was, because on the night of that meeting Deputy Lynch succeeded the late Deputy Seán Lemass as leader of the Fianna Fáil Party and as <Col N="2261" /> Taoiseach.  It was difficult to say whether the speech was intended to be put into his mouth or into the mouth of his successor as Minister for Finance but either way it was an interesting speech, because the officials who, presumably, had consulted with their Minister or had at least shown him a draft of what he would be saying, had said for him the words they put into his mouth, to escape, as Homer put it, the words which they had intended should escape the barrier of his teeth and these were that in this country we had too many ombudsmen, if anything, that every Deputy, councillar, Senator was an ombudsman.  Even the parish priest was regarded as an ombudsman because anyone with a grievance went to him in the expectation of the problem concerned being resolved. The thought which came from the Department of Finance then was that we did not really need an official ombudsman because of our having so many effective unofficial ones.  Though I made very little of the point then, there is something in that line of thought.  In a sense the Minister of State or Deputy Desmond or myself are quite well placed to pursue a grievance that is brought to our attention.  It would be quite likely that on receipt of a letter from one of us an official in a Department would at least look through the file concerned to see whether, for instance, Mrs. X was entitled to a medical card after all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a qualified question mark in regard to this Bill.  When speaking earlier today on the Estimates for the prisons and the Garda, I said that I thought the new legislation for the appointment of an ombudsman would be incomplete if it did not contain a provision for the review by the ombudsman of complaints made against the Garda and against members of the prison service.  I went on to give in great detail the reasons for that opinion. Though there was nobody but the officials in the Chamber to hear what I said, I shall not bore the House by going over that ground again.  I note that Deputy Ryan's Bill excludes the activities of the Garda from the purview of the ombudsman.  I suppose that is so because it would be part of Deputy Ryan's view, as I understand it, that there should be some independent organ or authority for scrutinising the acts of the police where these acts are the subject of complaint by the public and in such situation there would not be any need for the ombudsman to have such authority.  In those circumstances, I would not have any fault to find with this exclusion but in the event of our not having any independent authority to scrutinise complaints that may be made against the Garda&mdash;and luckily, such complaints are not made often&mdash; whatever legislation we have here should contain an expressed subjection to the ombudsman's jurisdiction of complaints made against the police or officers of the prison service.  In that event, though I am entirely in agreement with the principle of the Bill I would qualify my support somewhat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though the Garda and the prison service are only very seldom the target of complaints, they themselves would be the main beneficiaries of a system of transparent investigation.  It is not to flatter subversives or fellow travellers or the kind of people who get a kick out of having a go at the State, regardless of who is in power, and it is not even to flatter <Col N="2263" /> those whom I might call genuine bourgeois liberals, of whom I would regard myself as one, but it is in the interests of the police and the prison service that I suggest we have an independent arbitrator of complaints in regard to these bodies.  If the public are made happy regarding the conduct of the police by means of impartial investigation they will accord the police a confidence which in any other set of circumstances would be qualified.  While I was speaking on the Estimates I instanced the Cork cell death in 1967 or thereabouts when the Minister for Justice was Deputy Lenihan.  I could not count the number of ministries that man has held briefly and flitted from but he was for a short time Minister for Justice, a kind of Guinness Book of Records stuff.</P>

      <P>The then Minister stonewalled for about two months while the country was shouting at him in regard to his refusal to allow a proper judicial investigation into the death concerned. The suggestion made by the relatives of the dead man was that death resulted from injuries received by the deceased while in Garda custody.  Ultimately the Minister had to yield and there was set up a proper judicial inquiry. The result of the inquiry showed that the death had been accidental and from that day on there was not another word about the matter.  In other words, the principal beneficiaries of that impartial investigation were the Garda.  The inquiry strengthened public confidence in the Garda and in fairness to them some of their own members were most prominent in saying that and have said it in different forms since.  Any suggestion <Col N="2264" /> that the police would be hampered in their work by reason of there being an impartial authority with jurisdiction to inquire into complains made against the force is completely misplaced and renders no service to the State, to public confidence and, above all, renders no service either to the police or to the prison service.</P>

      <P>The most frustrating aspect of this debate is that it will be well into the eighties or at least two years from now, before we shall have in operation an effective ombudsman system.  That is a very serious reflection on the present Dáil because for the past eight or nine years we have repeatedly spoken about the matter here. There has been an unending succession of Dáil questions in this connection. During the past ten years I have littered the Dáil Order Papers with various questions on the issue.  I understand that the cost of replying to a parliamentary question is now about £50.  Therefore, a lot of money has been spent already on the question of an ombudsman in terms not only of parliamentary questions and debates but in the setting up of special committees and in the parliamentary draftsman's office.</P>
      <P>That money could have been devoted to a short, sharp and reasonable attempt by a Cabinet to bring in a suitable system.  I doubt if any Cabinet in the past seven or eight years has spent more than ten or 15 minutes discussing this matter, and that applies to previous administrations as much as to the present one.  To his credit, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, made a serious attempt at the end of an arduous and difficult period in office to get something off the ground, and he nearly succeeded.  It is deplorable that it will be at least next April or May before any Bill in connection with this matter is passed, and that is assuming that some provision will be made for the ombudsman and his office in the next budget.  There will then have to be the usual protracted procedures of advertising the job and making the appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2265" /> Last evening the Minister for Finance indicated that the Bill would be circulated within a matter of weeks.  On that basis we may assume we will have it in the second week of December, but the House will adjourn a week later.  I doubt if we will be in a position to have a Second Stage debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <P>Time will be against us, because the Minister said it will be some weeks before the Bill will be circulated. If the Bill were circulated next week we might be in a position to discuss it.  When we resume after Christmas, provided we have not a new Taoiseach in the meantime, we will be engaged in a budget debate and it is highly unlikely that time will be provided to discuss a Bill dealing with the ombudsman.  We know it will be a lengthly and complex Bill.  Undoubtedly there will be amendments, and when this House finishes with it it must go to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister for Finance may be able to expedite the entire process but it has taken him three years to get this far, with all the ground work done between 1975 and 1977, with a full report available to him, in addition to a voluminous file in the Attorney General's office as well as considerable data from Westminster and European countries on the operation of the system. I think that what happened was that he suddenly woke up and discovered that Fine Gael had wrong-footed him by tabling their Bill and by proceeding with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make a strong plea to the Government not to delay any further in introducing this essential and fundamental legislation.  There is no doubt that there are citizens who for whatever reason consider they have suffered grave personal injustice at the hands of the administration. They consider themselves entitled to seek a thorough, independent, impartial and preferably non-judicial investigation into their complaint. Deputies meet many citizens who want <Col N="2266" /> to proceed on that course.  Naturally, some individual citizens have recourse to law.  We had a celebrated case where the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána took the State to court because he had a deep sense of personal injustice.  He taught the Cabinet a severe lesson in relation to the process of termination of one's employment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kelly has already spoken.  I would remind the House that there is a Bill before us.  We appear to be talking all the time about a Bill that is supposed to come before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is arguable that if we had an ombudsman at that time a phone call from him to the Secretary of the Department of Justice would have prevented that occurrence.  It is a classic case where an ombudsman could have prevented that public disgrace.  We should not underestimate the effect it will have on Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is no secret that many Deputies spend innumerable hours at public expense at the end of a direct line telephone in this House, often at their own personal expense&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They spend a large proportion of their time intervening with State Departments, health boards, local authorities, with State-sponsored bodies and with the whole apparatus of the administration trying to elicit information on behalf of their constituents.  This applies also to Senators who do this work on behalf of the public.  We spend our time trying to find out why somebody did not get their pay-related benefit right <Col N="2267" /> down to dealing with an allegation that a garda stopped somebody who was allegedly drunk and abused the individual. The Deputy inquiring into the complaint has to see what he can do about that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Multiply a rural Deputy's work by 184 and it would be necessary to have about one dozen ombudsmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  There is no doubt that if we had an effective system of ombudsman what masquerades as parliamentary intervention would be substantially reduced.  That would even apply to Dáil questions.  If a citizen approached a Deputy with what he felt was a grave complaint against a public servant or a body in the conduct of its affairs, one could legitimately tell that citizen that the complaint would be adjudicated upon, it would be sifted and teased out in the outside office of an ombudsman. Therefore, the predominantly messenger boy role&mdash;I say that with great respect to my fellow Deputies because I spend 60 per cent of my time doing this kind of work, work for which I was not elected to do or never paid to do and work which is, basically, not the function of a legislator&mdash;of Members would be greatly reduced.</P>
      <P>My first point I made in relation to the Bill was the interminable delay in passing this legislation.  My second point was that Members would have a great weight of litigation, correspondence and representations taken off their shoulders because the serious complaints would go through a more democratic, objective and fair system of complaint if an ombudsman was appointed.  Thirdly, there is the more serious issue of educating public opinion here that one should not have to go through a Deputy's or Senator's good offices to get something. There is the problem of advising citizens that where a decent system of complaint exists there is no great need for perennial recourse to the Deputy, Senator or county councillor for every complaint within the administrative system.</P>

Those representatives would be able to devote more time to the job they were elected to do.

      <P>Having been involved for 20 years in public life, in trade unions and in the Dáil for the past ten years, I know that the overwhelming majority of public servants here discharge their functions and their work with clear efficiency, general competence and fairness.  Those of us who have travelled <Col N="2270" /> around Europe hold the view that our public service, relative to the public service in countries like France or Italy, is much better.  From my visits to America I can say that our public servants are much better.  I am talking about elements of corruption, influence, patronage and those issues which impinge on the public service.  By and large, our public service are clearly unblemished in the generality of their work.</P>

Deputy Horgan made the point that if there are stupid systems in operation, if there is a super-abundance of red tape in operation and if we have set up unworkable bureaucracies here, then the political heads of the Government Departments are the people responsible. We enact legislation here and if it is confused and gives opportunities for corruption or total inefficiency we, as legislators, are responsible.  Public servants administer the law in accordance with the Acts passed by this House.  I am always bemused that public servants at health board or local authority level are slated by public representatives who know that the systems were set up by politicians.  It is the politicians who must reform the system and we should not blame the public servants who administer the system.</P>
