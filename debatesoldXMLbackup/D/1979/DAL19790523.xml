      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Tairgim leasú a 1:</P>
      <P>I leathanach 5, i ndiaidh líne 14, go gcuirfear isteach an mhír nua seo a leanas:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(a) déanfar míreanna i agus ii d'alt 4 a leasú trí &lsquo;mura bhforáiltear <Col N="1197" /> a mhalairt le reachtaidheacht&rsquo; a chur i ndiaidh &lsquo;triúr&rsquo; i mír i, agus i ndiaidh &lsquo;triúr&rsquo; i mír ii.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In page 4, after line 14, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  paragraphs i and ii of section 4 shall be amended by the insertion of &lsquo;unless otherwise provided for by legislation&rsquo; after &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo; in paragraph i, and after &lsquo;Dublin&rsquo; in paragraph ii.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to clarify the position in respect of the Seanad seats of the NUI graduates and the Seanad seats of the University of Dublin graduates.  Article 18.4 states quite clearly that</P>
    <P>The elected members of Seanad Éireann shall be elected as follows:</P>
    <P>i.  Three shall be elected by the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>ii.  Three shall be elected by the University of Dublin.</P>
    <P>In the Bill before the House no attempt was made to change the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; even though the Bill may become law and will add two subparagraphs to section 4.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3º of Part 2 of the Schedule says:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Article shall be invoked to prohibit the dissolution by law of a university mentioned in subsection 1º of this section.</P>
    <P>It is intended, as we know, to introduce legislation to dissolve the National University of Ireland and to establish independent universities.  After the constitutional amendment has been made and the National University of Ireland dissolved I would not like to see still written into the Constitution the words:</P>
    <P>i.  Three shall be elected by the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>ii.  Three shall be elected by the University of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is bad drafting to leave those two sentences there without qualification.  I attempted in my amendment to qualify <Col N="1198" /> them by adding at the end of each sentence the words &ldquo;unless otherwise provided for by legislation&rdquo;.  I am allowing for the dissolution of the National University of Ireland and for the protection of the present seats of the University Senators and the position in relation to Seanad by-elections as mentioned in the Minister's speech yesterday.  I am also allowing for the dissolution of University College, Dublin, and for the redistribution of the three NUI seats and the three University of Dublin seats.  The words I suggested in my amendment to be added to subsections i and ii of section 4 would make the reading of the Constitution clearer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point made by Deputy Collins but the wording of the Bill covers fully this point in subsection ii of section 4 of Article 18 by providing that any election arrangement to be introduced in substitution for the arrangement in subsection i will be provided for by legislation, as the House knows from yesterday's debate.  The existing arrangements&mdash;this will be renumbered subsection (4) (i)&mdash;must remain unchanged because it must continue to have effect until the substitute arrangements have been made and have been legislated for.  All these points are old country for us because various drafts were suggested and it was felt that the safest wording was one which covered the existing situation, made provision for, say, the eventuality of a by-election and guaranteed that the eligibility of existing Senators to sit would not be under challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I still believe the drafting is sloppy.  Having confidence in the Minister to introduce legislation to dissolve the NUI in, say, a year's time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Knowing parliamentary procedure it may not be.  There will still be a clear statement in Article 18 of the Constitution that three shall be elected by the NUI, yet there will be enabling clauses to allow the dissolution <Col N="1199" /> of the NUI.  I am certain that people will be perplexed in the future about the wording of Article 18.  Simplicity and clarity are essential and are not achieved in the drafting of this Bill.  There is also the danger that the position may be challenged in the courts because the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in an Article of the Constitution must have a high priority in the eyes of the courts.  I fully realise the objectives of the mechanics of the subsections, but it is most undesirable to allow sloppy wording in an Article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Collins about this drafting and I will presently move an alternative solution myself.  I understood the Minister to say that the amendment moved by Deputy Collins might call into question the entitlement of Senators now sitting for the two universities to sit further between now and the amending legislation.  I cannot see the Minister's point because if the only change made in the draft is that suggested by Deputy Collins the right of these Senators to sit is completely unimpaired. They have been elected by the NUI and by Dublin University and there has been no intervening legislation to undermine their right.  The situation is absolutely plain.</P>
      <P>The same would apply in the event of the Minister accepting my amendment because part of Article 18 provides that ordinary law can determine the franchise of the universities.  Even if my amendment were made, ordinary law could put right the matter about which the Minister is apprehensive.  That problem does not seem to arise at all in respect of Deputy Collins's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking in the general context of the drafting of the Bill. Specifically in regard to Deputy Collins's amendment, I maintain that the point is fully catered for in the proposed subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is fully catered for in the Minister's subsection, but if he had set out to try to find a clumsy and inelegant way of doing it he could not have succeeded to a greater extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not admit there is anything clumsy or inelegant about it. All these points were taken fully into account and we had several drafts more or less along the lines of Deputy Kelly's amendment but it was felt that the present format, which I admit looks opaque, was the only safe one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a good deal of scratching of wigs over this when the time comes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the constitutional amendment is accepted by the people and legislation is brought in to dissolve the NUI, there will still be a simple sentence in the Constitution stating that three shall be elected by the National University of Ireland.  I maintain that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; has considerable legal strength in the Constitution and may be open to challenge in the courts, even though I take the point that under the Bill dissolution by law of a university is not prohibited.  I am not a constitutional lawyer but I feel that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, if it remains without qualification, may lead to legal hassle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks as if the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is of considerable strength but Deputy Collins is forgetting that if the amendment is accepted there will be a decision of the people against which any word in the Constitution, no matter how strong, will not be able to stand.  It will be a decision of the people that the dissolution by law of any university shall not be prohibited.  It seems plain that the amendment, if accepted, would be overwhelmingly stronger than the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the place mentioned by Deputy Collins.</P>

    <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P>In page 4, lines 15 to 19, to delete paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) and substitute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  in section 4&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  paragraphs i and ii are replaced by a new paragraph i as follows:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;i.  Six shall be elected by institutions of higher education.&rsquo;,</P>
    <P>(2)  paragraph iii is renumbered ii,</P>
    <P>(b)  in section 6, &ldquo;the Universities&rdquo; are replaced by &ldquo;institutions of higher education&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I explained yesterday the purpose of this amendment.  I appreciate the reasons for haste in regard to this Bill but it is unsatisfactory that the appearance of the Bill should be so long delayed that a Deputy wishing to put down an amendment, not to a Bill about field drainage but to a Bill to amend the Constitution, should be asked to do so within ten minutes.  I did my best but I would not be surprised if my amendment is not perfect, apart from the substantive objections which the Minister may have to it.  I would not wish to stake very much on its correctness as a piece of drafting.  I had not even time to type it out.</P>
    <P>The object is to try to avoid the extreme inelegance and clumsiness of the method adopted in the draft of the Bill before us.  It makes a much more flexible situation and leaves it open to legislation to determine what shall be reckoned as institutions of higher education for the <Col N="1202" /> purpose of the six Seanad seats.  It also provides a certain flexibility in regard to assigning seats as between Dublin University and the NUI.  I do not imagine this is one of the Government's objectives, though I can imagine circumstances in which it might be.  There might be a lot to be said for giving a larger representation to that university which has an enormously larger graduate body.  I do not feel strongly about it and am not pressing the point, but such a case might be made.  If so, the draft I have suggested would make that possible without any further referendum because all six seats would be attributable to institutions of higher education, whether the NUI, Dublin University, the NIHE, the Municipal College of Music or whatever.  These possibilities would all be comprised within the fairly simple formula I have suggested.  I put down a consequential amendment, as part of the same amendment, which would be necessary in the event of the replacement of the universities in paragraph 6 with institutes of higher education.</P>
    <P>I must admit that if my amendment were accepted, legislation would be necessary in advance of the next Seanad election whereas as matters stand, even with the amendment being put forward by the Minister, it is possible that a further Seanad election could take place with members being returned by the NUI and by Dublin University.  If that is the main difficulty in regard to accepting my amendment it is a signal that there is not intended any early move by the Government in regard to Seanad representation for other institutes of higher education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Constitution is amended as the Minister proposes it would seem that it would be possible to hold an election on the existing Seanad electoral law after the next dissolution of the Dáil without bringing into the net any other institution of higher education. In other words, the Minister is not doing anything but leaving himself an option which the Government may choose to exercise or not to exercise between now <Col N="1203" /> and the next Seanad election.  My amendment would oblige them before the next Seanad election to make statutory provision for the franchise in such a way as to compel them to name the institutions to which they were willing to accord a share of Seanad representation.  I agree that that is not merely a drafting change but I hope that the Minister would not find that a compelling objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On a general point, if the amendment is accepted by the people, the Legislature will be free to have all six seats taken as one constituency or to confine seats to specific groups of graduates or to graduates of a specific university or institution.  There is total freedom for the Legislature in this regard as the Deputy will realise if he reads the Bill carefully.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Kelly's amendment, having assured the Deputy first that there is no intention on my part to delay legislation in respect of the new independent university, that I intend to push ahead with the legislation as quickly as possible, any reading of the Bill that would be taken as an indication of delay or causing inadvertently is a wrong reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean that the Minister intended to delay the legislation but made the point that if he found my amendment objectionable on the ground that it obliged him to legislate quickly, I would take that as a signal that delay was intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to push ahead with the legislation with all possible speed.  The amendment we are considering now was given careful consideration by us before the Bill was brought before the House but we did not deem it adequate for reasons I shall outline. First, there is the question of the safeguarding of the continued eligibility of election to the Seanad on the university franchise.  It was contended that that would be covered by paragraph 9 of Article 18 but there was some doubt about it.  As the Deputy has said wig <Col N="1204" /> scratching can take place in matters of law.  We did not wish to give any further reason for itch and that is why the Bill was drafted to cover all eventualities.</P>
      <P>In the context of the deletion of provisions i and ii of paragraph 4 of Article 18 by referendum it was felt that the provision of paragraph 9 of Article 18 could not be relied on for this purpose. The best legal advice available to us was that on the face of it, the provision could be relied on but if there was any eventuality, anything that could be thought up by the more subtle legal mind, we wished to provide for such eventuality.</P>
      <P>Another point was the possibility of a by-election, for example, in the University of Dublin or for the NUI panel. Nobody has a guarantee of life.  Also, a Senator might resign.  Therefore, we wished to cover the eventuality of a by-election among the Members elected by the NUI or by the University of Dublin prior to the passing of the legislation. Deputy Kelly may say this provides an excuse for delay but delay is not intended.</P>
      <P>Another point is that there must be a freedom of choice for the date for a general election.  In theory and in practice the Government should be free to call a general election at any time.  This possibility had to be covered also in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they will call one in the course of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution and the laws of our land are important.  Eventualities must be covered, regardless of how limited the possibility.  The drafting was considered carefully during a long period of time.  Having regard to these matters, I am not in a position to accept Deputy Kelly's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the last point made by the Minister, I agree gladly that the Taoiseach must have discretion to seek a dissolution when he so wishes but obviously it would be a major legal embarrassment to the Taoiseach, who naturally would wish to keep his manoeuvrability intact, to be told by the Minister that it would be a year before the question could be sorted out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> Therefore, I see the Minister's point, but on the other hand if my amendment were accepted we would still have paragraph 6 of Article 18 but it would read that &ldquo;the members of Seanad Éireann to be elected by the institutions of higher education shall be elected on a franchise and in the manner to be provided by law&rdquo;.  That means that a Bill in respect of which there should be no reason for delay and which under pressure I could draft before lunchtime would give the Minister, first, adequate legal provisions to deal with the by-election situation, and, secondly, adequate legal provision to provide that no question could arise about the legality of the continued tenure until the dissolution of the Seanad.  I realise the issue is not political and I appreciate that the Minister had available to him the best legal advice possible.</P>
    <P>Some of that advice comes possibly from people I know and for whose judgment I have a lot of respect but in using the word &ldquo;opaque&rdquo; the Minister has unwittingly admitted the point I am trying to make.  This would appear to be one of the most obscure parts of the Constitution, and I repeat that the Constitution is an instrument which, if only for reasons of dignity, ought not to have to be construed like a revenue statute or a statute about Local Government which is a series going back to the 1860s.  It ought not to be necessary to scratch one's wig about the meaning of it.  You might scratch your wig about the meaning of a fairly porous or difficult term of what is exactly a family.  We have discussed that here recently in connection with the Bill on family planning. There may be a difficulty in putting that on paper.  There may be political as well as legal difficulties in putting it on paper. However, it cannot be difficult to put on paper in a somewhat different form what is involved here and bring in the necessary stop-gap legislation.  If the Minister's Bill is going to be put through in this way, I am afraid it will be a wrong step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not have understood the Minister correctly.  Was he <Col N="1206" /> saying that he proposed to retain to himself the right to determine the exact way in which these seats should be distributed in a certain constituency or combination of constituencies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The point was raised by Deputy Kelly to which I was simply replying.  I said that the amendment leaves it open to the Legislature to decide, in whatever way it wishes, the allocation of the six Seanad seats.  Deputy Kelly raised the question of a university which had a far greater electorate than another university and talked about the idea of some equitable allocation of seats as between one university and another, having regard to the numbers of the electorate. My reply was that the Amendment to the Constitution Bill before the House leaves the Legislature completely free to have the six Senators elected in whatever way, in its wisdom, it decides.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this matter yesterday on Second Stage.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say to it in a more considered fashion than in his answer on Second Stage of the debate.  We were talking, on Second Stage, about the possibility of giving special representation to any particular group of institutions or any individual institutions.  In my speech <Col N="1208" /> I gave historical evidence for the assumption that the history of the university seats in the Seanad has been, over the years, bound up with the apparent desire by succeeding administrations of different political complexions to make arrangements which would have the effect of giving a somewhat disproportionate representation to people who have some connection with the northern part of our isle.  In the past, the mechanism which was judged most appropriate for giving a positive discrimination in relation to people coming from the North was the mechanism which gave Trinity College, Dublin University, the same number of seats in the Seanad as the National University, despite the fact that its graduate body was very much smaller, and still is.  At present the Trinity College graduate electorate is about 8,000; the electorate of the National University numbers five times as many.  Yet, the two institutions contribute the same number of Members to the Oireachtas under the existing Constitution and legislation.</P>
    <P>We may ask two questions in relation to that general principle, now that we are at this juncture in our constitutional history.  The first is, is it appropriate to continue to seek to give some special weight of representation to people who have strong connections with the North of Ireland in our Legislature?  Secondly, what is the mechanism which is most suitable for doing this?  It is reasonable to try, with constitutional and legal mechanisms, to bridge the gap between North and South, even at the cost of some element of positive discrimination. The university or higher education representation in Seanad Éireann has in the past been used under such a mechanism.  It seems there is no reason why it should not continue to be used. The next, more detailed, question is whether that mechanism should be through the framework of Dublin University representation or not.  This is a more difficult question because Dublin University, in relation to its student body in particular, has changed very substantially over the years.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education quoted the Provost of Trinity College as saying <Col N="1209" /> that, given the present composition of the student body, it had at least as good a right to be described as a national university as the other institution which actually bears that name.  Indeed, this is probably the case.  I find it difficult, logically, to argue for a special reservation, if one likes to put it this way, at this point in time, for any particular institution in the Republic, even Trinity College, although I am well aware of the particular contribution of that institution to the State, through its members in Seanad Éireann.  I do believe that it is an appropriate occasion to think in terms, not just of widening the electorate to include other institutions of higher education in the Republic but of at least, establishing the possibility, which may or may not be seized by the Government of the day, of widening that electorate to include the graduates of institutions of higher education in the northern part of our island.  I would go so far as to say that if any seats are to be reserved anywhere, if there is to be any element of positive discrimination in the legislative arrangements proposed by the Minister after the referendum, this positive discrimination should apply to that part of the electorate who are Irish citizens, who live north of the Border and who are graduates of third-level institutions in that part of the island.</P>
    <P>My amendment is put down specifically as an enabling one.  It does not force the Minister to do anything.  It does not force him to extend the electorate to include the graduates of Queens, the NUU or the Northern Ireland Polytechnic.  But it does make it possible for him or for any other Minister for Education so to do if he thinks that it is a good idea.  In his reply to this matter yesterday the Minister was very brief, he simply said that he could not accept it.  We want better reasons than a flat denial because the terminology that I have adopted is clear. There is any manner of argument about the constitutional status of this, that and the other.  Surely the use of the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in an Act, or even in our Constitution, is not capable of misinterpretation or misunderstanding.  It would plainly cover everything that the Minister <Col N="1210" /> wants to do in the short-term in relation to institutions in the Republic of Ireland. It would enable him to do anything he wanted to do, obviously with the agreement of the institutions and of the graduates of the institutions concerned in the North of Ireland, at any future date.  It does not tie his hands in any way.  It lays the foundations for another bridge towards the North.  I urge him to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the idea behind Deputy Horgan's amendment.  I accept that there must have been an element of positive discrimination in favour of the graduate body of Trinity College in the allocation of three seats, although the numbers changed over the years.  In fact, the NUI grew away in numbers from the University of Dublin.  In so far as the disproportion was designed to be a nod in the direction of what was then called the minority, it was defensible. The decision on the allocation of seats on the election to the Seanad is a decision for this House and it is not before the House at the moment.  Deputy Horgan's amendment raises this matter indirectly.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Horgan's thesis is that by allocating three to 1,000 in one case and three to 40,000 in another we were making some kind of a nod in the direction of the North, his thesis is not sustainable because of the change in composition of the student body in Trinity College.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I said&mdash;and I regard it as of some importance&mdash;that we should encourage students in the Six Counties to continue to look towards Dublin for university education.  We must not forget that many students in the NUI are from the Six Counties.  There has been a tradition that both the University College of the NUI and Trinity College of the University of Dublin have attracted many students from the North.  For participation in the election to the Seanad, the best approach would be to encourage their coming in at least as large numbers as they have been coming over the years.</P>

      <P>The right approach is to try to attract more students.  In the context of continuing university representation with graduate electors, they will be participating in the political life of the country.</P>
      <P>Up to 1948 the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; was used.  Since then the word &ldquo;State&rdquo; has been used.  However worthy the motives that prompted Deputy Horgan to put down the amendment, I regret I am not in a position to accept it.  We had the same kind of debate when we were dealing with the NCEA Bill, which is still before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on the NCEA Bill I expressed concern that one of the qualifications for membership of the council is residence in the State.  I believe that restriction is very retrogressive and does not establish a generosity of spirit towards people living in Northern Ireland.  I have sought a change in the attitude in respect of membership of the council, especially in the membership of councils involved in educational matters.  We have an opportunity of bringing together under the Bill experts from the North and other countries.  That aspect of the Bill is currently under discussion.</P>
      <P>The same narrowness of mind is being maintained in the Bill.  I agree with Deputy Horgan that the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; should be used.  This word is used in the English translation of Article 4 of the Constitution.  The use of the word will allow a more liberal attitude to participation in the political, social and cultural affairs of the whole of Ireland by people living in the North.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan's amendment has a generosity of spirit with which I agree.  I support it without reservation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We really need to cudgel ourselves, not only inside this House but outside it, into different ways of thinking about the North.  We really need to have <Col N="1212" /> what one could describe as more all-Ireland thinking.  What my amendment is designed to do is simply to help create a general atmosphere of openness towards the North and to make it possible for this or any future Minister for Education to take appropriate legislative steps in the wake of an improvement in the relationships between the two parts of our island, to give substance to a basic educational link.</P>
      <P>It is true, as Deputy Kelly says, that of course there will always be people from the North coming down to the South to our educational institutions but that, with all due respect, is not the answer that the Minister claims it to be to my amendment.  I was interested in passing to note that, although he referred to the change of terminology in 1948 or thereabouts, he did not go so far as to say that there was a major constitutional objection to the use of the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in this context.</P>
      <P>In relation to what Deputy Collins has said I should point out of course that I am not even suggesting that this could be used to extend the franchise to people living, for example, in Northern Ireland. If this legislation is passed or if the referendum is passed by the people without this amendment we will have a situation whereby somebody who has graduated in an institution in the Republic, whose entitlement to vote may indeed be somewhat questionable because of some misunderstanding about citizenship, who may no longer be living here and who may be paying his taxes, in the words of the late Deputy Seán Lemass, to any other Exchequer, will be entitled to vote for a Member of the Oireachtas even though he lives in Kuwait or Bangkok, whereas the Minister for Education is shutting off from himself the possibility of giving a graduate of Queen's University who lives and works in Dublin the same rights.  That is all I am asking: that he should give himself the possibility of making that kind of right available in Ireland to graduates of Irish educational institutions.</P>

      <P>For the reasons that I have mentioned I am not able to accept Deputy Horgan's amendment.  I do not <Col N="1213" /> think that the situation is as grave as Deputy Horgan says.  The points that we made already are of numbers increasing and, as Deputy Kelly said, in some instances of students from the Six Counties coming to our southern universities. The link, which I am afraid is not as strong as it used to be, between Trinity College and the mainly minority group, though perhaps not exclusively, is still there.  Student numbers are down and they are certainly down proportionately. All these factors still keep us very much in touch with the Six Counties.  I do not think that giving the vote to the graduates at Queen's University&mdash;and of course that would mean the New University of Ulster as well&mdash;would be particularly significant in this regard and I do not think that the graduates of Queen's University have ever expressed any wish that they should be included in the electorate of Seanad Éireann.  In fact I would like to see the day when the vast majority of them would be clamouring for such power to elect to Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point that there has not been a clamour from the graduates of Queen's University or indeed from any educational institution in the North for this kind of right to representation as part of an electorate. Would the Minister not agree that this is precisely because we have over 50 years here developed a bifurcated way of thinking about ourselves&mdash;they up there do not think about us down here and we down here, although we may make noises from time to time, do not think very much about them up there.  This is designed simply as a gratuitous gesture.  It is not even a very substantial gesture, but it leaves it open to the Minister for Education to do or not to do anything he wants to.  But as an initiative it is without the kind of horrendous political overtones that many initiatives from the South carry and are seen as carrying by people in the North and it is on those grounds that I recommend it.</P>

      <P>If there is one area where there has been considerable cross pollination and continual contact it has been at the university level.  I must say <Col N="1214" /> that in other spheres of our national life the contact and the interchange of scholars and friendship between scholars in the Six Counties and in the south of Ireland has always been kept up but only in that particular field, so it is not a good field for Deputy Horgan to concentrate on.  There has been no kind of academic partition ever.  There have been external examiners, interchange of lecturers and so on over the years, and it is highly desirable that the universities should set a headline in this regard.  But, as I said already in all this, a decision about the allocation of the six Seanad seats and so on is a matter for legislation to come before the House and there will be a full opportunity to discuss it then.</P>

    <P>This amendment is only a drafting one. There is no substance in it other than the <Col N="1215" /> question of usage.  I do not put it any further than that.  Perhaps the Minister would advise us having had a chance to think about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how the words &ldquo;invoked to prohibit&rdquo; carry the kind of sinister overtones Deputy Kelly attributed to them on Second Stage yesterday.  Admittedly he established some kind of guilt by association in a later Article of the Constitution where they are associated with the activities of the ministry of Defence but I am convinced that the words are the most suitable ones in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that there is anything sinister about them.  I am only trying to establish&mdash;and it is not easy to establish despite all the bowing and scraping towards it and the lip service paid to it&mdash;that the Constitution is not a model of elegance when it comes to clear and standardised usage.  It would be a great deal worse but for the passage of this Bill, but it is not a model even as it stands.  In regard to the Constitution, as a classicist like the Minister will recognise, there ought to be something of a lapidary simplicity about it so far as that can be achieved.  That extends also to paying attention to the details of usage and not using a form of words which is quite at home when talking about preventing soldiers from commandeering vehicles to using that usage in a quite different setting which is intended merely to convey the permission or, as the case may be, lack of permission for the national legislature to enact this or that kind of measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said yesterday that my amendment will make no change in substance, but I regret to see the linguistic usage of the Constitution being taken so lightly.  I believe that this will be the only instance in either the 1937 Constitution or its predecessor of 1922 in which the expression &ldquo;invokes to prohibit&rdquo; will be found in connection with outlining a situation in which the Oireachtas is not free to legislate on a certain matter.  That has not ever been used before and it is another tiny dimension of messiness <Col N="1216" /> which I hoped this Minister above all would have been willing to avoid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kelly that a lapidary simplicity would be desirable, but the more contact I have with legal people and legal things the less I believe that a lapidary simplicity in anything is achievable.  What puzzles me is the word &ldquo;invokes&rdquo; which is a liturgical word to a great extent.  A few years ago if you took out &ldquo;invoke&rdquo; and &ldquo;vouchsafe&rdquo; you would not have any prayers left.  The word &ldquo;prohibit&rdquo;, which is a mild kind of verb, should not be interpreted as somehow or other getting from an association with another Article of the Constitution any kind of&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash;sinister meaning. I do not think that Deputy Kelly meant &ldquo;sinister&rdquo; in a sense, but &ldquo;guilt by association&rdquo; would be a more appropriate term for me to use.  He seems to imply that because they are used later on in an Article of the Constitution in the context of the activities of Defence they should not be quoted here in the groves of academia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister is willing to spend a few minutes talking about a point of usage, there are a few phrases in the Constitution in which the Oireachtas, although declared to be the only authority with powers to make laws for the State, is, nonetheless, prevented from legislating in a particular area or in a particular way or with a particular object. I will give three instances.  They are not the only three but they are the most prominent.  Article 15.4. says:</P>
      <P> 1º The Oireachtas shall not enact any law which is in any respect repugnant to this Constitution or any provision thereof.</P>
      <P>Article 15.5. says:</P>
      <P> The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.</P>
      <P>Article 41.3. says:</P>
      <P> 2º No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" /> In all these cases the prohibition, so to speak, or barrier placed on the legislative freedom of the Oireachtas, which otherwise is total, is expressed by means of the verb &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  These are cases in which the Oireachtas is being kept out of a certain field.  In Article 40.1., which I mentioned yesterday, the Constitution declares equality of citizens before the law, but it says:</P>
    <P> This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.</P>
    <P>That is the converse.  That is not something which prevents the Oireachtas from legislating but an expressed permission for the Oireachtas to legislate notwithstanding something else. That is what we are trying to achieve here.  We are trying to express a permission for the Oireachtas to legislate in regard to the dissolution of universities which are named notwithstanding that they continue to be named in this rather inelegant way to which Deputy Collins drew attention.</P>
    <P>Here are four instances, three in which the Oireachtas is specifically kept out of a certain area and another in which the right of the Oireachtas to be in that area is asserted notwithstanding a general statement which might appear to call that right into question.  Since we are adding another member to that class, the usage which we employ here ought to conform so far as is possible with the usage of the other instances.  The model or headline for the usage which the Minister has chosen seems to come from a quite different area, namely, the question of prohibiting the acts of the military in doing things like carrying out summary executions or court martials, submitting civilians to court martial and barricading roads with commandeered vehicles and so on, which might be characteristic in times of war or armed rebellion.  I mention this merely as a point of usage.  I suppose that I would not get very far with the Minister for Fisheries or the Minister for Defence on a point like this but I would hope that the Minister for Education would at least give a quiet hearing and think about the <Col N="1218" /> point I am making.  He has to go to the other House and possibly he will see the matter in another way between now and then.</P>

      <P>I express concern at the speed with which this Bill has been pushed through this House.  It is a Constitution Bill the effect of which will be seen when subsequent legislation is introduced affecting the Seanad representation from the higher institutes of education.  We should have given more time to consideration of the contents of the Bill.  Longer time should have been allowed for discussion on each Stage of the Bill.  It is with reluctance that I acceded to considering the Bill within the time scheme.  It is unfortunate that the House should be put in the position that <Col N="1219" /> we have to consider a Bill affecting the Constitution with that kind of constraint. The Bill was drafted in a messy fashion and the words used are not as clear as I would like them to be.  We should strive for clarity and simplicity in any constitutional amendment and in any Bill dealing with the Constitution. This has not been achieved in this legislation and I consider that unfortunate. My colleague, Deputy Kelly, an eminent expert in the field of constitutional law, also made that point.</P>
      <P>I acceded to the request to discuss the Bill within the time restraint because I wanted to allow the Government the opportunity of putting the matter to the people in July.  At the same time I must stress that I am not happy with the phrasing of the Bill or the manner in which the Constitution may now be changed.  That will happen not in a simple way but in a complicated manner which may be open to a challenge in the courts of law.  That would be most unfortunate. If that happens the Government must accept the blame because they did not allow us time to consider each stage of this Bill separately.  They did not allow a time gap between the various stages to give us an opportunity of considering the effects of the various stages of the Bill.  That was unfortunate but I hope the Seanad will be afforded some more time to consider this legislation.</P>

      <P>In this Bill we are introducing a new element into our democratic structure in relation to the Seanad, the widening of the franchise which has traditionally been used to elect six Members of Seanad Éireann from university graduates to at least potential graduates of other third-level institutions.  This, it must be stated, whatever reservations we may have about details of the Bill or of the length of time it has taken to pass it, is a positive step and one which is to be welcomed.  It may be objected that the idea of special representation for educational interests in a House of the Oireachtas in this matter is an anomaly in this day and age&mdash;Deputy Kelly <Col N="1220" /> made comments along those lines yesterday&mdash;but if that is the case it is really only because the Seanad itself is something of an anomaly being an indirectly elected House which reviews and has certain powers in relation to the legislation passed by this House, a directly elected Chamber.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that once one has established in legislation and in the Constitution the idea of an indirectly elected House the question of how those indirect elections should take place is, ultimately, a matter of opinion and of politics rather than a basic principle.  It should be no more surprising, wrong or irrelevant that 40,000, 50,000 or 60,000 graduates of institutions of higher education should have the right to elect six Members of the Oireachtas than that one person, the Taoiseach, should have the right to nominate 11 of them.  I have pleasure in welcoming the principle of the Bill and I look forward with a keen interest to the legislative instrument with which the Minister will eventually propose to flesh out the details of this principle.</P>

      <P>I have very little to add to what I said yesterday in regard to this amendment except to reiterate that registration for VAT purposes is hardly relevant to this section.  In any event, registration for VAT purposes is no guarantee that evasion will be combatted.  There was a notorious case reported in the newspapers a couple of months ago and if I quoted the heading of one of those newspapers Members would have an idea of what was involved.  The heading read: &ldquo;Unemployed man with 37 aliases got £55,600 in VAT con&rdquo;.  Admittedly, any system is open to abuse.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The point I am making is that registration for VAT is no guarantee that the purposes of the section will be achieved.  However, in the course of the discussion on this matter Deputy Barry referred to his amendment No. 35a which relates to the Second Schedule and was designed to make clear that &ldquo;qualifying work&rdquo; includes insulation on its own, not merely as part of a general house improvement.  As I indicated to the Deputy, that was the intention behind the provision and I believe that the Bill as drafted achieved that but it might be helpful to him if I indicated now that I propose accepting that amendment when we reach it.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Minister in what he said concerning my amendment.  This morning I came across a document issued by accountants concerning the Finance Bill and they state that as far as they can see the purpose of <Col N="1222" /> the section is not so much to give relief to taxpayers as to try to tax people who are evading tax.  If a very rigid tax evasion system is to be operated by inspectors of taxes, then the benefit of this section will be lost.  It is to try to introduce a new system whereby people can avoid having to fill up too many forms that I suggested this amendment.  I considered it worth while because it would simplify the situation.  I do not think, as some Members mentioned, that it goes far enough but it would be a help in the creating of more employment, the desired objective of section 6.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): When I read about this allowance in the newspapers I thought it would be of some value to householders. However, when I looked at the section and studied the Second Schedule I came to the conclusion that both were much ado about nothing.  On further consideration I have come to the conclusion that in one sense it is a cosmetic exercise by the Minister for Finance trying to outdo his colleague, the Minister for Health, who seems to be an expert in giving concessions and leading people to believe he is doing something for them, when it does not cost anything.  Here the Minister for Finance has outscored the Minister for Health.  While he gives the impression that the object of this section and the Second Schedule is to give relief from income tax it is a provision that will collect income.  Also while he gives the impression that this is a section that will make it cheaper for householders to have house repairs carried out, in fact it will make it dearer.  There is no doubt about that.  The relief this section affords consists of the householder being able to charge the labour content of repairs carried out to his house, between £50 and £500, in other words, £450, against income tax.  But in order that the householder may obtain such relief the man who is doing the work for him will have to become registered under this Bill and will have to get a form of registration. He will then become a registered <Col N="1223" /> person and a list of such registered persons will be exhibited some place or another, I think it is the inspector of taxes office, for all and sundry to see.  In addition the householder claiming relief for the repairs must make an application to the Inspector of Taxes, must disclose the name of the registered person, that is, the man who is doing the repairs, when of course the Revenue Commissioners will get after him.</P>
      <P>Furthermore under paragraph 3 (1) of the Second Schedule there is the provision that if a householder applies for relief from income tax for having repairs carried out to his house he must expose himself to a visit by an authorised officer of the Minister for Finance who will inspect his house, the repairs carried out and generally what is going on there. Indeed I do not know what use will be made of any information an authorised officer will get when he carries out such inspection.  When I read that provision in the Schedule it prompted me to ask whether the same checking-up procedure is imposed on a businessman who repairs his house and who can claim the cost of such repairs against his income tax liability.  Does such a businessman have a visit from one of the Minister's authorised officers to see what is going on?  It is an outrageous invasion of the privacy of a man's dwellinghouse under the pretence of granting relief from income tax.</P>
      <P>Furthermore the confidence usually vested in an inspector of taxes is deliberately breached in this Schedule by giving him the right to communicate with the Social Welfare people in regard to the activities of the registered officer. If the Minister for Finance and his officers have reason to believe that perhaps there are nixers going on then, as I see it under this Schedule, they have the right to investigate because the Table specifies:</P>
      <P> Person to whom information to be given (1) Any officer of the Minister for Social Welfare authorised by him for the purpose of this paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the effects of this section and the <Col N="1224" /> Second Schedule, under which people are supposed to be granted some relief from income tax, will be the invasion of a person's private dwellinghouse to see what is going on there and to hand any registered person over to the Social Welfare authorities for prosecution. That is it in a nutshell.  Does the Minister really believe that the effect of this provision will be to make it cheaper for people to have repairs carried out to their private dwellings?  Does the Minister really believe that these men doing small jobs are going to register; does he really believe that? I do not think he does; I believe he is more sensible and down to earth than that.  Surely the Minister does not believe that such men, who are not liable to income tax&mdash;some of them may be liable for small amounts; I do not know; &mdash;will register.  Its effect will be that before I have a man paint my house I must ask him if he is registered; if he will get me a form on which I can claim income tax when I will never see him again; he will disappear.  Then I will have to go and get a large contractor, a big man who is registered, who is maintaining an office with an accountant and so on to do the job, when he will charge me twice as much.  I had a painting job done a few years ago.  Beforehand I got two estimates, one for £450 and another for £275.  I asked an architect friend of mine how much he thought the job should cost and he told me £600.  I told him then of the two estimates I had received, when he told me that the man who had quoted me £275 would do a first-class job.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the effect of this measure is either purely cosmetic and valueless to the householder or, if he tries to avail of its provisions, it will cost him more to get his house done than if he never bothered claiming income tax relief.  Further it will drive the small man, the small contractor who knows his job, a painter, carpenter or general tradesman, out of business because he will not register.  Then the people who want repairs carried out will have to engage a large contractor who will have management staff and offices to maintain, when it will cost them far more.</P>
    <P>I notice that under paragraph 5 (1) of <Col N="1225" /> the Second Schedule the person must be registered.  I wonder whether the same procedure will apply as for the registration of sub-contractors because over the years it was practically impossible for a sub-contractor to become registered.  A lot of my time was taken up making representations on behalf of people who wanted to be registered as sub-contractors but they would not be registered unless they had a residence or had established themselves as people of substance.  On a fair reading of paragraph 5 I do not think that stringent procedure will be applied because, if a person is registered in the State, the inspector of taxes must register him.  Certainly the registration procedure in regard to sub-contractors was a nightmare; a person could not be registered unless he had a workshop and management set-up.</P>
    <P>I do not want to drag out this section or to be offensive to the Minister but I say to him: &ldquo;Thank you for nothing&rdquo; because it is no good.  Of course, it may be good from the Minister's point of view.  It may catch people who are evading tax but the Minister should say that.  He should say that it will be an offence for people to engage in work unless the Revenue Commissioners are notified.  It is less than candid to do this under the pretence of giving a benefit to householders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were discussing an amendment yesterday the Minister and I were having a bit of a barney about the question of jobs.  I was accepting for the purpose of the argument that this particular section will create some jobs and that all the jobs that it will create will not solely be in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. The Minister challenged me on the degree to which I would find the job creation aspect of this proposal satisfactory. I then referred to the question of full employment.  He replied very reasonably that nobody could expect this particular proposal to create full employment.  Nobody expects that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That remark was in relation to the Deputy saying that this section would not create enough jobs.  I said <Col N="1226" /> enough in relation to what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is drawing attention to my use of the word &ldquo;enough&rdquo;.  I would define &ldquo;enough&rdquo; in this context quite simply by saying that there is no way in which I can see this section will create enough jobs to justify all the ballyhoo that has gone into it and all the unnecessary effort that will be expended by the Revenue Commissioners and anybody else associated with the administration of the system which is being set up under this section.  That is what I meant basically by enough jobs.</P>
      <P>It seems to me to be a pathetic scratching of the surface of the unemployment problem.  If it has any real effect in catching people who do nixers and who do not want to pay the tax on the nixers they do, that is all right.  I believe that will be its major effect and its effect in the area of job creation will be marginal.</P>
      <P>In relation to the scheme there are two points which need to be made.  The first is that whatever the putative value of this scheme to the creation of employment its value to the householders who avail of it, if they can weave their way through the tangled web of complexities, is directly related to their marginal tax rate.  We will have a situation in which the benefit to those with money and perseverance can be quite substantial. Unless I am wrong in my calculations the net benefit to somebody on the top marginal rate of 60 per cent in relation to the amount of money expended on labour between £50 and £500 of any authorised improvement works will be approximately £270.  That is £270 he would have had to pay in income tax which he is not paying now because he is paying somebody £500 for labour.  In other words, over half the cost of his expenditure on labour up to that £500 limit will be given back to him by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is generous indeed when we compare it to the average wages which most people get.  I suggest it is generous out of proportion to the work force which it is hoped to bring about.  I would like to contrast the generosity here with another scheme which is also under the control of the Minister for Finance and is not <Col N="1227" /> widely known but with which it is relevant to compare it.  I refer to the scheme for giving relief to taxpayers in relation to allowing them to set off against their taxable income amounts paid by them for medical expenses.  Under an earlier Finance Act it is permissible for a man with a family to set off certain medical expenses against his taxable income.  The irony of the situation we are dealing with today under this section is that a man with a family has to lay out twice as much in actual hard cash before he pays a penny that he can set off against his taxable income than a well-off person who decided to employ a couple of people or a small contractor to build an extension for him.</P>
    <P>Under this section a person who wants to build an extension will start getting tax relief when he has expended £51 on labour on his extension.  If he were the father of a family outside the limit for eligibility for a medical card by a most miniscule amount, he would have to spend £100 of his own money before he starts paying any money that can be set against taxable income.  If the Minister was to be reasonable and rational in this regard he should at the very least have extended the other concession upwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, Deputy, it would not be relevant.  It is relevant to mention it in passing as a comparison but it would not be relevant to debate it on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am about to conclude. Is it more relevant for a man to be given twice the effective tax concession to build an extension to his house than to look after and pay for the health of his family?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The relief for certain expenditure on residential premises is only for labour costs.  The Minister should extend this to materials.  The cost of materials for renovating, reconstructing or improving a house are so substantial that they deter people from carrying out improvements to their houses.  The Minister should consider bringing in an <Col N="1228" /> amendment to include materials.  There is mention in the explanatory memorandum about insulation work and the Minister has included it in the schedule. We are going through an energy crisis so the Minister should give full relief for the cost of buying materials for insulation work.</P>
      <P>Another point of importance relates to electrical fittings.  I suggest that the Minister should consider giving relief in respect of expenditure incurred by householders in having their premises inspected with a view to ensuring that electrical fittings are up to standard. During very bad storms last winter a number of accidents occurred throughout the country because of faulty electrical fittings and the Minister would be well advised to consider allowing inspection costs against income tax.</P>
      <P>I should like to know whether the period in relation to these schemes of allowances will be continued after 5 April 1980, if they will be continued in future years.  People are nervous about completing application forms in respect of loans, grants and so on because they fear that if they put dates on them they will be tied to those dates.  That is why so many people come to public representatives and others for assistance in having such forms completed.  I should like the Minister to let me know if this scheme will be continued after 1980 so that people will know next year if they will be entitled to benefit under the scheme.  Perhaps the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will not agree with me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Since April, because of the postal dispute, people have been unable <Col N="1229" /> to communicate by post with the Revenue Commissioners and I should like to know what the Minister has in mind in this section.  May such documents be delivered by hand?  This is causing problems because when people visit the tax offices, or indeed any Government office, they find they will not be given notice forms by an inspector of taxes or other officials.  How will applications made under this section be treated if the postal dispute drags on for a long time?  The House is entitled to be told what the position is in regard to the delivery of notices, certificates and so on.</P>
      <P>Many people who carry out grant-aided improvements to their homes should be given tax allowances in this respect even if they do the work themselves if they can satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that it has been carried out properly.  Why must a householder employ a third party to do the work?  I appreciate the Government's policy in relation to employment but I suggest that people should be allowed to do the work themselves provided they give prior notice to the Revenue Commissioners.  Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out the undesirability of having to bring in bigger contractors, apart from the fact that such people have very little interest in doing small jobs.  This scheme is directed towards such contractors, leaving out the smaller people.</P>

      <P>It is confined to registered contractors and there are many small builders who are not registered.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick on the reference by the Revenue Commissioners to the Department of Social Welfare, he may be interested to learn that amendment No. 39 withdraws that paragraph because it is not considered to be appropriate <Col N="1230" /> to a Money Bill.  If it had been considered appropriate I would not have had any hesitation in leaving it in, and I am surprised at the Deputy's complaint about it.  What is the use of people talking about tax evaders if they object to what, I suggest, are reasonable measures to tackle evasion?</P>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Fitzpatrick on reflection would want to be known as one who was trying to aid and abet people who are sponging.  That is the only word you can use for people who are, in fact, working on the side and drawing social welfare.  They are only one category of tax evaders.  We are tackling all of them I hope.  A number of steps have already been taken in this Bill, and amendments contain further measures for doing that.  I do not think we should distinguish between tax evaders.  All of them have to be tackled.</P>
      <P>On the question of an inspector or an authorised officer inspecting the taxpayer's house where the work has been carried out, this is an enabling provision. I would visualise that it would happen very rarely.  Contrary to what Deputy Fitzpatrick said, or at the very least implied, it happens also in the case of business people, not on a very frequent basis but on some occasions.  I see no objection or difficulty about it.  Deputy Fitzpatrick grossly exaggerated the alleged invasion of privacy.  After all, when people apply for grants&mdash;and in many cases here they will be getting grants&mdash;there is an inspection system. Does Deputy Fitzpatrick regard that as a gross invasion of the privacy of the individual?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I said this is an enabling provision.  I do not anticipate that there will be an inspection on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners except in a very rare case.  That will happen normally only where there is reason to believe some kind of an attempt at evasion is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of inspecting work done where a grant is being given or a tax allowance is being given does not seem to <Col N="1231" /> me to be unreasonable.  If Deputy Fitzpatrick has been able to stomach it, as he was for a long time as a Deputy and as a member of Government, it is a bit late in the day for him now to start pleading that the possibility of an inspection of work done&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This is a different type of inspection.  This is a Nosey Parker trying to see how much more tax he can extract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very interesting reaction from Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I will not elaborate on it unless he wishes to elaborate on it.  I regard the provision that in cases where the Revenue Commissioners consider it necessary&mdash;and only in such cases&mdash;an inspection can be carried out of work done in respect of which a tax allowance is claimed as a reasonable provision, and certainly as no invasion of privacy.  If it is an invasion of privacy, so is an inspection by a local authority, or by the Department of the Environment in respect of a grant for such work.</P>
      <P>It is true, as Deputy Horgan said, that the extent of the benefit under this section depends on one's marginal rate of tax.  That is true of any allowance under the tax system.  It is one of the difficulties we face.  It is not easy to overcome it, but I would remind Deputy Horgan that in an earlier section where we tried to overcome it in regard to child allowances by reducing the child tax allowance and increasing the social welfare children's allowance&mdash;the cash value of that, so that people not liable for tax would get the full amount and people liable at a low marginal rate would get more than those liable at a high marginal rate&mdash;there were numerous complaints from Deputies in the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  I cannot recall whether Deputy Horgan complained.  I do not think he did, but complaints were made about it on behalf of his party.  I do not pretend that this is a matter easy of solution, but it is not good enough to be blowing hot and cold on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point raised by Deputy Enright <Col N="1232" /> about including materials and insulation as well as labour in the allowance was dealt with in considerable detail on the amendments which have been disposed of and I do not propose to go back over them again.  I want to reiterate that the purpose of this section, which is experimental, is to encourage the creation of employment.  An allowance in respect of materials would be contrary to that purpose and would be open to abuse. The primary purpose is the creation of employment and that is why the allowance is in respect of labour only.  It is introduced on an experimental basis and, therefore, I cannot guarantee that this provision will continue beyond 5 April 1980.</P>
    <P>If it is successful, it will certainly be continued.  The odds are, and experience would suggest, it is likely that even if it is not a clearly outstanding success it could be and would be argued that it has not had a fair chance and should be extended further.  While I am not prepared to give an absolutely cast-iron guarantee that it will be extended beyond 5 April 1980, I can say all the indications are that it would be so continued.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright referred to the difficulties arising from the postal strike. As I will indicate in a moment, already a number of applications are in despite the postal strike.  I for one am not prepared to assume that the postal strike will go on for ever.  The difficulties Deputy Enright referred to will sort themselves out in due course.  If they do not, the matter can be looked at again.  I have no reason to assume these difficulties will not be overcome.  In making the point about giving the allowance to those who carry out the work themselves, Deputy Enright adverted to the reason why that is not provided for, that is, that the purpose of the section is to help to create employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason was partly the creation of employment, but people on very small incomes might be able to carry out the work at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, but the purpose of this section is not merely to give a tax allowance but to help to create <Col N="1233" /> employment by giving a tax allowance. We must not lose sight of the purpose of the section.  I was somewhat mystified by Deputy Enright's statement that this would exclude small builders.  In the main the kind of work covered by this section will be carried out by smaller contractors.  The Deputy was correct in saying that many large contractors would not be interested in this kind of work.  When he says they are not registered, he is jumping the gun a bit.</P>
      <P>After all we are only discussing the section now.  It is a new section, a new provision, and it is open to anybody engaging in this type of work to register in the future even if they are not registered now.  I do not think there is any good reason for anticipating that such people will not register.  If they are engaged in this type of work those who choose not to register are free to make that decision.  That is no reason for saying we should alter the section and allow such people to engage in this kind of work in such a way that the householder can get the tax allowance while they, for reasons which must be suspect, refuse to register with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Horgan about medical expenses relief, the position is that the relief is given in respect of medical expenses exceeding £50 for any one qualified person, or £100 where there is more than one qualified person.  Criticisms have been made of the section to some extent but largely in relation to the amendments and concerning the complicated nature of the provisions, particularly in the Schedule.</P>
      <P>There are two possible approaches which may be taken to a scheme of this kind.  The first is to provide a simple, straightforward scheme which will enable the genuine householder and taxpaying contractor to get the benefit of the scheme without any trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately when this approach is taken the unscrupulous will immediately set out to abuse the scheme and secure the maximum tax relief whether or not any work is carried out and, at the same time, ensure that the contractor will not pay tax on his profits.  When this happens <Col N="1234" /> and when the extent of the abuse eventually comes to light it then becomes necessary to tighten up the scheme and to bring in a number of safeguards to protect the Exchequer. This is what happened in the case of the sub-contractor's system which was introduced in 1970.  It was based on a relatively straightforward system of certificates which were designed to enable genuine sub-contractors to receive their payments without deduction of tax.  The system then became subject to abuse to an alarming degree, involving the use of photographic copies of certificates, the handing around of certificates from sub-contractor to sub-contractor and the production of forged certificates.  The result was the loss of millions of pounds to the Exchequer and a more tightly drawn up scheme had to be introduced in 1976.</P>
    <P>The second approach to the kind of problem we are faced with here is to acknowledge that unless safeguards are built into the scheme it will be abused and will have to be amended later.  I suggest that the logical approach is to build in the safeguards at the beginning and protect the Exchequer from the unwarranted loss of revenue that will occur otherwise.  This is the approach taken in this section in relation to the present scheme.  In drawing up the scheme regard had to be had to previous experience in relation to sub-contractors. As I said yesterday, while it is true that the material in the Second Schedule presents a formidable appearance, probably three-quarters of it is designed to prevent evasion and will not affect the genuine householder claiming relief or the taxpaying contractor.</P>
    <P>For example, paragraphs 7 to 11 which Deputy McGreevy particularly criticised relate first of all to the withdrawal of a certificate of registration of a contractor in a case where he was not entitled to it and, secondly, penalties for false statements and so on.  These paragraphs will not be of any concern to the genuine contractor.  Deputy Barry contrasted the procedure under the section with that which applies in relation to life insurance relief which he said was granted on foot of the taxpayer's claim. The Deputy may have overlooked the <Col N="1235" /> fact that when a person takes out an insurance policy the company supply the policy holder with a statement setting out particulars of the policy which the taxpayer forwards to the inspector of taxes to obtain relief.  Generally the relief is continued from year to year without further verification.  It must also be remembered that if the need arises to check any aspect of the policy, for example, whether it has been discontinued, the insurance company will supply any information required.  This is unlikely to be the case where a check would be carried out in relation to relief claimed under this section if the proposed safeguards were omitted since the contractor who had done the work and who probably had given a receipt would not be available either to supply information or indeed, to have himself assessed in respect of tax.</P>
    <P>I might illustrate more clearly the kind of problems that would arise if we approach the introduction of this scheme on the first basis I outlined; in other words, making it as straightforward as possible, waiting for the abuses to occur and then bringing in amendments to correct it.  Basically that is what happened with the sub-contractor's scheme when it was introduced in 1970.  The actual tax receipts which arose there averaged £1 million per year during the first four years.  During the six years to 1976-1977, the yield averaged less than £3 million a year and the highest figure was £7 million in 1976-1977.  Following the tightening up of the scheme in 1976, the tax received for the first full year of the operation of the tightened-up version of the scheme&mdash;1977-1978&mdash;was £16 million, more than double the receipt for 1976-1977 and more than five times the average in the previous six years.  I hope these figures will give Deputies some idea of the likelihood of evasion in this general area and what is almost certain to happen unless adequate safeguards are built into the present system.</P>
    <P>The House may be interested to know that up to the present 330 householders have made application for the relief and but for the postal dispute it is likely that <Col N="1236" /> the number would be increased by four or five times.  Obviously the problem about forms concerning which Deputies were worried has not in any way inhibited these householders.  Up to the present inquiries have been received from 33 persons wishing to be registered for the purposes of the section.  They would be contractors.  Again, but for the postal dispute it is clear that the number would be much higher.</P>
    <P>In regard to the forms, there may have been some misunderstanding by Deputies.  I do not blame them for it because the wording of the provisions can lead to this but I should like to explain briefly to the House how it is envisaged that the scheme would operate. Supplies of the printed form will be given to registered persons and to the National Manpower Agency.  When a householder engages such a person he will be given the form by the registered person.  It will be filled in and the registered person will complete the last part of it.  This form, which details the work to be done, will be sent to the inspectors of taxes who will then forward a claim form to the householder on which he can claim his tax relief.  Once the inspector sends the claim form to the householder, that is a protection for the householder because whatever happens afterwards between the Revenue and the contractor there will be no difficulty for the householder.  When he completes the form to claim relief he will get it and no argument will arise because of some difficulty between the Revenue and the contractor.  In other words, that will establish the householder's right to claim this relief provided the work is carried out and so on.  Also it will ensure that the householder, before the work is commenced, has established that the person doing the work is a registered person and that the householder will not find himself, having had work carried out and perhaps having paid for it, being told by the Revenue Commissioners that he is not entitled to this relief because the contractor was not registered.  It will avoid that difficulty and is a protection for the householder.  When analysed, I suggest that the provisions are not as formidable as they may appear.  I repeat that the main degree of formidable  <Col N="1237" /> requirements in relation to this, the main sections of these are related to combating evasion and will present no problems for the genuine householder and genuine contractor for whom the operation of the scheme should, I believe, be relatively simple and straightforward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the arguments we have had on this section and the Schedule to it could have been avoided if the wording had been clearer, if what the Minister has said in the last few minutes had been said.  I was certainly under a misapprehension as to how the claim could be made and how the householder could do it.  If what the Minister has explained now was explained to everybody else I think ordinary householders might benefit from it.  The Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Association of Certified Accountants, the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants sent a submission to the Minister on 8 May in which they said in relation to this matter that the relief would be extremely difficult to obtain and confusion would arise with taxpayers having work undertaken with a registered contractor who may not be in possession of a valid certificate at the time the work is carried out.  They said that the legislation as written appeared to be more directed towards getting people within the tax net than with giving relief to taxpayers.  It was suggested that an undue burden of proof was put on the taxpayer for the amount of relief involved.  If the Minister's explanation in the past few minutes is correct and if the relief is to be got as the section says only through registered contractors and if the only obligation on a householder seeking relief is to get the necessary form which evidently the registered contractor will have in his possession as a permanent part of his bookkeeping arrangements, that simplifies the matter very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not at all clear from the section or the Schedule that this is so.  Despite the fact that the Minister said, I think, that more than 300 had already applied, I believe that many people including the three bodies I have mentioned are under the impression that I was under, that the relief had to be claimed through the <Col N="1238" /> person doing the work, not through the person seeking the relief.  There is a very large element of tax evasion provision in the Second Schedule, and I do not accept from the Minister that, because a very different scheme for different reasons in 1970 was drawn in such a way that many people sought to evade tax under the sub-contractors' scheme, this would necessarily happen now.  If the Minister had accepted my amendment last night about people who were already registered for VAT&mdash;because they are registered they are known to and on file with the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;and issued the forms to those persons, much of the trouble might have been avoided.  I cannot remember what the new level for VAT is but I think it is £1,800 in a two-month period; I cannot remember the limit above which one must be registered for VAT but it is reasonably low.  The vast majority of contractors are already registered for VAT.  If the Minister had accepted that amendment we would have saved a lot of trouble, given the explanation we got this morning.</P>
    <P>The speeches made last night about the emphasis on catching tax evaders rather than creating jobs are justified when one considers the Schedule to section 6 and an amendment issued yesterday, amendment No. 31a, which puts in a whole new section six weeks after the Finance Bill was first published.  This is two pages long and again it appears to be directed at tax evasion.  Taking those things together I consider the speeches here this morning and last night on tax evasion are justified.  We are now only on section 6 of the Finance Bill which is pretty long and involved and we have not very many hours left to debate it.  I understand it must be finished next Tuesday night or that agreement has been reached to finish it on Tuesday night&mdash;is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan</i>): In my opinion this section and Schedule will not work in regard to the small contractor or tradesman.  I know enough about human nature and people in general to know that these people simply will not register.  Every contractor who will be involved in this scheme must register from now on. There is no such thing as some of them being registered as was the case in the past; all of them must register under this section.  The Minister has told the House that he has had 35 inquiries from contractors who wish to be registered.  I would not expect the Minister to give the names of these people but I feel that perhaps they are some of the fashionable contractors around the city whose boards we see outside houses advertising the fact that they are carrying on work there.</P>
      <P>Why must a person register for income tax purposes for this particular job while it is not universally obligatory on everybody to register for income tax?  If I start up as a medical practitioner I do not have to register for income tax.  If I start a small shop I do not have to register or if I start up as a dog trainer.  I could go on with a multitude of examples; practically every trade, occupation or business you think of is free from registration.  Why pick out this particular trade and impose registration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about sub-contractors. That was an entirely different operation because there you were dealing with huge sub-contracts involving large sums of money.  Here, we are only concerned with small jobs like painting, repairs and so on.  This seems to be making an exception.  I hold no brief for tax dodgers but I believe that if you are after one class of tax dodgers you should get after every one of them. If we are spending a lot of money going after the person who abuses the social welfare schemes and gets a few pounds he should not get and which he spends in the local shop, you should also go after <Col N="1240" /> the tax dodger on a large scale who perhaps is avoiding paying thousands of pounds which he does not spend in the local pub or village or even in this country.</P>
    <P>I always thought that since the PAYE system of taxation was introduced it was morally necessary to have a fair system of taxation.  Since one section are caught in a vice-like grip, it is essential that everybody should be.  This is a Mickey-Mouse operation which will not work. The people who do these kind of jobs are small operators and local tradesmen.  I would be interested to hear at the end of the year how many people who were not already on the books registered with the tax inspectors as a result of this operation. Surely the Minister is not concerned with people who are already making returns.  The small businessman will get out of the business altogether. The Minister may or may not like that but it is a factual commonsense approach to this.</P>
    <P>If section 6 and the Schedule were printed on the application forms and the attention of householders drawn to them, the number of forms that would be returned would be very few.  If this was an operation to get after huge tax dodgers, that would be all right.  But it is introduced as a scheme that will give employment and will benefit householders.  In my opinion it will not give employment and it will make it more expensive for people to get their houses repaired if they want to avail of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the questions I asked the Minister was the length of time this scheme would be in being.  He said it is an experimental scheme that will last for a period of 12 months and, if successful, may continue.  Two months have elapsed since this scheme was first mentioned.  Only 330 people have applied.  Surely there are more than that number of people improving their houses at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people have started work to improve their houses or have work completed before they send in their application forms and obtained the registered forms for income tax allowances will <Col N="1241" /> they be granted the allowances on their income tax?  Where I am living we have neither phones nor post.  Some people pay their income tax to Athlone, more pay it to Kilkenny and still more to Dublin.  They have no way of communicating with the inspector of taxes. Those people will not be able to work the scheme if they are held up until the postal dispute is over and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs go back to work.  I presume such people will be allowed to complete the work where they are being hampered by the postal dispute. The scheme lasts for 52 weeks and approximately eight or ten weeks have elapsed.  How long more will these people be prevented from applying for their allowances?</P>
    <P>Some 330 people have applied for this benefit and are entitled to deduct any figure over £50 that shall not exceed £450.  Why have only 330 people applied? A further effort will have to be made to ensure that people are aware of what is happening and can communicate with the relevant inspector of taxes in order to obtain their forms.  I am sure the Minister realises that this scheme, with the employment potential he envisages, is being held up at present.  Only 330 people have applied and perhaps all the others are millionaires&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that a permanent health benefit <Col N="1242" /> scheme in order to qualify for tax relief under the section in respect of contributions made under it must be approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  This is to prevent abuse of the relief which is being provided by the devising of tax avoidance schemes.  Conditions of approval are not being set out in the section at this stage.  Before doing so it would be advisable to have discussions with <i>bona fide</i> companies who operate this type of benefit scheme so that restrictions which might impinge on genuine policies would not be introduced. Time permits of this approach since the section will not come into effect until 6 April 1980.</P>

If there are problems arising in regard to the Revenue Commissioners disapproving of a scheme which people thought should be approved of I have no doubt that this would be brought to the attention of the Minister and the Opposition so that in that way it would be brought before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;in pursuance of a policy on which he paid premiums which he could not claim against tax.  I am trying to cater for somebody who would be getting benefit in the overlapping period between the non-tax benefit and the tax benefit so that the person who is actually drawing benefit at that stage will not <Col N="1245" /> have to pay tax after the section comes into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are variations on this which render the decision on the right way to do this rather difficult.  For example, a benefit which first became payable on 5 April 1980 would be exempt from tax on the grounds that the contributions made to the scheme had not been allowed for tax purposes. However, if we assume that the benefit continued for some months, would it then be the position that the benefit became chargeable on the grounds that in respect of the later period contributions to the scheme were allowable?  If it is argued that in these circumstances the benefit should continue to be exempt, how can one justify to another beneficiary whose benefit commenced in June or July 1980 that his benefit must be taxed since his 1980 contributions to the scheme were allowed as deductions?</P>
      <P>The only way these anomalies could be removed would be to provide that no benefit would be taxed unless it became payable under contract entered into after the commencement of the section.  As a corollary there should then be no relief in respect of deductions except in cases where a person entered the scheme after 6 April 1980.  This would deprive existing contributors of the proposed relief and would be unjustifiable.  The only fair and practical means of the dealing with the matter is the one provided in the section, which is that as from the commencement of the next tax year contributions would be allowable as deductions and benefits would be chargeable.  I do not pretend that this is a perfect solution, but of the various possible solutions it is the fairest and most practical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the problem about the man who starts drawing benefit in June or July of next year.  That is obviously an anomaly which it is difficult to cater for.  I am talking of the person who has insured himself for two-thirds of his salary of about £100 a week who is now drawing £66 in benefit having paid premiums for ten or 15 years.  If he gets sick at the end of this year he goes into benefit at two-thirds of his salary.  If his marginal taxable income on 5 April <Col N="1246" /> next year is 35 per cent, that £66 being two-thirds of what he would consider his normal wage will now be down by a further 35 per cent, so that where he thought he had insured himself and was willing to sacrifice the tax benefit for two-thirds of his salary, he will now be receiving less than half his normal wages from 5 April next.  As far as I am aware, during the duration of a long-term illness one does not pay premiums.  I am trying to cater for a person in that category.</P>
      <P>I would not know what to do about the man who is theoretically in the same position, who has paid his premium this year, has not been allowed to charge it against tax and who gets sick in July or August of next year.  We have to take that situation as it is.  At least he knows about the situation and may be able to adjust his policy to cater for it.  When this Bill becomes law it will probably be brought to his attention by the insurance company and he will probably be able to adjust his policy.  But the person who becomes sick in the reasonably near future and will still be sick on 5 April next could find himself receiving less than half his salary although he believed he had been insured for two-thirds of his salary.</P>

      <P>I can see the difficulty the Deputy outlines.  It seems that, no matter which way one approaches this, certain difficulties will arise; but what is provided in the section is probably the only fair and practical means of dealing with it.  However, I will undertake between now and next week to have a look at the particular problem to which the Deputy has referred.  He is primarily concerned about someone who is in receipt of benefit at the commencement of the next tax year and has not been allowed a tax deduction in respect of contributions which would have been paid in this tax year and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Interest amounting to £2,400 as proposed in this section services borrowings of £16,500 at 14½ per cent and if we take this amount as being a loan of 90 per cent, which may be generous, it represents a purchase price of about £18,500 or taking into account the £1,000 grant for first-time buyers, a purchase price of £19,500.  Income tax relief on £2,400 to a taxpayer in the 45 per cent tax bracket amounts to £1,080. This amount of relief, together with the <Col N="1248" /> savings resulting from the abolition of rates, represents a substantial subsidisation of home buyers out of public funds. I regard the figure of £2,400 as reasonable.  It is also consistent with the policy that building societies should require applicants for mortgages not exceeding £16,000 to furnish certificates of reasonable value and should limit mortgages exceeding £16,000 to 20 per cent of available mortgage funds.  There is a consistency about this approach. Having regard to the figures I have quoted, the £2,400 is a reasonable figure for the ordinary taxpayer and householder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P> In page 10, before section 9, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9.&mdash;For the year of assessment 1979-80 and any subsequent year of assessment, relief shall be given in respect of any payment of rent by an individual of an amount not exceeding £4,000 for any year of assessment.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want for people in rented accommodation the same benefits which are available to home owners.  A person purchasing his house by means of a mortgage, bank loan or local authority housing loan can claim relief on interest to the extent of £2,400.  I should like to see the same facility afforded to people renting houses.  I do not disagree with the Government's policy of having as many people as possible living in and owning their own houses, but there are many people who for various reasons will never own their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are thousands of civil servants in Dublin who are paying extraordinarily high rents for very inadequate accommodation. They do not envisage being in this accommodation all their lives and regard it as a transient phase through which they must pass while they attempt to amass the money to build or buy their own homes in Dublin or elsewhere.  This <Col N="1249" /> applies to civil servants, bank clerks, gardaí and many others.  If they had the capital and the inclination to buy or build their own homes at the age of 18 they would immediately be able to claim against the interest they would pay. Many of us do not think in terms of acquiring a home until we envisage getting married.  Many of the young people to whom I refer are heavily taxed and have benefited least from the tax measures introduced in the past few years.  If they were given the same tax concession as people buying their own homes it would help them to save money and more quickly acquire their own properties.  It would help them to put aside more money and to reach more quickly the stage where they could own property.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances there might be a much greater tendency to build houses rather than office blocks as an investment. I am not sure whether there is provision for income tax remission in the case of office blocks.  Going back 50 years and even longer terraces of houses were built as investments but there were social as well as fiscal reasons for changes in that pattern.  It might not be a bad idea to get back again to that position. If people were building the houses by way of investment properties we could be assured that the quality would be good and that the environment in which the houses were built would be maintained.</P>
    <P>One way in which we could encourage the building of houses for reasons of investment would be by encouraging people to rent accommodation. I do not think that the proportion of home owners on the Continent, for instance, where most of the accommodation is rented, is nearly as high as it is here.  The reason for that may be that it is profitable on the Continent to build houses for renting.  I expect that the lowest price at which a three-bedroomed semi-detached could be bought today would be £18,000 and that an economic rent for such a property would be in the region of £60 per week.  Very few young couples, whether they be employed in the civil service or in the Garda or anywhere else could afford that level of <Col N="1250" /> rent.  Last week the Minister told us that the average industrial wage is only about £84 per week.  Therefore, unless a young couple could benefit by way of a tax remission on their rent they could not afford the level of rents that would be asked for.</P>
    <P>If there were available a pool of potential renters of houses perhaps it would help to increase the numbers of houses being built.  I do not think any Government up to now have considered the possibility of tax remissions in respect of rent on houses.  My amendment would relate only to rents in respect of main residences.  It would not apply to the renting of a second house or to a seaside residence, for instance.  It would apply to people who for one reason or another find it necessary to rent.  Such a concession would help also in regard to young people being able to put aside enough money with which to build their own houses in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister to consider this amendment.  There are many people who must avail of rented accommodation.  In many cases, too, people are transferred from one area to another in the course of their employment and they usually have to pay substantial rents for accommodation.  The relief being sought in the amendment would be of much help to a big number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past there were many companies involved in the area of property who provided houses on a rental basis.  In this city houses were built on areas comprising acres and they were built to good standards.  They provided accommodation for people who were not in a position to purchase houses.  If we could encourage those people involved in property to build houses for renting, we would be helping to alleviate the housing shortage.  I should prefer to see houses rather than flats being built for renting. Obviously, the capital involved in any such scheme would be sizeable but the rents would be substantial and the situation would be alleviated for the tenants if there were a provision for substantial income tax relief.  There are far too many people who are in the area of building <Col N="1251" /> and speculation for the quick turnover, whereas if developers were building houses on the basis of letting them there would be a long-term project involved.  I expect that there would be a ready market available if people were to form public companies and invite subscriptions for investment from private individuals. There arises the question of why people would not invest moneys in other types of institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The report referred to was prepared by the National Co-ordinator for the Education of Travelling People, who works in close collaboration with my Department.  The report estimates that there are 3,000 travelling children attending school with sufficient regularity to ensure that they can make some real progress&mdash;an increase of about 300 on three years ago.  It states that the quality of the education these children are receiving has improved immeasurably owing to the provision of extra remedial teachers, special classes and pre-school classes.</P>
      <P>Because of the nature of this problem it is difficult to obtain accurate figures of the number of travelling children who are not attending school.  Nevertheless the report deduces that there are about 3,100 travelling children who do not attend school or who attend it only on a very irregular basis.  These are mainly the children of unsettled families still living by the side of the road.</P>
      <P>My Department, in co-operation with the National Council for the Education of Travelling People, will continue to press on vigorously with the provision of educational facilities for travelling children on the lines recommended by the Commission on Itinerancy.  As the commission pointed out, however, progress will depend to a large extent on the success achieved by the community at large in settling the remainder of travelling families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of travelling children are enrolled in second-level schools and are making reasonable progress.  The number is expected to increase as the effect of the special provisions made at primary school level in the <Col N="1266" /> context of the report of the Commission on Itinerancy come to full fruition.</P>
      <P>In general, my Department are currently engaged in receiving policies in respect of special education for children who can be catered for in ordinary post-primary schools, provided special facilities and services can be made available.</P>
      <P>Within this review, the needs of the children of travelling people of this age range are also being considered.  It is my policy to cater as far as possible for the needs of these within the framework of the ordinary school system and to resort to the establishment of special schools only where the alternative would not appear practicable.  This does not, however, exclude the establishment of special classes.  My Department will, therefore, be willing to entertain proposals from vocational education committees and other school authorities with regard to meeting the educational needs of travelling children in the 12-15 age range, and to consider such proposals within the framework of special educational provision.</P>
      <P>The question of training centres for teenage travellers is a wider matter in so far as it involves both vocational education committees, which have responsibility for continuation and technical education and An Chomhairle Oiliúna (AnCO) which has wider responsibilities in training for industrial occupations.</P>
      <P>At present, training facilities for young travellers either exist or are at an advanced planning stage in some 15 centres throughout the country.  I understand that there is one such centre in Coolock in North County Dublin which is being assisted by the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee, and plans are being examined to extend the work of that centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention that the majority of these centres have been started through voluntary initiative, principally by the National Council for Travelling People, and that they are being supported and aided to an increasing extent, both by vocational education committees and AnCO, working in co-operation with each other.  Such initiative will continue to have the sympathetic co-operation of <Col N="1267" /> my Department.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may help the Deputy by indicating to him&mdash; inadvertently four of the objects subject to these conditions were loaned by the National Museum to the Bishop Museum, Honolulu, Hawaii, without the consent of Trinity College.  The objects were returned to the National Museum on 13 February 1979.</P>
      <P>I will give the Deputy some information I have here in respect of what is described as the Cook collection.  There is no such entity as the Cook collection. Some items removed from their native territories were given at various dates and by various donors to Trinity College. These collections, together with other specific material, not associated with Cook, were transferred to the National Museum on three dates, 1882, 1885 and 1894.  Some were given outright, some were deposited and some, especially the 1894 group, were given on loan.  The 1882 group of objects included Peruvian and Mexican pottery, Chinese musical instruments, some ethnographical objects and a collection of insects.  The material was presented to the National Museum apparently without condition.  If the Deputy would indicate to me what of that collection is still causing him concern I will be happy to get that information for him.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will also appreciate that apart from the actual provision of those machines there was, until quite recently, a problem of space in the library.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the principal Department is the Department of Finance because, in respect of the provision of £500,000, it was conditional on certain developments in the subsequent years.  We were promised money for four years.  I was not happy with the scale of money being made available for the second, third and fourth years and I thought it prudent to negotiate with the Department of Finance so that I might get a better deal from them.  I also had to have consultations with the Department of Labour.  In the main, the Department of Finance are the Department with which I have been having my major consultations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in stating that the implication from the Minister's reply is that this scheme will run for at least four years?  Surely the Minister can tell the House at this point, even though the final details of this scheme may not have been arranged, who will employ those youth development officers?  Will it be the Department of Education directly, or the VEC?  What agency does the Minister see as the effective employment agency for those people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is very difficult and it would be unwise to see all this happening in any one area.  My Department are empowered to have employed a number of youth development officers.  I would not like to be absolute in the matter of the agencies.  As far as I am concerned, we should be given the opportunity of <Col N="1280" /> directing the employment of those officers into the areas where they are most needed.  I am sure it will be appreciated by the House that the best way to employ some of those would be through some of our voluntary bodies and perhaps the best way to employ others would be through some of our sporting organisations.  An organisation like the Amateur Boxing Association might possible be considered as an appropriate employer.  It would not be to the best advantage of the employment if we were to channel them all through one particular agency or vehicle.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 18:</P>
    <P>In page 10, before section 9, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;9.&mdash;For the year of assessment 1979-80 and any subsequent year of assessment, relief shall be given in respect of any payment of rent by an individual of an amount not exceeding £4,000 for any year of assessment.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy P. Barry.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We were discussing income tax allowances and reliefs for people who are paying rent.  If this new section were inserted the allowances would be increased to an amount not exceeding £4,000 for any year of assessment.  I was endeavouring to outline to the Minister the benefits which could accrue from increases in allowances for people living in rented accommodation.  I was also endeavouring to outline the position of people who were considering building houses for renting.  If these reliefs were granted, people might be encouraged to provide housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of young married couples are unable to provide their own private housing.  Corporations and Councils have long waiting lists.  If reliefs of this nature were provided, people would be encouraged to rent accommodation.  If rented accommodation were provided, <Col N="1295" /> more people would be looking for rented accommodation.  Private individuals might consider forming companies, acquiring land and providing houses, as has been done successfully in Dublin in the past by some property companies. Substantial numbers of people would invest in a company which had as its objective the provision of houses for renting.  The company could be quoted publicly and the houses could be provided.  This would have the merit that the tenants could obtain income tax relief.  It would also help to alleviate the serious housing problem.</P>
    <P>On the whole, a scheme of this nature would have a great deal of merit.  It would ease the problems of pressures on building socities for loans, pressures on local authorities for loans and pressures on insurance companies for loans.  It would create a fund and a method for providing houses which would be of benefit to everybody.  It would encourage in a progressive and positive way the building of a good type of house and this would be of benefit to everybody in the long run.  It would cost the Exchequer a very small amount of money and it would have very beneficial consequences.  For these reasons I would ask the Minister to consider the amendment sympathetically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>A provision for a reduction for income tax purposes in respect of rent paid for residential accommodation would have to cover, first, rent paid in respect of privately owned houses, secondly, rent paid to local authorities for houses and flats and, thirdly, rent paid to owners of private houses let in flats, or bedsitters, or whatever.  While the figures on which to base an estimate of the cost of such relief are not readily available, it is possible that the cost could be of the order of £50 million.  If a reduction of that amount in the yield from income tax could be tolerated, it is likely that many people would consider it would be more appropriately used to remove from the tax net a number of lower paid workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of rent paid to local <Col N="1296" /> authorities for houses and flats, in most cases if not all, there is a substantial degree of subsidisation.  It would be difficult to reconcile that with a tax allowance in so far as it was not based on the economic rent.  I am a little mystified by the case made by Deputy Barry, and perhaps to a greater extent made by Deputy Enright, who appeared to be saying that the acceptance of this amendment would lead to companies, and perhaps even co-operatives, getting together and investing in the provision of further rented accommodation.  Inherent in that seems to be the idea that this would happen because people could afford to pay higher rents if they were getting a tax allowance.</P>
    <P>Basically what the Deputies seems to be saying is that rents should be higher in order to encourage the provision of more rented accommodation.  It is an arguable case, but a number of people might argue on a different basis from that put forward by Deputy Enright and Deputy Barry.  It may be that this amendment is based on an assumption that it is anomalous that a house buyer can get income relief on the interest up to £2,400 on the money he borrowed to acquire an asset, whereas a tenant gets no corresponding relief in respect of rent paid for a similar property without ever acquiring any proprietary interest in it.</P>
    <P>Apart from the difficulties I have mentioned, particularly in regard to local authority housing, and apart from the question of cost, the removal of this apparent anomaly would give rise to another one, in that the rent paid by a tenant normally includes elements in respect of the landlord's expenses such as insurance, ground rent, repairs, and so on.  It would be very difficult to justify a relief to a taxpayer in respect of such expenditure which is effectively borne by another person.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of this matter explaining the background to it which are of historical and academic interest.  I will not detain the House by going into them unless Deputies want me to do so. They throw light on the development of this whole concept of giving this kind of relief, how it originated and how it developed.  I do not know that it will affect the basic position which is that, <Col N="1297" /> while it is difficult to estimate the cost of this, it would cost in the region of £50 million.  If one were prepared to contemplate that kind of expenditure is this the best way to expend it?  Problems and anomalies would arise if this proposition were accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be another interpretation on how it would be of benefit to house building, but I do not think this is the place to go into it.  I will come back to it again at another time.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18 (a):</P>
      <P> In pages, 10, 11 and 12, to delete subsections (1) to (5) and to substitute the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) (a) In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;employee&rsquo;, in relation to an employer, means a person employed by the said employer including, in a case where the employer is a body corporate, a director, within the meaning of Chapter III of Part V of the Income Tax Act, 1967, of the body corporate;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;employer&rsquo;, in relation to an individual, means&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i) a person of whom the individual or his spouse is an employee,</P>
      <P>(ii) a person of whom the individual becomes an employee subsequent to the making of a loan by the person to the individual and while any part of the loan, or of another loan replacing it, is outstanding, and</P>
      <P>(iii) a person connected with a person referred to in paragraph (i) or (ii);</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;loan&rsquo; includes any form of credit, and references to a loan include <Col N="1298" /> references to any other loan applied directly towards the replacement of another loan;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;preferential loan&rsquo; means a loan made to an individual or his spouse by a person who in relation to the individual is an employer save that a loan shall not be a preferential loan if it was made before the 6th day of April, 1979, and at the time the loan was made, the making of loans to persons, other than employees, for a stated term of years at a rate of interest which does not vary for the duration of the loans, formed part of the trade of the said employer and interest is payable in respect of it at the rate of interest at which the employer in the course of his trade, at the time the loan was made, made loans at arm's length to persons other than employees for the purpose of purchasing dwelling-houses for occupation by the borrowers as residences;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;the specified rate&rsquo; means the rate of 12 per cent. per annum.</P>
    <P>(b) For the purpose of this section, a person shall be regarded as connected with another if that person would be so regarded for the purposes of section 8 of the Finance Act, 1978.</P>
    <P>(c) In this section a reference to a loan being made by a person includes a reference to a person assuming the rights and liabilities of the person who originally made the loan and to a person arranging, guaranteeing or in any way facilitating a loan or the continuation of a loan already in existence.</P>
    <P>(2) Where, for any year of assessment, being the year 1979-80 or any subsequent year of assessment, relief is claimed by an individual by virtue of one or more of the following provisions, that is to say, section 496 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, section 76 (1) (c) of the said Act or paragraph 1 (2) of Part III of Schedule 6 to that Act, relief shall not be given for that year of assessment in respect of the part, if any, of the aggregate amount of interest <Col N="1299" /> in respect of which relief is so claimed on a preferential loan or loans that exceeds the amount determined by the formula&mdash;</P>
    <img websrc="/graphics/D.0314.1299.1.gif" />
    <P>where&mdash;</P>
    <P>A is £2,400,</P>
    <P>B is the aggregate amount of interest, other than interest on a preferential loan or loans, in respect of which the individual is entitled to relief for the year of assessment under any one or more of the aforementioned provisions,</P>
    <P>C is the aggregate amount of interest on a preferential loan or loans in respect of which relief is claimed by the individual for the year of assessment under any one or more of the aforementioned provisions,</P>
    <P>D is the amount of the interest which would have been payable on the preferential loan or loans for the period or periods for which the interest included in C was paid or payable, as the case may be, if for any rate or rates at which interest was paid or payable as the case may be for the said period or periods there were substituted the specified rate, and</P>
    <P>E is the amount of interest which would have been payable for the year of assessment on any preferential loan or loans in respect of which no interest is payable if interest were payable on the said loan or loans at the specified rate.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 9 gives effect to the proposal that the maximum amount of interest which ordinarily qualifies for income tax relief would be scaled down in cases where employees and certain directors enjoy the benefits of loans made at preferential rates of interest.  Examination of the section, as originally drafted, indicated that it would be possible for certain employees, particularly directors and senior executives of a company, to get around the provisions of the section and, accordingly, the first five subsections <Col N="1300" /> are being rewritten to close possible loopholes.</P>
    <P>A number of ploys could have been adopted which have too easily circumvented the provisions of the section. For example, a director or senior executive of a company could arrange with his company to have a substantial preferential loan divided into two parts. One part would constitute an interest-free loan and the second part would consist of a loan on which he could claim he was paying interest at 12 per cent. Under the section as it stands his interest relief would not be restricted because the interest-free loan would not be affected and the full amount of the interest on the other loan at the 12 per cent rate would be allowable.  The interest in question will now be restricted in accordance with the formula set out in the amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 18a is very technical.  Its purpose is to close loopholes that will probably come to light in any event.  There are a few points I wish to raise with regard to the amendment. The word &ldquo;employer&rdquo; is defined in the Minister's amendment.  In the case of a group of companies a loan for a senior executive could be obtained from a banking company within that group. That person would not be an employee of the company that gave the loan.  Will he be caught by this provision?  In the amendment there is the phrase, &ldquo;...a person shall be regarded as connected...&rdquo; but there is no reference to a connected company.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that point?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter when the loan was made.  The effect of that saver with regard to 6 April 1979 is to ensure that there will be no retrospective taxation.  It will only apply in the current year but it will apply to a loan whenever it was taken out.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it would help the Deputy if I gave an example.  If an employee has a preferential loan of £20,000 at 3 per cent and pays annual interest of £600 the calculation&mdash;I am saying this subject to correction&mdash;would be £2,400.  This is A minus 0 which is B, multiplied by £600 which is C, over £2,400 which is D plus 0 which is E and that would be equal to £600.  Incidentally, it is true that all preferential loans of £20,000 or less will remain unaffected by the changes being made.  I do not know if that helps the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it does.  As I see it, the new calculation procedure is to take account of a case where a person might have a preferential loan and also other kinds of interest to claim.  Is that the purpose of B and E which is 0 in the example given by the Minister?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barry did raise a point on it which I did not advert to.  The basic point made by Deputy Barry, which is covered in amendment No. 19, is that he suggests that to apply this section to a loan which was negotiated prior to 7 February 1979 is in effect to apply retrospection.  I do not accept that, because all that is being done here is to change the taxation method and the amount of tax being collected, but it is only being changed retrospectively in <Col N="1303" /> respect of previous tax years.  The fact that the loan was negotiated in some previous year is, I suggest irrelevant as regards retrospection.  To accept the proposition that this cannot or should not be done is in effect to say that one cannot change the tax structure in so far as it relates to existing remuneration. When I put it that way I am sure Deputy Barry will agree that that is not an acceptable proposition; otherwise you could never change, say, income tax rates except in respect of new income. Obviously that is not an acceptable proposition.  The principle behind this is not one I could accept but in practice any change being made applies only to the current tax year and subsequent years, not to any previous tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says.  I should not have used the word retrospective in that way and I suppose I should correct it.  What I was trying to do was to safeguard people who took up jobs where part of the benefit&mdash;not the direct salary but the perquisites&mdash;was that they would have a loan at a preferential rate.  Since 7 February they will not have loans at those preferential rates as a portion at least will be taxed.  It is a bit unfair to tax such people for that benefit when they could not have known when getting the loan that they would be taxed.  They had no guarantee it would not be taxed but I think that since 7 February anybody in those circumstances is entitled to be taxed because they would negotiate the loan on the basis that it would be taxed.  I shall not press the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy will accept that similarly anybody who took a job on a particular salary when there was a particular rate of income tax in force could not and would not attempt to claim that if there was a change in the income tax rate it was something that would have induced him not to take the job and therefore it should not be done.</P>

      <P>Yes, but I think he would seek to reimburse himself from his employer by the amount which the Government was taking which is what normally happens, whereas this might <Col N="1304" /> not necessarily be possible in the case of a loan and his standard of living would be reduced by that amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 13, after line 9, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that this section shall not operate to increase the tax payable by a married person where that person's spouse becomes entitled to unemployment benefit&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a new section and I think it is a totally new concept in Irish taxation whereby the following benefits under the Social Welfare Acts 1952-79, disability benefit, unemployment benefit, maternity allowance comprised in maternity benefit, pay-related benefit, deserted wife's benefit and injury benefit will all be taxed from 5 April next year.  This is a point I was making earlier this morning about insurance companies covering sickness, that if the benefit is taxed the subscriber should be allowed against tax the amount of his contribution towards the insurance.  The Minister will argue that in arriving at the figure of 4.4, allowance was made against the tax. There had been a tax allowance the previous year&mdash;this is an awkward way of saying it but I think the Minister understands what I mean.  I believe that to tax these allowances would make people worse off again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment is to ensure that people <Col N="1305" /> would not be worse off when this Bill is passed.  Some of these provisions appear to be fairly innocent and just when put into a Finance Bill.  Many people might argue that no matter what the source of the income it should be taxed. Possibly it would be hard to argue against that except for the fact that there are cases where one or other of the partners in a marriage had been working, was now sick and on disability benefit.  They might have used up their tax allowance if the other spouse was working at this stage and the couple would certainly be worse off next April compared with next March, when the new section comes into operation.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say what income will be got from this section.  I have asked some people who might be able to guess and while none could estimate exactly what the figure might be, they reckoned that the total of benefits paid out would be about £150 million in 1981.  If these benefits were taxed at the average rate of, say, 30 per cent the Minister could get between £40 million and £50 million in tax.  That is the amount of the tax which the Minister said, in relation to section 8, it would cost him if he were to accept the amendment which I put forward at that stage to allow people to claim their rents against tax.</P>
    <P>Before we could agree to this provision we want to ensure that people would not be worse off and that, as the amendment says, the effect of the section would not be to increase the tax payable by a married person where that person's spouse becomes entitled to unemployment benefit.  That would ensure, where one partner is on benefit and the other working, they would not have to pay more tax when this section is operating than they would have to pay previously.  I also want to know how much this will mean to the Exchequer in increased taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question now is one that he put earlier and I can answer it but I fear I missed the other question he put.  To deal with the first one, it is estimated that the yield in the income tax year 1980-81 would be of the order of £13 million, not £50 million or <Col N="1306" /> £40 million.

      <P>On that amendment, this proposal runs counter to the intention behind section 10, which is that social welfare benefits be treated as income for income tax purposes.  If by treating unemployment benefit as income for income tax purposes the taxpayer's taxable income is increased so as to make him liable to tax, it is only right that he should pay the tax.  When a person's spouse becomes unemployed the spouse's income is reduced by the difference between the spouse's wages and the unemployment benefit and the income tax will be correspondingly reduced.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Barry will have the effect of exempting unemployment benefit in cases where it is paid to a person's spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With effect from 6 April 1980 it is proposed that unemployment benefit will be treated as income for tax purposes in the same way as income arising from any other source such as investment income and so on.  There would be no more grounds in equity for granting a tax exemption in respect of unemployment benefit payable to a married person than there would be for exempting the benefit when it is payable to a single person.  For that reason I cannot <Col N="1307" /> accept the amendment but intend, on the section, to elaborate on the reasoning behind the whole section.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 13, after line 9, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) (a) The Revenue Commissioners may make regulations modifying the Income Tax (Employment) Regulations, 1960 (S.I. No. 28 of 1960), in their application to the benefits mentioned in Parts I and II of the Table to this section and the benefits mentioned in section 224 (2) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
      <P>(b) Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before Dáil Eireann as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by Dáil Eireann within the next twenty-one days on which Dáil Éireann has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 10 provides that certain social welfare benefits are to be taken into account for tax purposes.  This is being done by fitting them into the PAYE machinery.  The purposes of this amendment are to enable any modifications necessary to be made in the PAYE system so as not to hinder the smooth operation of the social welfare code or make difficulties for those who are entitled to benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment refers to the Income Tax (Employment) Regulations, 1960. These are the regulations made under section 127 of the Income Tax Act, 1927, which governs the PAYE system. The benefits which are mentioned in section 224 (2) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, are widows contributory pension, orphans contributory allowance, retirement pension, and old age contributory <Col N="1308" /> pension.  Under section 224 (4) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, these benefits are deemed to be emoluments to which Chapter 4 of Part V of the Act applies. They are liable to income tax and are subject to the PAYE regulations.  It is appropriate that they be included in the present amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section gives effect to the proposal contained in the White Paper <i>Programme for National Development, 1978-1981.</i>  In paragraphs 622 and 623, income from short-term social welfare benefits should be taken into account in assessing a person's tax liability.  As from 6 April 1980 the benefits listed in the section will be taken into account for tax purposes.  I have already indicated to the House the expected yield on this.</P>
      <P>The White Paper gave the background to this but serious anomalies had resulted from the practice of disregarding for tax purposes certain short-term welfare benefits.  These anomalies are likely to be exacerbated following on the introduction of the pay-related social welfare scheme.  For example, maximum rates of unemployment and disability benefits, that is, flat plus pay-related rates, would now amount to almost £55 a week for a single male and £65 a week for a married man.  As matters stand at present these payments are not regarded as income for income tax purposes and no tax will be payable, whereas a single person on this level of income from any other source, wages, pension or investment income, could be paying £10 a week in tax.  A married man whose wife was not working and who had no children with an income similar to his social welfare recipient counterpart could be paying almost £6 a week in tax.  It is difficult to justify, in a situation in which a person is working and earning the same kind of money that would now be available under the pay-related social welfare system to a recipient, that one would be paying £10 a week in tax and another £6 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that a suggestion <Col N="1309" /> has been made on a number of occasions in recent years that absenteeism has been encouraged by the fact that many employees receive almost as much in take home pay from unemployment and disability benefits, flat and pay-related rates, as are obtained in wages when working.  This question was examined by an interdepartmental working party which reported in January 1976.  As a result of these deliberations a scheme was adopted which, by and large, ensured that the maximum income of an unemployed person would not exceed 85 per cent of the after tax income he enjoyed in the period immediately prior to unemployment.  This scheme applied only to unemployment benefit at flat and pay-related rates.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed that a large element of disincentive on the part of many people to work is attributable to the problems caused by the payment of tax rebates in periods of unemployment allied with relatively high pay-related benefits.  These problems would be eased to a considerable extent if the relevant social welfare benefits were taken into account for tax purposes, which is what this section proposes.  There will be no liability to tax unless the recipient is in receipt of income or benefit exceeding the effective exemption limits for tax purposes.  These are: for a single person, £1,115 a year or £21.44 per week; for a widowed person, £1,185 a year or £22.79 a week; and for a married person, £2,230 a year or £42.88 a week.  As indicated, it is proposed to collect the tax through the PAYE system.  The commencement of the scheme has been deferred to the tax year 1980-81 to enable the necessary arrangements to be made by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The primary point that people have to grasp is that, without this section, you could have people who are working&mdash;with the same income as people who are in receipt of these benefits&mdash;paying, in the type of case I have mentioned, almost £10 a week in tax, or if a single person £6 a week in tax, and their opposite number in receipt of social welfare benefits with the same income and paying no tax.  As I said <Col N="1310" /> earlier, it is difficult to justify that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister has said regarding the purpose in bringing in section 10 which deals with the case of an unemployed person being better off tax-wise than a person working all the time.  We need this section. Perhaps in 1980-81, by the time this section comes into effect, as the Minister pointed out earlier, he could allow the total social welfare contribution as a fully allowable tax benefit against a person's gross income.  What I want to ask the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, may I interrupt the Deputy before he gets away from this point, and point out that, if that were to be done, it would mean a fairly substantial increase in the social welfare contribution, which has already been reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall discuss the matter in another way.  At the moment, when a person becomes unemployed, he gets his form P45 from his employer which shows his gross pay and his tax deductions up to that date.  Usually, after four weeks he applies to the tax office for a refund of tax by completing Form P50 as the allowance would have accumulated for the four weeks, so he would be due a certain amount of tax and that keeps going on to 5 April in the tax year.  Under the present system, if he gets a tax rebate for the time when he is unemployed he is reissued with a new P45 which is usually amended by the Tax Office, in most cases.  What now will be the position?  How will the system operate?  How will his employer know whether to aggregate the allowances forward?  I have another question, but I would like an answer to that one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated, the system will not operate until the next tax year. One of the reasons for that is that arrangements for its administration by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare, and between these two are being worked out. When these arrangements have been completed, they will be communicated to <Col N="1311" /> employers, instructing them how to administer the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can foresee difficulties as regards the operation of the system, but I am sure the Minister will be able to arrive at the right system.</P>
      <P>The second question revolves around section 10 (2):</P>
      <P> Amounts falling to be paid on foot of the benefits mentioned in Part 1 of the Table to this section shall be deemed to be profits or gains arising or accruing from an employment and, accordingly&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) tax under Schedule E shall be charged on every person...</P>
      <P>Take the case of a married man with a business the profits from which are taxable under Schedule D.  His wife as a Schedule E taxpayer, would pay tax under PAYE.  If the wife, halfway through the year, becomes unemployed and is entitled to unemployment benefit, or disability benefit, or whatever, on my reading of this section, if she went back to work during that year she would be caught.  If she did not go back to work until the new tax year, as their incomes are added together, Schedule D for the husband and Schedule E for the wife, she would avoid paying tax, whereas a married man on Schedule E, paying PAYE, whose wife is working and paying PAYE as well, would be caught under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that a wife, under such circumstances, would escape. The fact is that, if she is in receipt of these benefits, they will be deemed to be part of her income and will be deemed to be part of the husband's income in the normal way.  They will be assessed as such.  I am not quite sure if I understand the Deputy's point, but I think he means that because the wife is out for the rest of the tax year she will be, in effect, out of the PAYE system.  Perhaps I have not understood?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 488 (3) of the Income Tax Act 1967 has machinery with provision to facilitate proceedings in the High Court for recovery of income tax which is due for payment.  The section, as it stands, provides that a certificate by an inspector of taxes, stating that a particular amount of tax is due under an assessment which has become final and conclusive, is to be taken as evidence of that fact until the contrary is proved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section, however, does not cover the situation where an assessment is under appeal.  Where a taxpayer appeals against an assessment, he is required to specify the amount of tax which, in his opinion, is due, that specified amount then becomes the amount due for payment, <Col N="1313" /> pending determination of the appeal. The amendment effected by the present section will enable an inspector of taxes to give a certificate that the amount so specified is due and payable. Basically the position is that when the provision was made in the 1967 Act there was not the machinery that exists now under the appeal whereby one specified the amount thought to be due. Technically section 488 does not cover the present machinery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 14, after line 36, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment, the provisions of this section shall not operate so as to deprive any individual whose total rateable valuation in respect of all farm land occupied by him is between £50 and £60, of allowances in respect of the payment of rates which he enjoyed prior to the enactment of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are proposing to reduce the valuation threshold for income tax, and farmers who previously were exempt from income tax because <Col N="1314" /> they have not valuations in excess of £60 are now going to be liable for income tax if they have valuations in excess of £50. We are not objecting to the principle of this, although obviously there will be problems in relation to some farmers who may not have incomes of that scale.</P>
    <P>What is objectionable about the procedure being adopted here is that automatically once the valuation threshold is reduced the farmers in the area in question between £60 and £50 will lose their allowances against rates as well.  That is not contained in this Finance Bill but it was contained in a rather disingenously described Bill which was concerned with relief of rates and called the Relief of Rates Bill.  It was a Bill which said that as soon as the valuation threshold for income tax was reduced from £60 to £50&mdash;as in this case, and it could be reduced to nought next year&mdash;automatically all farmers in that category lost their allowances against rates as well, the primary allowance and the secondary allowance which they had.  This is very bad legislation. If the Minister wanted to reduce allowances against rates he should have brought in a Bill to do it and justified it here in this House instead of using this back-door method contained in the Relief of Rates Bill whereby, simply by making the change in the Finance Bill for income tax purposes, automatically the farmers lose the allowances for rates as well without any separate or special enactment.  That is the reason I put forward this amendment, in order to stop the Minister from doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment is not valid.  He is forgetting that under the 1978 Finance Act rates are allowed as a payment against income tax.  A person's threshold now drops from £60 to £50 and he loses the rates allowances if he is in a position of paying income tax but the full rates he is paying are allowed as payment of tax and effectively are regarded as income tax.  Therefore, it is not valid in all cases to say that he loses out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy was right to draw attention to the fact that farmers are entitled to set off their rates bill against their tax bill and not merely as an expense.  That is a special and unique dispensation.  Secondly, in so far as there is a liability on people to pay rates when they make a loss or when they have not a taxable income, whatever view one may take of that, that is not now.  That has always been so with regard to rates and this Bill is not changing the fundamental position in regard to rates.  That is another issue altogether. This is merely dealing with the income tax aspect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position is that the link between the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act and the Finance Act is as follows: the 1978 Rates Relief Act, <Col N="1316" /> which covers rates relief for the years 1978 and 1979, provided that rates relief shall not be available to those whose total valuation equals or exceeds the tax threshold for farm taxation.  The relevant threshold is the one applicable at 1 January in any year.  For example, the rates relief for 1979 cut-off point is £60 rateable valuation.  Section 12 of this Bill does not deprive anybody of any rates relief to which he might otherwise be entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the Deputy is making an assumption if he is saying that this section deprives anybody of rates relief to which that person would otherwise be entitled.  It is not doing so. There is a separate corpus of legislation dealing with rates relief on agricultural land.  The current legislation is the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Acts, 1939 to 1978.  It would not be right that the Finance Bill should be used to effect or prevent changes which should more properly be made through the medium of the Rates Relief Act.  The Government have already decided that the cut-off point for rates relief by way of the agricultural grant will be reduced to £40 rateable valuation from 1 January 1980. This was announced on 24 April 1979 as part of a package of taxation measures designed to bring in a yield from farmers in line with the yield from other sectors of the community.  A Rates Relief Bill which will provide reliefs for <Col N="1317" /> those whose total agricultural land valuation does not exceed £40 will be introduced in due course.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, from 1 January 1980.  If the cut-off point for rates relief were left at £60 rateable valuation for 1980, which seemed to be the aim of this amendment, rates payments by farmers in 1980 would be £40 million rather than £46 million and this would have the effect of reducing the overall tax payments by farmers in 1980 from the planned £100 million to £94 million.  I do not propose to accept the amendment, which would have that effect.  The yield has already been indicated as has the method by which it will be achieved and I do not propose to interfere with that as it is designed to bring the yield from farmers into line with that of other sections of the community.</P>

      <P>In this as in other matters, the Minister is following the entirely wrong line relation to farmer taxation. We on this side of the House support strongly the principle that farmers who make an income should pay a tax on it. But this section will impose a very significant increase on farmers in the amount of rates they pay and that will have to be paid whether they make an income or not.  The Minister's attitude in this is in line with his attitude on other taxes, the levy and the resource tax, both of which have also to be paid whether the farmer makes an income or not.  No section of the community should accept a system of taxation based on paying a share of income received.  This measure and the other measures introduced by the Government will be levied whether or not a farmer makes an income.  As such they are objectionable to the Fine Gael Party.</P>

It is now an open secret that the farming organisations were unable to agree on the method by which this might be done.  That is their business.  However, it is the business of the Government to devise a system which will produce the necessary yield. We have not said that this is the end of the road.  On the contrary, we have indicated that we visualise changes which would relate more to payment of income tax in line with income.</P>

If he or anybody else says that the system of farmer taxation should be income tax on the income of farmers and only that, it implies certain things.  First, it implies all farmers being liable for income tax on all their income.  Second, it implies no special arrangements for agriculture. These arrangements are important because agriculture is different from other sections of the economy.  The taxation system should reflect that difference.

That may be a popular thing to do in County Meath, but the Fine Gael Party ought to decide whether they are in favour of a yield from farming in line with the yield from other sections of the community.

The amendment is designed to change the income tax arrangements in relation to rates on agricultural land, not the rates arrangements which are the subject of a separate code.  As far as the income tax arrangements are concerned, this amendment was designed to raise the threshold for income tax purposes to £60 valuation when in fact the Government have announced that it will be £40 as from 1 January next.  I do not subscribe to the object of this amendment nor do I subscribe to the theories put forward by Deputy Bruton in support of it.  I find that theory lacking in credibility since Deputy Bruton, when he was in a position to do so, did nothing about trying to remedy the matter about which he now complains.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister asked a number of questions and it is my intention to reply to them.  The spirit of Deputy Bruton's amendment is to maintain the agricultural relief grant at £60, it having been reduced from 1 January 1978 to £75 and as from 1 January 1979 to £60.  The Minister has told us that it will be reduced as from 1 January 1980 to £40.  Several times the Minister posed a question to Deputy Bruton as to how he thought farmers should be taxed. I should like to tell the Minister that farmers expect to be taxed in accordance with the promises made by the canvassers sent out by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Fianna Fáil before the last general election.  Those canvassers told farmers that they were being bled white by the National Coalition, that they were grossly overtaxed and that if they elected Fianna Fáil to power the taxation imposed on them would be reduced. Those statements were not repudiated by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance.  Is it any wonder that farmers are up in arms when they find that they will now be subject to a resource tax of £70, must pay full rates and a levy of 2 <Col N="1322" /> per cent, regardless of income, another levy of .5 per cent in regard to the eradication of disease and their agricultural relief grant brought down to £40.

      <P>I cannot allow the Minister get away with the statements he has made.  The Minister has told us that £100 million must be collected in taxation from farmers and he has tried to devise a system to collect that amount.  I should like to know on what he bases that £100 million.  It appears that he is basing that figure on his own ignorance of the agricultural industry.  In 1978 the Minister gave a commitment to the agricultural community that they could have the notional system for a three year period but he wants to change that now. Where is the Minister's credibility and that of his Government?  That is a question the farming community are asking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know how the Minister stands legally in this regard having made such a commitment to the farming community.  Farmers engaged in developing their land on the basis that the notional system would operate for a three year period.  I should like to put the following example to the Minister: a <Col N="1324" /> farmer with a valuation of £60 on his 75 acres is now liable for income tax, for full rates, which he can charge against income tax, and the 2 per cent levy.  The levy will amount to £255, rates, £660, tax, £420, a total of £1,335 while his income would be approximately £6,400.  A man in the PAYE sector on a similar income will pay approximately £1,080 in income tax while the farmer would pay approximately £1,335.  Why is the Minister treating farmers as a separate category and subjecting them to a penal tax?  The Minister is putting farmers out of line with other sections of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get back to the amendment put down by Deputies P. Barry and Bruton, which relates to rates. We can go into all of the other matters when we are dealing with sections 12, 13, 14 and 15.  In answer to Deputy D'Arcy's question about the notional system, if he reads section 14 he will find the answer, because there the position is <Col N="1325" /> restored.  But everybody is forgetting about the rates.  Deputy Bruton's amendment overlooks them, but I have no doubt he knows the position quite well.</P>
      <P>The position now is that, if people have to pay income tax on their farming, their rates are allowable as a payment against that tax.  That is a far better position than obtained when farming tax was introduced in 1974.  From 1974 until the passage of the 1978 Finance Act a farmer who had to pay income tax had to pay rates also.  Let me give the example of the farmer with a valuation of £200.  He paid approximately £2,000 in rates and his income amounted to £3,500.  Therefore in total he paid £5,500.  Now, as a result of the provisions of the 1978 Finance Act, that farmer's rates are allowable as a payment against tax.  Therefore he pays only £1,500 in income tax because £1,000 is subtracted from his income tax liability, leaving him that much better off.  Prior to the implementation of the 1978 Finance Act rates were not allowable as a payment against tax.  Part of the IFA's cry against farming taxation in the period of the last Government was that rates should be regarded as a payment of tax.  We restored that position.  That was spelled out in the 1977 Fianna Fáil election manifesto and that is what we did in last year's Finance Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton well knows that farmers who have a taxable profit are, as a result of the Minister's amendment of the 1978 Finance Act allowing rates as a payment of tax, far better off, as my example illustrated and every Deputy on that side of the House knows.  Had the Minister's amendment of the 1978 Finance Act not been agreed then we would still have rates and income tax as they had obtained.  The only person who loses out now in having rates regarded as a payment against tax is a person who does not have a taxable income. Therefore I am opposed to the amendment because there is no justification for it.</P>

How <Col N="1326" /> many of those farmers will be taxable&mdash;they will not have the income&mdash; but still they will be liable for the full rate of £660, because rates are approximately £11 in the £ in most counties?  Such a farmer has no income under Fianna Fáil because they have reduced his income by 14 per cent in that there was a 14 per cent increase this year in the actual costs of agricultural production.  Therefore that man will not have any taxable income. What does one do with him?</P>

As from next year a farmer with a £40 valuation, who is a small farmer unless he is engaged in intensive agriculture, if he is married and has a few children will not be in the income tax net.  The Minister may take that as a fact.  Of course, if he was in intensive agriculture he could be in the net.  Let us suppose he is in cattle, milk or something like that, that he is a married man with three or four children and he had a poor law valuation of £40.  He is not in the income tax net.  But next year if rates are £12 in the £ he will be asked to pay £480 by the Minister for the Environment at the behest of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not fair.  I cannot give the exact rate that man would be paying at present, but with all the agricultural relief available to him he will be paying very little.  But in future he will be paying three times as much, because if the rate <Col N="1327" /> is £12 in the £, as it is in some counties, he will be paying £12 in the £ from £1 up to £40.  That means be will be paying to £480.  How can the Minister justify that? That is doing what the Minister and the Government said they would not do; it is passing over the rates on private houses to agricultural land.  The Taoiseach gave a solemn undertaking before the last election that that would not be done. That is indefensible.  It is a tax imposed on a person who is not in the income tax net; it is taxing a man who would not be liable to it, and I bitterly resent it.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to delay this but I do not want Deputy D'Arcy to pretend afterwards that he asked questions and that I did not answer them or was unable to answer them.  He wanted to know where will we get the £100 million. He should know by now that there are a number of ways of arriving at the figure.  Basically it is on the assumption of what is paid by other sectors of the community and then calculating what should be a comparable yield from the farming sector.  That is the proposition put forward by the Government, one which I think most people accept is a fair one&mdash;that the yield from farming and other sectors should be in line. Perhaps Deputy D'Arcy does not accept that, I do not know.</P>

      <P>The proposition is quite clear; that different sectors of the community, calculating on the basis of their profits, should pay a yield in line with other sectors of the community; that it should be in line from each sector.  That is the proposition I thought would commend itself to any fair-minded person.  It is quite clear it does not commend itself at least to the rural elements in the Fine Gael Party.  That is their business.  That is the proposition the Government have put forward, the one with which most people agree.  The calculation of how it has been arrived at has been explained on a few occasions and it would not be appropriate to do so here.  If Deputy D'Arcy has trouble about it, I will try to assist him at a later stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy D'Arcy asked about the notional system.  As Deputy McCreevy pointed out to him, a later section deals with that.  But, as far as the three year commitment on that was concerned, a later section does away with it.  As far as the retention of the notional system on a permanent basis is concerned, I do not think the Deputy knows this&mdash;and, if he does not, he may be interested&mdash;the fact is that the farming organisations having accepted the idea that the yield had to be in line with other sectors of the community accepted that there were various ways of doing that.  They indicated&mdash;I have to say, in fairness to them, without commitment&mdash;that among the methods by which this could be achieved was the dropping of the notional system.</P>

No farmer is liable for income tax who is not entitled to set up his rates bill against his tax bill.  That is the first thing.  That was not so when the Deputies opposite were in Government. Do the Deputies remember that they did not provide for that?  Do they remember, when they are shedding all those crocodile tears about the unfortunate farmer in the £60 to £70 valuation, who has no income so that he cannot pay his rates, that they did not do anything about him when they were in Government?  We are providing that no farmer is liable for both rates and income tax under this Government.</P>

      <P>Deputies opposite do not like to be reminded of what they did not do when they could have done it nor do they like to be reminded that they are trying to ride a few horses.  Quite apart from the view that might be taken by urban dwellers, it is my belief that farmers in general accept the proposition that there ought to be a fair share paid by them and that to achieve that the yield from farming taxation should be in line with the yield from other sectors of the community.  They know also that the ideal system which will produce that yield will not be produced overnight. They know there were opportunities available to have a system which might have been, perhaps, somewhat better than the one which is coming in and that those opportunities were not availed of. What is being done under this section and what is sought to be set aside by this amendment is to produce a yield from the farming taxation in line with that of other sectors of the community.  I must repeat that our objective is to have a yield from the farming sector in line with that of other sectors.  I believe that is a fair objective and I believe that most people, including farmers, subscribe to it.  I cannot and will not accept an amendment from the Fine Gael Party which is designed to ensure that we do not get a yield from the farming sector in line with that of other sectors of the community.</P>

      <P>In page 19, before section 21, but in Chapter IV, to insert the following section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;21.&mdash;Chapter IV of Part I of the Finance Act, 1977, is hereby amended by the insertion after section 25 of the following section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>  25A. (1)  For the purposes of this Chapter the number of employment contributions payable in respect of an employed contributor in a relevant period, or part of a relevant period, falling wholly after the 5th day of April, 1979, shall be equal to the number of contribution weeks in that period, or part of a period, for which the appropriate employment contribution or contributions in respect of that employed contributor was or were paid or would have been paid but for section 6 (1) <Col N="1334" /> (c)  (inserted by the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1978) of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.</P>
    <P> (2)  In this section &ldquo;contribution week&rdquo; has the same meaning as in the Social Welfare Act, 1952.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>This amendment by inserting a new section 21 in the Bill provides for the insertion of an additional section 25A in Chapter IV of Part I of the Finance Act, 1977.  That chapter contains the legislation governing the special 25 per cent rate of corporation tax for manufacturing companies which achieve a specified increase in employment.  The appropriate increase falls to be determined by making a comparison between the number of employment contributions payable in respect of a company's employees in a particular period and the number of such contributions payable in an earlier period of the same length.  This formula avoids distortions arising from part-time working, retirements and recruitments during the two periods.</P>
    <P>The introduction as from 6 April 1979 in the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1978, of the new system of fully pay-related social insurance contributions necessitates a technical amendment of Chapter IV of Part I of the Finance Act, 1977.  Under the previous flat rate contributions system, a contribution was due each week during the whole or part of which there was insurable employment.  As from 6 April 1979, contributions will no longer necessarily be made weekly, but will be made each time there is a payment of reckonable earnings.</P>
    <P>Thus, in respect of a person paid monthly, there will be only 12 contributions in a full year from 6 April 1979, instead of 52 contributions in weekly stamps in the previous year.  In addition, contributions in respect of an employee will henceforth cease when his reckonable earnings in a contribution year have exceeded the ceiling of £5,500. In order to compare like with like, the new section 25A provides that contributions payable on or after 6 April 1979, or which would be payable but for the ceiling of £5,500, are to be matched with <Col N="1335" /> the number of contribution weeks covered by the payments.</P>
    <P>Without this amendment a company which had achieved a 3 per cent increase in employment might not qualify for the 25 per cent rate of corporation tax for the 1979 period because the number of employment contributions payable in that period was not 3 per cent greater than the number of stamps in a preceding period.  It is largely a technical amendment arising out of the chargeover to pay-related social welfare.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 19, before section 21, but in Chapter IV, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;21.&mdash;(1)  The provisions of Chapter IV of Part I of the Finance Act 1977, relating to reductions in corporation tax for certain manufacturing companies carrying on a trade on 31st December, 1976 or commencing to trade in 1977 or 1978 shall continue to apply in relation to a 1980 period, with the necessary modifications in accordance with subsection (2), and shall apply also in respect of manufacturing companies commencing to trade in 1979.</P>
      <P>(2)  Section 24 of the Finance Act, 1977, is hereby amended&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (3):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(3)  The Provisions of subsection (2), except paragraph (c) thereof, shall apply, subject to the provisions of subsections (4), (5), (6) and (7) in relation to a 1978 period, a 1979 period and a <Col N="1336" /> 1980 period as they apply in relation to a 1977 period;&rsquo;</P>

    <P>&lsquo;(c)  In relation to a 1980 period&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  each reference in subsection (2) to 1977 shall be construed as a reference to 1980, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the reference in subsection (2) (d) to 103 per cent, shall be construed as a reference to 112 per cent,&rsquo; and</P>
    <P>(c)  by the insertion after subsection (6) of the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(7)  In relation to a 1980 period, a company may elect either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to have the financial year 1977 treated as the standard year for the purposes of subsection (2) (d) in relation to the specified trade carried on by it, and where such election is made, the provisions of subsection (4) (c) (ii) shall apply to the company as if the reference to 112 per cent.  Were a reference to 109 per cent., or</P>
    <P>(b)  to have the financial year 1978 treated as the standard year for the purposes of subsection (2) (d) in relation to the specified trade carried on by it, and where such election is made the provisions of subsection (4) (c) (ii) shall apply to the company as if the reference to 112 per cent. were a reference to 106 per cent., or</P>
    <P>(c)  to have the financial year 1979 treated as the standard year for the purposes of subsection (2) (d) in relation to the specified trade carried on by it, and where such election is made, the provisions of subsection (4) (c) (ii) shall not apply to the company.&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Bill of 1977 or 1976 a provision was introduced allowing people <Col N="1337" /> to have a preferential rate of corporation tax if they increased their employment and their turnover by certain percentages which the Minister has outlined.  The Minister amended it last year, or the year before, to delete the provision dealing with the increase in the turnover, but to maintain the increase in the employment to qualify for the preferential rate of corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>Since then, the Minister announced that from 1981 onwards the new rate of corporation profits tax will be 10 per cent.  To bridge the gap between the running out of this financial year, which will be 6 April 1980, and the commencement of the new preferential rate of 10 per cent in 1981, I am seeking to have the preferential rate extended until the new 10 per cent rate will become effective.</P>
    <P>It would be exceedingly helpful to business people who are trying to plan much further ahead than 1 January 1981 if they knew the precise details of how the 10 per cent will operate.  How will they qualify for it?  Will there be conditions attached to it such as are attached to the preferential rate of 25 per cent?  How will it relate to companies at present enjoying tax-free exemption for their exports?  How will they be treated? Apart from the bold announcement by the Minister that such a rate will apply in two years' time, no details have been available to the business community.  It would be helpful to the business community if they could have details of the new scheme as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I am trying to ensure in this amendment that the preferential rate of corporation profits tax introduced in 1977 will extended to the time when the new preferential rate comes into effect.</P>

      <P>The point raised by Deputy Barry in relation to the new 10 per cent does not arise directly on this section.  Some details have been announced, but the full and precise details have not yet been announced.  There are good reasons for that.  The Deputy may take it they will be announced in sufficient time for people to plan ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Barry is designed to extend for a further <Col N="1338" /> year the application of the 25 per cent rate of corporation tax which applies to the income of certain manufacturing companies which achieve an increase of 3 per cent, broadly, per annum in their employment levels.  The first year of application of this relief was 1977 and relief in respect of any accounting period, or part of an accounting period, falling within 1977, was provided for in the Finance Act 1977.  The 1978 Act extended the application of the 25 per cent rate for two years, 1978 and 1979. Therefore, no provision is required for 1979 in this year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to the point put forward by Deputy Barry that this would facilitate planning by industry, that may be true up to a point but I have to point out also that there are certain constraining effects in that as regards future budgetary flexibility. The decision whether or not to extend the relief for a further year will be taken in 1980 in the light of budgetary conditions and other relevant conditions then prevailing, such as the level of employment, the effectiveness of this inducement as then assessed in increasing employment in manufacturing industry and any other relevant factors.</P>
    <P>In so far as it may be shown that this inducement has operated effectively to increase employment, I can say that obviously there would be a predisposition on the part of the Government to extend it in so far as that can be done.  I acknowledge there are difficulties in measuring the effect, but so far as it can be done it is better that it be done towards the end of the existing period so that an up-to-date assessment can be made by the Government of its effect. Subject to budgetary constraints, if such an examination were to reveal that this has been effective in increasing employment, there would be a prodisposition on the part of the Government to extend it. I cannot agree that that decision should be taken now rather than in 1980.</P>

      <P>In page 19, subsection (1), lines 30 to 36, to delete paragraph (iii).</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has had many representations about this matter from manufacturing industry.  I do not think I need to enlarge on the matter except to say the relief was of benefit to the IDA in attracting industry.  It should be left at the full 100 per cent rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has indicated, the purpose of this amendment, with amendment No. 29, would be to provide for the extension of stock relief in full for a further year; in other words, that the restriction announced in the budget and provided for in section 21 would not apply for the year.</P>
      <P>I have to remind the House that stock relief was a temporary measure.  It was introduced in 1975 to take account of the then existing rate of inflation.  At that time the rate of inflation was, no doubt, creating very serious anomalies.  The continuance of stock relief when inflation has dropped considerably must be seriously questioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole justification for stock relief relates to the totally distorting effect of the inflation experienced at that time.  In this connection I will point out that the increase in the CPI from February 1974 to February 1975 was almost 24 per cent and that from February 1975 to February 1976 it was 16.08 per cent. The latest year&mdash;February 1978 to February 1979&mdash;shows an increase of 10.83 per cent.  Under the provisions which these amendments seek to remove from section 21, the amount of stock <Col N="1340" /> relief would be three-quarters of the amount that would be available if the relief were continued, subject only to existing rules and restrictions.  For example, if a taxpayer will otherwise qualify for a deduction amounting to £100 he will receive a deduction of £75 only.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that wideranging reliefs are available to industry in the form of tax relief on export profits and manufacturing profits and accelerated capital allowances.  The proposed introduction from 1 January 1981 of a 10 per cent rate for manufacturing industry will provide further extensive relief.  In these circumstances the extension of stock relief on the lines proposed in section 21 is, I suggest, a generous measure having regard to the other demands on the Exchequer at the present time.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I am afraid I cannot accept the amendments.  Having regard to the other benefits available to industry, to the various demands on the Exchequer and the fact that stock relief was introduced to meet a particular situation that does not obtain to anything like the same degree now, a reduction of one-quarter in the relief is not an unfair or ungenerous approach to this matter now.  Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that, although other factors enter into it, the fact that there was a reduction in the food subsidies which were also introduced at a time of raging inflation is a corollary to this measure.  If the action taken with regard to food subsidies is to operate I do not think it would be justifiable to adopt this attitude in regard to stock relief in relation to companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister had made the same argument last year in relation to stock relief it would have carried more weight than it does at the moment with so many people worried about the inflation rate in the current year.  We will know more about that in the middle of next month.  Many companies and business people are very worried about inflation in 1979 and in 1980.  One of their worries is buying in goods at a higher price than the goods they have disposed of and this was the basis of the section that gives stock relief to companies. <Col N="1341" /> They do not know that if they are in that situation at least when they come to balance the books they will not have to pay tax on what they would consider as inflation profits.  They would be better able to see into what for all of us is a rather uncertain future and at least they would have that one worry off their minds when considering investing in further stock, which in turn has the effect of keeping the economy going and has an effect on employment.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point that this was introduced when inflation was at a very high level here, as in the rest of the world.  This is one of the measures that were taken at that stage; food subsidies was another and many other measures were taken then which had the effect of allowing this country to come out of the recession induced by the OPEC prices, the oil shortage of 1973-4, very quickly and surely.  We came out to such an extent that virtually alone, with the exception of Japan, of the countries of the world we were moving into a growth position as early as the second quarter of 1976.  It was the sane and steady hand at the tiller during that difficult period that allowed the growth in 1977 and 1978 that the present Government are now claiming credit for.  They know in their hearts that the present economic growth has been built on policies adopted by the previous administration in 1975 and 1976.  It would be of some comfort&mdash;if no more&mdash;to some members of the business community if they could be assured that such inflation will not go beyond its present level in the coming 12 months and at least that companies will not be asked to pay tax on that portion of their profits which is due to inflated prices.  For that reason I recommend the Minister to think again about these amendments and to adopt them.</P>

      <P>Tempting as it is, I shall not pursue the Deputy down some of the lanes he has opened up in what he has said except to say that every independent economic commentator I know of added 1 per cent to the expected growth rate in the middle of 1977 as result of the measures taken by the new Government which took over at that time. <Col N="1342" /> Deputy Barry might like to think about the implications of that.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the Deputy cannot deny the facts I have stated. However, I shall not pursue that matter on this occasion.  I shall do so on another occasion, but I do not think it relevant now.  What is relevant is that stock relief is being extended to accounting periods which ended in the year from 6 April 1978 to 5 April 1979.  The rate of inflation for that year was 10.83 per cent, from February 1978 to February 1979, which was less than half the rate which applied in 1974-75 when this provision was introduced.  Deputies will recall that at that time the rate was almost 24 per cent.  Whatever may happen with this year's inflation rate it is not relevant to this section, which applies to the extension of stock relief to accounting periods ending in the year from April 1978 to April 1979.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> In page 23, before section 27, to insert the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;Chapter VI</P>
    <P Just="Center">Anti-evasion</P>
    <P>27.&mdash;The Tax Acts are hereby amended in relation to offences committed after the passing of this Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>  (a)  by the deletion in section 517 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, of &lsquo;, 413&rsquo;, and</P>
    <P>(b)  by the substitution of &lsquo;10 years&rsquo; for &lsquo;three years&rsquo; in the said section 517 and in section 148 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976,</P>
    <P>and the said sections 517 and 148, as so amended, are set out in the Table to this section.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TABLE.</P>
    <P> 517.  Notwithstanding subsection (4) of section 10 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, summary proceedings under section 128, 173 or 516 may be instituted within 10 years from the date of the committing of the offence or incurring of the penalty (as the case may be).</P>
    <P>148.  Notwithstanding section 10 (4) of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, summary proceedings under section 516 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 (false statements), as applied in relation to corporation tax or under section 63 (production of books and documents: export sales relief) may be instituted within 10 years from the date of offence or incurring of the penalty (as the case may be).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This section provides for the extension from three to ten years of the time limit for the taking of summary proceedings under certain sections of the Income Tax and Corporation Tax Acts.  The most important of these sections are concerned with proceedings for the lodgment of incorrect or false returns or the submission of fraudulent statements and accounts.  In the nature of things, it is likely to be a matter of some years before evidence becomes available to the Revenue indicating that returns or documents <Col N="1344" /> which have been lodged are false. The time limit of three years is quite inadequate in this context and it is now being extended to ten years.  The new provisions will apply only to offences committed after the passing of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should add that a time limit of ten years applies in relation to the making of assessments and the lodging of claims for repayment, but where there is fraud or negligence there is no time limit for the making of assessments. Perhaps it could be argued that likewise there should be no time limit for the taking of proceedings for the lodgment of false returns or fraudulent accounts.  In practice a time limit of ten years is likely to be sufficient particularly for cases where summary proceedings are being taken, but if it is found not to be so the question of removing the time limit altogether would have to be considered at a later date.</P>
    <P>The most important of the provisions affected by the extension of the time limit is section 516 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which reproduces a provision contained in the 1918 Act.  This section imposes a penalty of imprisonment &mdash;there is no provision for a monetary penalty&mdash;for a term not exceeding six months for (a) knowingly making false statements or false representation for the purpose of obtaining any allowance, reduction, rebate or repayment of tax either for the person himself or for any other person and (b) knowingly and wilfully aiding, abetting, assisting or inciting another person to make or deliver a false or fraudulent account with reference to tax.</P>
    <P>In a recent case in which Revenue took proceedings in relation to the submission of a false document and the lodgment of false returns the summons relating to the returns had to be dropped since the returns had been lodged more than three years previously.  Although a time limit of three years applies in relation to proceedings under the sections I listed in the proposed new section, it would be open to the Revenue to take proceedings under other sections, for example, sections 501, 503 and 505 for monetary penalties.  Proceedings for the <Col N="1345" /> recovery of such fines or penalties may be taken within six years of the offence under section 511.  Proceedings for penalties under section 501 for fraudulently or negligently making incorrect returns are excluded from the time limit.</P>
    <P>This provision is part of the necessary steps to be taken in the drive against tax evasion.  Further steps will be necessary. It cannot be regarded as a major step although it is an important one.  It is part of an overall programme I am pursuing to tackle tax evasion.</P>

      <P>It has not been the practice of the Revenue Commissioners to do so.  I am sure that they had powers under the relevant sections to go to the ordinary courts but they did not do so.  I understand from what the Minister said in recent statements that it will be the practice to pursue tax evasion through the ordinary courts.  In that case taxpayers will no longer have their cases heard in camera.  The cases can be reported in the newspapers.  Have any guidelines been laid down for the Revenue Commissioners as to what kind of cases they will pursue?  Will we have ordinary cases like bicycle fines, no car tax and so on coming up?  I should like to know what kind of case the Revenue Commissioners will pursue and whether they will pursue everybody who sends in an incorrect return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the situation will not be that we would have a series of cases like no lights on bicycles and so on.  The principal cases I expect to be coming to the courts would be where there have been false statements or false returns made.  There has been a practice heretofore whereby in cases of this kind normally the Revenue Commissioners would settle the case with the offending taxpayer on payment of the outstanding tax and interest and a penalty.  It is important that we should go further than that and, where appropriate, cases should be brought to court.  In cases of false statements and false returns, it is the intention that in the normal way such cases will be brought to court and will not be settled by the Revenue Commissioners quietly.  There are two reasons for that.  One is that it is important that the public should be aware that the Revenue Commissioners do take action and do recover not only the tax and interest but penalties in cases where this happens.  There are a number of cases where this has been happening but the <Col N="1347" /> public are not aware that wrongdoers of this kind are pursued and are obliged to pay penalties.  The public should have knowledge of what is happening.</P>
      <P>Secondly, publicity given to cases of this kind will act as a deterrent to people who might not be deterred if they felt it was a question of taking a chance and if they were caught out they could eventually, although it might hurt, pay the penalty but nobody would know about it.  The public disclosure of wrongdoers of this kind&mdash;I cannot use any lesser term for this kind of activity&mdash;will have a deterrent effect and help to reduce tax evasion.  I do not say that in any punitive sense but in the sense that the public and the public interest require to be assured that steps are being taken to tackle these kinds of offences, particularly in relation to false statements and false returns.</P>
      <P>I have tried to outline the general thinking behind the approach involved and to indicate that people should recognise the fact that, in future, cases of false returns and false statements to the Revenue Commissioners are likely to lead not only to severe penalties but to prosecution and publicity in relation to the offence committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1976 Finance Act, periodically about every ten years, there has been the practice of the Minister for Finance announcing an amnesty.  The last was in the tax year 1976.  Taxpayers who had been evading paying their tax were allowed to make a clean breast of it and proceedings were not instituted, but they would have to pay the interest accruing from the tax that should have been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it now the intention under this section no longer to have an amnesty announced by the Minister for Finance? Further, if proceedings are to be instituted in the courts against people found to be evading tax or making false statements and so forth, will the practice now prevalent be discontinued?  The practice is as follows: There is a very effective Investigation Branch of the Revenue Commissioners.  They catch the taxpayer about 60 per cent of the time. In a lot of other cases, the taxpayers <Col N="1348" /> who have been evading the payment of tax give themselves up, if I may use that phrase, to their local inspector of taxes and say that they have undisclosed assets or were making false statements and wish to settle their debt.  In the cases referred to the Investigation Branch, it may take months or years before the exact amount is worked out and interest on the tax is paid.</P>
    <P>If this section is in the Finance Act and proceedings are instituted and the cases come before the courts, we will definitely not have taxpayers giving themselves up.  That would rule out, effectively, any amnesty which might possibly be introduced.  If the Minister goes ahead with this section, he should introduce an amnesty as outlined in the 1976 Finance Act, a further amnesty for a period of, say, three months, which defaulting taxpayers could avail of.  If the intention is to bring people to the courts, it would be only fair, if they wish to consider their position that they should have the opportunity of coming clean.  I would be afraid of throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  If in these back duty cases, as they are referred to, it is the intention that they be worked out in court, this will take perhaps five or six years and the detailed financial transactions and personal and business transactions will be named in court.  I would not be happy that we are proceeding on the right lines.  I am not in favour of pursuing taxpayers into the courts at every possible opportunity.  The more lenient system of the Irish Revenue Commissioners, if I may pay them a tribute, catches the evader far more quickly than under the UK system.  People are less likely to get away with tax evasion for years.  In the UK if people are found to have been evading their tax for a number of years, say ten to 15 years, the book is thrown at them and they are thrown into gaol.  The Irish system is far more effective and is quicker.  They get the tax and everyone is better off.  The threat of court proceedings may, as the Minister said, lead people to be more careful.  I think the present Revenue Commissioners' system should continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I have no plans, at present, for an amnesty of the <Col N="1349" /> kind referred to by the Deputy.  I am not leaving out the possibility, but no plans for such an amnesty exist at the moment. Secondly, it has always been the practice of the Revenue Commissioners to treat more leniently the case where the taxpayer himself voluntarily discloses his offence, rather than that they detect it.  That practice will continue.  I did indicate that, in the normal way, cases of the kind I have been describing would be brought to court, but the fact that there was a voluntary disclosure by the taxpayer of his offence would be a factor that would weigh in the decision as to whether the case should be brought to court or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister write that into the section, that if there were a voluntary admission&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I must leave the Revenue Commissioners the discretion. However, I can say that a case where such an offence is not voluntarily disclosed will almost positively end up in court.  In case anybody is interested, the message should be clear.  It would be better to make a voluntary disclosure rather than wait to be found out.  Thirdly, the Deputy seems to envisage the possibility of the courts, in effect, being clogged up with a whole lot of cases where all the minute details of accounts of the taxpayer, and so on, would be examined. That is not what I envisage.  The most important of the sections of the 1967 Income Tax Act that we are dealing with here are concerned with court proceedings relating to the lodgment of incorrect or false returns or the submission of fraudulent statements and accounts. I am talking about prosecutions in respect of these, as distinct from going into the details of the taxpayer's accounts, which is a separate item.  We need not worry, on foot of this amendment anyway, over the prospect of the courts being drowned in the detail of the various taxpayers' accounts.</P>

      <P>You may only have to establish a case in relation to one portion of his account.  Furthermore, to some extent it depends on whether the taxpayer is going to deny the whole thing.  In many cases he will not do that because he knows he would be dragging out the proceedings and making his situation worse.  I do not think we need assume that every case in which there is a prosecution will involve going into all the details of the taxpayer's accounts in the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy raised a point which was not answered by the Minister.  How would the Revenue Commissioners decide whether to proceed in open court, or to proceed through the appeal commissioners, which is in camera?  There is a very important difference between these two proceedings in terms of penalty, because the penalty of having one's tax affairs discussed in public, in open court is probably, for many, a greater penalty than any monetary penalty they might suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not opposed to what the Minister is proposing to do, and one must recognise that it is a major step which is going to create much greater pressure than has existed in the past on people who have been doing this sort of thing. However, I am a bit worried about how the Revenue Commissioners will decide whom to proceed against.  The difference is very great in the case of a taxpayer.  If he is going to be proceeded against under the Appeals Commissioner mechanism he is maybe not getting such a bad deal in some ways.  If he is going to be proceeded against under the other method, even though the amount of money taken from him might not be very much greater, he is getting it in the neck.  I am worried that there would not be any fair criteria for discriminating in one case as against another.  In making that decision the Revenue Commissioners will be going almost as far as administering justice themselves and also <Col N="1351" /> deciding whether a case should be pursued in one way or the other.  I am against people who are responsible for the enforcement of justice also having the responsibility of administering it and deciding whether a particular penalty should be imposed.</P>
    <P>It would have been better had the Minister been more specific in the provisions of the amendment as to the type of case in which this should be used.  It could be used, theoretically at least, for fiddling little cases in a vindictive fashion because a commissioner from the Revenue did not like the colour of the eyes of a taxpayer and so decided to throw the book at him and bring him to court as well because the fellow may have been abusive or something like that in an interview.  That is not likely, but it is theoretically possible, under the provisions of the Bill that this vindictive approach could be adopted in one case and a more lenient approach in another.  People should not be put in the position of having to make a decision whether to throw the book at a particular fellow and not at another without guidelines in the Bill. form of something written in the Bill. Does the Minister feel that there is a lack there?</P>

      <P>This is a difficult section to discuss.  We are all in favour of what the Minister is trying to do and we all feel that, if those who are not paying their fair share did pay their fair share, then those of us who have halos would not have to pay as much.  However, in all this Finance Bill, particularly in this section, in the amendment we are now discussing, amendment 31a which comes next and the amendment to section 6 which we discussed earlier, there seems to be an over-enthusiasm for chasing people, who of course are doing wrong. We are all obliged to pay taxes in spite of the fact that you can go into any public house in Ireland to find all kinds of bar lawyers there advising one that the Jesuits said&mdash;even though I am sure they never did&mdash;that it was no sin to do the Government as long as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;you gave to God what was God's and to Caesar what was Caesar's.  I agree with Deputy Boland when he said that they are going to start going down through the lists and, no doubt, the first case that appears in court and the publicity that will be attendant on it will frighten a lot of other people into declaring voluntarily to the Revenue Commissioners that they have been bad boys.  If they proceed alphabetically then obviously I will be in court, being a Barry, and Deputy Taylor will contribute voluntarily because he is a Taylor and he will not have the attendant bad publicity, whereas I will and everybody's finger will be pointed at me.</P>
      <P>I am not sure about the system which Deputy McCreevy has said is adopted by the Revenue Commissioners.  How much evasion is there of a small kind? There are matters like charging up to business expenses that should be borne by the person as an individual out of his individual tax.  I do not know whether these provisions can deal with that. There is the falsifying of accounts.  Any business of a reasonable size and making reasonable profits is going to employ an accountant.  I am sure there is not an accountant in the country who would sign a set of accounts which contain false figures.  He might do it unwittingly, but if he is worth his while as an accountant or auditor, for the sake of his own profession and of the man whose books he is auditing he is going to go very thoroughly into the whole situation.  If he is going to produce a set of accounts and sign them they are going to be able to stand up to scrutiny.  For that reason I do not know whom we are talking about in this regard.  We are talking about quite small people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last 12 months I had a case of a man who was a publican in a small way. He was over 80 years of age and he had got an account for an amount of tax going back maybe four or five years, and he did not agree with it.  He said he had given this matter to his accountants who had not gone in front of all the courts in which they were asked to appear.  The man himself paid no more attention to the matter and eventually he discovered that it was an assessment for tax for <Col N="1353" /> £9,000 that he had received.  I know that his turnover would be hardly £9,000 in a year, never mind having £9,000 profit. The accountants did nothing about it and eventually, because of the accountant's negligence, the man was caught and there was no appeal against the amount of money for which the Revenue Commissioners said he was due to pay, even though it was only an assessment, because his accountants did not present the books.</P>
    <P>Of course the accountants are to blame for that.  If accountants were equally negligent under this section, who would go to prison?  Who would appear in the courts?  Would it be the accountant or the publican, as in my example? It would, of course, be the publican.  It is he who would be exposed as being antisocial, whereas the accountant should be exposed for being unprofessional.  I hope this firm of accountants in this case will be exposed.  I am advising the publican strongly to do that but, like all very old men in a small line of business, he is not prepared to take on the professional classes as he sees them.  He feels that if he goes anywhere near a court he is going to lose because he will not be competent to deal with the position.</P>
    <P>I can see what the Minister is trying to do.  Anything that will cut off the fringes of the benefits enjoyed by those people who sail close to the wind regarding taxation should be done.  However, against that I am a little worried about all these extra powers being given to the Revenue Commissioners, particularly in this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not sure about other finance legislation, but since this Bill was published just prior to Easter, about five weeks ago, there has been a whole group of amendments, two in particular&mdash;this and the one following&mdash;which were not included in the original publication and which evidently have been thought out since by somebody as being desirable measures.  Perhaps Deputy McCreevy is the only person in this House at the moment who can tell us from his experience whether these are justified.  If I understood him correctly, he seems to consider that there is not such a great amount of avoidance in this country as people think and that, where there is, the <Col N="1354" /> Revenue Commissioners are extremely good at catching up very quickly with it and getting a result that is of benefit to the Exchequer as well as to the non-taxpayer. I agree with him that because of the size of the country we all know one another's business.  Of course I take the Minister's word that he has been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that something like this is necessary and must be included in this year's Finance Bill.  But I beg leave to keep at least a question mark in my mind as to whether or not we are not using a very large hammer to crack what may be a very small nut.  We are giving powers to people, but I will come to that under another amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to remind the House that I specifically referred to tax evasion in my budget speech and outlined the approach we would take in the matter.  I said that there was evidence that some self-employed persons such as traders, landlords of residential premises and professionals were not making returns.  In some cases where accounts were being furnished there were indications of evasion.  Among other things I said that, apart from strengthening the staff of the Revenue Commissioners, the anti-evasion campaign would include the examination in depth of particular accounts and that, in future, more emphasis would be placed on legal proceedings than on compromise action where the making of false returns was uncovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are dealing with in this amendment is primarily the extension of the time limit from three to ten years for the taking of summary proceedings under certain sections of the Income Tax and Corporation Tax Acts.  We are not adding to the powers already vested in the Revenue Commissioners except in so far as it is proposed to extend the time limit from three to ten years.  I have already explained to the House why the extension of the time limit is necessary. The three-year time limit is not practical in a number of cases.  With the powers already existing, the only other difference involved is that I have given public notice of the fact in the budget and since of an intention on the part of <Col N="1355" /> the Revenue Commissioners to bring cases to public hearing in court.</P>

      <P>The various sections provide for this matter.  It is generally true that <i>mens rea</i> is required in most prosecutions.  The Deputy may be under a misapprehension in so far as he was referring to appeals to the Appeal Commissioners. That does not arise in this case.  He is thinking on an appeal to the Appeal Commissioners on the amount of tax.  We are talking about prosecutions. There is no question of the Appeal Commissioners deciding to prosecute. As regards hearings <i>in camera</i>, the only such cases that exist at present is where there is an appeal on a point of law to the High Court in relation to a taxpayer's assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not open to an official of the Revenue Commissioners to decide that somebody is going to be prosecuted, whether for what appeared to him to be good reasons or even in the kind of case that Deputy Bruton referred to, which was an extreme example, where somebody spoke in a way that the official concerned did not like.  The decision to bring a prosecution is one that can only be made by the Revenue Commissioners. They have had extensive powers for many years and they have exercised their powers reasonably.  We have no reason to anticipate from past experience that the Revenue Commissioners would engage in a vendetta against a taxpayer or use their powers unfairly.  My experience as a Minister and as a Deputy is that they are reasonable in dealing with persons who are in difficulty, particularly in dealing with the kind of case with which Deputy <Col N="1356" /> Barry may have been concerned&mdash;the relatively small taxpayer who, through ignorance, gets into difficulty with the Revenue Commissioners.  My experience is that they deal sympathetically and helpfully with such people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean that the Deputy gave that impression.  The report of the Revenue Commissioners for the year ended 31 December 1977 refers to a number of cases.  To give the House an idea of the kind of thing they are faced with, I will read a few details from the report.  In paragraph 126 they give details of cases settled in 1977 in which the amount involved was £20,000 or more.  In some of the cases the settlements included current liabilities.  They list people under different categories of occupation and give the amounts.  Leaving out the amount of the settlement, which included interest and presumably penalties, the following estimated amounts of tax were underpaid: £59,644; £44,771; £40,000; £35,000; £30,000; £27,000 and so on.  It cannot be said that the persons involved in those cases were innocent offenders.  We must take into account that such people are operating and that we are only dealing with the ones who have been detected.</P>
      <P>The reference made by Deputy Barry to a firm of accountants raised an interesting question.  I am sure that as an accountant Deputy McCreevy is conscious of what I am about to say.  I understand that in the USA the accountant is equally liable with his client for any false, misleading or inaccurate statements. I understand that accountants here and in Britain do not favour the introduction of such a system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Reasonable account is taken of the situation in which the taxpayer was genuinely misled by his accountant. If there is a prosecution it is for the court to decide whether the person was misled or whether he deliberately made fraudulent statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> The change made in the amendment is primarily to extend the time limit.  There is no change in substance other than that except the change I have outlined in the approach to cases of this kind.  The powers are there but it is a question of the way powers would be exercised in the future.</P>
    <P>I cannot say positively that there are certain guidelines that will be rigid and will apply to the Revenue Commissioners in their approach to these cases. If I were to do that I would tie their hands too much.  On the other hand, I tried to outline the kinds of cases where people can expect in future to be prosecuted and I have also indicated that the chances of prosecution are very much greater if one waits to be found out as distinct from a person who voluntarily discloses his past offences.  Our experience of the way the Revenue Commissioners have operated over the years should reassure us that there is no reason to believe that they would act either in a prejudiced or in an unprincipled way in the exercise of these powers.  I believe that it is necessary and that the public requires that we take more effective steps to tackle tax evasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us of the amount of under-assessed tax which the Revenue Commissioners collected in 1978.  I understand that in 1977 in one case they collected £1,500,000 from a manufacturer.  In my view it was better to collect that money independently than to have a public court hearing which might have resulted in that person being put out of business.  I am aware of two cases where proceedings were instituted in court.  The amount involved in one of those cases was very small and it was not a question of evasion.  In fact, the amount has been declared but the person concerned omitted to state that on the form.  It was the case of a medical doctor and in my view it was ridiculous to bring it to court because evasion was not involved.  I understand that the amount involved was £1,000 in director's fees.  Such cases should not be brought to court and I was glad that one was thrown out.  I should like to know if <Col N="1358" /> increasing the time limit from three to ten years will mean more of those cases. The Minister should lay down criteria under which people will be brought before the courts.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the Revenue Commissioners, and the Minister, who are anxious to prepare sections to catch tax evaders, but we must be careful about the amount of power we give to the Revenue Commissioners.  We should not give them the power to do what they like.  I accept that they should bring people to court who abuse the tax system. In such cases it will be the commissioners who will be making the recommendation but in the cases of small amounts the recommendations will be made by junior officials.  The Minister should consider announcing criteria on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Up to now the Revenue Commissioners have done good work in getting money without having to go to court and I do not think this section will improve that situation.  It is possible that the Minister is correct in saying that the publicity given to court cases will make people more aware of the danger of tax evasion.  In that connection the Minister should consider granting an amnesty, as occurred in the past, to those who now come clean.  For months we have been reading about tax evaders and it is my belief that it would be fair to give people a final opportunity to come clean before deciding to bring them to court.</P>

      <P>I should like to know what the situation would be in relation to a person who is incapacitated and whose work is carried on by book-keepers and accountants.  I am aware of a case where a person was not in touch with his business because of incapacity and during that period he had to depend on others.  Such a person should be excluded from this section because he could not be held culpable or responsible during that period.  The Revenue Commissioners should give sympathetic consideration to such a person before bringing him to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>A person who was clearly not culpable can rest assured that the Revenue Commissioners would take account <Col N="1359" /> of it and not prosecute.  If they did not believe him and prosecuted him it would be for the courts then to determine whether or not he was culpable. The Deputy can rest assured that where such a situation arises it is unlikely that a person who is not culpable would suffer the penalty envisaged in the section.  I stated earlier that only two such cases were brought before the courts, but I was referring to cases where imprisonment was the penalty.  There have been a number of cases where there was a monetary penalty but only in two cases could imprisonment have been imposed.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go into the details of an individual case but in regard to the one I touched on earlier, and which was referred to by Deputy McCreevy, I must state that from what Deputy McCreevy said he appears to be relying on certain necessarily abbreviated accounts published perhaps in the newspapers. From what I am told the sum involved was by no means insubstantial.  There was the question of deliberate false statements arising and the minutes of meetings alleged to have been held and which were not held.  I do not wish to go into the details of that case.  We are talking about extending the time limit in regard to the possibility of imprisonment as distinct from monetary penalties arising.</P>

      <P>In page 23, before section 27, but in Chapter VI, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;28.&mdash;Section 70 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (3) of the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(3A)  The precedent partner of any partnership, when required to do so by a notice given to him by an inspector, shall, within the time limited by such notice, prepare and deliver to the inspector a statement in writing, signed by him, stating the amount of the profits or gains arising to the partnership from each and every source chargeable according to the respective schedules, estimated for the period specified in the notice and according to the provisions of this Act and there shall be added to the statement a declaration that such amounts are estimated in respect of all the sources of income mentioned in this Act, describing the same, after deducting only such sums as are allowed.</P>
      <P>(3B) Section 174 shall have effect in relation to a partnership carrying on a trade or profession as if in that section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) &lsquo;precedent partner&rsquo; were submitted for &lsquo;person&rsquo; wherever it occurs,</P>
      <P>(b) &lsquo;a partnership&rsquo; were substituted for &lsquo;him&rsquo; where it firstly occurs, and</P>
      <P>(c) &lsquo;or in the possession or power of the partnership&rsquo; were inserted after &lsquo;power&rdquo;&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 174 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, deals with the situation where a person carrying on a trade or profession either fails to furnish an inspector with a statement of his profits or furnishes a statement with which the inspector is dissatisfied.  In that situation an authorised officer is entitled, under the section, to call for the production of accounts, <Col N="1361" /> books and records which will enable him to test the validity of the amount of profits returned.  Because section 174 speaks of &ldquo;a person&rdquo; it can be argued that it does not extend to partnerships.  The present section is designed to remedy this.  In 1965 special provisions dealing with the taxation of partnerships were introduced.  These are contained in Chapter III of Part IV of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Section 70, which is in that Chapter, imposes on the precedent partner of a partnership the obligation of furnishing the return of income on behalf of the partnership.  It is proposed to amend that section by inserting two new subsections, the first of which deals with the statements to be delivered by the precedent partner, the second of which imposes on him the obligation of furnishing the accounts and records when so required under section 174 of the 1967 Act.</P>

    <P>(3)  Where a notice under subsection (2) has been served on the taxpayer, an authorised officer may, for the purpose of inquiring into the tax liability of the taxpayer, by notice in writing served on any person who, in relation to the taxpayer, is subject to this section require him, within the period stated in the notice, or within <Col N="1363" /> such further period as the authorised officer may allow&mdash;</P>
    <P>  (a) to furnish him with particulars of any business transactions which that person had with the taxpayer during a stated period, and</P>
    <P>(b) to deliver to him or, if the person to whom the notice is given so elects, to make available for inspection by an authorised officer such documents specified or described in the notice as are in his possession or power and as, in the first-mentioned officer's opinion, contain, or may contain, information relevant to any tax liability to which the taxpayer is or may be or may have been subject, or to the amount of any such tax liability.</P>
    <P>(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a person who is carrying on a profession, and on whom a notice under subsection (3) has been served, to furnish any particulars relating to a client to an authorised officer, or to deliver to, or make available for inspection by, an authorised officer any documents relating to a client, other than such particulars or documents&mdash;</P>
    <P>  (a)  as pertain to the payment of fees or to other financial transactions, or</P>
    <P>(b)  as are otherwise material to the tax liability of the client.</P>
    <P>and, in particular, he shall not be required to disclose any information or professional advice of a confidential nature given to a client.</P>
    <P>(5) Where a person fails to comply with a requirement duly made on the person under subsection (3) within the period stated in the notice containing the requirement or such further period as may be allowed by the authorised officer concerned, the person shall be liable to a penalty of £500.</P>
    <P>(6) The person who, in relation to a taxpayer, are subject to this section are any person who is carrying on a <Col N="1364" /> business, or was doing so at a material time, and any company whether carrying on a business or not.</P>
    <P>(7)  For the purposes of subsection (2), every director of a company is to be taken as being concerned with the management of any business carried on by the company, and a material time is any time which, in the authorised officer's opinion, is, or may have been, material in the ascertainment of any past or present tax liability of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>(8)  Where documents are to be delivered to an authorised officer pursuant to a requirement duly made under subsection (3), copies of such documents may be delivered instead of the originals; but&mdash;</P>
    <P>  (a) the copies must be photographic or otherwise by way of facsimile; and</P>
    <P>(b) if so required by the authorised officer, the originals must be made available for inspection by an authorised officer, failure to comply with this provision being treated as failure to comply with the requirement.</P>
    <P>(9) An authorised officer may examine any documents furnished or made available for inspection under this section and may take copies of, or extracts from, them.</P>
    <P>(10)  When exercising any powers conferred by this section, an authorised officer shall, if so requested by any person affected, produce to that person a certificate of the Revenue Commissioners authorising him to exercise the powers conferred by this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This new section authorises the Revenue, in cases where they are dissatisfied with the accounts lodged by a person carrying on a trade, profession or business other than banking business, to seek information from his business suppliers or customers so as to check the accuracy of the accounts submitted.  Experience has shown that the absence of information from independent sources encourages tax evaders to understate <Col N="1365" /> their profits and also the extent of their business transactions.  These evaders proceed on the basis that the Revenue will be unable to check the accuracy of their statements or accounts.  Of course Deputies are aware that in the case of employees full information as to their earnings is supplied to the Revenue by their employers.  There is no reason why the self-employed should be left in the position that there is to be no independent check of their accounts or returns of profits, particularly in cases where there is reason to be dissatisfied with the returns being made.</P>
    <P>The section will be applied only where (a) the person carrying on the trade, and so on has lodged accounts with which the inspector is dissatisfied and acceptable reasons for the apparent deficiencies in the accounts have not been supplied; and (b) the specially authorised officer has reviewed the case and the inspector's reasons for being dissatisfied and decides that, in order to determine the proper tax liability of the person concerned, independent information as to his business transactions is required.</P>
    <P>It is not intended that the section will be used in a great percentage of cases: it would be used only where a case is referred for special examination.  Indeed the existence of the section is expected to have a salutary effect on the quality and accuracy of accounts being lodged in cases where taxpayers are at present understating their profits.</P>
    <P>Banking business is excluded from the scope of the section since banks are subject to supervision by the Central Bank to which detailed returns of the profits and banking transactions are made.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with that.  As I said, they are subject to supervision by <Col N="1366" /> the Central Bank to which they have to make detailed returns of the profits and banking transactions.  Apart from that it is necessary to ensure that nothing be done which might lead to an outflow of funds from the banks or to a fear that the traditional confidentiality between banker and customer would disappear.</P>
      <P>The House will note that a special provision, in subsection (4), has been inserted to protect professional relationships between solicitor and client and doctor and patient.  Only such information and documents as pertain to the payment of fees or as is material to the tax liability of the professional person may be sought.  Indeed the section limits the classes of persons from whom information may be asked to (1) any person carrying on a trade, profession or business and (2) any company, whether carrying on a business or not&mdash;subsection (6).  This means that a doctor or dentist's private patients would not be subject to the provisions of the section and a doctor or dentist is likely to be called on to provide information about business transactions which they had with other persons carrying on a trade, profession or business.</P>
      <P>If required, I can demonstrate to the House that there is a considerable need for this.  I do not propose to do that unless Deputies want me to do so. Otherwise they can take my word for it. I would hope that the outline I have given would be sufficient to indicate to Deputies what we have in mind.  But if any Deputies have any queries on it, I will endeavour to answer them.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick (<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>) on Tuesday, 22 May 1979:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the hopelessly inadequate allocation of finance by the Government to housing authorities in respect of new house starts for the current year.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;welcomes the generous provision made in the Public Capital Programme for the current year for the maintenance of a high level of activity on the local authority housing construction programme and notes an anticipated increase in the total number of new house completions this year arising from the Government's national housing programme.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want to support the amendment moved last night by the Minister for the Environment to the Fine Gael motion.  The Minister's speech can have left little doubt about the lack of any genuine foundation for the allegations made in the motion or about the validity of the <Col N="1368" /> case put forward by the Minister for the amendment.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to reiterate the telling facts and figures in the Minister's speech, apart from pointing out again that the motion &ldquo;deplores the hopelessly inadequate allocation of finance by the Government to housing authorities in respect of new house starts for the current year&rdquo; while, in actual fact, final allocations for new work in the present year have not yet been made.  Instead I want to deal, in the time available to me, with specific points made by the Deputies who have spoken so far.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick took the Minister to task&mdash;incorrectly, as he will realise if he reads the text of the debate&mdash;for using 1977 as the base year for all comparison purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As if to show how the matter should properly be handled, Deputy Fitzpatrick himself chose to go back no less than a decade and quoted from the White Paper &ldquo;Housing in the Seventies&rdquo;.  That was a document of which the Fianna Fáil Government of the time, which published it, were proud and with good reason.  I would strongly recommend to the Deputy that he should read right through the White Paper and not merely dip selectively into it to produce an odd statement or statistic which he feels might now be used against the present Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Housing in the Seventies&rdquo; reviewed the national housing situation in a most comprehensive way.  It enunciated Government policies and objectives to deal with problems, especially unfit and overcrowded housing conditions, and it outlined an imaginative programme for the ensuing decade which would upgrade our national housing standards and, in the process, eliminate most of what was unsatisfactory in living conditions throughout the country.  I make no apology for harking back to the White Paper.  Unlike Deputy Fitzpatrick, I do so not to denigrate but to remind the Dáil that the basic principles and objectives <Col N="1369" /> promulgated by the Government in 1969 still hold good and still guide the 1979 Government in determining national housing policies.  We are still completely committed to the principle that, as far as the resources of the economy permit, every family can obtain for their own occupation a house of good standard at a price or rent they can afford.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil election manifesto of 1977 and that recently published in connection with the local elections reiterate and, in so far as is necessary, update the policies stated in &ldquo;Housing in the Seventies&rdquo;. Deputies would be well advised to go back to the 1977 manifesto and see for themselves how all the commitments to improving housing conditions made in that document have been fulfilled during the intervening two years.</P>
    <P>One final point which I feel should be made before I turn to deal with the specific statements made by the Opposition Deputies relates to the allegation that this Government are set on a policy of downgrading the local authority housing programme and building up the private housing sector.  I would ask Deputies to look back on our record in this regard over the years.  While Fianna Fáil held the reins of Government output in the local authority sector rose every year from 1961 onwards, with one slight pause between 1967 and 1968, when completions fell by 34 dwellings or less than 1 per cent.  Contrast this with the record of the Coalition Government when local authority output was built up to a peak of 8,794 houses in 1975, largely as a result of the programming and planning undertaken prior to 1973 but which then plummeted to only 6,333 houses in 1977 a fall of nearly 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The present motion by Fine Gael Deputies sounds rather cynical when one remembers that this 20 per cent drop in output was due to the denial of adequate funds for the programme by the then Minister for Finance, a member of that party.</P>
    <P>A desire for home ownership is one of the most deep-rooted traits of Irish people. While this Government are completely <Col N="1370" /> committed to providing the necessary capital to enable local authorities to house families in genuine need and who lack the resources to house themselves, they have also given practical evidence that, in so far as possible, even persons of modest means will be encouraged and assisted to house themselves rather than become, or remain, tenants of local authority dwellings.</P>
    <P>The financial incentives made available since Fianna Fáil resumed office in 1977 are most impressive.  They include the elimination of the income and valuation limitations on eligibility for housing grants which the previous Government had introduced and which had practically phased out the grants the introduction of the £1,000 new house grant for first-time owner occupiers, the abolition of rates on houses, big increases in the loan and income limits under the SDA scheme, a liberalisation of the low-rise mortgage scheme and an increase in the maximum loan, an increase in the subsidy payable on sites provided and developed by local authorities for private housing, a much more generous system of house improvement grants and further tax concessions in respect of money borrowed for the construction or improvement of houses and also in respect of the employment content in reconstruction work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick asked how it will be possible in 1979 to maintain the same level of activity with a percentage increase in the public capital programme allocation for local authority housing which, he alleges, will be insufficient to match the cost of inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that the actual increase in the amount of money available for expenditure on the local authority programme is about £5 million more than the difference between the public capital programme allocations for the two years, because the total of the debit balance of housing authorities at 31 December 1978, which must be met within this year, was £5 million less than <Col N="1371" /> at 31 December 1977.  This is a very important point.  This reduction in the debit balance will offset the effects of increased inflation of costs to a very large degree.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Quinn made a lot of play about the difference between the figure of 27,392 quoted by the Minister in his contribution to the debate last night as the total number of approved applicants and a total derived by Deputy Fitzpatrick from the answer to a recent Parliamentary Question on the subject. The inference was that the House was being deliberately misled.  I want to contradict any such implication categorically. The Minister gave correctly 27,392 applicants as the most up-to-date figure <Col N="1372" /> available to him of the total number of applicants on approved waiting lists at 31 September 1978.  The 35,000 figure quoted by Deputy Quinn is the total of all applications submitted to local authorities at 30 September 1978, including unapproved applications, on the basis of returns made to him at the time of the answer to the question.</P>
      <P>Obviously, in the interests of orderly programming, which Deputy Quinn so assiduously seeks, the Minister was concerned to give the number of applications accepted by the authorities and not a gross figure including everybody who sought a local authority house, whether eligible or not.  Incidentally, Deputy Fitzpatrick gave the impression that housing authorities are operating an income limit of £70 a week for local authority housing eligibility.  There is no prescribed income limit and it is left to each housing authority to make a judgment on the basis of each individual case, taking all circumstances including income into consideration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke with feeling about the needs of small families, including parents without children, who are badly in need of housing.  I agree that concentration on larger families for many years has tended to keep pushing individuals and small families into the background.  It is the Government's policy that housing authorities should give greater attention to the genuine needs of smaller families who are badly housed, particularly the elderly and the disabled.  I would hope that the lessening of the proportions of larger families on approved lists will now encourage authorities to make better and more specific provision for smaller families who genuinely need their help.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick asked for information about the categories of persons to whom low-rise mortgages have been made available.  The low-rise mortgage scheme as originally introduced in November 1976 catered for the following categories of persons:</P>
      <P>  (a)  an existing tenant or tenant-purchaser of a local authority house who will surrender his dwelling to the local authority on receipt of a loan to purchase a private house;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> (b) families of three or more persons who, at least one year prior to seeking the loan, had applied to and been accepted by a local authority at that time as being in need of rehousing on the grounds that their existing accommodation was dangerous, structurally unfit or seriously overcrowded and that their financial circumstances were such that they could not reasonably be expected to provide proper accommodation from their own resources and who are still in need of rehousing:</P>
    <P>(c) a person who has been allocated tenancy of a new local authority house and who wishes to purchase that house.</P>
    <P>In February 1979 the Government agreed to amend the scheme to include two-person families which consist of one parent and one child and who are otherwise eligible to qualify under category (b).  At the same time it was decided to confine applications under category (a) of the scheme to persons who had been tenants or tenant-purchasers of a local authority house for at least six months.</P>
    <P>Information received from the local authorities show that at 31 December 1978 loans had been paid to 557 applicants under category (a) and to 534 applicants under category (b), while 97 persons who have been allocated new local authority houses have chosen to purchase them under the low-rise mortgage scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn in his contribution charged the Minister and his Department with incompetence in the way money made available for housing was being used and gave the House a lecture on the application to the programme of socialist theories and beliefs.  He suggested <Col N="1374" /> that the Minister should shift money from the private sector to local authority housing.  His socialist equation had only two main factors.  He ignored a third very important factor, the taxpayer. One of the main limitations on the expansion of local authority housing is the current accumulating and already enormous, cost of State subsidies which fall so heavily on the taxpayers.  The Government must hold a reasonable and fair balance between the needs of families for social housing and the burden which taxpayers generally can bear as a result of social housing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn, while free with his charges of incompetence, saw nothing wrong apparently, in applying contradictory principles to his approach to local authority housing and to the building industry. He deplored, roundly, overheating in the building industry and demanded an end to the peaks and troughs which, he said, have plagued it, but in the same breath he blandly berated the Minister for being concerned about overheating in the local authority housing construction sector, and decried the steady progress achieved in recent years in this sector.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked for better use of available resources to get the best value for money, but no doubt he will be ready enough to make a special case for the excessive costs involved in central city housing development.</P>
    <P>In considering the question of the competence of the Department in the housing area, one might examine the relationship between housing targets and performance.  Since 1964, every medium-term national housing target has either been achieved or exceeded. This achievement required close monitoring of the various elements of the national housing programme and changes in policies to meet the situation. Since 1973, the number of new houses built each year has been within 8 per cent of 25,000 a year.  On the basis of information available from the Economic Commission for Europe, there is scarcely any other developed country which has managed to remain so close to a national housing target during the past six years.  As far as the housebuilding sector is concerned, it is widely accepted <Col N="1375" /> that peaks and valleys in building activity were minimal during this period.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there were valley periods in the building industry.  But these occurred during the Coalition's recent period in office before Deputy Quinn entered this House.  Output in the building industry was increasing steadily from the mid-1960s up to 1973 when it reached a peak.  Output dropped by about 1 per cent in 1974 and by a further 7 per cent in 1975.  It increased by 4 per cent in 1976 and by a mere 2.5 per cent in 1977.</P>

      <P>With the agreement of representatives of the builders and the workers, the Government gave a major boost to the industry in 1978 and again this year.  The Deputy failed, of course, to say that between 1973 and 1977 direct employment in the industry fell from 85,000 to 77,000.  Since July 1977 direct employment in the industry has increased by about 7,000.  There has also <Col N="1376" /> been a further increase in employment in ancillary industries.  I make no apology for lifting the industry up off the gutter and shortening the dole queues.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to the massive support given by the Government to the industry since 1977, in consultation with representatives of builders and workers. I could have taken the easy option of providing for a modest growth rate of 4 per cent to 5 per cent a year, but this would not have eased the record level of unemployment in the building industry when the Coalition left office.  At present the question of the training needs of the industry is being specially examined in consultation with the industry.</P>
      <P>One of the primary reasons for the scarcity of skilled labour in the industry is the fact that there was a decline in the number of houses built during 1976 and early 1977.  There was a lack of confidence in the industry.  Since late 1977 that confidence has been restored.  People did not go into apprenticeships in the industry at that time, but they are now doing so and, within a short time, we hope to have a skilled labour force capable of handling the industry again.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn said the abolition of rates combined with the £1,000 grant was a fantastic subsidy to people already housed.  There is no doubt but that the abolition of rates is of great financial assistance to people already housed.  That was one of the Government's aims at the time.  What the Deputy forgot to emphasise is that tenants and tenant purchasers of local authority houses also benefit from this decision.  It is, however, nonsense to talk of the £1,000 grant being a subsidy to people already housed. This grant is payable to first-time owner-occupiers of new houses and flats.  If a person already owns a house and decides to change house, he will not qualify for the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn also referred to a shortfall of over £11 million in 1978 in capital expenditure in the non-local authority housing sector and said money should have been applied to local authority housing.  The shortfall in expenditure occurred mainly on SDA loans.  The main reason for the shortfall was that it was difficult to anticipate the <Col N="1377" /> effect of the increases in the loan and income limits made by the Government in July 1977.  The previous limits had remained unchanged since September 1973.  It was decided not to apply the savings to the building industry because it was clear that the level of activity in the industry was already very high when the savings became apparent.  In fact total capital expenditure on housing increased by £29 million last year. Further, the diversion of the SDA savings to local authority housing would give rise to an unwarranted increase in housing subsidies.</P>
    <P>The Deputy did not, of course, refer to the saving of some £16 million in SDA loans in 1976.  Total capital expenditure on housing dropped that year by £10 million relative to the previous year. At that time the building industry badly needed a boost.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully challenged the accuracy of figures I quoted showing changes in output in the building industry.  We referred in this context to changes in the completions of local authority dwellings. I was quoting figures based on output in the entire building industry of which local authority housing is only one component.</P>

      <P>The housing programme was at a low level.  The morale of those involved in the construction industry was very low before Fianna Fáil returned to office.  Since July 1977 the Government have increased substantially the allocations to local authorities for housing.  They have also provided a tremendous incentive to people to build their own houses, persons who would otherwise be still on the local authority waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said he knew a family who waited for seven years to be rehoused.  I was speaking to a knowledgeable person in South County Dublin today who told me that at a recent meeting the council were quite justified in allocating a house to a young married couple with a child a few months old.  He told me that in that area there are about 800 houses in the <Col N="1378" /> pipeline.  There is no serious problem there because they know the finance is on the way.  The Government have already allocated money for existing commitments to housing authorities. They have already allocated money to allow them to make starts and to continue with the programme up to 31 July. It will then be reviewed and they will get more money to enable them to carry on. There is no such thing as a scarcity of money for the housing programme. There is no such thing as a scarcity of money for the construction industry at present.</P>

      <P>The Minister's final statement is very welcome.  It is a pity the Minister for Finance is not present in the House.  There is no scarcity of money for anything according to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.  I will not get involved in arguments about ideology.  I suggest that the Minister is in need of a large injection of reality.  For the past 30 minutes this House has been given a treatise on how people should provide their own houses.</P>
      <P>The motion reads:</P>
      <P> That Dáil Éireann deplores the hopelessly inadequate allocation of finance by the Government to housing authorities in respect of new house starts for the current year.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by an tAire Comhshaoil reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Welcomes the generous provision made in the Public Capital Programme...&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;and so on.  We are talking about the provision of houses for people who cannot provide this basic facility by themselves for themselves.  This is the point at issue.  Giving us large chunks of a speech concerning the building industry and telling us how healthy it is and how unhealthy it was when the National Coalition were in office, whether that is right or wrong, is totally and absolutely irrelevant.  It has nothing to do with the provision of social housing. <Col N="1379" /> It will not promote that cause one iota and I ask the Minister to desist from that kind of evasive speech in relation to this serious social issue.</P>
    <P>He gave us some figures and when challenged on these figures by a former Minister who should know what he is talking about&mdash;and I am sure does know what he is talking about&mdash;he told us he was dealing with the figures for a calendar year.  We are back to the evasive terminology which has become part and parcel of this House recently. When challenged on figures, Ministers and Ministers of State tell us they are talking about annualised figures, about calendar year figures and everything else but not about actual, real figures.  We end up on this side of the House not even knowing what Minister are talking about.  I am afraid that the Minister of State is not too sure at times what he is talking about.</P>
    <P>The reality of the current situation is the following figures which I think are the correct ones.  In 1977 for local authority housing the sum of £74.1 million was provided.  In 1978 a sum of £80.77 million was provided, which represents an increase of 8.25 per cent. In 1979 the sum of £86 million was provided, representing an increase of 6.1 per cent.  In his speech last night the Minister mentioned that £90 million had been made available, but he failed to give information about the extra £4 million. My guess is that it may have come about because of the extra money available to the Department through the withdrawal of the VAT refund facility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That increase would bring the figure roughly to a 12½ per cent increase.  It has been admitted in this House by the Minister that inflation in actual building itself amounted to 28 per cent in the past year.  That does not take into account the major inflationary element, namely, the cost of land.  One could think of any figure there depending on the area and one could end up with an increase of 30 per cent to 50 per cent on land alone.  There is an admitted inflation figure of 28 per cent given by the Minister, but we are now told that we are getting £5.23 million plus overdraft accommodation for an extra £4 million which brings the amount to about 12 per cent.  That is not nearly enough even to stand still and keep up with inflation let alone to make inroads into the soaring numbers on the housing lists.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned some figures concerning the housing lists.  In a reply concerning approved and unprocessed applications on hand for the local authorities at 30 September 1978 all the county, urban and county borough areas are given.  The reply states that the number of approved applications was 27,515; the number of unprocessed applications was 7,569, which means a total of 35,084.  From my interpretation of what the Minister of State said, he is assuming that none of the 7,569 unprocessed applications will be approved. I interpret that from the figures he gave. If that is so, there is a major shortfall in what is being provided as against the total applications.  From the inflation figures quoted and the moneys made available that gap is widening at an even greater rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also gave figures concerning the major improvements made by his Government on the private sector front.  In fact, the figures for housing applications show that people whom one might expect would be providing their own houses are now being driven on to the local authority lists because of the fiercely escalating costs.  The Minister knows that.  I am sure he has advised people on the completion of application forms for SDA loans and has told them where to go to get the shortfall of <Col N="1381" /> £4,000, £5,000 or £6,000, together with Government grants.  These are the facts so far as the provision of a house is concerned for a young couple starting out in life.</P>
    <P>In my own area in east Mayo, and I am sure in Kerry, there are people now joining the local authority housing queue who would not have dreamt of doing so three, four or five years ago because there was still a ray of hope that they might be able to provide a house for themselves.  This is a major social problem.  The Minister has spoken about the White Paper.  It would seem that Fianna Fáil White Papers on housing policy during the years have all been for private ownership of houses.  We all concur with that, but the anomaly arises when that same party or Government come along and put private housing beyond the reach of the person whom they were encouraging to own a private house, putting him back on the local authority list and then not doing enough to ensure that he gets a house.  At that stage they renege on their responsibility and social obligations.  We are now facing a major social problem as a result of this double-think which has been evident during the years and which is gaining momentum at the moment in the policy adopted by this Government.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the provision of social housing by local authorities is now evident.  There are two factors involved: the provision of land and the provision of money to purchase that land.  As a member of a local authority I have sat for hours through meetings.  I have taken part in debates concerning the purchase of lands for road widening and for houses.  Much time was spent discussing what should be bought and how much.  At the end of the day somebody asked &ldquo;Have we money to buy this land?&rdquo;  only to discover that the answer was in the negative.  That is happening now with the result that land banks are not there, particularly in major urban areas where the price of land is escalating out of all proportion.  Yet, we are not in a position to increase our land banks.  It would be another way of getting people off the local authority housing lists if moneys <Col N="1382" /> were provided by the Exchequer to local authorities to purchase land, service it and sell serviced sites.  This would be an incentive to people to build or purchase their own homes whether on a cooperative basis or as individuals availing of the grants of which the Minister boasted a while ago.  A serviced site at a reasonable cost would be a very strong inducement to people to build or purchase houses and would serve the double purpose of at the same time having people taken off the local authority housing lists.</P>
    <P>Despite the final word of the Minister of State asserting that there was money available for housing and the building industry, I do not think that is a reality. The money is not there either for housing or the building industry to the extent needed.  The Minister knows that and should refrain from making wild assertions in the House in the hope that on the eve of an election it may gain some votes.  That sort of statement has lost all credibility coming from the Minister and his party.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke boastfully about the provisions made available in the last 20 months or so in the private sector and about this famous&mdash;or is it infamous?&mdash;£1,000 grant.  That has nothing to do with the people to whom the motion refers, people who need, not a £1,000 grant but a £10,000, £11,000 or £12,000 grant to provide themselves with a house.  That is the reality.  The red herring of the £1,000 together with the provision of a £9,000 loan and a low-rise mortgage scheme do not face fairly and squarely the problem confronting the country and particularly the Minister of State responsible for housing.  It is totally irrelevant and does nothing to justify the Minister's actions.  It does not do himself justice as a person or as a Minister.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to the present position in regard to incentives for the provision of private dwellings by people themselves.  I shall be very brief on this because I think it is irrelevant and I mention it only&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is quite right. The cost of financing a house by the private individual availing of the £9,000 SDA loan runs at £128.37 per £1,000. We know what £9,000 would provide; it would not provide a dwelling house. Everybody knows that the most modest type of dwelling house at present and any site around that house involves from £14,000 to £19,000.  Taking the lower figure of £14,000 there is a shortfall of £5,000 which, on the seven-year personal loan basis in any bank, costs about £23 per week.  Add to that the £22 or £23 repayments on the SDA loan and the total repayments will be somewhere in the region of £46 or £47 per week.  To become eligible for that £9,000 loan your income must be under £77 per week: I understand the means have been increased from £3,500 to £4,500.  So, a young couple, with or without a family, are being asked to pay £46 or £47 weekly in mortgage repayments out of a total income of £77.  It is unreal, illogical and anti-social to expect such a system to work.  The damage accruing to society in general from that kind of pressure on any young married couple must be disastrous. Yet the Minister of State can boast of the fact that this sort of pressure is being put on that couple without making any provision to see that something is done to curb the massive increase in the price of building land and housing costs generally.</P>
      <P>Last year, for example, I am told that the price of imported timber decreased. That is a major element in any house and yet we have massive increases in the overall costs of housing.  The only conclusion I can reach is that somebody somewhere is making an absolute &ldquo;kill&rdquo;&mdash;be it the developer or the builder.  I do not know where to point the finger but it should be pointed at somebody.  Houses are being built for £19,000, £17,000 and £18,000 which could be built for £10,000 and £12,000.  An enormous rake-off is taking place somewhere and the Minister should see where and why it is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a very strong rural bias and should seek to ensure that people born and reared in rural areas should be allowed to live there.  From my experience <Col N="1384" /> in certain local authorities there is a trend&mdash;I appreciate the reasons for it but they do not justify the end&mdash;for people, particularly old people, to be forced out of their rural environment into town housing schemes.  This is a very tidy and possibly less expensive way of housing people because in these schemes water and sewerage facilities and so on are laid on.  It is quite cheap to build houses in these circumstances.  It is very unfair to expect people who have spent their lives in a rural setting on their own land to uproot themselves and go into a town.  They may be small towns but to such people they are conurbations to which they will never become accustomed. That is what is happening.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that such pressures as are being brought to bear by certain sections of his Department would be terminated forthwith.</P>

      <P>As a local representative I know of cases where the local authority have failed, having tendered for a contractor two or three times, to get a contractor to build a house on a particular site in a rural area because, despite the estimate given, the Department will not sanction the amount of money which the estimate comes to.  It may be subtle pressure but the pressure that counts is non-availability of funds.  If a person cannot get a rural cottage provided for him by the local authority he has no option but to uproot himself and go into a housing scheme.  That is happening and I do not care what the Minister says.  I am sure the Minister will agree with what I am saying.  He may not be responsible for this personally but as Minister he must bear responsibility for it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has failed to answer the question about whether there is a limit on the cost.  There is a limit on the unit cost.  If the unit cost is the cost of the house, then I accept that <Col N="1386" /> the Minister has said there is a limit on the cost of providing a rural cottage and that limit is fixed from time to time.  I know there is a limit.  It is depriving people of houses in their own localities.  The Minister is aware of that.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have responsibilities but they cannot go beyond the amount of money made available to them.  Their obligations and demands for the provision of housing cannot stretch further than the money made available to them. Two into one will not go.</P>
      <P>I should like to reiterate the major problems facing us.  From his speech last night the Minister seemed to indicate that he is happy with the progress being made, despite increasing numbers on waiting lists and despite the fact that people who should be providing their own houses are coming onto local authority housing lists due to the indifference and apathy both of the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to control the price of housing materials.  These are serious matters which must be confronted by somebody sometime.  The present administration are either unwilling or incapable of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This evening a Government spokesman made a reference to the fact that Deputy Quinn, speaking last night, reflected on the Department's officials in regard to housing.  I should like to make it clear that that was not his intention.  There is no way in which anyone who knows anything about housing or about the Department of the Environment would reflect on the officials. No matter what Government are in office, they are an excellent set of officials who do their job well and there is no intention to reflect on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials will do what the Minister tells them and the Minister will, in the main, do what the Government tell him to do.  What we are talking about is not what the officials or what the Minister did but what the Government told him to do.  What is the Government's policy on local authority housing?  That is very clear to anyone who is interested.  The Government's policy was enunciated on 17 December 1975 and again on 26 <Col N="1387" /> January 1976 by the Taoiseach, then Leader of the Opposition, when he said that what was wrong was that too many local authority houses were being built in proportion to the total number of houses being built.  That is the policy of the present Government.  While the previous Government were in office and I had the honour to be Minister for Local Government, we decided on two things; one was that we would attempt to build 25,000 houses per year.  I congratulate the Minister for the Environment on achieving the building of 25,000 houses last year.  Unlike my predecessors in office and the Fianna Fáil speakers when I was in office, I am prepared to accept these figures without any question; the figures given are correct.  This is a great achievement. Twenty-five thousand houses per year; over a period of the life of the Government which was slightly over four years, we built 101,000 houses.</P>
    <P>Our second achievement was to build local authority houses for those who needed them.  This is where the present Government and we differ. The present Government, quite obviously, do not want to build local authority houses for those who need them.  The Minister of State at the end of his speech made what I would consider a rather sneering reference to the cost of centre city housing. I would point out to him that all over the years Fianna Fáil fell down on centre city housing and fell down for a number of reasons.  One of the main reasons was that the then Fianna Fáil Ministers for Local Government had not the courage to sign CPOs for the purpose of making available land in the centre city when houses could have been built at a reasonable cost.  In the 1960s when these CPOs were presented for signature, the Ministers would not sign them, and houses which could then have been built for around £1,000 are costing an awful lot to build.  Instead of signing the CPOs and building the houses there the then Fianna Fáil Government decided to move housing out to the perimeter and to build satellite towns.</P>
    <P>Most of the people living in these satellite towns are quite happy and are <Col N="1388" /> living in an area where they are at home. People living in the city centre wanted to remain there and the people who now live there want to remain there.  It is ridiculous for anybody&mdash;and particularly ridiculous for a Minister of State&mdash;to talk about the colossal cost of building sites and building houses in the city centre.  Do not forget this; those people who moved out to the perimeter of the city and are working in the city have to travel every day on already overloaded roads and streets.  The State, or somebody else, had to build schools for them, provide doctors, provide churches, provide shops.  All these things had to be provided in the new areas, while the ones already here in the city centre were left idle.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister quite plainly that, no matter what the cost, the centre of this city and of all other cities and towns in this country must be built up. That is where people should live, if they want to live there.  A cost analysis would show that, in the main, it is as cheap, or cheaper, to live in the city centre as in the perimeter.</P>
    <P>I am very proud of one thing.  During my term as Minister, I persuaded the Government to agree to provide the necessary money to Dublin Corporation who were, mind you, willing enough to say that they wanted to build in the city centre but had made no move to do so while Fianna Fáil were in power, obviously because they knew they would not get the money to do it.  I persuaded the Government to give me the money, and the Minister last night was rather apologetic about the amount of money being given to Dublin City and County and Dun Laoghaire for building houses. Let me say to him that there is no necessity whatever to be apologetic about that.  Dublin City and County and Dun Laoghaire are the areas where there is most trouble about housing and this is where the money must be spent, whether he, or I, or anybody else likes it.  I am not speaking as a Dublin man.  We must cater for those with the most needs.  We got barracking enough from the present Government when they were on this side of the House.  They had all the answers; they have only the questions now.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil took over, we had <Col N="1389" /> reached the stage where we had not seen the end, or a prospect of the end, of the demand for local authority housing, but at least we were making a genuine effort to provide houses for those who needed them.  When Fianna Fáil took over, in the first year they built 7,263 houses.  I do not think the Minister, or his Minister of State, or anybody else, would attempt to claim that that was Fianna Fáil planning. In 1977 they built 6,333; in 1978 they built 6,073.  What did they build in 1979? Would anyone like to guess that it would be down another thousand? These are the people who tell us that the building industry is doing well under a Fianna Fáil Government.  One of the tricks used by the present Government over many years is that when anybody tries to corner them on their bad record in housing, and they have a bad record in housing, they always come back to the old one, the building industry.  Would somebody try to explain?  I have not the time to explain fully what the building industry covers.  The Minister is well aware&mdash;perhaps more aware than most people here because of his position&mdash;that the building industry covers so many things that housing is a relatively small part of it.  The sooner the Government realise that the real crux is local authority housing the better.  They are bragging about all the money going into the building societies.  Nobody is as glad as I am of that, and that this money is being used for housing.</P>
    <P>Do not forget, when we took over back in 1973 there was not a lot of money going into the building societies and there was not an awful lot of that money being provided for building local authority houses.  It took a deal of work and time to bring around the present position.  I put through a Bill which modernised the building society law, which was 102 years old and which allowed a State guarantee for building societies which the present Minister, to his credit, introduced at the appropriate time.  We would have done it.  Some people might say that if we had been politically astute enough we would have done it before the election, but it was not necessary guarantees from these building societies and the necessary <Col N="1390" /> terms worked out.  The present Minister did this and it brought a colossal amount of money into the building societies. Funds which were not available to the building societies before that are now available and I am glad to see that.  A large amount of the money being spent in building houses is coming out of the building societies, not out of State funds. The sooner that is remembered, the better.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the SDA loans and the low-rise mortgages. I introduced the low-rise mortgage scheme in November 1976.  The position then was that it would apply to a man and his wife who were on the housing list with the local authority for 12 months and had one child.  I still differ from the officials on their interpretation of one child at the time.  My interpretation of it is that one child applies to the time when the loan was applied for.  I should have seen that difficulty and I did not.  When the time came to change the scheme it was changed to a parent and child and it completely ignored the greater demand, in my opinion, of the two parents, or the two people who perhaps had no family, had only just got married, or were married for a number of years and had no children.  Why were they not included? I will tell you why. The low-rise mortgage scheme costs money and that is one thing this Government do not want to spend on the type of people who would avail of it.</P>
    <P>We are told that if they do not want to avail of the low-rise mortgage, the SDA loan up to £9,000 is available to people with up to £77 a week.  They would be the people who would be able to avail of the scheme.  With £77 a week you can borrow a maximum of £9,000 if the local authority are satisfied that you are a suitable person to give £9,000 to and are able to repay it.  Take a man with a couple of children who has £77 per week gross.  Consider his outgoings or whatever he has to pay before he brings any money home.  His take-home pay may be £68 a week and the repayment over a period of 30 years is £22-odd a week for his £9,000 loan.  What is he going to live on?  While he has that £9,000 loan what does he do? <Col N="1391" /> Not many years ago local authorities would have sites.  They would take over land on which they intended to build local authority houses and they would rent or sell those sites to prospective house builders who qualified for them at a couple of hundred pounds a site.  Now the lowest amount which would be charged for one of those sites is something in the region of £2,000 and it may well be up to £3,000.  Take that from the £9,000 and where do we find ourselves?  What is the person going to build the house with?  He may go to the bank with his letter from the local authority saying that they intend to give him a loan of £9,000 when he has the house completed.  That is no good to the man who is going to build the house.  He must have money in his hand as the house goes on and so he goes to the bank and if he is lucky he borrows a few thousand pounds on the strength of the guarantee from the local authority.  He finishes up paying that, starting to repay the £9,000 loan when he gets it from the local authority and if he is lucky enough to finish his house&mdash;God knows how he will do it&mdash;he then has to furnish it, start off a life, try to keep his family and pay for their upkeep with less than £77 a week.</P>
    <P>I was criticised when I was Minister because I would not increase the income limit for the loan and I would not increase the loan.  A very good reason to me at the time was that, while house prices were nothing like they are now, those who do not understand and those who have never had to live on a small income cannot see the point that there is no use in saying to somebody, &ldquo;You can have a loan of that amount of money&rdquo; if the person is not in a position to repay it. You are simply dangling something in front of him which is of no use to him. Instead of doing that I made the decision, which the Government accepted, that the proper thing to do was to build houses for those who really needed those houses, and we continued to do that.</P>
    <P>The present Government are determined that they are not going to build houses for local authority tenants, that <Col N="1392" /> the amount of subsidy which they have to pay on it is far too high.  The Minister and the Minister of State talked about the amount of additional money which was given by the State to local authorities.  Even if you count the £4 million extra which the local authorities were entitled to borrow, it does not bring any more than about 10 per cent while the increase in the cost of houses last year was approximately 28 per cent.  The result is that we are giving to the local authorities from the Central Fund less real money than they were getting three or four years ago and what is being said to those local authorities by the State is, &ldquo;It is all right, you do not have to build houses.  We do not expect you to.&rdquo; Fianna Fáil never believed in giving good housing to the working class.  They are useful only on days like 7 June, but this will be remembered on this coming 7 June and for a long time to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this motion because the Government have been speaking around it and not about it.  We should get down to the basic facts of life and the reason why this motion was put down, which was to make more money available for local authority housing. Certainly we have had an increase in the allocation of funds for local authority housing, but when one weights inflation against our allocation we are in a minus situation in a big way.  The Government cannot deny that.  We are heading slowly for a housing crisis in this country, particularly in urban areas and most particularly in Dublin.  We had housing crises before, in the 1960s, but we are heading for a major one now.  This is not because people are afraid to provide for themselves.  They are not; they want to provide for themselves but they get no assistance whatsoever from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their manifesto the Government talked about the £1,000 grant.  This £1,000 was a bonus for the builder and not a help to the housebuyer.  Since the time that £1,000 was made available costs have escalated out of control.  I am surprised that the Minister has not called for a public inquiry into the housebuilding industry regarding the profits <Col N="1393" /> and the extortion methods being used against unfortunate people.  As a result now people cannot raise the wherewithal.  If they go to a building society today for help they must have been 12 months with that building society and they must have at least £1,500 or £2,000 invested therein.  If they want to buy a house that is the prerequisite with the building society.  If they go to the local authority they must be earning £3,500.</P>

      <P>The Minister introduced a system of having to produce a tax certificate in order to get a loan. Previously at least you could go to your employer and ask for a statement of earnings and you could get a written statement that your earnings were, say, £3,850 per year.  The Government raised the amount but they used despicable methods to try to stop people from getting loans.  It is ridiculous.  The Minister knows this.

      <P>We are talking about today and about people wanting genuinely to buy houses.  People who want to provide houses for themselves are barred from doing so by the income limit.  Most people who work in industry today earn in excess of the limit.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that the building industry is doing well.  As Deputy Tully said, the building industry may be doing well but the house building industry is not doing well.  The introduction of the low-rise mortgage by Deputy Tully was like a breath of fresh air.  It was an innovation in the area of house purchase.  I disagree with the rules that one must be on the housing list for 12 months and must have a child for 12 months.  The low-rise mortgages should be available to newly-weds as they are the ones who are trying to provide homes for themselves.  Why should they have to wait until they have had a child for 12 months?  The rules of the scheme suggest that it was never meant to work.</P>
      <P>The best way to encourage people to provide homes for themselves is to give them low-rise mortgage.  We should also subsidise the provision of mortgages by building societies.  The Government have not shown any imagination in the matter.  Even the Government would admit that the £1,000 grant is useless.  The Minister has not attempted to curb the escalating cost of housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> It is clear that the Government are not interested in local authority housing.  A reading of the White Paper suggests that the Government intend to cut back on local authority housing.  When we were in Government we committed ourselves to the re-development of the inner city. Since Fianna Fáil came into office the only thing they have said about inner city housing is that it is expensive.  Of course the cost of inner city housing is expensive.  In Clondalkin the best agricultural land is being used for the building of roads, churches and schools. We have the same situation in the inner city area.  Small-minded bureaucrats count only the cost of the bricks and mortar being used on local authority housing in the city instead of the overall cost in social and economic terms.  They may claim that they are building in New Street, in the cattle market and so on. These commitments were entered into by the previous Government.  When those houses are built I believe that Dublin will be allowed to slide into deterioration again.  The Government are not interested in long-term proposals; they are only interested in expediency. They were elected on their promises and have now been in Government for two years.  During this time there has been a decline in our housing <Col N="1396" /> programme, a decline in the commitment to regenerate the city.</P>

      <P>They have not committed themselves to inner city housing. In their current local election campaign they are saying that they are building this, that and the other.  They have neither built nor planned.  They have allowed the housing programme to run down because of the high inflation rate. A few years ago houses were built for £7,000.  The same houses now cost £14,000, and in the city centre they cost £27,000.  The Government have not investigated the rise in building costs. They have not done so because their friends in the building industry made it possible for them to be in Government. We shall see the greatest housing crisis and its attendant social problems if more money is not allocated for local authority housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising this evening the situation in regard to the regulations introduced by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in regard to the petrol situation in this country.  I would describe those regulations as purely cosmetic.  They constitute an absolute failure by the Government to bring about any improvement in the petrol situation. I shall deal with this from two approaches: one, the disastrous effects the petrol shortage is having on our tourist industry and, secondly, that no proper regulations have been introduced by the Minister in regard to diesel being provided for farmers.</P>
      <P>In regard to the regulations, anybody who has any commonsense and who is moving around this city or the countryside will see that they are not being adhered to for the simple reason that the petrol stations have not sufficient quantities of petrol at present.  There is no doubt about that whatsoever.  The petrol stations are endeavouring to keep as many people happy as they can but they just have not sufficient quantities to provide the necessary fuel.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley, the Minister, has been saying that people were queueing up for 50p or a £'s worth for topping up purposes.  That is totally incorrect.  There may be the odd crank or two looking for 50p worth to top up but the ordinary commonsense people will not waste their time queueing at petrol stations if they can get by without doing so.  That is one fact of life that should be realised: that most people who are queueing at petrol stations are doing so because they need the fuel.</P>
      <P>The fuel and petrol shortage has been aggravated completely by the postal dispute. Throughout the length and breadth of the country people are having to travel around to deliver letters&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is dealing with petrol, not with the postal dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, Sir, but people are having to travel by motor car to deliver letters and make arrangements for the delivery of post; that is in areas where there are telephones.  But in an area where there are neither letters nor telephones people are having to travel around making arrangements to deliver messages, post and so on.  All of this activity is eating into our already scarce energy supplies.  It means also that the shortage of petrol is further aggravated and is causing unnecessary travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> Another matter with which the Minister has made no effort to cope is that of petrol stations closing early on week days and at week-ends which is causing very serious problems.  One could notice the build-up after last weekend on Monday, yesterday and again today.  This situation will be aggravated further over the holiday weekend, the next fortnight or so.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is aware that the projections of revenue from our tourist industry this year amount to approximately £320 million. I understand that Bord Fáilte are carrying out a review of their projected figures.  I do not know why they have not issued their revised projections but it is my opinion that those projections will be cut by approximately half.  Therefore, because of the energy problem and the postal dispute there will be an approximate loss to our economy this year of £150 million.  This is not something that will happen next week or in a fortnight's time; it has happened already and is going on as I speak.  I believe it will mean a direct loss to our economy of approximately £150 million, which is a shattering figure and something about which everybody is alarmed.  I live in the heart of the country in an area where we have neither post nor petrol.  I am meeting people involved in the hotel and tourist industry who are really taking me to task about this situation.  All I can do is to endeavour to bring the seriousness of the situation to the attention of the Minister and of allowing it to continue unabated.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is a sensible man.  He is aware that our tourist industry in recent years has been increasing steadily; the figures have been rising each year.  This year not alone will they level off but they will drop considerably unless some efforts are made to remedy a serious situation.</P>
    <P>I want a categorical answer from the Minister to this question.  Does he not agree with me that his Department know that rationing is absolutely necessary?  I believe, if the postal services were restored, we would immediately have petrol rationing.  The only reason we have not got it now is that the Department <Col N="1400" /> of Industry, Commerce and Energy are unable to distribute the ration books throughout the country to the people who will be using them.  If they were given to Bord Fáilte they would not be able to distribute them either.</P>
    <P>The only way to improve the situation is to resolve the postal strike and to ration petrol.  I urge the Minister and the Government to stop shilly-shallying in regard to the postal dispute and have negotiations take place between the responsible Minister and the Post Office Workers' Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to do so.  I do not want to be critical about this matter without providing a remedy. Once the postal services are restored ration books can be provided for the people using petrol.  I have been told that when people with their cars arrive at our ports and they realise they cannot be guaranteed a supply of petrol they stay one night and leave.  No effort is being made to try to remedy this situation.</P>
      <P>There were two letters published in yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i> dealing with this matter.  One of them was from Tom and Rosaleen Maher, Bush Hotel, Carrick-on-Shannon and told about the considerable drop in their hotel bookings. Last year they had advanced bookings of 404 bed-nights and this year they have 105.  The second letter was from a person in Holland who was arranging nine coach tours of 40 people each.  He said:</P>
      <P> I may get stuck with the passengers somewhere in the country because of lack of diesel for the coach.</P>
      <P>This makes him seriously question if he will come to Ireland.  I ask the Minister to make a serious effort to have the postal dispute resolved and bring in petrol rationing for our tourist industry. My time is limited and I am prevented from discussing the matter further but rationing should be introduced for farmers who will be using machinery to cut silage in the near future.</P>

I assumed Deputy Enright would make a serious contribution which would justify keeping the staff of the House here after 8.30 p.m.  I realise, after listening to him, as everybody else must, that all he is doing is playing to a gallery in his constituency for a local election which he is fighting on 7 June.  His contribution had more to do with the postal dispute than with the petrol shortage.  He mentioned the orders made by the Minister but he did not refer to the original order made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The first order stated:</P>
      <P> In the period beginning on the commencement of this Order and ending on the 30th day of June, 1979, an oil wholesaler, oil retailer or a distributor shall, in the delivery of gas diesel oil, give priority to the delivery of such oil for the purposes of the following&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  agriculture,</P>
      <P>(b)  commerce,</P>
      <P>(c)  fisheries,</P>
      <P>(d)  hospitals and similar institutions,</P>
      <P>(e)  industry,</P>
      <P>(f)  tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines were clearly set down there and those are the guidelines which are being worked on.  Nobody doubts that there is a petrol shortage.  The demand for petrol in Ireland has increased considerably over the past 12 months because of the phenomenal growth rate as a result of the policies carried out by the Government despite the totally irresponsible accusations made by Deputy Enright.  It is a proven fact that we have seen a phenomenal growth rate in the last 12 months and, consequently, <Col N="1402" /> because of the world shortage&mdash;other countries right across Europe are also short of petrol&mdash;it is hitting us harder. We cannot expect to be immune from the effect of a tightness in supply.</P>
    <P>There is not an unlimited supply of petrol in the world market at the moment. The price orders made last weekend should help considerably in alleviating the shortage of petrol. However, it will take 10 to 14 days for the effect of the higher prices to be reflected in increased deliveries of petrol to the Irish market by the oil companies. We have had discussions with the oil companies and they have been asked to respond to the favourable climate now created for supplying oil here.  All of them have indicated that they are doing everything in their power to get the additional supplies of petrol and other oil products into our market.  Even the Deputy will realise that it takes 10 to 14 days for it to be shipped and to be sent to the filling stations.</P>
    <P>As far as tourism is concerned, the Minister, speaking on 8 May last&mdash;I also spoke on this Private Members' Motion&mdash;made the point that we are giving special attention to the problems of the tourist industry and are doing everything in our power to sort out any difficulties.  The oil companies are assisting us in this.  As far as coach tours are concerned we have arranged that special facilities for the diesel needs of tourist operators will be met.  I do not know what the quotation the Deputy gave from the gentleman in Holland is about.  It highlights the totally irresponsible nature of the case put up by the Deputy to say that no topping up was going on.  There was but this, to a great extent, has been sorted out as a result of the £5 minimum purchase order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not in need of rationing during the present difficulties, which will be pretty well sorted out within 10 to 14 days.  Rationing is a last resort which in many ways creates more problems than it will ever solve.  It might suit Deputy Enright in a local election <Col N="1403" /> campaign to say that the only reason it has not been brought in is the postal strike but those are not the facts of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the agricultural community and their supposed problems, as outlined by Deputy Enright, I assure him that any problems that have been brought to the attention of the <Col N="1404" /> Department&mdash;there are very few from the agricultural area&mdash;are being looked after.  The needs of the agricultural community are being more than adequately met.  I would like to go into more detail but, even if I had time, the arguments put up by Deputy Enright do not warrant a more lengthy reply.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 11.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24 May 1979.</P>

      <P>The claim made by the whole-time clerical staffs employed at comprehensive and community schools has been the subject of a Labour Court recommendation. My Department have accepted the recommendation.  Implementation of the recommendation has been held up at the request of the ITGWU to give them an opportunity to discuss its details with officials of my Department. A meeting for that purpose is taking place today.</P>
