      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 5 (resumed), 6 (resumed), 7 (resumed) and 8.  Private Members' Business will be taken between 7 p.m. and 8.30 p.m., No. 15 (resumed), by agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach come to any decision yet about allowing a special debate on the subjects I raised yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I intimated yesterday that the Whips could discuss the matter with a view to seeing whether agreement could be reached about finishing certain items of business on the Order Paper which were discussed yesterday and which will be discussed today.  I understand that the Whips have failed to agree to conclude that business, so I do not propose then to give time otherwise unless such agreement can be come to. Perhaps it can be reached in the course of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some business on the Order Paper which obviously could not be finished.  It is important, but not urgent.  It could not be finished this side of Christmas, never mind today. Would the Taoiseach consider giving a debate even on the industrial relations position which is, according to the papers this morning, deteriorating further?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I left it to the Whips to consider whether it is possible to conclude, if not all the business which is on the Order Paper, at least some of it.  I understand that no suggestion whatever has been forthcoming to conclude any item on the Order Paper.  The Opposition cannot have it both ways.  They are calling for debates on what they describe as matters of importance and then regarding others as so urgent and important that they cannot agree to finish them.  We cannot put one aside in order to take the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>An Foras Talúntais, who receive the majority of their income from State finance, are being given power to borrow under this Bill.  Up to this almost all the State companies which were given the power to borrow were self-financing companies.  Their income is derived from their activities which covers their outgoings. They are in a similar position to companies in the private sector&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to now, with one exception, no State company who were largely State financed and did not have an income of their own were allowed the power to borrow.  It is perfectly legitimate to give a body the power to borrow if they are a commercial body, even though they may be State owned, who are earning money with which they can repay that borrowing.  It is a strange procedure to give a body who do not have an income of their own, independent of whatever they receive from the State, the power to borrow in the same way one gives it to a body like the ESB or CIE who have an income derived from the sale of their services.  The income which Foras Talúntais have from the sale of their services is very small by comparison with their total income, most of which comes from the State.</P>
      <P>It is not basically a good idea to give a State financed company the power to borrow because they are borrowing against future income which will come from the State.  They are earmarking perhaps five, ten, 15 or 20 years in advance income which they will have to get from the State.  They are borrowing money now and the money to repay that will have to come from the State in 15 or 20 years time.  There is an old principle in parliamentary democracy that no parliament has the power to bind its successor. If we allow companies to borrow and their borrowings have to be repaid by the State when they fall due in 15 or 20 years time we are binding a succeeding administration to produce money for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>AnCO or CERT&mdash;I am not sure which&mdash;have already been given the power to borrow and they are not self-financing.  Although there are 30 State companies which have the power to borrow, they are self-financing companies engaged in commercial activities. We have now the case where a non self-financing <Col N="1076" /> body is being given the power to borrow.  Whereas a commercial company by virtue of its commercial operations can expect to have an income derived from its activities with which it can repay the borrowing, the income to repay the borrowing of a State financed company must come from the State. This creates a new situation and one that is hard to justify.  It is legitimate for the Minister for Finance to borrow to finance activity of a non-self-financing nature, but there is a safeguard in that it is the Minister who is doing the borrowing. Ultimately he will be responsible for that and will be answerable to the Dáil. If we delegate to subsidiary bodies the power to borrow against repayment by the State, there is no central answerability in respect of the borrowing as there is when the borrowing is done by the State itself and for which the Minister for Finance is answerable to this House.</P>
      <P>If An Foras Talúntais borrow substantially under the power now proposed to be given, will the Minister for Finance be answerable for that borrowing, will it be the Minister for Agriculture or will both Ministers say that this is a matter internal to AnCOT and that they cannot comment on whether the borrowing was justified or how the money is being used. It is a serious erosion of parliamentary sovereignty if we devolve to a body that is not directly answerable to this House the power to borrow substantial amounts against the inevitable repayment by the State.  I know in the case of commercial companies that borrow the State gives a guarantee and there is a possibility that the State may be called on to exercise that guarantee and to repay if the company's activities do not yield an income sufficient to enable it to repay but that is only a possibility, and indeed a very unlikely one.</P>
      <P>However, in the case of An Foras Talúntais and the one or two bodies that have been given the power to borrow, it is not a question of a possible repayment by the State but an inevitable repayment by the State.  A new principle is being established and before I go further with the amendment I should like to hear the Minister's justification for giving this power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing new in this power of borrowing that will be given to An Foras Talúntais. Many bodies such as county councils, health boards and county committees of agriculture can borrow, as can the National Agricultural Authority.  That power was given by the National Coalition. Borrowing by An Foras Talúntais must be approved by the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Section 21 of this Bill is copied exactly from section 50 of the 1977 Act to give An Foras Talúntais the same borrowing powers that were given to The National Agricultural Authority in the 1977 Act.  Under this Bill these powers are being given to An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta.  In my opinion amendment No. 60, in the names of Deputy Bruton and Deputy D'Arcy, is far too restrictive.  It restricts borrowing by An Foras Talúntais not only to borrowing for capital purposes but also to borrowing for capital purposes of a nature likely to yield a rate of return not less than the rate of interest paid on the borrowing.  This is completely impracticable. Under the amendment if the borrowing is to be done lawfully it must comply with the stated conditions, but who will be the judge of whether the likely rate of return from the borrowing reaches the level set by the amendment? If An Foras Talúntais think that the yield will reach the requirements of the amendment, does this make the borrowing lawful?  If not, who is to be the arbiter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposes to take from An Foras Talúntais the power to incur even a temporary bank overdraft for current purposes.  The absence of this power could, on occasion, be embarrassing and could cause a breakdown in the services provided and cause the temporary disemployment of staff.  No doubt such borrowing had to be arranged in the past.  In any event, section 21 as it stands provides the necessary legal cover if this should be necessary in the future.  I wonder why the Deputies want to place these restrictions on An Foras Talúntais when they did not advocate the same restrictions in relation <Col N="1078" /> to the National Agricultural Authority in the 1977 Act?  They did not suggest a similar amendment in relation to An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta in this Bill.  I would be suspicious of their attitude towards An Foras Talúntais.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposal in the amendment that there should be a full disclosure to the Dáil within one week of the borrowing, here again an attempt is being made to lay down restrictions in relation to An Foras Talúntais that do not apply to any other semi-State bodies. In my opinion there is no good reason why such exceptional requirements should be laid down in this case.  It is an unnecessary interference in view of the fact that the borrowing in the first place is subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture.  For that reason I think the amendments put down by Deputy Bruton and Deputy D'Arcy are unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister of State to tell us how An Foras Talúntais apparently borrowed money when they did not have the power to do so and if he was concerned about that.  It is a bad precedent, when we are spending days discussing what powers should and should not be given to a semi-State body, that the Minister can come into this House and in the middle of his contribution, as an argument in favour of giving them power, blithely say that they have already done it anyway without being given that power.  That is making a mockery of the House and of the professed concern of all parties to reduce borrowing when approximately 25 per cent of the Government's annual income is being used to repay interest on borrowing. I asked the Minister to give some details of how An Foras Talúntais borrowed money when they did not have the power to do so.  I do not blame the Minister of State for that.  The money was borrowed when he probably did not have responsibility in that area and I would not suggest for one moment that he would condone such a move.  As I said, I would like to know how it happened and if the Minister is prepared to carry out an investigation into the matter and see that this kind of thing does not go on in respect of other bodies which do not have power to borrow.</P>
      <P>If a body is short of cash I cannot see why the Government cannot borrow, or introduce a Supplementary Estimate, or give them money in some other way.  If An Foras Talúntais were short of money it was possible for a Supplementary Estimate to be introduced.  I understand also that it is possible to give them money in advance of the Supplementary Estimate being passed because as we all know, Supplementary Estimates are passed at the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult for me to give the information Deputy Bruton requested. I said in my contribution that the board of An Foras Talúntais exceeded their borrowing limitations on one occasion and that the matter was taken up by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the watchdog who examines the accounts of State boards.  It is his job to keep an eye on those bodies <Col N="1081" /> and to ensure that they stay within their limitations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton knows that up to now the legislation did not state that the board may not exceed their limitations. In other words, it was not written into the Act.  For that reason it was a fairly loose arrangement.  Under the present Bill it is being written in and under no circumstances can the board, in future, exceed their borrowing limitations.</P>
      <P>That is the answer to the Deputy's question.  It was not written in before. There was no such thing as directing the board that they may not exceed a certain limit.  If it had been written into the Act I would consider it a serious breach for An Foras Talúntais to exceed their borrowing limitations.  As I said, it happened on one occasion and was corrected by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I do not think there is anything to worry about.  The important thing is it is being written into the new Act and therefore there is nothing to worry about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the Minister's explanation which more or less amounts to saying that An Foras Talúntais never did this although there was not anything in existing legislation about borrowing.  He suggested that where bodies are not specifically debarred from borrowing it was all right for them to do it.  My case is that unless such bodies have been given explicit power to borrow they must not do so.  It is not good enough to say that they may borrow unless they are precluded statutorily from doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got anything to add.  The Act is silent in regard to this matter, so who is to say whether a board would be wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the Minister is wrong in thinking that if an Act is silent on the powers of a board that the board can go ahead and do what they are not precluded from doing.  They could run up debts of any amount.  According to the Minister's theory, the sports councils set up by the Minister for Education could borrow millions simply because <Col N="1082" /> they are not specifically precluded from doing so.  I do not think anybody could argue in favour of such a situation.  I am afraid the Minister is taking a very softhearted view and I hope his officials will advise him to reconsider.</P>
      <P>There are other bodies under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture who have not got powers to borrow and, according to the Minister, if they are not specifically barred from borrowing it is all right for them to go ahead and do so. If that is permitted we could have boards borrowing and billing the State ten or 15 years later.  I know one board who went ahead and erected a building without any authority.  They came back much later looking for the money.  That was highly irregular and should not have happened.  It would be wrong if boards were allowed to think that when they were not precluded from borrowing they could go ahead and do so.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to other bodies, such as health boards and local authorities generally, who have powers to borrow.  That is not a comparable situation.  Such bodies were given borrowing powers because they had incomes of their own.  Local authorities had rates revenue and could repay their borrowing in due course from their income from rates.  An Foras Talúntais are in a different category because they do not have power to levy rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that the reason for my amendment is my concern about State bodies having borrowing powers without incomes of their own.  As far as borrowing is concerned, it is only sensible that it should be undertaken only for capital purposes.  I do not think borrowing should be permitted to cover current expenses because there would not then be a likelihood that the return would be such as to repay the borrowing. The country and the House are entitled to know to whom State bodies owe money.  It is not right that State companies should borrow money and then tell us about it only after three or four years.  Annual reports of such bodies are not lodged until 12 or 16 months after the end of the year in question. Therefore, An Foras Talúntais might borrow money at the beginning of 1979 and the first the House would know <Col N="1083" /> about it might be in the middle of 1981, 25 or 26 months after the borrowing had taken place.</P>
    <P>That is not an acceptable control on the level of accountability.  My amendment would remedy this by insisting that the House would know within one week about the borrowing, the currency involved and the rate of interest.  I do not think semi-State bodies should borrow in currencies which may have their value changed to such an extent that we might be repaying twice the amount borrowed. If State companies begin to borrow in foreign currencies there is a danger of being caught by the market.  I know certain State companies who borrowed money at the wrong time in the wrong currencies and had to repay double the amount.</P>
    <P>If my amendment is accepted, if there is this one week limit within which we must be made aware of the company's borrowing, companies would be very careful before making the mistake made by certain other State bodies in the recent past.</P>

Why do they have to have an independent power to borrow given that before they can borrow they have to have the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture?

      <P>In page 9, lines 52 and 53, to delete &ldquo;and the Minister for the Public Service.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In legislation coming before the House now there is this clause providing for the approval of the Minister concerned and also the approval of the Minister for the Public Service.  In this case the provision for the approval also of the Minister for the Public Service is causing a good deal of frustration because of previous experience in trying to negotiate settlements. In the first instance, the approval of the council will be necessary and then it will be necessary to have the approval of the Minister for Agriculture.  That would be fine but people making a claim must then have the approval of the Minister for the Public Service.  This will render it virtually impossible for employees of An Foras Talúntais to negotiate either in regard to terms of employment or in regard to remuneration. We would accept the provision for the approval of the Minister for Agriculture but there the matter should <Col N="1088" /> rest.  The Minister for Agriculture would not be likely to agree to a claim unless he had the prior approval of the Minister for the Public Service but we could not agree with the manner in which the process is proposed in the Bill.  That is why we propose the elimination of the clause concerning the approval of the Minister for the Public Service.  What we are doing here is putting an embargo on negotiations.  The kind of personnel that we expect to be employed in the foras will hardly be prepared to operate in those circumstances because they will probably be able to find work which is much better paid.  Therefore, if we are anxious to recruit and to keep the best people we must ensure that negotiations are not made impossible for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Ber-mingham's amendment.  The inclusion of the Minister for the Public Service in regard to approval for agreement reached already by the Minister for Agriculture suggests there is not collective Cabinet responsibility, that if the Minister for Agriculture gives his word on something he is not acting in concert with his colleagues, that he is not trusted.  The implication is that somebody must oversee the Minister for Agriculture in order to ensure that he will not give away anything to which employees are not entitled.  This is a very unusual precedent.  A Minister should be responsible enough not to agree if he knows that his colleagues will not approve. That should be sufficient.  To carry the provision to its logical conclusion each Minister in the Government would be responsible to the other.  I regard the whole purpose of the inclusion in this case of the Minister for the Public Service to be the provision of a delaying device.  It suggests that the Minister for Agriculture will be afraid to stand up to the people with whom he must deal direct, that he will need some sort of cover-up whereby he may appear to be the nice guy with the people with whom he is dealing, telling them that he would like very much to give what they are seeking but that the necessary agreement of the Minister for the Public Service is not forthcoming.  This is a device that will enable the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1089" /> to shift his responsibility to somebody else but that is not the way in which a Government should do their business. However, this passing-the-buck attitude is unfortunately symptomatic of this Government and by giving them the power they are seeking here we are only enabling them to continue to operate as they have been operating in the past. That is why I support the amendment wholeheartedly.</P>

It is proposed in the Bill that control of salaries in respect of people employed by the foras be exercised by the Minister for Agriculture with the approval of the Minister for the Public Service but the amendment seeks to eliminate the provision for the approval of the Minister for the Public Service, leaving salaries control in the hands of the Minister for Agriculture.  This is not acceptable because the Minister for the Public Service is the only Minister in a position to ensure reasonable parity of salaries throughout the public sector. Indeed, that is a primary function of his. He is the one who would have the greater knowledge of what is happening in the public service.  Obviously, it is necessary that there be consultation between him and whatever other Minister is concerned with a claim.</P>

      <P>Apparently, the Minister of State is missing the point of the argument.  Negotiations, generally, are a difficult process but they will be much more difficult for the people concerned if this Bill is not amended because, having reached agreement with the council and subsequently with the Minister for Agriculture, they must then have the approval of another Minister. Surely when the year's allocation is made to the Department of Agriculture account is taken of expected increases in incomes so that the Minister should know the level of increases to which he might agree.  If his agreement is obtained it should not be necessary, therefore, to seek further agreement.  As Deputy Bruton said, the additional provision for the approval of the Minister for the Public Service is suggesting that there is <Col N="1090" /> not collective Cabinet responsibility or that the Minister for Agriculture is capable at some stage of agreeing to an increase that he knows the Government would not agree to.</P>

I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister of State that there is provision for three stages of negotiations. The institutions of State are breaking down at present.  The reason for the increase in the number of strikes is that people are frustrated by delays in dealing with claims.  The Bill proposes the setting up of a council and it also involves the Ministers for Agriculture and Finance.  I agree with what Deputies Bruton and Bermingham have said. There is sufficient control in the Department of Agriculture without involving the Department of Finance.  The proposal is a delaying tactic which is not in the interests of the Department of Agriculture.  I appeal to the Minister of State to withdraw the section and to accept the amendment.</P>

The Minister is making the mistake of not listening to arguments made in this House.  Satisfying himself by saying, &ldquo;You did it when you were in office&rdquo;, shows that he has like Louis XVII after his restoration, forgotten nothing and learned nothing.  We all know that Louis XVII did not last too long after his restoration and that within 18 years the monarchy in France was abolished. The Minister of State, like King Canute, is not prepared to put his toe in the water.  The Minister should put his toe in the water and show that he is prepared to do his own thinking.</P>
    <P>The lack of responsibility among Ministers is the cause of the present industrial unrest, particularly in the public service.  Ministers should be willing to accept responsibility without passing the buck.  One of the reasons why government has not worked relates to the system of memoranda.  When Ministers do not reply to memoranda issues cannot go to the Government.  That is happening now and it happened when we were in office.  This section makes the delaying tactic easier for Ministers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This would not involve a lot of paper work.  This has been done for years for other bodies and I do not envisage any problem here.  The effect of this section is to make a determination by the foras in respect of remuneration and allowances of their staff, subject to the concurrence of the Ministers for Agriculture and Finance.  If An Foras Talúntais had remained part of the National Agricultural Authority their staff would have been subject to controls on remuneration and allowances, similar to what we are asking for here.  These controls are embodied in the 1958 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is Government policy to have ministerial control of remuneration of all non-commercial and semi-State bodies. Such control applies to recently created bodies such as the National Board for Science and Technology and Bord na Gaeilge.  It is also appropriate that the arrangements in regard to the staffing of the foras should be consistent with those for the new body, to counter any danger <Col N="1095" /> of inter-body jealousies or leap-frogging between the bodies in any salary merry-go-round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that this would apply to even very short-term contracts. If for instance An Foras Talúntais wanted to employ somebody for six weeks to do a study, that person's rate of remuneration would be subject to the same controls.  I can see some difficulty with that.  As the Minister will realise, I am strongly in favour of accountability for all actions by semi-State bodies.  I must and will be consistent on that issue. I agree with the general principle, but a situation could arise where there could be an urgent need to take on a person who is not a member of the staff to work for a short term.  If his rate of remuneration has to go to the Minister for Agriculture and then to the Minister for the Public Service and back, a short term measure which might be necessary to keep a project going, could hold up an entire project.  For instance, one man might be capable of dealing with a certain problem which arose in the course of a long-term research project and it might be necessary to employ him for about six weeks or so and then let him return to his own employment.  If the employment of somebody for such a short term has to be approved by the Minister for Agriculture and by the Minister for the Public Service, an entire project could be held up just because they could not get a man for a short period.  Has the Minister thought about how this would work out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This control would apply only for the person who is becoming a member of the staff.  The foras, if they needed, could employ a consultant or anybody like that on a contract basis. They are quite free to do so.  This only applies to a person becoming a member of the staff.</P>

      <P>This amendment will ensure that failure to appoint or nominate the full quota of members does not invalidate a county committee.  County committees must be appointed on a specific occasion, that is, at the first annual meeting of a council following a local election.  It is important to ensure that an omission by a county council or a voluntary organisation, whether deliberate or otherwise, does not invalidate the constitution of the committee, and that appropriate remedial action can be taken as necessary.  Accordingly, this amendment will provide that the Minister for Agriculture can take such action if the council or voluntary body do not appoint or nominate their full quota.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 68:</P>
      <P>In page 11, after line 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Amendment of Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1958</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1958, is hereby amended by the addition of the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" />&lsquo;(6)  The council of a county shall pay any balance of the contribution to be made under subsection (1) of this section which remains unpaid on the coming into operation of section 53 of the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority Act, 1977, partly to An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta and partly to the committee of agriculture for the county in such proportions as the Minister may direct.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment adds an additional section to the Bill.  Section 53 of the 1977 Act provides for the transfer of certain property of the county committees of agriculture to the National Agricultural Authority now being replaced by An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta.  In this context, property includes a number of things, one of which is money in hands, in banks, and so on.  Unless the transfer happens to take place exactly at the beginning of a financial year, there would be a period between the time of the transfer and the end of that financial year in which county committees would continue to receive funds from county councils and, under the existing terms of the 1977 Act, would not have to transfer any part of these funds to An Chomhairle.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides that where, after the transfer date, which is the coming into operation of section 53 of the 1977 Act, a county council are due to pay to a county committee a balance of the appropriate contribution for the year, such balance must be paid partly to An Chomhairle and partly to the county committee in such proportions as the Minister for Agriculture determines. This is to ensure that the county committees get sufficient funds to enable them to perform their retained functions and that An Chomhairle are not deprived of their fair share of the funds.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 26, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 26 deals with the method of appointment of the county <Col N="1100" /> committees of agriculture and affords us an opportunity to discuss the whole position of the county committees of agriculture in the context of the new arrangements. I am not entirely happy with the position.  To be fair, it does not derive solely from the present Bill but also from the NAAERA Act of 1977.</P>
      <P>I am not happy that the county committees of agriculture have adequate powers to obtain information within specified times.  They are being given power to get information, but not power to get it within a particular, stated time. They are not being given power to get information from all the people, from whom they should be able to get information to enable them to do their job properly.</P>
      <P>On the question of voluntary organisations to be represented on the county committees, we will now have a substantial number of people from farming organisations on the county committees in addition to people selected by the county councillors.  I am not happy at the way in which this is to be done.  I am not sure that I could put forward an alternative proposal, but there are certain doubts which must be raised about the proposal in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The number of members to be nominated by each such rural organisation active within the county shall be such as the Minister may by order determine. A number of farming organisations may be active in a particular county, for example, the ICA, Macra na Feirme, the Irish Farmers' Association and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association.  Those four organisations are all active in my county.  There are also other organisations such as the Small Farmers Defence, the Land League, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is to decide the relative strength of these organisations?  The Minister for Agriculture.  What evidence will he have on which to make his decision?  We do not know.  Will he go on membership figures?  That would mean he would have to get membership returns from each of the organisations.  If he does not go on membership figures, what other basis has he got to go on other than his own purely subjective judgment?  If it is to be done on the basis of the Minister's <Col N="1101" /> subjective judgment that one organisation is more important than another, the Minister will either be put in an invidious and awkward position, in that he will have to make decisions about bodies and their strength, bodies with which he has to negotiate, as against other organisations which would be very difficult for him, or he will have the temptation to pursue a line of favouritism and to give one organisation more than it is entitled to because he gets on better with that organisation.</P>
    <P>I am not saying the Minister would do that.  In fact, I would be very surprised if he did, but the temptation will exist for any Minister operating this Bill in the absence of any objective criteria in the Bill as to how the organisations' relative strength should be assessed in deciding how the voluntary people are to be selected.  There are no objective criteria in the Bill.  I know this situation existed in the previous Bill but this will put whoever is operating the Bill in an awkward position.  He will be involved, so to speak, in local farming politics in every county in Ireland.  He will have to examine the relative strength in each county of each farming organisation before he decides how many votes to give them.  Obviously you could not apply the same principles in one of the Munster counties as you might apply in Meath, Westmeath or Roscommon. There are going to be differences.  One cannot see far ahead what is going to happen in these various organisations. The Minister should not be put in this awkward position.  Something should be contained in the Bill which would give the Minister a definite line to go on in making the decisions.  How is this to be done?</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make relates to the powers of county committees of agriculture.  These powers are contained in section 36 of the 1977 Act and the committees have power to review and to make recommendations to the Minister regarding the programmes and so forth of the operations in the county.  Of course, anybody in the world has power to make recommendations to the Minister, and so telling the committees that they have power to make a recommendation <Col N="1102" /> is not telling them that they have any more power than any individual in the entire country.  If the post is working, presumably any individual who wishes to do so can write a letter to the Minister and make a recommendation. That is not giving anything to the committees.  Of course, they are being given the power to request reports from time to time from the chief agricultural officer on the progress of the advisory and educational programme of the county and also to request reports from time to time from the appropriate officers of the Minister about schemes operated by him in the county.</P>
    <P>I have two criticisms to make on this, one a major one.  The committees have not the power to ask either An Foras Talúntais or An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta for information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not labour the point.  The committees should have power to request reports from An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta and from An Foras Talúntais in the same way as they have powers to request reports from the Minister.  The powers given to committees to request reports are valueless unless the committees can get information from the people who have the responsibility.  I will leave it at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few remarks on the composition of the <Col N="1103" /> board.  I foresee great problems in this field because the Minister cannot come up with a formula that he can apply to every county committee of agriculture.  I see great problems in trying to decide what rural organisations represent the farmers within an area and what the representation should be.  We had this at one stage of the Bill but the Minister for Agriculture threw no light whatsoever on how he is going to work out this formula and apply it in each county. Deputy Bruton said that his county has three or four organisations.  Wexford has as many organisations as any other county.  We have the IFA, the ICMSA, the small farmers' organisation and so on.  There are eight or nine of them, all claiming that they represent agriculture in that county and they will all claim that they will be entitled to a say on the county committee of agriculture.</P>
      <P>The erosion of powers of the county committees of agriculture by this Bill will take away the interest that was there heretofore.  We have seen what happened in the health boards and local health committees when their powers were taken away.  Once that happens, so will the interest be taken away.  Powers are necessary for decision-making, and decisions are not being made in the county committees of agriculture.</P>

      <P>The section deals mainly <Col N="1104" /> with the composition of the board.  The Minister for Agriculture threw no light on the situation.  Would the Minister of State be prepared to give some indication of how these rural organisations are going to be representative of county committees?  For many years I have known the difficulties that county councils have in trying to select members.  I am prepared to accept that it was done on a party basis, but there was some base that they could work on.  There will be queer politics in it now with the present composition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in this that was not included in the Act of 1977. The question of what rural organisations will represent the farmers or what formula the Minister might apply in dealing with this is something that the Minister himself will have to fix by regulation.  He will do so in consultation with the farming organisations in the county.  This is better than having it written into the Bill at this time.</P>
      <P>Section 26 has a fourfold effect.  First of all, it replaces the provisions of section 42 of the 1977 Act and provides that a county council can select members of the county council and also non-members in nominating 60 per cent of the members of the county committee of agriculture.  Secondly, it fixes a set membership for each committee of four times the number of county electoral areas, whereas previously the membership could vary between three and four times the number of the county electoral areas.  Thirdly, it requires that every person appointed to a committee of agriculture, whether chosen by the county council or nominated by other organisations, must have an involvement in agriculture.  Fourthly, it ensures that a casual vacancy on a committee of agriculture can be filled by the organisation or organisations which made the original choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the first point, under the Agriculture Act, 1931, county councils were free to choose members or nonmembers, and nearly all committees have non-council members.  This has been a feature of the county committees throughout the country.  Section 42 of <Col N="1105" /> the 1977 Act, however, requires that all of the 60 per cent of the members of a county committee chosen by a county council must be council members.  No doubt this was just an oversight and so section 26 as drafted in the Bill restores the old position in this respect.</P>
    <P>The second point is that the provision in section 42 of the 1977 Act that a specific number of members of a county committee, equal to 40 per cent of the total membership, be appointed on the nomination of a voluntary organisation designated by the Minister proved to be unworkable.  As the total membership of a committee could vary between three and four times the number of electoral areas in a county and as members must be appointed at the first meeting of the county council after a local election, it would not be possible to specify in an order made beforehand the number of members to be nominated.</P>
    <P>As regards my third point, the previous Rules 5 and 5A in the Second Schedule to the 1931 Act, in relation to qualifications of membership, referred only to members chosen by the county council, so it is necessary to revise these articles to include persons nominated by other organisations.</P>
    <P>The fourth point regarding a casual vacancy on the county committee of agriculture, is self-explanatory.  The principle involved was referred to already by the Minister in the debate on section 11, membership of the board of AnCOT.</P>

      <P>I am not at all satisfied with the Minister's explanation.  In the final analysis it will be the Minister's subjective judgment that will take effect as to what vote should go to what organisation.  That is not a very good system because it means the Minister is being given tremendous power to decide that one organisation is more important than another.  If there was something in the Bill specifying that he must take account of active membership or of certain factors, at least that would provide him with some guideline.  In those circumstances, if he was accused of being unreasonable, he would have something to refer to and could maintain that he was following the line of the statute.  At present not only does the temptation exist for him to show favouritism but the temptation exists also for others to exercise pressure on him to show favouritism because they know he is not tied in any way by anything contained in the statute.  If there were more specific criteria contained in the Bill they would constitute a protection for the Minister against unfair pressure being brought to bear on him.  Surely any sensible Minister would welcome the existence of something definite in the statute as to how the relative strength of one organisation should be measured against that of another.  The Minister might get away with it this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be very interested to know if he will announce the composition of the organisations in question that he will decide in respect of each county before <Col N="1107" /> the local elections, or if he will wait and make these orders after the local elections but before the first meeting of the county committees or of the councils which they select.  If it is done in that sort of backhanded way it would be very serious indeed.  I should like to know how the Minister will do it.  If it has got to be done soon surely he must have some idea of the method he will use to select these people and, if he has, he should tell the house and should not be trying to keep it a secret.</P>
    <P>Certainly I hope he will give an assurance that whatever scheme he will adopt will be announced before the local elections, that he will not wait until the people have voted and then introduce whatever order he has in mind, containing God knows what provisions on which nobody will have an opportunity to decide at the polls or elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Bruton here and feel that this issue should have been dealt with in the Bill itself.  At least we should have been given some indication of what the order will contain.  The Minister is taking enormous risks.  I do not know whether the Minister of State is talking off his own bat or is assuming that the Minister will take this course, but the time available to him in which to get involved in the 27 county committees in the country and in which to reach some sort of uniform decision must present enormous problems.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has said that the Minister may have consultations with the main farming organisations only. Those main organisations may have particular vested interests.  We have all experienced within different groups this pulling and hauling, one against another. If the Minister is going to get involved in this type of thing he will create problems galore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not given some indication&mdash;and I believe here we could be of some help to him&mdash;of what exactly he has in mind.  I warn the Minister that he would be walking headlong into trouble on this issue. It could well be somebody from this side of the House over there who would <Col N="1108" /> have to make this decision, but any Minister who takes upon himself power to select 40 per cent of a county committee of agriculture in the rural organisations amongst the 27 county committees will have some job, and is really taking something on.  Some guidelines should be laid down or some criteria specified by which any Minister could measure&mdash; particularly when he will be going into each county&mdash;who should represent a particular organisation within that county.</P>
    <P>Perhaps on Report Stage the Minister would introduce an amendment spelling out exactly what he has in mind and give us an opportunity to discuss it because here we could be of help to him rather than a hindrance.  Anybody who has any knowledge of county committees of agriculture and what goes on after each local authority election as people endeavour to obtain membership on these boards, the pulling and hauling that goes on, will know that what I maintain is correct.  If the Minister takes in every rural organisation on top of the politicians he will really have a problem on his hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I be permitted to put one further point to the Minister, that is, the possibility that organisations will be created solely to get places on these committees. That is another danger against which there is no safeguard in the Bill.  The Minister would benefit from having well-defined criteria laid down. Now that the day is approaching when he will have to make decisions, he may have second thoughts and will want to introduce an amendment on Report Stage clarifying this position, when he would be doing himself a favour also.</P>

There is a cloud hanging over us as to what the Minister has in mind and it is wrong and irregular as far as I am concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It is understandable that it is not possible to deal with Committee Stage of a Bill in one session without a break but it is unfortunate that we have to have so many bites at Committee Stage of this Bill.  We have discussed it for short periods over a long time with the result that it is difficult to deal with it in a coherent manner.  It takes a lot more time than if we were dealing with it in a couple of long sessions.  We have had a long debate on my amendment to this section.  That amendment provided that any agreement must include a clause which would provide for a termination of a tolls agreement.  The Minister and I differed over the interpretation of subsection (2).  He was of the opinion that the subsection made it obligatory on a roads authority to insist on inserting in any such agreement a clause providing for the termination of the agreement with the other party.  I held the view, and still do, that the subsection only enables a roads authority to insert in the agreement a clause providing for its termination but does not oblige the insertion of such a clause.  The Minister, after a lengthy debate, agreed to have another look at the matter between now and Report Stage and it was on that basis that I withdrew my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have expressed the view that it was a pity that the Minister did not avail of the debate to tell the House all he knows about the proposals for toll roads and bridges throughout the country.  It has emerged that the Minister, and the Department, have had inquiries in regard to Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and a Naas by-pass.  I asked the Minister whether those inquiries were from the same people and whether all the situations mentioned, with the exception of the Naas by-pass, were in regard to bridges.  I asked him whether the inquiry about the Naas by-pass was from the same source as the inquiries in regard to the cities mentioned and I would be obliged if the Minister would give the House that information.  I mentioned that the locations seemed to be prime profitable ones which would not entail any possibility of a loss and pointed out that for that reason it was necessary that the agreements provide <Col N="1112" /> very definite terms for the termination of the tolls agreement.</P>
    <P>It appears that section 9 (1) enables a road authority to enter into agreement with another person for rather minimal services in some cases.  Such an agreement may be entered into by the road authority with another person if the other person agrees to pay some or all of the cost of the provision of the road. That is understandable but I hope it would be read as meaning that the other person would pay a substantial portion of the cost of the provision of the road. Paragraph (b) enables such an agreement to be entered into provided the other person pays some or all the cost of the maintenance and improvement of the road.  That is a lesser obligation on the other person.  Paragraph (c) enables such an agreement to be entered into if the other person is prepared:</P>
    <P>to provide or join or assist in the provision of the road for or with the authority.</P>
    <P>I am not too clear what that is. Paragraph (d) states:</P>
    <P>to maintain and improve or join or assist in the maintenance and improvement of the road for or with the authority.</P>
    <P>That is even a lesser service which is being asked from the third party. Paragraph (e) enables an agreement to be entered into with another person for a very minimal return.  The road authority may enter into an agreement with a third person by virtue of paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of this section if the other person is prepared to operate and manage the road for or with the authority, including the provision, supervision and operation of a system of tolls in respect of the use of the road.  That means that the road authority may enter into an agreement with a third party if the third party does nothing more than operate a toll checkpoint and collect tolls.  That is going too far.  If the road authority build the bridge or the road they should go the whole hog and collect the tolls.  It is proposed here to enable the local authority to enter into an agreement with a third party to do nothing more than collect the tolls.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> Paragraph (f) is an omnibus provision which enables the road authority to enter into an agreement with another person provided that other person does such other things connected with, incidental to, ancillary to or consequential upon the foregoing as may be specified in the agreement.  That omnibus paragraph covers anything that has been left out.  It is hard to imagine what it would be because paragraphs (a) to (e), inclusive, are fairly comprehensive.</P>

      <P>As I said the last day we debated this Bill, there are people who expressed interest, not only the one party which got a lot of publicity in the Dublin area.  As I also emphasised we cannot take those expressions of interest to further discussion or negotiation without this legislation.  There is no point in getting down to the nitty gritty parts of an agreement or what type of agreement might come forward from such discussions until we have the legislation which will permit the authority concerned to do so.  This matter should be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also said that those seemed to be in areas which were the most attractive commercially. Naturally, if the private sector are to be involved in building a bridge, a tunnel or a road they will have to see some possibility of getting back their investment with a reasonable profit or they will not <Col N="1114" /> be interested in such a project.  The very fact that interest has been expressed in specific areas is quite understandable.  I do not see any point in pursuing the line the Deputy is pursuing until such time as we have the necessary legislation to permit the particular road authority to do so.  I thought I answered that last week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to paragraph (f).  The different paragraphs in this subsection cover the financing of a toll project, the construction of such a project, the maintenance of a project or its improvement, the operation and management of the project and other activities or arrangements relating to these. With regard to the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, I said I would look into this matter before Report Stage.  I have done so and my advice is that the &ldquo;may&rdquo; gives far more flexibility with regard to the final approval by the Minister of any particular agreement.  If there is no terminal date for such an agreement the Minister has the power to insist on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to attribute any disrepute to this Minister but our job here is to trust the law rather than any Minister of any particular administration. I accept that there are certain constraints in regard to this Bill and that there are certain things the Minister cannot reply to.  Am I correct in assuming that if a local authority decide they want to finance a particular part of their road programme they can take section 9 as their enabling licence to do so?  They could then approach a group of commercial banks or any other major finance organisation and with them work out a scheme so that this financial body would provide the capital required. They would work out what the necessary return would be and bring that into their toll scheme.  Would a local authority be enabled to do that?  Would <Col N="1115" /> it be subject to critical review by the Department of Finance in terms of public sector borrowing?</P>
      <P>It appears to be clear that the private sector which has money can approach a local authority and offer money to them on the basis of terms to be agreed.  It is not clear whether the Minister in giving approval would have to have regard to the overall constraints on public sector borrowing if the local authority decided that they needed the money and wanted to finance it by way of tolls.  The capital sums involved are very hefty.</P>
      <P>There is virtually nobody in the private sector who has the capital sums involved to build a decent stretch of road.  We are talking of £10 million to £20 million for any reasonable stretch of road on which one could legitimately charge tolls.  The people, or even the consortiums, who have that kind of money are limited and even if they had the money it is questionable whether they would want to tie it up in such a long-term project.  It appears that the local authority have the power to approach the banks directly but it is not clear whether they would be subject to other legislation or to a veto under the public sector borrowing requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite in order for a local authority to make the approach mentioned by the Deputy.  On the question of approaching people such as those whom we are led to believe have vast sums in pension funds and so on, that should not present any problem with regard to borrowing.  In the event of a proposal coming before me or the Minister of the day, the question of borrowing and where the money would have to be found would have to be considered. The Deputy asks what would be the effects of such borrowing with regard to overall Government policy on borrowing.  That matter would have to be looked at also.</P>

      <P>With regard to the borrowing by the local authority in that context for what would obviously be deemed to be a commercially viable operation because the tolls would be <Col N="1116" /> deemed to be pitched at such a level so as to repay the capital and interest, would that automatically be considered as part of the overall public sector borrowing or would it be consideed separately?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>This enabling legislation is designed to facilitate the private sector. As we have learned in the past, the private sector essentially is concerned with river crossings and short-cuts of one kind or another that are outside the road programme.  If the private sector get involved with the orthodox road programme of any local authority&mdash;and what is concerned is a road as distinct from a bridge&mdash;given current prices the scale of capital required for any kind of decent by-pass of ten or 15 miles would be enormous.  I do not see that this will be enabling legislation for a local authority unless they are borrowing in the public finance market, either from the EIB or from the privately owned commercial banks here.  Will that be deemed to be an exercise by the private sector making money available to the local authority as distinct from the latter adding further to the public sector borrowing requirement?  I should like the Minister to tell us the position on Report Stage.  If there will be constraints by the Minister for Finance I do not think they will be able to finance projects in the way that it is partially the intention of the Bill.  I realise this is a complex area and the Minister may want to consult on the matter.  I suggest that otherwise there should be some reference in section 9 to the role of the Minister for Finance in relation to approving such schemes.  The capital involved will be very hefty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I think that the section is wide enough to enable the roads authority to enter into an agreement with anybody to do what is mentioned in subsection (1) provided the toll scheme <Col N="1117" /> has been approved by the Minister beforehand.  As the section is drafted an agreement could be entered into by anybody in the country or outside it. There is no limitation on the work that may be covered by the agreement provided a toll scheme has been approved.</P>
      <P>With regard to subsection (2), the Minister and I are <i>ad idem</i> at last.  I am not going to criticise him for having a wrong view about it.  I have some legal experience and training that the Minister has not had but that does not mean that he is not qualified to be a Minister.  On the last occasion the Minister said he was advised that any such agreement as might be entered into under section 9 must have a termination clause.  I said in my opinion that was not so and the Minister, having sought further advice, now agrees with me that the road authority may or may not insist on a termination clause in the agreement.  I appreciate that when it comes to the Minister for approval, as it must do, he may or may not insist on a termination clause.  My view is that we should write into the section that any agreement must provide for a termination clause.  The Minister said today that it would be reasonable to expect that if the private sector are going to interest themselves in road construction, road maintenance or road management they will do so where it is profitable.  That is what I would expect. The Minister agrees with me that such inquiries as have been received in his Department have been in respect of very profitable sites.</P>
      <P>I should like to add that we have no wish unduly to hold up the Bill.  If we had a reasonable session on it, not just in ten-minute instalments, we could make considerable progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey) Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of making a statement to the House about this matter of great concern to all of us.</P>
      <P>Because of the interruption of postal services it has not been possible to distribute to old age and other pensioners the new pension books payable from Thursday and Friday of this week.  Ordinarily these books would have been distributed during the last few weeks to the various post offices throughout the country for collection by the pensioners when they received their last payment on the old books last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accordingly made alternative arrangements for paying the pensions in question which I announced in radio and television broadcasts on Monday, 26 March.  In brief, these arrangements are that in the case of a person who normally gets payment at a post office which has remainded open the pensioner will bring the stub of his old book to that post office and will be paid at the rate shown in the book for the time being. Where the person normally went for payment to a post office which is closed, the pensioner will bring his book to the local centre of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and will be paid in the same way.  The money for the payments to be made by the society, together with any expenses incurred by the society in the administration of these arrangements, <Col N="1120" /> will be provided from the funds of my Department.</P>
    <P>A preliminary announcement regarding payments by the St. Vincent de Paul Society was made in all the daily newspapers on Wednesday 28 March. Details of the centres at which payment will be made were given in last Sunday's newspapers.  The exact location and the times of operation of each centre will be published locally.  Payment will be made in all cases by cheques drawn on the society's account in their banks in Dublin.  Adequate security arrangements have been made by the society.</P>
    <P>In regard to the society's part in these arrangements, I should like to reiterate what I said in my broadcasts and make it absolutely clear that the situation is that we have asked the St. Vincent de Paul Society to place their offices and their personnel at our disposal to make these payments on our behalf and they have very generously agreed to do this. However, they will be paying out the benefit which people are fully entitled to and no one should feel inhibited in any way from availing of this method of payment so kindly being provided by the society.</P>
    <P>I regret that it will not be possible to pay pensions at the increased rates announced in the budget for the time being. These rates were due to come into operation this week.  The balance due, however, will be paid as soon as this becomes possible.</P>
    <P>In my broadcast I also asked health boards and community welfare officers to do everything possible to ensure that nobody suffers any hardship as a result of the present situation and I have told them to be as flexible as possible in meeting any difficulties which may arise. I appealed to all the voluntary organisations throughout the country to undertake a special campaign of vigilance of old people in their areas during the next few weeks and that they should make sure that all those concerned, and especially people living alone, are made aware of the arrangements which will operate for the duration of the postal dispute.</P>
    <P>The total number of new books to be issued is about 375,000 while the total <Col N="1121" /> number of recipients of pensions and allowances is about 326,000.  The difference is accounted for by the fact that in a sizeable number of cases pensioners receive two books.  This occurs particularly in the case of those in receipt of living alone allowances.  I should also mention that the payments to recipients include increases in respect of some 46,000 adult dependants, about 65,000 child dependants and about 3,800 prescribed relatives.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that more than 200,000 pensioners will continue to receive payment of pension at post offices which have remained open.  The remainder, that is, approximately 100,000 pensioners, will be catered for by the arrangements made by the St. Vincent de Paul Society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the books had to be printed in accordance with the changes made in the budget and subsequently enacted by this House.  Therefore, the books could not have been sent out earlier.  By the <Col N="1122" /> time the books were ready to be sent out the postal services had been disrupted.  I regret very much the difficulties and hardships caused, but in so far as it lies within our power in the Department we are making every effort to ensure that hardships will be minimised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from old age pensioners would the Minister like to give advice to the people depending on children's allowances who have not received their books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Children's allowances are a different matter.  They are monthly payments and most of the people concerned have got their books.  About 120,000 have not been delivered because of the disruption of the postal services. Unfortunately I cannot do anything about it up to the present, but I should like to avail of this opportunity to say that the new rates will be paid on the books which have been delivered even though the books show the old rates.  In each post office a prominent notice will indicate what the new rates are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister knows that the only income of many women is the children's allowances and that accordingly many of them have not had any income this month.  Will the Minister give urgent consideration to the possibility of making some provision for those who have not received their children's allowance books and will he come before the House to make a statement on the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We should all like to place on the records of the House our appreciation of the St. Vincent de Paul Society for participating in the arrangements. Can the Minister assure the House that there are sufficient local offices of the society operating so as to ensure that all of the 126,000 people who cannot avail of post office openings will be served?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so.  Only 100,000 pensioners will be having access <Col N="1123" /> to the St. Vincent de Paul offices and I am fairly confident that everybody will be catered for.  However, I appreciate the Deputy's anxiety and I am glad to avail of this opportunity to reiterate my appeal to voluntary organisations in particular to be as active as possible during the next few weeks, first, to ensure that all pensioners are made aware of these arrangements and, secondly, to help out in making arrangements whereby the pension can be paid to those people who are not in a position to travel to the society's offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister not considered issuing details to the St. Vincent de Paul Society of the new rates of payment so that the cheques they issue might be at the increased rates and bearing in mind that the unfortunate pensioners are in need of these increases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We thought of that in the Department but on balance, because of the confused situation and the fact that some pensioners will be going to post offices and others to offices of the society, we decided that the most simple and most straight-forward way to proceed was for payment to be made at existing rates and to pay the difference to the pensioners later.  I am hoping with some confidence that throughout the community shopkeepers and others will help out old age pensioners by affording them credit or other facilities until the situation is rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that is happening and the people concerned are to be congratulated but would the Minister not consider the possibility of making available the increased payments to the St. Vincent de Paul Society or, alternatively, of requesting the health boards to be more liberal in their implementation of the supplementary welfare allowances? If the House accepts that the increased payments are needed surely every effort should be made to make these payments available to the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider the situation further but I have asked the health boards already to be generous <Col N="1124" /> and flexible in their approach.  The Deputy may be right in suggesting that perhaps the best reserve defence mechanism at our disposal is the system of supplementary welfare allowances.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>The free electricity scheme and the cheap fuel scheme operated under the aegis of my Department have contributed significantly to the welfare of the elderly during the present spell of cold weather.  In addition, the health boards give special assistance under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme where there are exceptional heating needs.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Eastern Health Board, the board's field staff&mdash;public health nurses, welfare officers and so on&mdash;have been asked to be especially active in aiding old people in the community who might suffer from the effects of cold.  Specifically, they have been authorised to issue extra blankets and fuel, turf or coal, where the existing services are inadequate and, if necessary, to issue electric fires.  The board's staff are keeping the situation in their areas under urgent review and the situation will be considered further at a meeting tomorrow. Other health boards are taking appropriate action in their own areas.</P>

Is the Minister aware that these people were not able to use the fuel vouchers because fuel was not available? The health boards did nothing to help them, although they were inundated with requests for assistance.</P>

There are some difficulties here and there but the amount of turf they are giving out is well up to normal standards.  They are very active in making sure that fuel is distributed as effectively as possible.  In addition, as I described in my reply, the health board are equally active.  All members of the health board outdoor staff are on the alert and are active in making sure that the effects of the present unprecedented cold spell are minimised as much as possible.  The Deputy has previously made these wild accusations in this House and he is not helping the situation or being fair to the dedicated members of the corporation and health board staffs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 15 to 20, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The operation of the boatyards at Baltimore, Dingle and Killybegs is primarily a matter for An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I understand from the board that in recent years considerable financial losses have been incurred at each of the boatyards in question due mainly to a falling off in orders for large wooden vessels.  The 1978 losses amounted to approximately £1 million and at the rate of losses currently being incurred in the three yards a further loss of £1 million is estimated for 1979.  The Exchequer provided £700,000 towards the 1978 losses and a sum of £500,000 is included in this year's Fisheries Estimate to cover the projected 1979 losses.  Despite these losses the work force has been retained at its full complement, apart from a limited reduction arising from normal wastage and voluntary redundancies under a productivity agreement with the trade union concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously the board cannot continue to carry indefinitely the high level of overmanning and resultant financial losses at the yards.  The position has been <Col N="1141" /> kept under constant review and in recent months all the options open to the board to improve the position have been considered. On the basis of the present order position 55 workers would become redundant on 31 May next.</P>
    <P>The Government have not decided to dispose of the yards to private interests, but if a realistic offer which provides safeguards for future employment in the yards is received it will be considered. The board have fully explained the position to the union concerned and a further meeting is being held today.  The Deputies may be assured that no effort will be spared by either the board or my Department to find a satisfactory solution to this very difficult problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the reason for these losses is twofold?  The first is management, and the second is that there was no development programme.  I understand it was suggested that £2 million would modernise the boatyards and save many redundancies. Does the Minister realise that these redundancies will cost between £1 million and £1.5 million?  Surely he could give a guarantee to this House that £2 million would be spent on modernising these yards and ensuring that their operations are viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The result is that the sort of modernisation required would cost in the order of £6 million.  In the interim period private boatyards have been constructed with the aid of grants from the IDA under both Governments. The fishermen are going to these private enterprise boatyards of their own volition. I cannot direct the fishermen otherwise in regard to their own business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in 1975-76 two steel hulls were built in Killybegs on a trial basis?  I understand <Col N="1142" /> they were a profitable enterprise.  When the Minister became Minister this £2 million should have been spent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many complex circumstances surrounding this whole sorry affair.  Could I ask the Minister whether an inquiry should not be instituted to ascertain the true causes of the losses the Minister has quoted, and also to try to unearth the manner and means best suited to reviving these yards and expanding them in the future?  It should not be a question of taking it from the private enterprise, which is working very effectively, but of preventing millions of pounds being spent abroad to import boats we could be building here ourselves.  Is that not the real situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Blaney for his constructive suggestion in the whole area of investigating the present position in regard to boat building for fishery purposes here.  This is precisely what I am doing at the moment. I am keeping all my options open and having constructive discussions with the interests concerned with a view to devising some system for these boatyards which would not lead us down the slippery slope into further losses of millions of pounds.  The options open include joint venture arrangements between the board and private enterprise, private enterprise leasing arrangements with the board, or the board doing a different type of job with a more devolved or regional form of management. An investigation of the kind suggested by Deputy Blaney is under way.  I am certain something must be done <Col N="1143" /> because we cannot allow this situation to drift.</P>

Will the Minister not accept that he has given in to pressure from the private boatyards and agreed to run down deliberately the BIM boatyards with a view to closing them at an early date with the resultant loss of so much employment?

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> As I had been saying before reporting progress, we are dealing with this Committee Stage in a piecemeal manner which does not make it easier to have a useful debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> Subsection (2) says:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, an agreement under this section may&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  provide for the application of the proceeds of tolls, systems of accounting...</P>
    <P>(b)  provide for its duration and for its termination...</P>
    <P>(c)  provide for the giving of such security as may be specified therein.  </P>
    <P>On the last occasion we debated this the Minister and I differed on the question of whether or not the Bill imposed an obligation on the road authority to write into the type of agreement about which we are speaking a clause providing for its termination.  I thought it did not; the Minister thought it did.  We are now both agreed that it does not but that it merely enables the road authority to write into the agreement a clause providing for its termination.  I maintain that the agreement should have such a clause written into it, that it should not be an optional matter for the road authority or for the Minister, that this House should exercise that much control over any such agreement, should specify that any such agreement must provide a clause for its termination when the other party, who is the private contractor, has been recompensed adequately for the money expended by him in constructing a road or bridge.</P>
    <P>The Minister concedes that, as far as his present knowledge goes, such inquiries as have been received in his Department are for projects in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and the Naas by-pass.  The Minister concedes also that each of those five projects would be a profitable enterprise.  I go further and say that some of them are in the golden egg category and none of them could possibly show a loss.  For that reason I am very strongly of the opinion that this House should retain control over such agreements to the extent that it will be written into this Bill that they must provide machinery for their termination.  I am against giving blank cheques of this nature.  That is the <Col N="1164" /> main point I make on subsection (2).  It deals really with paragraph (b) of that subsection.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to deal also with paragraph (a) which says that the agreement may:</P>
    <P>Provide for the application of the proceeds of tolls, systems of accounting for tolls collected and the methods and times of payment of proceeds of tolls to the persons to whom they are to be paid under the terms of the agreement,</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would inform us what thought has been put into that and exactly what is involved in that paragraph.  I should like to know if the Minister and his Department have considered what arrangements are likely to be made.  We know that the Minister's Department make regulations fairly quickly and probably at present have them in draft form.  I do not mean to be funny when I say that sometimes they make the regulations before a Bill is enacted.  That would suggest to me that the Minister has considerable information at his disposal as to the type of regulation that would be made.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) also provides for the giving by the person concerned of security for their observance of the contract. What type of security has the Minister in mind?  Will it be security given by a private individual or will it be the more formal type of security such as an insurance company bond or a bank bond?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the substitution of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the main point the Deputy is debating.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; gives greater flexibility and the Minister of the day can impose a terminal date if he decides it is in the interest of the proposal or it can be reached by agreement between the local authority and the promoter in question. The flexibility is there whereby if a date is set at 20 years a clause can be inserted that this would be reviewed every five or ten years.  That is a very reasonable approach. If the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; was substituted it could cause greater difficulties than the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  For example, <Col N="1165" /> there are many uncertainties in the world money markets, interest rates, oil shortages and so on, and these are all factors which govern the volume of traffic and how successful or viable a particular bridge tunnel or road might be from the point of view of the people involved in it. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; offers greater flexibility where any proposal is concerned.  It does not prevent the two parties concerned agreeing on a date duration clause or inhibit the Minister insisting on such a clause which could be subject to review every so often in the light of experience with the scheme concerned.</P>
      <P>If we were to insist on a definite date duration clause of ten or 15 years without the experience of how viable a scheme is we might inhibit the question of cross-subsidisation, which Deputy Quinn mentioned before.  It might prove better and more beneficial to a road authority in a county if there were profits accruing from a scheme that they could be directed towards further schemes by regulation of the Minister. The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would create problems while the &ldquo;may&rdquo; would safeguard the public interest.  The interests of all concerned can be safeguarded by agreement with the local authorities or by direction from the Minister concerned, who could insist on such a clause if he thought it in the best interests of road users and the people.  He could also have this subjected to a periodic review and change it subject to that review and the outcome of such a review.  In my view the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the best one and I cannot accept the substitution of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important section. The Minister told us that this was a piece of legislation enabling the private sector to become involved in our roads system.  As introduced this could be turned on its head and we could be told that this is legislation enabling the public sector to get money from the private sector which it otherwise would not get if it could not by-pass the Minister for Finance.  I raised the question of how the Minister would view an approach by any public sector agencies, a road authority, into the commercial money market to get money.  I asked if that would be interpreted as an additional load on our public sector borrowing.  I appreciate that that is not a matter that can be readily answered and I do not know if the Minister has had an opportunity to inquire about it.  The Labour Party would be eased in our concern about the enabling legislation if we felt it was enabling in both directions and that a road authority could go on to the international money market, the EMS money market through the EIB or the domestic money market, to raise funds.  I am talking about funds of the order of £30 to £50 million because I am talking about funding the existing road programme as distinct from funding a short-cut bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) states that a road authority may, with the consent of the Minister, enter into an agreement with the party or parties with whom it has entered into a previous agreement. Unless the private sector is coming up with a new road proposal, as distinct from wanting to participate in an existing road programme, I do not see any role the private sector has to play in this area other than providing capital.  Looking realistically at the volume of capital involved for any serious road programme, unless we made more money out of <Col N="1167" /> CAP than any farmer wants to admit, that kind of capital is not around.  If it is around I am sure the Minister for Finance would like to know where it is. The only people with that sort of money are the banks or financial institutions. Therefore, the role of the private sector would be to act as a sort of broker, agents for money.  Why can a county manager, with the authority of his councillors, not approach the banks directly and attempt to raise money on the market?</P>
    <P>There is no mention of the role of the Minister for Finance and from that I assume it is suggested that the money that would come into this sector would be private money which otherwise would not find its way into the public sector.  I should like to know in fiscal and financial terms the definition of money so raised by a local authority.  If it is public sector borrowing will it be subject to the budgetary constraints as a percentage of GNP?  That major question determines who is being enabled to do what in the legislation.  It is possible that had the legislation being presented in a different manner we would have spent less time on it.  If there is a satisfactory answer to that matter we can deal with it now and perhaps take the remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>With regard to what Deputy Fitzpatrick said in relation to the termination clause, am I right in assuming that whatever agreement is reached it has to be reached formally between the local authority and the other party involved and that the Minister has to consent to it before it comes up as the reserve function decision of the local authority?  Am I right in assuming that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the local authority under their reserve function powers are the group which will decide whether or not there is a termination clause we will be quite happy to leave that judgment to the local public representatives.  If they are not responsible enough to decide what they want to do in regard to the termination of the contract, we are all out of business.  I differ with Deputy Fitzpatrick in regard to this.  If the agreement <Col N="1168" /> has to be agreed by the local representatives before it goes to the Custom House for approval and if the local representatives decide they do not want a termination clause, then the logic of the Minister's argument stands: the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; gives greater flexibility than the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like to know what the interpretation of public sector borrowing is in relation to section 9.  If any local authority want to move in the morning on the assumption of my interpretation of section 9 that they can have the facility to go directly to the banks, are the regulations in draft form?  How quickly would the Minister give guidelines in relation to the ratio of tolls as a percentage of a capital re-employed, the period of time and all the rest of it? How prepared are the Department to respond to an initiative from a local authority?  Can the Minister now indicate to the House what volume of capital has been put forward as being available from the private sector if the necessary legislation is passed?</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that this Bill is an open door to the private sector, because it is very liberally interpreted. There are very few constraints placed on them.  They only have to give free passage to State vehicles.  They do not have to accommodate the wheelchaired and disabled Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to.  This House, subject to the normal commercial constraints, is entitled to get some indication from the Minister of the amount of capital from private sources which he and his officals have been told will possibly be available, subject to the legislative framework being adequate, to participate in toll bridges and roads.</P>
      <P>Is the capital likely to be provided by the private sector part of the public sector borrowing?  Does the Minister for Finance have any role in it?  Can that be defined in section 9?  If a local authority want to proceed on the basis that this legislation will be passed in the near future, is there a Government policy on toll roads readily available so that a local authority can get off the ground? What volume of money are we talking about that is available from the private sector?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the borrowing situation, where a local authority are concerned any borrowing they do is subject to sanction by the Minister under the 1960 Local Government Act.  It is not a question of regulations.  As far as the local authority are concerned, any borrowing has to be sanctioned.  The Deputy mentioned the commercial banks in relation to the private sector. The existing controls would be exercised by the Central Bank, not specifically by any Minister.  There is nothing to prevent the private sector borrowing if it is within the control of the Central Bank at the particular time.  It is possible they might borrow outside the country, perhaps from the EIB or some other place.  This would be subject to the existing controls of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>With regard to the volume of capital, there is no way we could assess this at the moment, as I have said on more than one occasion.  A lot of interest was expressed in this matter.  There was specific interest in one particular proposal, as everybody knows because of the publicity it got.  I would not attempt to assess what capital would be available, whether it is available to them already or whether they would borrow at this stage without further discussion with the particular local authority concerned.  There is nothing in this Bill that would prevent any person or company from having discussions with me or my Department beforehand in relation to those matters. We are only trying to get into a position to enable such hard discussions to take place.  I would not attempt to access the volume of capital which might be available.  I hope it will be quite sizeable.</P>
      <P>With regard to the duration clause raised by Deputy Quinn and who would have the power to insist on this at local authority level, it is the elected representatives who would insist on that.  All through the Bill the powers are with the elected representatives.  It depends very much on the wisdom of these elected representatives to assess the decisions during the discussions before the matter comes to the Minister for approval.</P>

      <P>I am talking now about capital sums of £30 million and £40 million. If a local authority go to a group of banks to borrow £X million for a toll scheme and they are told by the Minister for the Environment that the Minister for Finance says that this would unduly increase the public sector borrowing and the local authority then go to a broker and ask him to organise this borrowing on the private market, would that money be subject to the same scrutiny and control as money which the local authority directly negotiate for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if it is borrowed by the local authority directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is borrowed directly by the local authority it falls within the public sector borrowing.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the local authority say they will not borrow it directly, that they will not sign with the AIB, for example, but instead will sign with some financial brokers and if those people, in turn, raise the money on the legal value of the contract with the local authority, one borrowing requirement will not be subject to public sector definition but the other borrowing requirement will be so subject.  If a local authority wanted they could circumvent the Minister for Finance by doing that and they would have to pay the broker a percentage, but a percentage of £20 million is a lot of money in order to get around the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the right circumstances many local authorities would like to get into the money market.  As a result of the EMS and other factors there is a lot of long-term capital around that might be available for this kind of project.  We know that the by-pass at Naas is giltedged in terms of security and so on.  If such ventures by the local authority will <Col N="1171" /> be subject to the constraints of the Minister for Finance&mdash;which have nothing to do with the Custom House&mdash;the enabling aspect of this legislation will be handicapped.  I should like some clarification from the Minister on this point although I accept that it may take some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised the question of whether a local authority borrow directly or through a broker. Whichever way they borrow the money, the matter will be subject to scrutiny and sanction by the Minister.  Even if they go through an agent, which is all a broker would be, it would still be the local authority who are borrowing the money and the matter would be subject to the same scrutiny and sanction.  The fact that they use an agent would not make any difference.  Personally I do not see the point in a local authority working through a broker if they have to pay commission.  They will be subject to the same sanction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that matter.  I am not a financial expert and I should like to clarify some other points.  Is it possible that a formal agreement could be drafted between a group of banks and a local authority to enter into the joint financing of a particular scheme which would not be perceived as the local authority borrowing money in the traditional way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Any borrowing by a local authority is subject to sanction and any agreement entered into is subject to sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Some banks&mdash;I am thinking of merchant banks&mdash;by way of financing certain projects take out equity as distinct from personal securities or guarantees.  If a local authority with a group of merchant banks set up a project in which the banks take out equity as distinct from debentures or securities of one kind or another, would that qualify as borrowing?  Will a local authority be able to go directly to the money market or will they have to get sanction every time they move from the Minister and also from the Department <Col N="1172" /> of Finance or will the banks simply provide the money?  I do not see that the private sector has any contribution to make to a local authority who want to carry out their own road programme. The local authority have their own design staff and maintenance crews and they have their own road programme. The only way the private sector can come in is where they are adding to the road programmes by way of a bridge and so on.  The only thing a local authority need from outside their own resources is finance.  If their access to finance will not be enabled by this legislation, then I do not think this can be described as enabling legislation.</P>
      <P>I am trying to find out if there is some formula of equity ownership or equity participation between a bank or a group of banks and the local authority which could be so legally framed as to qualify to meet the provisions of this Bill and, at the same time, that would not be seen as direct borrowing in the traditional sense and, therefore, would not come under the scrutiny of the 1960 Act or any other provisions that govern local authority borrowing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If a situation should arise where the merchant banks would get involved in the equity it would be the equivalent of any company in the private sector reaching agreement with a local authority.  The merchant bank or banks would be the second party to an agreement for a proposal for a toll scheme.  It would be a matter for agreement between them and the local authority. Any borrowing by the local authority has to be sanctioned.  If a bank wants to put up a certain percentage of the total cost they would enter into an agreement similar to what we spoke about on various Stages of the Bill: they would not just remain a sleeping partner, merely putting up the money.  Merchant banks being what they are, I should imagine they would want an agreement. They would play the same role as any company or person that would be involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I should like to tidy up two points and to raise another matter.  First, I wish to raise the question of the amount of the toll in the light of an agreement under section 9.  It is clear that section 9 does not provide for the fixing of what I would call individual tolls or a charge for crossing a bridge or using a road.  There are three steps.</P>
      <P>Section 3 provides for the making of a toll scheme, and that must be approved by the Minister.  Section 4 has provision for the entering of objections and so forth.  At that stage the toll scheme has been fixed.  Section 5 provides for bye-laws which fix the charge that a vehicle owner will pay for use of the bridge or road.  What is the position in regard to the agreement?  Will the terms be fixed before the agreement has been entered into?  I would imagine they would have to be because you could not expect a private individual to invest a considerable amount of money if he did not know what the toll charges would be.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated then that the bye-laws would be changed for each new scheme, or that from the beginning if a bridge is to be subject to tolls it will be known that it will be operated by the private sector, that the scheme will be made in the ordinary way and that the contractor will be involved in the making of the bye-laws in order to satisfy himself that it will be worth his while to construct the bridge?  The agreement apparent does not provide for the individual toll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I am making myself clear. There are three stages: there is the scheme under section 3, the bye-laws under section 5 and the agreement under section 9.  The agreement does not provide for the fixing of a toll per <Col N="1174" /> journey, and any contractor would be interested in that.  Therefore, I assume the contractor must be in at the making of the bye-laws.  The next question is whether the Minister can alter an agreement under section 9.  Is not his only control that he may refuse to approve, that he may say he will not approve of a scheme but that if so and so were done he would approve of it, and then the scheme would go back to the road authorities for amendment?  Finally, I should like to say a word, purely from a legal viewpoint, on subsection (5) of section 9 which reads:</P>
    <P>The parties to an agreement under this section shall carry out the agreement in accordance with its terms and conditions and a road authority shall have all such powers as may be necessary for that purpose.</P>
    <P>With all due respect to the draftsman and his advisers, I suggest that is superfluous.  Subsection (1) confers on a road authority the right to enter into such an agreement, and presumably if a person legally enters into an agreement he is bound by its terms.  Perhaps there is some good explanation in the Minister's brief in regard to what subsection (5) adds to the section.  The parties to any agreement which they are competent to enter into and if it is not contrary to law, are bound by the agreement, and each would have all his legal rights to enforce it.  It is generally accepted that it is not good drafting to write superfluous clauses into legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, there is the agreement between the local authority and the proposers.  That scheme may not be effected for two or three years.  The tolls would be fixed under section 5 when the scheme is about to become operational.  The amount of the charge could not therefore be fixed at the time of the agreement because the financial situation might change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Does that mean the contractor must be in on the bye-laws?  If he is not is he not buying a pig in a poke?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The bye-law would not <Col N="1175" /> be in conflict with the contents of the original agreement.  Subsection (5) is included to make it clear that there will be an obligation in law to comply with the terms and conditions of agreement under this section.  This is essential to cover the possibility of any grievances in regard to non-compliance with the agreement, and road authorities will not be devoid of powers considered necessary for the purpose of carrying out an agreement to the full.  If an agreement were framed in the form of a contract, the first item I have just mentioned would be covered, but the road authorities would still be subject to the <i>ultra vires</i> rule.  The Deputy's second question covers the matter of the competence in law of road authorities in relation to an agreement under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister agrees with me that there are three stages.  If an agreement with a private individual were not involved there would be only two, the toll scheme under section 3 and the bye-laws under section 5.  That would be the situation if the road authorities were operating the toll themselves.  The inclusion of a private individual brings the question of an agreement into the picture.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has said, the road authorities would enter into an agreement with the contractor to construct a toll bridge or road.  I agree with the Minister that it might be two or three years before the toll bridge or road would be ready for use.  In his last statement the Minister said that at that stage the bye-laws would have been made.  Is the contractor to have any right in regard to the making of the bye-laws? Can we say, for instance, that inflation has gone up and as a result he would be entitled to a more substantial toll?  How will the contractor be protected?  How is he to have a say three years after he has entered into an agreement in regard to the fixing of a toll?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In the financial statement which would be submitted with the agreement there would be an indication of the range of toll envisaged and at the <Col N="1176" /> appropriate time the toll charge would be fixed by bye-laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> If a man were to spend £1 million or may be £3 million on a stretch of road he would not like to be relying on an estimate given three years earlier. The agreement entered into will not fix the tolls.  We go back to the bye-laws. Perhaps the explanation is that the contractor is a shrewd man&mdash;he must be if he has control of that much money.  He will have to have control over the bye-laws because if he has not he cannot control his revenue and he cannot ensure he will get a reasonable return from the amount of money he spent on the bridge or road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The contractor would have safeguarded himself in the agreement. Otherwise, he would hardly have signed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I would expect so but this means that by reason of section 5, in an ordinary public sector toll scheme the tolls will be fixed by bye-laws drawn up by the local authority and approved by the Minister.  But where we bring in the private individual there must be something else written into section 5 to give the contractor necessary control to ensure that the tolls would be adequate to provide him with a fair return on his money.  This question must be considered. I consider subsection (5) of section 9 to be a lot of waffle.  Subsection (1) of that section provides that:</P>
      <P>Where a toll scheme is approved of by the Minister, a road authority may, with the consent of the Minister, enter into an agreement with another person under which, upon such terms and conditions as may be specified in the agreement...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion that is binding on the parties to the agreement, on the private contractor and on the road authority, each of whom has certain rights and obligations by reason of the agreement. Therefore, subsection (5) is totally unnecessary unless it is for the purpose of copperfastening something.  Regarding <Col N="1177" /> my question as to whether the Minister can amend an agreement, I do not think he can do this but he can refuse to approve an agreement and to continue to send it back to the road authority until such time as he might approve of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  The Minister would not be a party to the agreement.  His function would be either to approve or reject it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be reasonable to assume from what the Minister has just said and from the points raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick that on the passing of this legislation the regulations will be published without delay?  The Minister, in common with Deputy Fitzpatrick and I, knows local government rather well. He must know that a city or county manager will not begin drafting an agreement merely on the basis of section 9 unless he is given some indication from the Custom House as to what is likely to be given consent.  We know how our system of government works.  Perhaps the Minister would give some indication as to whether the regulations will outline a draft form of agreement.  I am not trying to ascertain what is likely to be the situation because I know the Minister cannot commit himself to that extent but he might let us know whether the regulations will contain either a series of models or a model form of agreement for the benefit of local authorities, containing specific reference to the question of termination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There will not be any such model but we would welcome any discussion that might be necessary in regard to enlightening local authority managers or elected representatives at any time.  The Deputy appreciates that a model can vary from one proposal to another but there is no reason for precluding discussion at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably any toll scheme would concern the national primary route system.  There will hardly be toll schemes in operation on minor <Col N="1178" /> roads or on by-passes.  By virtue of being responsible for roads the Minister must have some national responsibility in this context.  Consequently, may we not expect some lead from him on this question?  On the basis of this enabling legislation might we not expect the Minister to inform some local authorities that there will be money available in, say, the next five years or that, alternatively, they should talk about possible toll schemes.  What may we expect to come from the Custom House as a result of this legislation?  I would suggest to the Minister that, in the event of the Department not taking some initiative, most local authorities would not act on the basis of this enabling legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that he has spent a year having the legislation drafted.  He has told us, too, that the private sector have expressed considerable interest in the toll roads scheme and we have clarified that a local authority have the right by way of equity participation to formalise an agreement directly with a group of finance companies, including a merchant bank.  If the Minister really wishes to give substance to this legislation something more must be given to county managers.  Basically the only additions that can be made in this regard are in terms of section 8 which deals with regulations.  We have almost completed this Bill so far as this House is concerned and it is only reasonable at this point to ask the Minister to give some indication of initiatives of any kind that may be on the agenda.  I am not seeking specific commitments but for some indication as to what role, if any, the Minister envisages for the Department other than the statutory role as outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be sending a circular to each county manager or local authority.  For their information this circular will set out the provisions of the Bill and what these provisions permit them to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it envisaged that the circular would offer technical assistance in regard to the drafting of an agreement and in computing and calculating the returns necessary to ensure that the tolls <Col N="1179" /> would pay for all the items referred to in section 9?</P>
      <P>The areas in which there are to be the most likely toll schemes in terms of the road programme as distinct from estuary crosses are medium-sized local authorities with limited scales of managerial resources.  We are not talking basically of places like Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford or Galway but of places such as Laois, Offaly and Tipperary. While I have the greatest respect for the personnel in the local authorities in those areas their degree of experience and skill is limited.  In terms of the Minister getting a response to the legislation I am interested in hearing whether the Department will be prepared to offer their professional expertise as distinct from supplying simple information by way of circular.  The people concerned in the local authorities could probably ascertain from the Official Report the outline of the legislation but the Minister may intend offering something more than this in the circular he proposes framing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be of assistance to any local authority but not in the technical sense to which the Deputy refers because the Minister must approve finally of any scheme.  I would envisage a situation in which local authorities would have their own consultants for any major scheme and I expect that in regard to the private sector and the local authority both being involved in any scheme they would have consultants either jointly or separately.  Apart from technical assistance, any other type of assistance that might be required would be available from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The consultants that I am referring to would be fiscal or managerial consultants.  In most cases the county manager would ask the treasurer to come up with some programme of financing that would end with a toll charge over a number of years.  If a local authority goes into partnership with a private organisation, the members of the local authority whose function is to finally agree the <Col N="1180" /> agreement will not be able to get an objective assessment.  Would a local authority have the power to hire independent financial consultants without the Minister's consent?</P>

Has the Minister given any thought to the type of regulation that would be introduced in regard to section 9?  I can clearly visualise the type of regulation that would be necessary under section 3.  We should be clear in our minds that an agreement under section 9 would be an assessment between the road authority and the contractor with the approval of the Minister.  It will be a private document between the road authority and the contractor and will only reflect itself in the toll charged.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In underlying the reaction of the Labour Party to this Bill, I hope to deal directly with the suggestion contained in the Minister's speech that this Bill deals &ldquo;in a responsible and acceptable way with a problem which has been a matter of political debate for <Col N="1182" /> the past six or seven years but which has not so far been resolved."  I do not believe that this Bill deals in a responsible and acceptable way with the problem.  At the time I did not believe that the Bill introduced by the previous administration dealt with the problem in a responsible and acceptable way.  For a variety of reasons virtually all the political parties face two ways&mdash;in some cases three ways&mdash;on the question of family planning.  There is no great internal agreement in the Fianna Fáil Party, there are differences of view in my own party, and substantial differences of view in the Fine Gael Party.  That mirrors the disagreement which exists within the country among many shades of opinion on this important issue.  For some people it is a very fundamental issue.</P>
      <P>For the Minister to come into the House and say that this is &ldquo;the first real Family Planning Bill&rdquo; is a travesty of rational assessment of the Bill.  For the Minister to say &ldquo;the Bill now before the House genuinely merits the title of Family Planning&rdquo; can only bring a hollow laugh, whether one has a medical mind or a mind trained in the social sciences or in legal affairs.  By any analysis the Bill does not genuinely merit its title.  I became quite irate when the Minister went on to suggest &ldquo;This Bill is a Family Planning Bill in the full and proper sense of those words&rdquo;.  Towards the end of his speech he said that the Bill is &ldquo;a sincere attempt to meet the situation in a reasonable and acceptable manner&rdquo;. Finally he coined for all time the unique comment that this Bill &ldquo;seeks to provide an Irish solution to an Irish problem&rdquo;.  This stretches too far the extent of my personal credulity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some ways I have more regard for the document issued by the Order of the Knights of St. Columbanus, which was circulated to delegates at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis and also to Members of this House.  In its erroneous nonsense this document is at least more honestly drafted than the Bill.  It genuinely states the absolute error of its assessment.  It states that where contraception legislation has been introduced premarital and extramarital sexual activity escalates, illegitimacy surprisingly, increases, <Col N="1183" /> venereal disease increases, legalised abortion is soon demanded to deal with failures of contraception and then the young are the first to suffer.  At least that is a point of view.  It is a point of view with which I totally disagree, but it is stated in an unvarnished way.  The Minister attempts to suggest that this Bill is genuine, sincere, reasonable, responsible and unique to Irish law.  We all know that the Minister does not believe this and neither do his departmental staff, the Irish Medical Association and rational politicians&mdash; though it is very hard to find rational politicians on this issue.  It is time to examine why we must interminably discuss this matter in this manner.</P>
    <P>There are some members of my party and very many people throughout the country who, for spiritual and religious reasons, believe that it is a sin to practice contraception in a particular form known as artificial contraception.  They believe it to be a mortal sin in accordance with the teaching of the Catholic Church.  If people have a religious faith of such strength, I entirely respect it.  I do not believe contraception to be sinful or immoral and there can be differences of view in terms of one's faith.  However, we as legislators must clearly draw the line when those who hold that contraception is immoral and sinful insist that their view be enshrined in legislation for all the people of the land, irrespective of their religion.  I must add a crucially important point.  When such persons say it is not only immoral and sinful but advance in support of their view alleged sociological and medical evidence, one can see sharply that the matter is open to rational dispute.  I make that point emphatically.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any great need to make contraceptives widely available either in slot machines, or barber shops, and so on.  That is not necessary.  I hold the view strongly that it is entirely reasonable and fair that contraceptives, and particularly non-medical contraceptives, should be available not only to married persons but also to single persons.  Single persons, if they so wish, and if it is in accordance with their conscience, <Col N="1184" /> have a right to avail of contraception. Non-medical contraceptives, and Condoms in particular, should be available in chemist shops, in health board clinics, and in family planning clinics.</P>
    <P>I have an open mind about the age limit.  Perhaps it should be 18 years of age and upwards.  I would not advocate it myself, nor would I wish to see young people involved in it, but it is legally permissible for persons of 17 years of age and upwards to have sexual relations.  It is not a criminal offence.  People have sexual relations outside marriage.  That is a fact of life.  I would not encourage that because I believe that, in their human relationships, people should act in as responsible and caring a way as possible.  Sometimes one would almost believe that it is a criminal offence here to have sexual relations outside marriage.</P>
    <P>I believe very strongly that this Bill will prove to be unconstitutional.  I do not propose to go into the FitzGerald judgement on the McGee case, but one can presume that in future some unmarried men or women in their twenties will bring the Minister to court to test the section on the grounds that it is an infringement of their human rights.  That vague, maladroitly-drafted section relating to alleged <i>bona fide</i> practices, whatever that means, before one can get an authorisation from a doctor, whatever &ldquo;authorisation&rdquo; means, will be declared unconstitutional, I have no doubt.  One does not have to have any extensive training in legal affairs to come to that conclusion.</P>
    <P>There has been an enormous amount of propaganda about abortion.  I have been subjected to it over the past ten years in this House.  I have received the most horrific multi-coloured photographs dealing with abortion.  They have also been sent into my home where I have four young children.  The sensitivity of the people who send them out does not extend to that.  Gruesome photographs relating to abortion are their way of trying to convince me to oppose contraception.  By and large they have been counter-productive.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies can distinguish sharply <Col N="1185" /> between the issues of contraception and abortion.  To his credit the Minister makes that distinction clearly.  Although abortifacients are not defined clearly in the Bill, I do not propose to get involved with the Minister about that question.  I am opposed to abortion.  I could not support legislation in Dáil Éireann in favour of abortion but I can distinguish between legislation in that regard and legislation relating to contraception.  Most Deputies are mature enough to understand the need to make that distinction between those two separate questions.</P>
    <P>I want to commend the articles by Dr. David Nowlan, the medical correspondent of <i>The Irish Times.</i>  He published three excellent articles.  In one of the articles he included a table related to abortions in Britain giving residents of the Republic of Ireland and residents of Northern Ireland.  He said:</P>
    <P>The only point to make about the table is that the figures for the Republic are certainly substantially lower than the true state of affairs because it is known and has been shown, that many women from the Republic give English accommodation addresses when they go for abortions; and the Northern Ireland figures are probably subjected to the same bias.  But it is trends that we are looking for.  Does the ready availability of contraceptives lead to an increase in abortion rates?</P>
    <P>He went on to refute the general assertion which is made by the opponents of contraception that, if it is available, inevitably it will lead to a demand for legalised abortion.  It is disgraceful that some people have succumbed to that kind of irresponsible allegation in an attempt to decry the benefits which should be available to women in particular.  As a predominently male Legislature we tend to underscore the benefits to women of contraception.</P>
    <P>One of the aspects of family planning is that, generally speaking, it is advisable for people to have their families at as young an age as possible, if they are blessed with an early marriage, and if they are blessed with children.  The older <Col N="1186" /> one gets the greater risk in terms of infant mortality or maternal death.  Dr. Nowlan quoted a statistic which should go on the record of the House.  He said that a study of 350,000 live births in America showed that maternal death rates rose from 5.1 per 10,000 births to mothers under 20 years of age, to 34.3 per 10,000 births when the mothers were over 40 years of age. In other words, he said that having your baby early in life rather than later is safer, and to achieve that will normally involve some kind of contraceptive activity, at least in the later reproductive years.  There is no need to take the word of Dr. David Nowlan on it.  There is a great deal of evidence from the WHO as well.  That kind of evidence is widely available both in this country and abroad and is something with which every family, every family doctor and every gynaecologist will be familiar.</P>
    <P>I come to another argument in favour of contraception.  He went on to say that a study of infant deaths around the time of birth, carried out in Britain in the 1960s, showed that peri-natal mortality rates rose from 24.2 per 1,000 births on first pregnancy through 30 on the third to over 50 deaths per 1,000 births when the mother was in her fifth pregnancy. He pointed out then that the interval between births was shown to affect the percentage of births that were premature. I agree with his analysis here.  It is of extreme importance to point out that the substantial medical, human and marital benefits from contraception arise where children come into life when the parents are relatively young and that the risk inherent in having children as a mother becomes older is substantially diminished.  Secondly, contraception enables families to space births.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, and of extreme importance, there is nothing more disturbing to any legislator in this House, nothing more awful in my experience and nothing more desperate in terms of trying to come to grips with it, than to notice a family in which a young child is not wanted by the mother, the father or both. Very often one is absolutely powerless to do anything about it, particularly as a politician trying to see how <Col N="1187" /> best that family might be encouraged. This can happen anywhere.  In the absence of contraceptive advice a child may arrive who, for reasons best known to the individuals concerned, is not particularly wanted.  It is very difficult for the vast majority of us to conceive of any situation where any child might not be wanted, but such are the vagaries of human emotion and reaction that this happens.  There is substantial evidence to indicate that children who are unwanted very often become battered children. There is nothing more horrendous for most of us, and for all politicians, particularly those who served for any length of time, than to come across the case of a battered child perhaps every two or three years.  It happens, and can be attributed to the fact that the family did not in any way practice contraception. The child arrived and there was not much thought about it.  People acted in an irresponsible manner.  They took chances and then that child had the most awful reception from its parents at the most formative period of its life.  That is an argument in favour of contraception.</P>
    <P>I do not want to overstate the arguments, but there has been so much propaganda against contraception that the positive, happier, more beneficial aspects of it have to be stressed.  I do not get any pleasure or relief in a legislative sense in coming into this House having so to state.  It is an appalling reflection on Irish society that one should have to say these things repeatedly to a country which prides itself so much on the Christian family and on the care of children in this International Year of the Child.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the practice of contraception, provided&mdash;and one must continually enter the <i>caveats</i>&mdash;that it is not contrary to the personal moral beliefs of the families and individuals concerned who will under no circumstances practise it, can lead to a happier marital relationship.  In the event of individuals who are not married having sexual relationships it can lead to a very substantial chance that children will not be conceived in that relationship.  In that context we seem to be acting at least in a somewhat responsible manner, even if one suspends one's moral judgement as to <Col N="1188" /> the appropriateness or otherwise of what one is doing.  I want to put that on record because I have found that the vast bulk of the material that I have received in the post has been so self-righteous and negative, and so assuming of the moral responsibility on our own behalf, that it seems to be the product of a rather Jansenistic concept of life which is so unhappy, so unloving and so negative, looking around corners to find evil and sin, that at times one begins to question one's own Christian beliefs.  Unless one goes constantly to the positive, the good and the benefits, one could finish up being almost impaired by that kind of propaganda.</P>
    <P>I come now to the nub of the Bill.  Section 4 states that contraceptives shall be sold only by chemists in their shops and only to persons named in a prescription or authorisation given by a registered medical practitioner.  I find section 4 reprehensible.  I am surprised that a longstanding parliamentarian like the Minister, a man of such legislative experience, such knowledge of the ways of the world, a man who has had such considerable contact with the medical profession and such direct contact with the pharmaceutical chemists of the country since he became Minister should finish up with this repugnant formula to get around the sensitivities of conscience making a bad situation even worse.  It is outrageous that one should say to a person seeking a non-medical contraceptive: &ldquo;You must go to the doctor; you must advise that doctor that you want a non-medical contraceptive&rdquo;&mdash;to use the parliamentary term for a condom.  It is outrageous that one must say to one's family doctor&mdash;and lots of people, particularly young people do not have an individual doctor&mdash;&ldquo;sorry, I am not married; I am here though for a <i>bona fide</i> purpose; I am not looking for 10 pints of Guinness as a contraceptive; I am looking for a condom; I want a written authorisation,&rdquo; presumably on a piece of paper which will have family planning stamped on it, because presumably this will be subject to regulation by the Minister.  That person will have to sit in the doctor's surgery, when the receptionist will come out and say to that young man, or woman, or married man: <Col N="1189" />&ldquo;What are you here for?&rdquo;  Of course, Ministers do not frequent surgeries; they are treated at a slightly more exalted level.  But that receptionist will ask: &ldquo;What are you here for; do you want your certificate; are you still on disability benefit?&rdquo;  Whereupon the unfortunate person will have to respond: &ldquo;No, I want a certificate for a packet of condoms&rdquo;, perhaps in front of 20 or 30 people. That person will be forced to tell the receptionist: &ldquo;No, I cannot tell you what I want; I want to see the doctor privately. All I can say it that Morecombe and Wise will have little difficulty in having a free, rich source of Irish Paddy joke material.  Probably it will come to that. Not only will it be unconstitutional, it will be hilarious.  The unfortunate person, having received this notorious piece of paper&mdash;I only wish that poor old Myles na Gopaleen was alive today when he would have us in stitches; he would well outdo Man Bites Dog, Man Bites Doctor or whatever, in terms of analysis&mdash;must go to the local chemist who will look at him with jaundiced eyes in between dispensing bars of palm olive soap and, to the likes of me, hair restorer or something like that, and ask him what he wants, when the written authorisation will have to be produced.  He will then get his supply&mdash;with again the big proviso&mdash;provided that chemist has not a conscientious objection, in which case the unfortunate devil at that point, probably in the extremity of the purpose for which he wished the said non-medical contraceptives, will have to travel another half mile or, if he happens to live in a rural town, will have to borrow a car and drive to the next town to get a replacement of supplies.</P>
    <P>If it were not so tragic, so ridiculous, so dreadful in terms of legislation the situation could be funny but it is not.  It is anything but funny, a situation in which one appoints the medical profession, the registered medical practitioners, the moral arbiters of the supply of a non-medical contraceptive, in which they are officially designated under this Bill.  In that situation one must say to the Minister: do you really believe it; do you really think that is a genuine solution to an Irish problem as you stated in your final oration on this Bill?  I suggest to <Col N="1190" /> him that it most certainly is not.</P>
    <P>Of course there is an additional difficulty in this regard&mdash;the doctor and the chemist will be paid for all of this. Not only is the moral, family and individual privacy of the individual endangered, in the process, his pocket is fleeced.  I presume the Minister will devise a system such as that under which one goes to a doctor and gets a repeat prescription, or the kind of thing that operates when one is on a course of injections.  Presumably the Minister will devise some system under which an individual can obtain repeat authorisations without having to pay for them.  I have not met very many doctors who will not demand another £2 or £3; one has to pay them.  Nor do I know of any chemists around the country who will gaily distribute non-medical contraceptives without adding a prescription charge, whether it be 47p, 50p or whatever.  Certainly they will demand payment as well.  Therefore the unfortunate individual will have to pay out of his pocket, through invasion of his privacy and of course by exposure to the world of the purpose for which he seeks such contraceptives.</P>
    <P>Of course a certain justification has been advanced by the Minister.  It is of crucial importance that this House should endeavour to understand the rationale of the Minister as to why he has so designated the general practitioner-individual relationship.  Let us listen to the advice of the Minister.  He said of the doctor, if I may quote:</P>
    <P>He is the person who most appropriately can give such advice and assistance since he is the professional person who knows most</P>
    <P>I stress this&mdash;</P>
    <P>about the physical and the psychological characteristics of the couple seeking his advice and who is also aware in a general&mdash;or frequently in a very specific&mdash;way of their social and financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>As the Minister well knows, if one takes, for example, health board visitation statistics, the number of persons who visit their general practitioner annually is <Col N="1191" /> not very great.  How many of us go to the doctor on a regular, annual basis or twice a year, three times or five times? How many doctors are aware of the physical and the psychological characteristics of the couple seeking their advice?  Probably they are a young couple between the ages of 20 and 35 because the incidence of birth after 35 drops quite sharply.  The couple may not be that well known to the doctor.  To suggest, as the Minister does, that that is the reason this moral arbitration must devolve on general practitioners, to suggest that that is the profound reason for such distribution of non-medical contraceptives is less than honest and I do not believe that the Minister believes it.</P>
    <P>Furthermore one is confronted by a situation in which the rationale advanced by the Minister mentions the word &ldquo;couple&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;couple&rdquo; seeking his advice.  We then have this unique piece of vocabulary, &ldquo;the couple&rdquo;.  What is meant by &ldquo;the couple&rdquo;?  Is it a married couple, an unmarried couple, or a widower and the lady with whom he is consorting?  As I understand the legal definition of the term the latter are considered &ldquo;a couple&rdquo;.  There is no reference in any part of the Bill to the word &ldquo;couple&rdquo;.  It merely uses the phrase &ldquo;a person&rdquo;.  Suddenly, and magically, &ldquo;a person&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;a couple&rdquo;.  The Minister could not get permission from the Government to introduce a Bill except it was explicit throughout it that married people would get contraceptives, but not single people.  He could not put that into the Bill because he knows it would be unconstitutional.  It is implicit in the section relating to the issue of contraceptives for <i>bona fide</i> purposes that it will have to be married persons.</P>
    <P>The Minister hopes to slide out under a constitutional action on this matter. Section 4 (2) states:</P>
    <P>A registered medical practitioner may, for the purposes of this Act, give a prescription or authorisation for a contraceptive to a person if he is satisfied that the person is seeking the contraceptive, <i>bona fide</i>, for family planning purposes...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> The subsection then went on to deal with &ldquo;the couple&rdquo;.  The Minister carefully did not include the words &ldquo;married couple&rdquo; because he hopes we will be all very good boys and not embarrass him. He holds the view that we have enough egg on our face in relation to our previous efforts and hopes we will allow him get this Bill without any rigorous analysis.</P>
    <P>I find that section particularly objectionable. It is medically unnecessary to devolve such a responsibility on GPs. Every doctor knows it is outrageous to suggest that they should have to issue a written authorisation for a non-medical contraceptive.  That is the widespread view of the medical profession.  Medical surgeries are overcrowded and overworked enough without having hundreds of people coming from family planning clinics seeking contraceptives because they are obliged to do so under the Bill.  Whatever the excuses advanced by the Minister, it is even more invidious that those unfortunate people, customs officials, should be placed by the Minister in a similar position.  It must bring a wry smile to some customs officers in relation to the Minister. Customs officers will have to decide whether the quantities of contraceptives are sufficient for the traveller's own use. I recall a former Minister deciding to try to put a numerical limit on the quantity that would be permitted for personal use. Needless to say, apart from appearing as a note on the file it did not get very far at Cabinet level; they had enough sense not to be drawn into that argument.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous to place that onus on customs officers.  It makes a laughing stock of those unfortunate people who have enough to administer in terms of trying to ensure that arms and ammunition and other illegal contrabands are not brought in.  Presumably, a principal officer in the Department of Health, or the Department of Finance, will have to give such people guidelines.  Will it be a couple of dozen or a couple of gross? What will the limitation be?  Will there be an age limitation?  If an unmarried young person under 25 is found in possession of contraceptives and declares they are for his own personal use, what <Col N="1193" /> will the situation be?  If the customs officers find that he has 34 dozen and asks the person concerned how he can claim they are for his personal use, what will the situation be?</P>

      <P>I was acutely embarrassed about the previous Bill, which I had to accept.  I was ashamed of it and thought it awful.  I was more ashamed of the vote than the Bill, but that is the way it went.  There is nothing wrong in doing a little bit of St. Paul's confession to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We all have a few confessions to make now and then and on this issue there is nothing lost by being honest.  The Minister cannot hide behind that.  Customs officers will have a responsibility under this legislation which they do not want and which should not be given to them.  It will prove impractical in terms of implementation. That must be stressed.  A statement will have to be made in relation to this and I do not know whether it will be in Arabic, Irish or English.  A notice will also have to be printed in the Aer Lingus <i>Cara</i> magazine outlining to travellers the situation in relation to the possession of contraceptives.  As one arrives at Dublin Airport one hears announcements by air hostesses to the effect that if one visited a farm while abroad one must report to the Department of Agriculture inspector. I am sure those beautiful stewardesses of Aer Lingus will now have to tell passengers of the existence of a regulation by the Department of Health whereby a person carrying a quantity of contraceptives in excess of the national norm of usage by an individual over a period will have to report to an inspector of the Department.  It is not hard to imagine the reaction and incredulity of tourists and the greater hilarity of Irish passengers who are paying enough to travel <Col N="1194" /> by Aer Lingus without having to pay for hollow jokes also.  This is too ridiculous for enshrinement in legislation.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the section which specifies that contraceptives may only be imported by licence to be granted by the Minister.  The Minister stated that licences will be granted to wholesalers who wish to import contraceptives for sale or a licence may be granted directly to a pharmaceutical chemist.  He has excluded the right of family planning clinics to import contraceptives directly.  If they were designated as wholesalers and got a licence they could import them and they could distribute them.  All the indications are that the Minister intends that family planning clinics shall not have the right to import and distribute contraceptives, particularly non-medical contraceptives.</P>
      <P>The first family planning clinic opened in Dublin ten years ago.  I have not noticed any massive deterioration in national morality in that period.  During that period the Irish Family Planning Association clinics in Synge Street and Mountjoy Square in Dublin have had 50,000 people going to them.  That figure does not include those who go to family planning association clinics in Galway, Cork, Limerick, Bray or Navan.  It does not include either the many thousands of people who have received family planning advice from their own general practitioners and it does not include the issue of non-medical contraceptives directly in the post by the Irish Family Planning Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The largest single responsible contraceptive advice has emanated from the Irish Family Planning Association clinics which the Minister is closing down.  Unless they obtain licences to import and distribute contraceptives in those clinics, unless they employ chemists and have open shops in their clinics there is no way they can operate. I have had people coming to me asking if it is true that family planning clinics will be closed down.  I have told them: &ldquo;There is no point in going to a family planning clinic just for medical advice.  If you need a medical contraceptive you will receive it but if you need a non-medical contraceptive you will not <Col N="1195" /> receive it.&rdquo;  There are many trained family planning doctors who have received their family planning qualifications from the Joint Committee of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and who are qualified family planning doctors.  I predict that the family planning clinics will deliberately decide in the future, if this Bill becomes law, to continue to give that medical advice and to issue medical and non-medical contraceptives. They will also import contraceptives illegally either from Northern Ireland or Great Britain and they will continue with their work.  We will then face a situation where we shall have prosecutions if they go ahead and import those contraceptives illegally.  There are quite heavy penalties under this Bill.  We shall have prolonged litigation, court case after court case and the prospect of people being charged.  We will have public agitation on the matter because many thousands of people are affected.</P>
    <P>People can still go to family planning clinics for prescriptions and they will then have to go to chemists.  The family planning clinics will not tell medical card holders or people in dire need that they cannot give them any medical or non-medical contraceptives.  I believe that this Bill will be brought into contempt.  I believe that doctors who are currently advising couples and single people, both men and women, will not subject them to the rigours of this legislation because they disagree fundamentally with it.  This means that immediately after the enactment of the Bill we will inevitably have constitutional test cases.  The Minister has to take that into account.</P>
    <P>I know that a number of my colleagues on this side of the House are anxious to contribute.  Deputy Oliver Flanagan was ready to come in last week.  The two of us are close friends and we may agree on many things but we do not agree on this particular issue. I have been a delegate on the Council of Europe for the past five years and I am on the Social and Health Committee. That committee, together with the World Health Organisation, favour family planning. Deputy Flanagan does not accept that viewpoint.  He is also a delegate to the Council of Europe.  We can disagree <Col N="1196" /> at national level.  We have our respective points of view.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the emphasis within the Bill on natural family planning. I have tried through the Council of Europe and the World Health Organisation to get a copy of legislation which specifically deals with natural family planning.  So far I have not succeeded. There is a data research facility in the House of Commons and in the United States Senate but they have not been able to find specific legislation which advocates and deals with the question of natural family planning.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this is an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  Personally I could never accept the use of the phrase &ldquo;natural family planning&rdquo;.  I have often asked myself why this system is regarded as so wonderful.  What makes it so very different from so-called artificial family planning when, as I am reliably informed, there must be a degree of programmed abstinence from sexual relations, where there has to be a daily taking of temperature readings, where one has to keep an acute eye on the calendar, where one has to be welltrained and, of course, one should preferably be a Catholic.  All of that is regarded as natural.</P>
    <P>I remember a famous case involving a former Minister for Health, Mr. McEntee, with regard to fluoride in the water supply.  It was alleged it was unconstitutional. It occurs to me that that was as unnatural in that context as the emphasis now being put on natural family planning.  There has been a slight degree of uneasy palavering by the Minister, a kind of legislative crawl. He stated:</P>
    <P>When the Bill has been passed, I propose to work closely with NAOMI and with the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and to obtain their assistance in providing a comprehensive natural family planning service so that in coming to a decision about the manner in which they wish to plan their families, couples have available to them appropriate advice and information on this method of contraception in addition to other methods....</P>
    <P>Of course the Minister was on solid, <Col N="1197" /> safe, secure and moral ground on that matter.  Section 2 (b) of the Bill states that the Minister shall:</P>
    <P>provide a comprehensive natural family planning service, that is to say, a comprehensive service for the provision of information, instruction, advice and consultation in relation to methods of family planning that do not involve the use of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>Apparently if one reads a book, buys a Chinese thermometer and a Japanese calendar, marks down the rigid periods of alleged safety and non-safety and indulges in a multitude of other medical practices and so on, that is regarded as entirely natural while the use of a non-medical contraceptive is entirely unnatural. I marvel at the ingenuity and the capacity of the international moralist legislators to use language that can be so deceptive and which can be so designed that people accept the use of that kind of language as normal.  I say that as a married person and a legislator.  I have been married for 19 years and have a family ranging from 18 years to two years.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is the other reality, the one that has been dodged about and dealt with so carefully by those who advocate natural planning.  I want to be very careful here.  I am not for a moment suggesting that those who wish to avail of natural family planning should not have an absolute right to do so.  That is their privilege.  However, when the Minister enshrines it in legislation one is entitled to question the matter even if one is only doing it in a non-medical way.  I have no training in medical affairs.  I have only an informed conscience in relation to legislative matters.</P>
    <P>Dr. David Nowlan, medical correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i>, is perhaps the most reliable medical correspondent on a national newspaper. Frequently I am critical of some parliamentary and political correspondents, but I regard Dr. Nowlan as eminently fair, reasonable and rational on this matter and I do not think the Minister would dispute that, no more than the previous Minister.  This week Dr. Nowlan reported as follows in <i>The Irish Times:</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" /> The Billings, or ovulation, method of family planning has been described as &ldquo;relatively ineffective in general use for preventing pregnancy&rdquo; in an interim report from the World Health Organisation on research now being conducted in natural family planning methods.  The method has been heavily promoted in this country in recent years.</P>
    <P>Dr. Nowlan said later:</P>
    <P>This would give a risk of almost 20 pregnancies per 100 women years among users of the Billings or ovulation method of contraception. Interestingly, the Dublin results seem better than those in other centres.  A failure rate of 10.4 pregnancies per 100 women years was reported from Dublin,...</P>
    <P>As long as there is a rational analysis of the benefits and of the failure and success rates of this method, I have no great objection.  It is no business of mine whether it will be availed of by individuals but when it is enshrined in legislation we have an obligation to comment. Dr. Nowlan also stated:</P>
    <P>But a method which produces a failure rate (whether because of the method or its users) of the order of 20 per cent cannot be deemed an effective or acceptable means of contraception for most people.  This must be a cause of concern particularly in this country, where the Billings method has been promoted with an almost evangelical zeal.</P>
    <P>Perhaps when the full and final results of the WHO study become available, its promoters may try to reassess the place of the Billings method in limiting fertility or preventing pregnancy.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in the grants he is about to give for research on this method.  Needless to remark, the Minister has carefully indicated here that he does not propose to give grants for research on other methods of family planning.  He will only provide funds for research on what he calls natural methods.  I will not say that the Minister is dishonest, but once again he is acutely embarrassed intellectually by the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> I regret that we in the National Coalition were not any more successful in coming to grips with this extraordinarily difficult problem.  I do not think the Minister, though, can shelter behind that because since 1971 the present Taoiseach has been saying he would face up to the realities of Irish life.  So did Deputy O'Malley, but it has been left to Deputy Haughey to face up to this difficult task, and I do not think he has succeeded, which is a pity.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Corish was Minister for Health he threw out the possibility of setting up an all-party committee.  At last week's Fine Gael Ard Fheis Deputy Boland suggested the same thing in an effort to get something better than the Bill we now have.  Personally I would favour such an all-party committee. However, the suggestion has been flatly rejected by Fianna Fáil.  When Deputy Corish offered the suggestion he was told: &ldquo;It is your job, get on with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was chairman of a Special Committee of the Dáil on the Misuse of Drugs Bill and I can recall the tremendous contributions of Deputy Haughey.  He showed a marvellous degree of liberality. When a question arose in regard to dangerous drugs, drugs of a dubious nature, Deputy Haughey said in effect: &ldquo;You are pushing too far.  You are being too rigorous.  There are some drugs that are not entirely dangerous, and the proposed penalties in relation to them are too severe.&rdquo;  What do we get now. No sooner does the mercury appear under Deputy Haughey than he says that the most dangerous drug of all is a non-medical contraceptive.  This contrasts very sharply with the Minister's excellent performance on the Misuse of Drugs Bill.  Many newspaper people said to me at that time that Deputy Haughey's tolerance and understanding were outstanding.  I regret that in relation to this Bill he has not been seen to display similar aplomb.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we will oppose this Bill. There will be opposition to the Bill for a variety of reasons.  My reasons for going into the &ldquo;no&rdquo; lobby are, I think, evident. I hope I will have a happy death, that I will not be in a disastrous state of moral <Col N="1200" /> turpitude and sin in my final hours.  I hope I will receive due forgiveness for my opposition to this Bill.  When we see the women of this country so unrepresented in the House particularly from the point of view of the terrible impact this legislation will have on the role of women in society, I have no doubt that in the future the people of the country will look back on this debate and will comment on the immaturity displayed in the Bill and on what the country must have been going through when the Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>I suggest again that the Minister should avail of the offer of an all-party committee.  Perhaps we might then get agreement and save ourselves the shame and the embarrassment which all parties, but particularly Fianna Fáil, find themselves in from the point of view of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>All the emphasis seems to be on women in this House and outside. Men never seem to have to take any responsibility whatever.  I am glad to see this Bill being introduced by the Department of Health.  It is of as much concern to men as to women.  I feel sad to say that all family planning matters are being left to women all the time.  It is significant that those who are opposing the Bill are split into two sections: there are those who condemn it because it is too liberal, because it is opening floodgates of contraception; and on the other hand there are those who say that we should go back to the pre-McGee case and discontinue contraception completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must all face up to the fact that family planning is being practised widely here and that there is nothing anybody can do to stop it.  Thousands of couples are practising family planning, contraception, or whatever you like to call it, and rightly so.  People have a right as well as a responsibility to plan their families.  It is hard to find anything as sad or as degrading as to see a woman pregnant every year of her marriage, producing children one after the other, rendering her incapable of coping with the situation, of looking after her children, of teaching her babies what they should be learning.  She is incapable <Col N="1201" /> of keeping a decent home for her husband and her children.  It is sad to see women growing old before their time because of child-bearing.  Therefore, I am glad to see this Government making some effort to help such people.  It is appalling to listen to middle-aged and old men debating the various aspects of this Bill.  I will hand it to Deputy Desmond that he was being reasonable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not referring to the Deputy who I thought was reasonable.  Last week I listened to a Deputy from the Fine Gael benches speaking a lot of nonsense about family planning.  He wanted us to revert to the pre-McGee situation.  That is not on.</P>
      <P>I have ascertained that medical card holders will not have to pay their doctors in respect of consultations.  At least that is some help but I am concerned that in the case of a woman being given a prescription for contraceptives for a six-month period or, perhaps, for a year, if she is in the lower income group she would not be likely to be in a position to pay for contraceptives in that quantity on one visit to a chemist.  The problem would be that should she decide to obtain, say, a month's supply at a time, she would be charged a prescription fee on each visit to the chemist.  I urge the Minister to consider this aspect of the Bill and to try to ensure that a woman would only have to pay a oneprescription fee though she might be obtaining supplies during a six-month period on the basis of one prescription.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young couples nowadays are generally very responsible and the majority of them endeavour to set up a home as soon as possible after marriage.  It is responsible of them not to have a family for the first few years of marriage.  In these circumstances I would hope that they would be considered as <i>bona fide</i> family planning applicants as it were and that they would not have to wait until after they had a child to be put into that category.  In other words, family planning <Col N="1202" /> should be considered to begin from the moment the couple marry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important for a couple to set up home early in their married life and it is responsible on their part to decide not to have children until such time as they are in a position to care properly for them.</P>
      <P>What is the position regarding common law marriages?  Presumably such marriages are to be regarded also as family units entitled to family planning services.  The Minister has stated that he will set up family planning clinics under the auspices of the Eastern Health Board.  One of the aspects of the Bill that concerns me is the three-fold operation that will be involved in obtaining contraceptives. First, a woman will attend a clinic where she will be advised as to the method of contraception that would suit her best.  Apparently she must go then to a medical practitioner for a prescription and, last, she must go to the chemist for supplies.  Would it be possible to combine the entire operation in the one premises, for example, in the clinic, because if a woman must spend a good deal of time waiting first at the clinic and then at the doctor's before she can go to the chemist she may decide not to bother.  Apparently men will not be involved in the procuring of contraceptives. The whole onus will be placed on the woman in this regard.  I suggest that there be medical doctors and dispensing chemists in attendance at the clinics. This would streamline the whole operation. Women generally cannot afford to spend two or three hours waiting in a doctor's surgery especially if they have families.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about the existing family planning clinics.  These clinics have provided a reasonable service during the past years when family planning services were not available elsewhere.  Therefore, I should hope that the Minister in consultation with these clinics would incorporate them into the scheme he is talking of.  They have provided a service that the legislators should have provided for long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> Hopefully they will be incorporated into any further measures the Minister may take.</P>
    <P>Various people have drawn my attention to the possibility of young unmarried people being facilitated by doctors on requesting prescriptions for contraceptives. Girls nowadays of 15 or 16 often look some years older so that if a girl of that age should go to a doctor and pretend to be older and to be married, the doctor might not know that she was not telling the truth.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Most women will agree that the natural method of family planning is best if it works.  However, it does not always work.  It certainly does not work without the co-operation of husbands. Husbands should be educated to accept the natural method of family planning.  A wife with an alcoholic or irresponsible husband has no control over the situation.  I am certain that the majority of women would welcome the natural method of family planning if they could persuade their husbands to agree to it.</P>
      <P>I hope there will be a campaign directed at women giving the location of the proposed family planning clinics and pointing out the help and advice available from them.  Within the last 12 months a survey was carried out in the Dublin area.  The result of the survey showed that the majority of young people are in favour of family planning. There was an overwhelming response to the survey and a great number of people who were asked to complete the questionnaire stated that they would like a family planning clinic in their area under the auspices of the health board. They also stated that all methods of family planning, including the natural method, should be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> My experience indicates that medical practitioners do not know very much about family planning.  I am pleased to note that there will be special training courses on family planning for medical practitioners.  When a woman asks her doctor for the pill or some other contraceptive he will prescribe for her without examining her or asking her any questions.  If she returns to her doctor in three months he will ask her whether it agreed with her.  If she tells him that the prescription did not agree with her he will simply give her another prescription for something else.  I hope that doctors will take the course in order to acquaint themselves with the prescribing of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>Couples who are regarded as being husbands and wives in common law should be provided for in the Bill.  We have many categories of adults who have a right to form relationships and who are legally entitled to decide not to have children.  We have a large group of separated persons who are entitled to have another relationship.  Those whose marriages have been annulled by the Church but who are still regarded as being married by the State should also be provided for in the Bill.  In the circumstances, can they claim that they are still married and legally entitled to contraceptives? There are many deserted wives who cannot be expected to live alone for the remainder of their lives. They need companionship and are entitled to relationships.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister intends to provide money for research into other methods of family planning.  In this day and age, when men are able to land on the moon, it should be possible to devise a safe method of contraception.  Many natural methods do not work and research should be carried out into these problems.  The Government have tried to formulate legislation to suit the majority of people.  The Opposition are apparently opting out of this problem and washing their hands of it, as they did when their own Bill was introduced.  Apparently they are not responsible now either.</P>

      <P>I have not seen them, so I could not say.  When this Bill becomes law I hope women will realise that it sets out to help and advise them. There are many people trying to make capital out of it on both sides and saying that we are being immoral and permissive. On the other hand, there are people who say we are not going far enough and are not legislating for the average person.  We are doing our best for the vast majority of people.  There are a few areas in which I should like to see more thought and there are areas where, as a woman, I would like to see more sympathy. I know it is difficult because there are hypocrites who spy on others and look down their noses on those who find a decent and human relationship outside marriage.  This sort of hypocrisy must stop.  Life is so short and if one finds a person with whom to make a happy union it is not necessary always to enter into the marriage bond and produce children from the union.  Surely we are all adult enough to realise that people fall in love and form relationships who do not want to marry and have children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of Irish people want to marry and rear children.  Irish women in particular, among all people of the world, love their children and want to have families.  The greatest single disaster for many married people is not to have any children.  This is very upsetting for many women.  They adopt children and try to fulfil themselves in that way. Basically, the Irish woman is not fulfilled unless she has children, but she must be <Col N="1207" /> allowed to have them responsibly and to educate and mind them.  This Bill will give her the help she needs and she will not feel that it is wrong to visit a family planning clinic.  Now she will feel legally entitled to go there and does not have to feel that she is immoral or bad in asking for contraceptives to space and regulate her family.</P>
    <P>I would ask all Members of this House to be charitable and not to despise or restrict people who have stable relationships but are not married. There is nothing immoral about it and nothing anybody can do about it.  Adults are now entering into relationships and living happily together without being married and they should be given consideration. The moaners and groaners who say it is immoral and wrong and look with disdain on such people are themselves the ones who are wrong.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this legislation to help numerous women legally to discuss their family planning problems with medical doctors.  I hope that men will stand up and be counted and go with their wives for these discussions and become part of the family planning process.  The onus has always been left on women and this is not right or fair.  If two people are together planning their family, both should take part in discussions on the methods of family planning.  I am sure the Bill will help numerous people and give them the confidence to discuss these problems with doctors.  It would be of great help if they could get advice from the doctor and get the prescription in the one clinic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to make a long speech because my views in relation to legislation of this kind are well known and are on record since the debate on the Bill introduced during the term of office of the previous Government.  The views I expressed on that occasion apply to the Bill at present before the House.  I have given very serious thought in recent times to whether all the Members of this House as an elected Parliament, as a responsible Assembly and as a Parliament charged with responsibility for making laws for the common good of the majority <Col N="1208" /> of the people, have gone completely out of their minds.  It may be that I am becoming cynical but I have a strange feeling that that is the case and that we fail to grasp the seriousness of the situation.</P>
      <P>Before introducing legislation every Minister has prolonged discussions and exchanges of views with interested parties. I will be anxious to hear from the Minister whether he feels this Bill will improve the quality of life of the majority of our people.  I should also like to know whether he has considered every aspect of our quality of life before introducing this Bill.  Our people are passing through a period of great change which is of deep concern to every single responsible Member of this House.</P>
      <P>We are living in a very sick society which is far from the sort of society we all sincerely desire to see.  We in this House, and particularly the Government, are charged with the responsibility to legislate to improve the quality of life in this sick society, or the Government can worsen it if they so desire.  We can either worsen it or endeavour to improve it.  A Bill of this kind will worsen the sickness of the society in which we live today.</P>
      <P>We must all examine this Bill carefully and closely and we must ensure that the legislation we pass is for the common good and is a step towards the improvement of the society in which we live.  Today we have the highest record of admissions to mental hospitals in the world relative to our population.  We cannot boast about that.  We have an all-time record of alcoholics.  We have an increasing drug problem.  We have an increasing number of deserted wives and deserted husbands and broken homes with consequential hardship and disturbance for children.  This is the Year of the Child.  Family life in Ireland is being disrupted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is an attack on family life as we have known it.  Families are breaking up with consequential hardship for children and those who cherish the true Christian family life as our parents, our grandparents and our great grandparents knew it.  We are living in times of change.  Are we to make bad worse, or <Col N="1209" /> are we to make bad a little better?  We must examine this Bill against the background of Irish society.</P>
    <P>We have lost all respect for human life before birth as well as after birth.  We have lost respect for human lives taken by acts of violence.  We have lost all respect for the property of others.  Our prisons are full to the doors.  We must bear in mind that the family is the fundamental unit of society.  It is under attack and that attack very often is helped by the media, by publications, and by the voices of so-called liberals who want to have no limit on their freedom, no limit to the pleasures in which they can indulge.  They want to have no responsibility and to close their eyes to the real practical purpose of our very existence.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that we have more teenage drinking than is good for Irish society.  There is great disrespect for any form of authority in the school, on the factory floor, or in the ranks of the trade unions.  Respect for authority is gone.  The foundation for respect for authority must be the family, the home. If the family is not based on true Christian principles&mdash;and the family is the fundamental unit of society&mdash;you cannot expect to have a society which will reflect goodness, hard work and Christian charity towards all.  A good, true and loyal society branches out from the family.  The family is based on marriage, a marriage in which, under God, both partners swear to be loyal to each other in sickness and in poverty until death parts them.</P>
    <P>People like the Deputy who spoke last feel that we are fighting a lost cause and that there is nothing we can do to improve the quality of life in relation to marriage, the authority of parenthood and the love which is the creation of a family.  A Bill of this kind is a most tragic, evilly disposed and unhealthy sign for the future of family life.  In our society we have increasing attacks of violence on old people and other individuals, and a growing incidence of rape and highway robbery.  Seldom a day passes without an armed robbery, not as in the past in the dead of night but now in broad daylight.  I put it to the <Col N="1210" /> Minister that society is breaking down fast with all the economic problems and difficulties in labour relations that we have.  Our country is on the verge of a standstill due to strikes.  A quarter of a million people marched in protest to make their views known.  Does he think that in these circumstances dealing with the provision of contraceptives is right and proper?</P>
    <P>There is no demand in this country for a Bill of this kind, but there is a demand that we deal with the numerous other political and economic problems to which seemingly this House is turning both the blind eye and the deaf ear. National catastrophes surround us in our daily lives, in our constituencies and outside them.  Have we taken leave of our senses when we come in here to occupy the time of Parliament with a Bill to provide contraceptives?  Are we on the verge of a complete breakdown in the processes of parliamentary democracy?  We take up the time of Parliament in present circumstances with a Bill of this kind when our farmers are on the verge of revolt, labour relations are a complete shambles and every section of the community is expressing dismay and alarm about the quality of life being experienced here at the moment. I say that there is no public demand for legislation of this kind. When I hear agitation for liberties and liberalisation, for pushing the family into the background, for divorce and for the introduction of contraceptives, by a Bill of this kind, I do not care what any Member of this House may say, I have a duty as a legislator to express my opinion.</P>
    <P>The provision of contraceptives will be the first step in the smashing up of the family and marriage as we have known them.  The Deputy who spoke a few moments ago expressed her opinion that there was nothing wrong in people living together and having a family without being married.  If the future generation of Deputies coming into this House are of that opinion, the Lord help Irish society in the future.  I am glad that 37 years in office are behind me in that regard when there was some sort of Irish standard. When I hear the views expressed in relation to the quality of life, the family, <Col N="1211" /> marriage, the restriction of human life which is the greatest gift God can give, and the manner in which these matters have been dealt with here, I feel that responsible elected legislators must have taken leave of their senses completely, especially when they advocate adults living together without ever entering into marriage legally or into the bond of the sacrament of marriage in accordance with the Catholic faith.  I never thought that I would hear that in this House, but I have heard it.  That is why I think that the family as we have known it is under very serious attack.  Article 41 of our Constitution guarantees to protect the family, its constitution and authority and to guard with special care the institution of marriage, because the family is founded on marriage.  If this Bill is passed&mdash;and there is little doubt that it will be&mdash;it is well that the Minister should know that there will be people who will take it to the Supreme Court because it is an attack on the family, marriage and parenthood.  For that reason the Supreme Court will favour the case of those people.  Despite the record of our society which I have tried to illustrate with my extremely limited knowledge of the activities of those who believe in liberalisation, in my opinion, and in the opinion of many others, this Bill will not improve the quality of our society.</P>
    <P>Proposals are being made to change the law in relation to contraceptives within the State.  This raises an important issue for the public generally and for the elected representatives of this House. The question at issue is not whether artificial contraception is morally right or wrong.  The clear teaching of the Catholic Church is that it is morally wrong.  I am somewhat baffled and bewildered that so many who profess the Catholic faith, a faith I share with them, do not seem to realise or grasp the importance of the fact that in every respect or degree there can be no doublethinking in this regard.  This is a Bill which can be described as one of conscience and, when confronted with such a Bill in this House, we must give it calm consideration and serious thought.  A legislator must legislate for the good of the majority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> I ask: Is this Bill advocating what is morally wrong and what has been condemned by the Catholic Church because the clear teaching of the Church is that it is morally wrong?  Here we have a Bill flouting the truth, what those who designed the Bill must know is wrong, and very wrong.  Whether it be public representatives inside this House or the general public outside it, in our calm senses we cannot close our eyes&mdash;if the majority in this House are Catholic legislators&mdash;to the teachings of the Church of which we profess to be members and of which the majority of people in this State profess to be members.  If that Church teaches that contraception is morally wrong, that is the teaching to be accepted by those who profess that faith and who believe in the teachings of that Church.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows well that no change in the laws of the State can make the use of contraceptives morally right since what is wrong in itself remains wrong regardless of what the laws of the State, the Government, the Minister or his Department may say.  No matter what excuses are advanced, no matter how meritorious a case put forward by Members for the provision of contraceptives or for the right of a medical practitioner to recommend that contraceptives be made available, in every circumstance it cannot change the factual position. That is why I make this plea to the Minister in the final stages of this debate because he must know; he cannot plead ignorance.  No member of the Government party can plead ignorance.  They must have well&mdash;informed consciences on matters of this kind.  Vatican II laid down clearly that when a Catholic requires information on matters relating to conscience of this kind ignorance is no excuse, that the conscience must be wellinformed and that Catholics must seek the truth on problems of contraception. Where are they to obtain the truth? Where does one go to seek it?  Is it to the Minister?  Is it to his Department? Where does one go in this country?  One only has to go to the Church with authority, with the wisdom of ages behind it, to the clear, simple expressions of the representative of no less than Christ Himself when he speaks in relation <Col N="1213" /> to this matter.  If every one of us in this House accepts the fact that, in accordance with Catholic teaching, contraception and contraceptives are morally wrong, what excuse can we make for passing a Bill dealing mainly with a matter which we know and which our consciences tell us is wrong?  If it has been conveyed to us that what we are doing is passing a Bill in relation to a problem which is morally wrong&mdash;as has been clearly expounded by the highest authority of this world&mdash;no Member of this House can advance such excuse. There may be public representatives who are gravely disturbed about this matter. It is wrong in a matter of conscience where a grave moral issue which affects Irish society and will affect that society for generations to come, is concerned.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann notes with grave concern the announcement by BIM that redundancies are contemplated in Killybegs, Dingle and Baltimore Boatyards; and the proposals to reduce the level of manpower to skeleton staffs in these yards; and calls on the Government to maintain and expand employment in these yards.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Begley.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand other speakers are anxious to contribute and since I have been facilitated I shall try to take less than the time remaining to me. Between Question Time today and the debate last night there has been a lot of discussion about this matter, but, unfortunately, the picture is no clearer after all that argument and discussion than before we started.  I understand the position to be that we are dealing with three yards which are for the scrap heap in the <Col N="1214" /> short term.  Those three yards are needed.  In fact, their capacity should be expanded to meet the growing needs of our fishermen in the future.  Those yards, with the skill and expertise developed over many years and generations, if disturbed for any length of time will not be capable of being put together again in our lifetime.  We are also dealing with three yards at a time of transition from timber to steel, although I believe there will be a firm market for timber craft.</P>
      <P>As far as the real development of our fishing fleet and our fisheries are concerned, steel is a must.  However, we are not doing anything about it.  We have not done anything substantial or positive in spite of the knowledge in the past six years that we were reaching the stage where steel was a must.  We should have decided then whether to carry out the work with steel or have it done abroad, but unfortunately no decision to go into steel in any meaningful sense was taken. That decision should have been taken at least three years ago and should have been given serious consideration at least six years ago.  I do not know whether serious consideration was given to it at that time, if any consideration was given to it in the interim, or if it is being considered at present.  If it is just being considered now, it is too late.  That is being done in panic.  We would need to be careful, if we are considering a movement into steel in a meaningful way, not to arrive at our conclusions too hastily or reach the wrong conclusion at this critical time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present BIM are aware of 24 likely suitable applicants who are seeking steel-hull trawlers which, on average, will cost £1 million.  I have no doubt that those boats will be commissioned to foreign boatyards at a loss to this country not alone in regard to our boatyards but in regard to our balance of payments.  I understand that there are approximately 80 who this year will be seeking craft at an average cost of £1 million for our fishing fleet.  We are talking of a very big business.  I have no doubt that if we had a similar operation in relation to any other product we would be falling over ourselves to try to establish new manufacturing outlets to supply this <Col N="1215" /> great market.  In this case the market is pressing us to supply them but, instead of attempting to do this in a reasonable way, we are running away from it and getting out of boat building, which has been in existence for so long.</P>
    <P>The Minister and BIM should get together very soon and make up their minds that there is a big industry involved. They should bring our industrial promoters, the IDA, into this.  We must seek out from private sources any suggestions or proposals of a concrete nature that could be considered in conjunction with the State on their own merits or amalgamation of State, semi-State or private enterprise.  That should be looked at so that we can arrive at the best possible conclusion.  I cannot see any logical conclusion being regarded as best or good enough unless we maintain and retain these yards and unless we can look forward to establishing other yards. Unless they can look forward to being useful, viable and capable of producing trawlers built with steel hulls at a proper price, we are not doing our job&mdash; something we have not been doing for a considerable number of years.  It is not my duty to apportion blame nor do I care where it lies, but we have not been doing as we should have in years gone by when we had the time to do it in a reasonable way.</P>
    <P>We are now up against exporting millions for a product which we could produce ourselves thereby providing more employment.  Members should not get the idea that this is a question of the privateers <i>versus</i> BIM as far as boat building is concerned.  It is no such thing because there is room for an expansion of both.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to point out <Col N="1216" /> that we have a vast potential we are capable of meeting but which we are not geared for.  However, it can be put together provided there is on the part of the Minister and the other agencies of Government a commitment to retaining the yards.  There should be no question of BIM running the boatyards in future. I do not say that in criticism of BIM but in criticism of a system that has been allowed to be overtaken by the developments of our time through the growth in our fishing and the sophisticated craft fishermen need.  These matters have become too big for the BIM structure. The board is not capable of running the yards and funding the price of the boats from taxpayers' money by way of loans and grants.  When we speak about the legitimate claims of fishermen being entitled to go where they can buy their craft cheapest, we must also take into account that our taxpayers have a big stake in every craft that is put into the water.  We should be trying to serve all taxpayers, fishermen, farmers, businessmen and workers.  The best way we can serve them is by providing, within reason, anything we can manufacture here from as much material as we can glean from our own resources with only the necessary raw materials being imported. We should not allow ourselves, no matter which way we are leaning, to say that they must be got at the cheapest price even if it means purchasing them abroad.  We must not say that we cannot get them as good at home as abroad.  We cannot expect people to pay more for them at home than abroad, but we have to balance this in favour of the Irish economy.  Everybody is concerned, whether in the fishing industry, boat building or whatever other sector they may be in.  We should see that the largest proportion of everything for the fishing industry is manufactured by Irish boatyards and Irish factories.  The end product will then be for the benefit of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he is inquiring in all directions at the moment.  In order that this matter is properly inquired into and without a witch-hunt apportioning of blame, which it could develop into, that inquiry should be a public one.  People who feel they have anything to add <Col N="1217" /> through information and experience over the years should be invited to give their views and their evidence.  This should be a public inquiry in the true sense of fact finding, finding out what has gone wrong, what needs to be done, how best it can be done, where it will be done and by whom it will be done.  I am not talking about a sworn inquiry.  I am looking for something which will be a real inquiry, eliciting all the evidence and facts which will be helpful and which at the end of the day will produce the best answer in the interests of our economy, the fishermen, the taxpayers and everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept the reasonable request that there will not be any redundancies until that inquiry is held.  It is only if it is decided that the yards must be liquidated, that there is no future for them either in private or public hands or in amalgamation, that redundancies should be determined on.  We are not dealing with unskilled workers whom we may be able to recruit any day if we want to start again.  We are dealing with very skilled people who will never be put together again if they are made redundant. It would take years to build up a team of skilled workers like those again.</P>
    <P>Those workers may be criticised in certain respects but we are not here to criticise.  I want a true effort made by everybody concerned to try to find an answer to the problem, a problem which should have been seen to much earlier. There was a long discussion at the meeting in Killybegs at which representatives from the other two yards were present.  A resolution was passed that night which I was surprised to hear the Minister say he did not get a report of. The resolution was that there would be an inquiry like the one I am talking about.  It also asked that until that inquiry was completed the redundancies announced to the workers should not be given effect.  I ask the Minister to ensure that those redundancies do not take effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and the Department of Fisheries obviously have a responsibility to more than the <Col N="1218" /> boatyards of BIM, which is a much larger organisation than one of boat builders.  It has become very evident from the debate here that, irrespective of the view taken by some people, the products of those yards have not been entirely satisfactory to the fishermen who want to use them.  It is also very evident that those products have failed to find a market abroad.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that those boatyards be turned into an export industry falls flat in view of commercial considerations which are obviously applied by foreign buyers when looking at their requirements in relation to the fishing industry in Scotland, England or further abroad.  The Minister is very concerned with the wellbeing of the fishing industry and he has to have consideration for the fishermen who use those boats.  He must ensure that they are provided with the best possible equipment.  Those men are not going into a factory, they are not going down the road in tractors, they are not doing a safe, sedentary job.  They are going out on the wild seas risking their lives and bringing back their harvest to our ports.  We have had unfortunate tragedies in this industry in the last few years.  It would be totally irresponsible to expect men to go to sea in boats which were in any way suspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are providing a product for a man it has got to be seen to be right as well as being right.  I want to quote from a letter from BIM, who on occasion have refused to give letters. This letter states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information supplied has been passed to the boat-building manager for his observations on the allegations <Col N="1219" /> made by the owner.  When the matter has been fully discussed I shall communicate with you again.</P>
    <P>That letter was sent on 4 August 1978.  I have a letter here which I wrote to the Department with a three-page list of defects on one particular boat.  In the engine room alone there were 13 major faults.  Independent tests were done by Napier's of England on stability which showed that a boat produced by a BIM yard was totally unsuitable.  I can give documentary evidence in relation to the type of faults which were found in those boats.  If the Deputy thinks that I will stand in this Chamber representing the fishermen of Skerries, Balbriggan and Howth and not make this thing public he had better think again.  If our boat builders are going to produce something they have got to stand over it the same as factory workers producing their export goods have to stand up in the international markets.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a responsibility not alone to the boat-building industry but to the users of those boats to make sure they are right.  He is discharging that responsibility in a courageous and imaginative way.  He will give an opportunity to those boatyards to do a worth-while job and get out of the morass of inefficiency and liability they got into under four years of total mismanagement. We were told that the profits were all right under the Coalition administration. The profits, according to my information, were very small and intermittent up to 1975.  I challenge the Deputy to give viable figures on profitability in relation to investment and turnover figures in those yards when the Coalition Government were in power.</P>
    <P>Allegations were made in the House that those yards were viable until the change in Government.  I am attempting to demonstrate that this was not so.  A pattern set in during the period of the inter-Party Government which became very evident immediately Fianna Fáil came to power.  The Minister obviously has to discharge his obligation to the taxpayers.  He has to see that the money the PAYE people contribute to the running of the country is spent in a responsible manner.  Those who work in the <Col N="1220" /> BIM boatyards have a heavy responsibility to ensure that they produce goods that are up to the highest international standards.  Unfortunately in many cases this has not been the case and the whole industry has to be looked at objectively.  It has to be put on a viable footing and I have no doubt that these men are capable of doing that.  I have no doubt that with proper direction from a Minister who is concerned they will be able to produce a product that will stand up on the international markets and be acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>How can they do that if they are sacked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>It is their responsibility to do this in competition with our EEC partners.  We are now in a competitive situation so far as boat building is concerned and whether we like it or not the people in the industry will be in competition with boat builders from Scotland, Holland and so on.  If the rest of the economy can do it, there is no reason why the boat builders should not do it as well.</P>
      <P>The lack of innovation in the boat-building industry, and in BIM in particular, in the past few years has been frightening.  The only two materials mentioned in this Chamber in relation to the production of hulls and boats have been wood and steel.  These two materials have been used in the production of boats for centuries.  We have had vast improvements in hull design and production and in new building materials in the past ten or 20 years.  GRP has found a usage all over the world but it has never been considered as a material by BIM.  It is used by some of the smaller yards here for pleasure boats and smaller inshore boats.  It is used abroad for sizeable trawlers and for commercial use but it has never even been suggested for use in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other material that is in use worldwide is a native material but, again, it has never been considered here. I refer to ferro-cement.  This material is in use throughout the world.  It was pioneered in New Zealand and is in use in the United States and England.  We have a large cement industry here but <Col N="1221" /> the use of that material for boat building has never even been thought about and in my view that is a total scandal.  It has not been used by BIM.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is used here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it has not been used for fishing boat construction here.  It has been used for small pleasure craft but it has never been used by BIM for boat building.  I challenge anybody with information to say that BIM have used this material for boat-building construction.  It is a rather heavier material than the others mentioned but as such it would have a certain advantage as far as fishing boat hulls are concerned.  It would have a certain inherent advantage over some of the other materials.</P>
      <P>It has not been mentioned in the debate that certain standards must be set in the production of the boats.  There must be consideration for the comfort of the fishermen and for standards of safety.  I seriously challenge and question the attitude of the BIM yards with regard to the safety factor of the boats that have come on the market in this country in the past few years.  How many instances have we had where proper equipment from the safety point of view was not supplied with the boats but this has not been mentioned in the debate.  In the reappraisal the Minister is doing of the industry I urge him to study this aspect very seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standards we will apply will have to be much higher than in the past.  We are in Europe now and we have got to be as good as the best, if not better.  Our fishermen deserve the best possible products but they have not been getting them.  The standards that have obtained in relation to safety equipment, and occasionally even navigation equipment, have not been acceptable to the more progressive of our fishermen.  This has forced them to go abroad.  Skippers will say that they would love to buy Irish boats and to buy from BIM but they cannot do so.  Other skippers will tell one that they had to buy from BIM because they sell their fish through BIM, are getting finance from them and, consequently, <Col N="1222" /> cannot buy elsewhere.  In many cases BIM abused their position as suppliers of finance in order to keep men in inefficient employment.  Our Minister sees the position.  He knows that £1 million a year of taxpayers' money is being spent. He must answer responsibly to the taxpayers, to the fishermen and to this Chamber.  He is acting responsibly in this debate and I know he will act responsibly towards the industry.</P>
    <P>The only chance the industry has is to appraise its attitude towards its own product.  In conjunction with the imaginative and forceful thinking of the Minister, the industry can ensure that there will be a future for the yards.  There can be a future with co-operation, there can be a future if the Minister's attitude is allowed to permeate down to the workforce. The Minister is concerned for the men and the industry.  It cannot be allowed to stagger from loss to loss, from one bad product to another.  The Minister is aware of the position and there is no doubt that we will change it around completely.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the steel boats produced in this country.  To my knowledge very few of them were produced.  They are mainly conversions from hulls produced on the continent. Two of them are in my home port of Skerries and they are two of the finest boats fishing these waters.  They fish not only on the east coast but also on the west coast and they are doing very well for the skippers.  The objective fact is that hulls of that type were incapable of being produced in this country.  The finishing work on them was of a high standard and their operation by our fishermen is very satisfactory.  The fact is that the industry is not in a position to build 90-foot steel hulls at the moment and it had no encouragement in the four years of inter-Party Government to equip itself.  Obviously the Minister is concerned about the matter and I know he will do something about it.</P>
    <P>Last night and this evening we have listened to the greatest load of old rubbish in so-called concern for BIM boatyards.  If that concern were genuine there is no doubt that something more constructive would have emerged and something would have been done in the <Col N="1223" /> four years during which we were in Opposition and when I was not in the House.</P>

They have to comply with the fishing regulations laid down in Brussels and they are entitled to the best that Europe has to offer.  If Irish yards can provide that, well and good; if they cannot provide it, they are entitled to go to Europe and get the best that is available there.  The challenge is before the BIM yards, put to them in a fair and honourable manner.  They will be given the opportunity to meet the challenge and it is up to them to supply the goods to the men who have to go out to sell the product in competition with others.

      <P>The Minister will give them the opportunity and it is up to them to take it.  If they are incapable of taking the opportunity, the Minister cannot go down to them and say &ldquo;Here you are&rdquo;. The Minister can only provide a vehicle through which people of initiative can progress.  If the people referred to by Deputy O'Keeffe have not got that initiative, then it is his problem.  Personally I do not believe it.  There is plenty initiative. Our fishermen have the initiative and the ability to progress.  I have no doubt the Minister will give the yards the chance to provide the type of boat the industry requires.  I have no doubt that under this type of encouragement the yards can look forward to a sensible rational programme of development.</P>
      <P>Unless the industry is taken as a whole it cannot expand.  I suggest to the Minister that when he is formulating proposals in relation to the yards he will get away from the situation in which a fisherman is under the impression that because he is selling his fish to BIM, because he is getting his finance from BIM, he must buy a boat from BIM. That is one of the greatest reasons for the difficult situation BIM now find themselves in from the point of view of the boatyards&mdash;there was torpidity, they were having an easy ride in a nocompetition situation.  Because of a closed shop the fishermen could not go anywhere else, or they had the impression they could not, and this led to inertia in certain quarters of the boat-building industry.  The Minister has seen this difficulty and he must turn it around and make the industry viable again.  I have no doubt that he will, in spite of these obstructive tactics and destructive observations that have been coming from the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I have never heard such a despicable attack on a semi-State body as that launched by Deputy Fox.  The position is that the Minister is responsible for this position, not BIM.  It is he who has to come to the House looking for the money.  Fianna Fáil are blaming the boatyard workers and BIM.  I have never listened to such hogwash.  The Minister's statements today will make sad reading for the boatyard workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> We heard from the Minister what the future holds for Killybegs, Baltimore and Dingle.  Does the Minister agree with Deputy Murphy that these yards made a profit in three out of the five years of Coalition Government?  Does he agree that when he became Minister in 1977 these yards were viable?</P>
    <P>In his speech on this motion yesterday and in reply to questions today, the Minister stated that this was not a viable industry when he became Minister.  The BIM chairman stated that also when they launched the two boats which Deputy Fox said had gone to Skerries. At the end of 1977 the Minister complimented the boatyard workers in Killybegs on the tremendous work they were doing.  I will quote a newspaper report at that time:</P>
    <P>Their interest will be fully protected and enhanced.  There is a total commitment to development of the marine resources and the way of life of Irish fishermen.</P>
    <P>The heading on that report was &ldquo;Lenihan Pledges to Fight for the Exclusive Limit&rdquo;.  That is a laugh now.  He stood in Killybegs and said he would fight for the 30-mile limit, which we all know has gone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, the 50-mile limit. Was it 30 or was it 50?  The Minister has forgotten.  He pledged himself to the workforce in Killybegs, which then stood at 130.  He said that the next time he came back to Killybegs he hoped to see the workforce increased.  What has happened since 1977?  Has the Minister spent the one-and-half years sleeping in plush chairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious thing.  I am delighted to see at least one Fianna Fáil Deputy from Killybegs listening to the debate.  I hope we will have the pleasure of hearing him backing up Deputy Fox.  The Minister has washed his hands completely of the three boatyards.  His references to expansion have become references to redundancies.  I agree with one thing <Col N="1226" /> Deputy Fox said: we all want to see the boatyards become viable.  There can be no argument about that.  The difference is that on this side of the House we say that £2 million or £3 million should be spent on a modernisation programme in our yards to make sure that steel hulls can be built, particularly in Killybegs. We should also like to see money spent on the Dingle and Baltimore yards in order to modernise these tremendous sources of employment.</P>
    <P>Boat-building is a traditional industry. It involves generations of craft handed down from father to son.  If we make these people redundant in the next couple of months, they will have to try to get alternative employment and their skills will be lost to the boat-building industry. What will we then do when the need arises for extra boats?  There are 320 people employed in this industry.  If they become redundant in the morning it will cost the Exchequer at least £1½ million in redundancy payments and unemployment benefit.  BIM told the workers today that if these yards were modernised it would cost not £6 million as the Minister told us earlier but £4 million. That would be the equivalent of about two years in terms of unemployment and redundancy payments and if we break down the figures further they would represent about £3,000 per job in terms of making the boatyards modern.</P>
    <P>The figure of £4,500 arrived at by the IDA is the price to be paid for inviting any foreign industrialist to set up here. We on this side of the House are not prepared to accept that these three boatyards must close.  Instead of selling out to private enterprises the Minister should persuade the Cabinet to sanction the necessary moneys to make the boatyards viable.  With the right management and the right organisation they can be made viable.  It is a ridiculous situation that BIM should be engaged as a business concern both in the selling of fish and in giving grants for boats.  From a business point of view, too, it is ridiculous that the chairman of the board is also the chairman of the board of directors.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous that BIM do not have a representative in the boatyards at Killybegs, Dingle or Baltimore.  We have <Col N="1227" /> the workers in the boatyards but we need a first-class manager who would be put on the board of BIM and given the money to get on with the job that is so necessary in terms of our expanding fishing fleet.  It is general knowledge that sanction is awaited from BIM in respect of more than 20 boats, two of which are 75-foot wooden boats.  One of these could be built at Dingle and the other at Baltimore.  Sanction is awaited in respect of at least 18 steel boats of between 90 to 120 feet.  Why should we spend about £36 million to have these boats built abroad when we have the skill and the labour to carry out the work here?  Have Fianna Fáil gone mad completely to even think of sanctioning such a project? The Minister should consider seriously the setting up of a new management board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney referred to the setting up of an inquiry.  We would welcome such an inquiry but I should be apprehensive that it might have the result of letting the Minister off the hook. What is needed is an on-going inquiry into the audit figures such as happens in the case of any other business.  There is no reason for semi-State bodies being exempted in this regard.  Surely the Minister realised about 18 months ago, when he visited Killybegs and told the workers there that the industry was viable and that output should be increased, that the management was not what it should be.  It was his responsibility then to ensure that the management was changed and the workmen given a fair deal.</P>
    <P>Three steel hulls were built at Killybegs in 1975, two of which were launched by the Minister.  My information is that these two hulls proved to be profitable concerns.  I understand that their building was commissioned by the Coalition on a trial basis, on the basis that if the project was successful Killybegs would be modernised to build steel boats.  I need not remind the House that it was unfortunate for Donegal that there was a change of Government and that the new Government did not make any plan in respect of steel.  Any sensible businessman would not sell a business, be it a hotel or any other, in an area in <Col N="1228" /> which there was an expanding fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister asked how the boatyards in the three areas concerned might be managed by someone working in Dublin.  This should not pose any problem if there is proper management. Management is conducted satisfactorily in this way in the supermarket and hotel industries, for instance.  There is no reason for State or semi-State operations not having the same degree of competent management as that which applies in the private sector.  What I fear is that if private concerns buy the boatyards cheaply there will not be a guarantee that the figures of 120 or 180 in respect of Killybegs will be maintained, that instead the yard would be working with a skeleton staff merely on repairs.</P>
    <P>Surely the Government are not thinking merely of a repairs operation for wooden trawlers at a boatyard such as that at Killybegs which can boast of 32 year's experience.  I realise that some of the fault has been with management, that some of it has been on the part of BIM, but the blame ultimately must rest with the Minister for Fisheries, who, having sold out in respect of our fishing limits, is now prepared to render the workers in these boatyards redundant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This industry is in its death gasp.  It is bad enough to decide to sack the men concerned but it is a sorry situation to slander them and to blame them for the situation.  Clearly it is not in the best interest of this nation that this important adjunct of our fishing industry should be handed over to private enterprise which is concerned primarily with the question of profit and will not have regard for the welfare either of the fishing industry or of the men concerned.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what has been said by the Minister regarding the reason for closing the yards, I wish to demonstrate that the history of boat building here has been a history of success and profitability and that there has been harmony and co-operation among the men concerned.  It is worth noting that there has not been a strike in the boatyards while they have been under the aegis of BIM.  That is a proud boast, but it is to the eternal disgrace of the Minister that he is prepared to disregard these loyal, courageous and devoted craftsmen and to relegate them to the unemployment scrap heap.</P>
      <P>For the year 1970-71, the figures for the boatyards showed a loss of £16,833; for 1971-72, there was a profit of £21,370; for 1972-73, there was a profit of £34,530; for 1973-74, there was a profit of £52,000; for a nine-month period in 1974 there was a profit of £10,539; and for 1975, the high point of the Coalition Government, there was a profit of £108,031.  In 1976-77, with the advent of Fianna Fáil, we find a loss of £187,202.  Under the Minister's administration in 1977-78 we find a loss running steeply up to £542,569.  In this year we again find a loss of more than £1 million.  These are the facts.  That is why I wanted to nail down the lie that the workers in BIM or BIM have been responsible for the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The labour force in these years was pretty good.  It was 143 in 1970-71, 148 in 1972, 164 in 1973, 242 in 1974, 318 in 1975, 295 in 1976, 285 in 1977, 260 in 1978.  I gather that the present figure under the Minister is 241.  Therefore, it <Col N="1230" /> will be seen that under the Coalition Government the high point of profitability was more than £108,000 and that the labour force was at peak at 318.</P>
    <P>Now it is proposed to change that situation.  The shocking proposal is that the workforce be reduced from 241 to 159 and that the redundancies continue over the next 12 months until only a skeleton staff is left in the three yards concerned.  Boat building is to cease and only a few men will be left by this time 12 months, doing what I do not know.  It is alleged that they may do some repairs. All that is required of the situation is an injection of capital to put these yards in a viable position once again.  It is a sobering thought for all workers in State bodies and local authorities, and a revealing situation for the unemployed, that this kind of thing could happen under Fianna Fáil, having regard to their programme for job creation and full employment.  They made these promises prior to the general election.</P>
    <P>The profits made in 1975 and 1976 under the Coalition Government have now been turned into a colossal loss by Fianna Fáil.  This is a frightening situation of gross mismanagement, a betrayal of trust on the part of the Minister and BIM and of the confidence reposed in them to maintain, sustain and develop this semi-State enterprise.  It makes a mockery of Fianna Fáil's promises in respect of job creation.</P>
    <P>How could profits and efficiency be maintained in the boatyards of BIM when it was the deliberate policy of the Minister to run down these yards?  In my opinion it was a sinister and effective exercise on the part of the Minister.  All the important key personnel were removed from these yards in stages.  Apprentice training officers were removed and never replaced.  What sort of a sign for the future was the abandonment of the apprentice training scheme?  Is it not a fact that the training of apprentices ceased some time ago?  How could we have efficiency when the chief naval architect was removed to another post and not replaced?  Why did that happen?  Is it not a fact that design craftsmen were eased out, that design engineers were transferred or compelled to leave and never <Col N="1231" /> replaced?  How could we have efficiency and full employment when the order processor or the works programmer was removed and never replaced, when even yard managers were removed and never replaced?  This was a coldly-calculated and deliberate method for the destruction of these yards.  This was a sell-out to private enterprise.  This brain drain continued for the past two years under Deputy Lenihan, the Minister for Fisheries.  The yards of BIM were left leaderless, bereft of funds, bereft of orders, bereft of management and expertise. In that situation how could they but fail and go down the drain?</P>
    <P>The Government and the Minister made a conscious decision that the boatyards of BIM would no longer be allowed to compete with private enterprise, that BIM were to be sacrificed on the alter of private profit and greed.  This is essentially a shameful sell-out by Fianna Fáil to the tacateers in shipping.  A sworn inquiry into this sordid business is the only thing that will suffice.  I agree with my friends who said here tonight that there are people on the other side of the House whom I would not have within an ass's roar of that inquiry because they could not be trusted.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the yards will not be closed but that the work of boat building will cease.  At best, a few men will be retained to do some minor repairs.  Why does the Minister not tell the truth to this House?  If he was serious in seeking private enterprise to assist in operating these yards would it not be practicable to retain the entire labour force rather than sacking them and scattering them to the four corners of the world.  In a situation like that it is obvious that these yards can never again be utilised for boat-building.  The Minister knows that if the labour force is depleted to the extent contemplated by him, these yards as boat-building places will cease to exist and cannot be retrieved.  The destruction of BIM has been carefully contrived and none of us on this side of the House has any doubt about it.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister told us that his solution to the problem was to apply surgery.  He has taken upon himself the role of a&mdash;I was going to say the role of <Col N="1232" /> a butcher, which might be more appropriate&mdash;surgeon. He said he is about to perform surgery.  I suggest that what he has done and what he is doing is surgery. He is cutting the throats of some 200 workers in the yards of BIM.  The surgery is in the nature of a stab in the back.  The Minister has taken upon himself the role of a surgeon who is operating on a lifeless corpse, he having drained that body of its life's blood over the past two years.  It would be far better to bury this body decently rather than engage in this shabby pretence.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with the BIM boatyards in Killybegs, Baltimore or Dingle that an injection of capital would not cure.  The body to which we refer is basically quite healthy.  It is admittedly badly run down but it can and should be revived.  It is simply suffering from a bad dose of Fianna Fáil-itis or, more appropriately, Fianna Fáil profiteering.  All that is required is a transfusion of the right kind, but I am afraid that the Minister and the Government are not likely to embark upon a revival of boat building.  The vested interests would seem to have triumphed and the workers of BIM are being used as pawns in a despicable game.</P>
    <P>The reason for the uncompetitive position of the boatyards in question is essentially the failure of the Minister to properly oversee the work of BIM.  It was the Minister's responsibility to ensure that BIM fulfilled their obligation to safeguard the future of the workers.  The Minister and the Government stand indicted and condemned in this regard. Inadequate facilities result in inefficiency. BIM made no attempt to invest adequately in the yards.  The rate of investment in each of the yards is about one-third of that of its main competitor in private boat building in this country.  I do not wish to mention the name.</P>
    <P>The Minister is dealing with a group of men renowned for their sincerity, integrity and devotion to duty.  This is evidenced by the fact that there was never a strike in the yards of BIM.  These men are not in any way responsible for the situation, despite what Deputy Fox said.  It would be a crime against society in general to victimise them now by <Col N="1233" /> throwing them on the unemployment scrap heap.  I understand that a productivity deal was recently considered by the Minister and some of the unions concerned. This deal was designed to create greater efficiency in the yards of BIM, but it never got off the ground.  The Minister never treated with the men concerned with regard to the implementation of this worthwhile scheme.  This extension of good will and co-operation on the part of the men was rejected by the Minister and we must ask why the productivity deal was discarded in this fashion.</P>
    <P>Why are the BIM yards being scuttled, while the Minister is refusing to extend a lifeline?  The yards can be saved and the jobs of the workers can and should be saved.  Their future life is in the hands of the Minister and God help them.  The Minister was elected to safeguard and promote the welfare of these yards and the workers therein.  I appeal to him to do his duty by the Irish people or else do the honourable thing and resign.  He has already brought nothing but havoc and ruin to the fishing industry and the sooner he goes the better.</P>

    <P>We must accept that the problem did <Col N="1234" /> not arise today or yesterday.  There should have been some forward planning during the past few years in regard to modernising these yards to meet the presentday demands.  The fishing industry has expanded immensely in recent years and the previous Government must accept responsibility for the present situation. The last speaker mentioned that the run-down took place when this Government came into office, but if he checks the record he will find that the movement of personnel from the boatyard began when the Coalition Government were in office.  A clear indication was given that they were endorsing the policy of running down the boatyards and unfortunately we have inherited this problem.</P>

      <P>In view of the possibility of redundancies taking place or of the yards becoming run down, I would appeal to the Minister to see that the yards&mdash;in particular the Killybegs yard&mdash;are equipped to handle repair work and the fitting out of boats whose hulls may have been obtained elsewhere. There is an outlet here for development. I agree with other speakers that the situation in which purchasers of boats are financed by BIM is not a healthy or a proper way in which a business such as this should be conducted.</P>
      <P>If there is a possibility of an independent body being allowed to run the yards and operate them, this would be far better for all concerned.  This must be looked at.  If a private concern were to take over the yards and run them and provide the work for the workers who have the expertise, the people concerned would accept that and be content with it. The concern we are expressing is here tonight is about the possibility that the highly-skilled people who had gainful employment would have to move out and go into other types of employment with the result that we would lose men who developed their skills and their expertise over the years.  That should be kept in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that there should be an inquiry into the operations of the yards.  There would be a full-scale inquiry into all details and all aspects. Where changes which would benefit all <Col N="1236" /> the people concerned can be made they should be made.  Every effort should be made to see that everything that can be done is done to find a fruitful solution. The only fruitful solution which would be accepted would be that the yards should be made viable again and that there would be a future for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is expanding and becoming a major industry.  We have no major shipbuilding yards in this country with the exception of the Belfast yard.  It is unfortunate that a maritime country like this has not got yards fully equipped to cater for the needs of the fishermen. Unfortunately, they have to go to Scotland, England and elsewhere to get special boats built to enable them to operate the present day methods of fishing.  Unless you are in fishing in the proper way, there will be no future for you.</P>
    <P>The Meevagh boatyard in Donegal, which is operated by a private concern, is running at a profit and providing gainful employment.  That augurs well for the possibility of the yards in question being taken over by some company who would wish to operate them.  I would ask the Minister to see that a comprehensive inquiry is carried out into the problem and that every endeavour is made to retain the much-needed employment which is involved.</P>

His record up to now has been shameful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Boats are also used for salmon fishing.  Now we are witnessing the demise of our native boat-building industry apparently at the behest of the Minister.  From the Minister's performance over the past two years it would seem that he would be happier if there were no fishing industry in Ireland.  We have had a series of proposals which would lead us to believe that.  This most recent case is a prime example.  We had suggestions from the Minister that the Spanish, the Danes and the Norwegians should do our fishing.  The inherent suggestion in the latest proposal about these redundancies is that the British and the French should build our boats.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Fox was speaking the Minister in charge of the Buy Irish Campaign, Deputy R. Burke, came into the House.  He made as quick an exit as ever I saw.  He must have been hanging his head in shame at the disgraceful aspersions which were cast on the competence of Irish tradesmen.  What hope has the Buy Irish Campaign got when we have a condemnation of our very skills by a member of the Government party?  The Minister seems to be determined to make sure that everything used in the fishing industry from a needle to an anchor, and that includes trawlers, is manufactured outside this country.  That will be the situation if the Minister's desire comes true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that for years BIM have been trying to get out of the boat-building business.  It is common knowledge that the senior executives of that board would rather not have such a <Col N="1239" /> development on their hands.  They see themselves more as developers of fisheries than of boatyards, but that does not mean that the Minister can wash his hands completely of the industry.  Last night I heard him blame over-manning as one of the reasons why the boatyards have been losing vast sums of money over recent years.  I put it to him that the over-manning has long ago been got rid of.  When the Coalition Government were in power far more people were employed in the three BIM boatyards than at present.  The numbers have dropped quite dramatically over the past two years.  The present run-down can only be described as an effort to close all three. When the number of people in employment in these yards will be fewer, there can be no other function than repairs. There has been a concerted effort to run those yards down, to delay and if possible divert orders from these yards.  As Deputy Treacy said here tonight and Deputy Blaney mentioned last night, there has been a concerted effort not to replace any staff who retire or leave for other reasons.</P>
    <P>The Minister's alternative suggestion that private enterprise can fill the gap is not confirmed by past performance.  If things are as bad or as inefficient as the Minister has claimed, why has private enterprise not capitalised on that in the last couple of years?  Last year loans were granted by BIM for eight boats over 65 feet in length to be built abroad. The Minister said that Irish boatyards can take over the work which is at present being done by BIM.  Surely the Minister is aware that the maximum size steel-hulled boat which can be built in private boatyards at the moment is 45 feet.  The demand is for much larger boats.  We need an industry which can build steel-hulled boats in excess of 45 feet, preferably 90, 100, 110 feet.  Has the Minister explored the obvious alternatives in this case?  Why not modernise the BIM boatyards to allow them to build steel-hulled boats which obviously the fishermen are seeking nowadays?  If BIM do not want to take the responsibility of these yards, why does not the Minister control these yards himself, use experts within his Department and give <Col N="1240" /> the yards a considerable amount of autonomy?  From speaking to workers in these yards I believe that if they had this autonomy things would work considerably better and the yards would be far more viable.</P>

      <P>I am withdrawing it, although I never said it.  We had a complete contradiction at Question Time. We were told one version by the Minister and one version in answer to Deputy Begley.  The Minister told a deputation here in Leinster House this morning that he had a client to take over the Baltimore boatyard, whereas he told us at Question Time that he had not a client, that he had merely an inquiry. There seems to be a vast difference between the two statements.</P>
      <P>The Minister by his refusal at Question Time today to detail the reasons for the huge losses in the Killybegs boatyard last year has confirmed our suspicions that this yard and the others were deliberately run down with a view to closure.  He knows full well that the losses incurred last year were caused largely by the fact that there were two boats being built to a new design, something which never had been tried before at Killybegs. As a result there were excessive expenses, and, generally speaking, the huge loss can be attributed to this factor. I do not believe the Minister's statement that we are heading for another £1 million loss in 1979 in these boatyards.  He is making that statement to suit himself and give himself another reason for ensuring that these boatyards do close down.  It is all used as a smokescreen or a cloud, ably abetted by people like Deputy Fox, to make the public believe that the BIM yards are highly inefficient, which is not necessarily the case.  The Minister should by now have got the message that the indignation at these proposed redundancies is not confined to the communities concerned.  It permeates the fishing industry and the whole country.  I advise the Minister to rethink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a very clear picture here in the last few days.  We see Fianna Fáil Deputies from affected constituencies tripping over themselves to make public statements renouncing what the Minister has stated publicly, that is that the redundancies will take place.  Deputy Blaney said last night that Senator McGowan told the people in Killybegs that there would be an inquiry into the matter and that he would have no hand, act or part in this closure.  Deputy J. <Col N="1242" /> Walsh of Cork South-West is quoted in the newspapers as saying that if the boatyards do close down it will be over his dead body.</P>

      <P>Or if redundancies take place for that matter.  The Minister should have learned from experience, but obviously he feels that he will not incur the wrath of the electorate in Dublin West County where there is probably not one full-time fisherman anyway.  But his colleagues in coastal constituencies might not be too thankful to him after the next general election.</P>
      <P>One thing becomes patently clear in this whole shoddy episode.  This is a conspiracy of some kind which embraces the higher echelons of BIM management, the Minister and certain Fianna Fáil entrepreneurs who are involved in the boat-building industry.</P>

That might suit Fianna Fáil and the Minister, but for God's sake let us think of the workers in the three boatyards concerned in the most remote parts of Ireland where there is no alternative employment and the only option is to emigrate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment because it appears that the Minister, the responsible person, is uncaring about the needs of the elderly, particularly those living alone, in relation to their heating requirements.  The weather we have had in the last five months has been the worst experienced for many years and the elderly have suffered most.  While provision was made for free fuel for such people they were left with fuel vouchers because they could not exchange them for fuel.  There was no fuel available for a long time.  The fuel vouchers could be described as worthless cheques because of that situation.  When I stated that people had died from hypothermia I was not exaggerating.  Indeed, my medical colleagues corroborated that statement. Doctor John Fleetwood, who is very concerned about the needs of the elderly and has worked very hard on their behalf, admitted this and made a statement to the effect that from what his colleagues had told him the increase in deaths from hypothermia this year had been significant.  It is no exaggeration to say that quite a number of people died this year because there was no provision made for their heating needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a situation that the same people living alone in poor circumstances had their circumstances worsened by the fact that they were deprived of food due to the removal of the food subsidies.  The free fuel scheme collapsed and I was inundated with requests from people who had fuel vouchers for up to 11 weeks but could not exchange them for fuel.  That was in January and February and I made a private and a public appeal to the Minister to organise a national relief campaign mobilising such services as the Red Cross and other voluntary organisations to provide fuel, electric blankets, ordinary blankets, electric fires and other heating appliances for such people.  I asked the Minister to provide the contingency funds that would enable them to use electricity without regard to the number of units used.  I did not criticise the Minister but I appealed to <Col N="1246" /> his better sense to do something in the circumstances to save the lives of such people.  When I mentioned the problem in the Dáil the Minister accused me of trafficking in human misery.</P>
    <P>The problem has been brought to light because a number of people have died as a result of the cold.  The Minister has the responsibility and could have mobilised the forces of the health boards and voluntary organisations, such as the Red Cross, in a national relief campaign to try to help such people.  There was no response from him.  That was a great shame.  The Minister may argue that there was home help, meals on wheels and other assistance.  On paper they are great but I have seen hundreds of cases where home help or meals on wheels were not available to such people.  I was engaged daily in giving names to health boards and requesting assistance for such people but friends and relatives later informed me that they had not received any such help, fuel or acknowledgement from the boards.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there are problems created by bureaucracy which exist in health boards but if the leadership had come from the Minister the entire community would have been anxious to help. The leadership should have come from the Minister in the allocation of contingency funds or a directive to the health boards to ignore the costs and make sure that funds were provided.  A public statement from the Minister on television telling the people that it was a national emergency where old people were concerned would have meant the saving of a lot of those lives.  It is a very serious indictment of the Minister, the Department, the health boards and society that a bigger effort was not made to help such people.  A few months ago the Cold Comfort Campaign proposed that a national heating scheme be introduced to cover the entire year and be administered by the Department of Social Welfare.  I am sure the Minister agrees that the present fuel scheme is grossly inadequate.  We have had old people queueing at fuel depots while contractors moved in.  Those aged and disadvantaged people were being exploited by members of the public.  The scheme is unworkable, archaic and is not meeting <Col N="1247" /> the needs of those people.  As the Cold Comfort Campaign members asked, those vouchers should be exchangeable for any type of fuel at any shop or used to pay central heating or ESB bills.  They also ask that delivery vouchers be given to people who cannot collect the fuel themselves.  At present one must prove that one is disabled before qualifying to have the fuel delivered.  That situation is not confined to Dublin; it is national. Deputy Eileen Desmond had already highlighted the problems in Cork.</P>
    <P>The Cold Comfort Campaign also asked that fires be distributed to such people through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Health Boards have not moved in.  Leadership should have come from the Minister in the form of a directive.  The Minister may say that he gave instructions that there was provision for that.  I told him today that one woman living alone had £13 a week disabled person's maintenance allowance out of which she pays £6 a week rent.  I brought this to the attention of the health board, who said they might be able to help with the rent but that it would be some time yet, that they were busy and they might get round to it.  The health board have the funds, but because of some bureaucratic bungling what the Minister may have in mind is not getting through to the people concerned.  Those people have had to stay in bed all day to try to keep warm in very cold, damp surroundings.  This is a terrible indictment of every one of us, particularly the Minister in charge. There is no sign of an abatement of the inclement weather and I ask the Minister now to give a firm promise that he will issue a directive to all health boards that no money is to be spared.  He should announce this on television and radio.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Deputy O'Connell.  There appears to be a discrepancy between the kind of information at his disposal in relation to the actual situation and some of the evidence in cases that have been referred to by the Cold Comfort Campaign and medical authorities in the city. Deputy O'Connell referred to some parts of this city and places throughout <Col N="1248" /> the country.  There appears to be evidence that the free fuel scheme has broken down and that many people entitled to fuel under that scheme have been waiting five weeks for delivery.  I agree that the difficulties have been compounded because there are no vouchers available.</P>
      <P>It looks as if the cold spell is continuing. The Minister should sit down with the health boards, the local authorities and all those involved in the administration of the scheme to see what emergency action can be taken to alleviate the hardship of those poor people. There is evidence from the voluntary bodies that those people have suffered hardship.  However, the Minister, from the information at his disposal, does not appear to have evidence that the situation is serious.  We are simply saying to him that there is the evidence of those various bodies that there appears to be a real problem in the delivery of the fuel under the scheme.  One group said today that it was chaotic.  The Minister said that that is untrue, that the scheme is still working.  If there are in Dublin city and elsewhere old people and others who are entitled to delivery of free fuel and who are not receiving it, then I believe it is an emergency for those people.  The Minister should sit down immediately with the groups involved and perhaps bring forward, as an interim measure, some of the national heating schemes which have been called for by the various bodies.  We know that the free fuel scheme at the moment has been subjected to the strain of unprecedented bad weather and the postal difficulties.  A lot of hardship has been caused to poor people and I ask the Minister to look into the matter.</P>

      <P>I was very surprised, Sir, that you gave permission to have this matter raised on the Adjournment because I thought that by now Deputy O'Connell and Deputy O'Leary had got sufficient mileage out of the hardship of the poor for their particular purposes. The free fuel scheme in Dublin and the other urban areas is now 35 years in existence and I, as Minister for Social Welfare, am the first person who ever <Col N="1249" /> looked at that scheme during the period of its existence with a view to doing something about it.</P>

If he is really concerned about this matter he should attend the Eastern Health Board meetings which discuss it.  He is a member of the Eastern Health Board.

      <P>If Deputy O'Connell went to his meetings he would not be put in the false position of coming in here and demonstrating so ostentatiously that he is completely out of touch with the situation.  I explained in the House today that the Eastern Health Board and Dublin Corporation during all of this year have been particularly vigilant and have been doing everything they possibly can to mitigate the effects of the severe weather we have been having.  I am in constant touch with both those bodies about this matter.  I instanced today that the health board have their field staff activated&mdash;their public health nurses, welfare officers and other similar outdoor staff.  They have been asked to <Col N="1250" /> be specially active in aiding old people in the community who might be suffering from the effects of the cold.</P>
      <P>Why does Deputy O'Connell come along here and ask me to authorise things which have already been authorised three or four months ago? The staff of the Eastern Health Board have been authorised to issue blankets, fuel and electric fires if necessary.  These things are going on day by day through the work of the dedicated, devoted staff of the health board.  Deputy O'Connell and Deputy O'Leary are not doing themselves or anybody else any justice by attacking those officers of the health board who are doing a very good job in the most unprecedented difficult weather conditions we have had for many years.</P>
      <P>I was also in touch with Dublin Corporation before this winter weather commenced with a view to effecting improvements in the scheme.  I have kept in touch with them right through the winter.  I got an up-to-date assessment from Dublin Corporation no later than this morning of the situation and of their activities.</P>

This free fuel scheme has never been regarded as satisfactory, but nobody did anything about it until now.  I have had it reviewed and investigated by an expert body of people in the field, representative of Dublin Corporation, voluntary organisations and social workers.  I have had a report from that body which is under examination at the moment.  It is my intention to bring <Col N="1252" /> about some improvement in the situation before next winter.  In the meantime, I assure the House that everything that can possibly be done by the health-board and Dublin Corporation to mitigate the effects of the severe winter is being done.
