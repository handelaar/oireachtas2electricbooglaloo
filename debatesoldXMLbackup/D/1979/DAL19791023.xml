      <P>Information from the 1979 census of population relating to individual townlands will not be available until the final detailed area tabulations for district electoral divisions and wards are completed.  It is anticipated, as indicated in a reply to a recent parliamentary question, that the final 1979 census figures for such areas will be published in January 1980.</P>
      <P>Information on the population of individual townlands is, of course, available from the 1971 census and I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the information required from this census.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to Deputy Kelly that the deficit in the current balance of payments is only one aspect of it and that in so far as the reserve and the state of the country's currency is concerned, it is the overall position of the balance of payments that counts, including capital inflow.  The Deputy may be aware that in the case, for instance, of the EEC, because of the increase in the price of oil there will be a <Col N="360" /> deficit in the Community on the current side.  In fact, there will be a deficit in every country except in Italy, brought about to a considerable extent by the increase in the price of oil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the facilities available from the Government Information Services and from the information units which exist in many of the larger Departments, it is not evident to me that any special further steps need to be taken towards meeting the objective mentioned by the Deputy.  In the last analysis, it is a matter for each individual Minister to decide to what extent information should, when requested, be made available on specific issues.</P>
      <P>As far as my own Department are concerned, I would be anxious that as much information as is reasonably possible be given in reply to inquiries about their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a particularly important question because of the increasing encroachment of bureaucrats and State bureaucracy into our affairs and our objection to that.  Would the Minister not agree that where there is an interdepartmental committee the head of the Department concerned is not the best person to decide whether the information should be made public or not in that he may have a vested interest in concealing the information?  Would the Minister make it a general principle that either Members of the Oireachtas can have access to any interdepartmental reports they request or, alternatively, would he <Col N="367" /> consider publishing a Green Paper on the whole question of freedom to information in the present altering circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that a Green Paper would be required and if such a request is made it will be considered. In reply to the Deputy's other points, I should like to state that section 4 of the Official Secrets Act lays down the procedure involved and that is what is applied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, there are matters which cannot be published because of security but where this Act does not apply would the Minister accept that Members of the Oireachtas be given a right of access, through the Library here, to the information they request? I am sure the Minister accepts that such information would be handled responsibly.  The suggestion I have put forward is intended to apply until the Green Paper is issued.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>In general, the limitations on access to official information are the interests of the State.  The Official Secrets Act, 1963, contains the present law on this subject. It specifically prohibits disclosures relating to certain contracts and security and, otherwise, leaves it to each individual Minister to decide to what extent information in his Department should be released.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Eligibility for medical cards is governed not by regulations but by section 45 of the Health Act, 1970. This defines an eligible person as one on whom it would be an undue hardship to provide general practitioner services for himself and his dependants.  In assessing whether or not this undue hardship exists chief executive officers take account of circumstances such as illness of a continuous <Col N="378" /> nature if this is brought to their attention.</P>

If the Minister so agrees, in view of the hardship imposed on any person, young or old, afflicted with an ailment which needs more or less constant care and attention over extended periods, would he not agree also that such a person should now be covered by a card?  I might add in conclusion&mdash;this is not a question but a comment&mdash;that I am satisfied that the present Minister is as good a man in the House to do that by way of helping so many of those people as is any other Member.  I am placing particular emphasis on this because I am a member of the Southern Health Board where I have found it useless drawing attention to these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a difficult question. There are a number of different aspects to it.  First of all, there is the medical card itself.  Even though a family or individual may be outside the guidelines nevertheless the chief executive officer has discretion to issue a medical card where the illness would be of such a nature that hardship would be caused to <Col N="379" /> the family by catering for it.  Secondly, there are a number of diseases which are listed as long-term illnesses and for which special provision is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course since April last everybody, every individual family in the country, is entitled to participate in the drugs refund scheme.  So that, as far as drugs are concerned, nobody need pay any more than £6.50 a month.  That applies to everybody.  I have also said to chief executive officers recently that, in the case of an individual or family having a constantly recurring heavy bill for drugs&mdash;where the amount is more or less the same going on from month to month&mdash;special arrangements should be made in these cases.  There is another case, such as asthma, for instance, where again I have asked the chief medical officers to be particularly careful and to take all the circumstances of these families into account in deciding whether or not to issue a medical card.  All in all, there is a fairly comprehensive approach to this problem.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 to 23, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The present health eligibility limit of £5,500 will continue until April 1980.  In the meantime in accordance with the terms of the national understanding the Government are introducing an interim scheme to compensate persons in the income range £5,500 to £7,000 for certain medical expenses incurred by them in relation to the period 25 July 1979, which is the date of implementation of the national understanding, to 5 April 1980, the date to which the limit of £5,500 operates.</P>
      <P>The expenses involved, and for which a payment may be claimed, are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> 1.  Portion of the premium paid to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board for the board's public ward scheme.</P>
    <P>2.  Hospital consultants' bills to persons without voluntary health insurance for services received as in-patients in public wards.</P>
    <P>3.  Hospital consultants' bills for services received as out-patients in public clinics.</P>
    <P>4.  General practitioner bills for maternity services.</P>
    <P>Full particulars of the interim scheme will be announced shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was not party to the national understanding negotiations, but would he agree that to negotiate an understanding which included a proviso that £7,000 would be the limit without having concluded the necessary negotiations with the profession involved was securing an agreement under what were effectively false pretences?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Medical Association can still refuse to accept the proposal and the undertaking given and that the understanding, therefore, falls to the ground?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that between 6 July last and now and certainly between 6 July last and 5 April 1980 many thousands of persons <Col N="382" /> on income rates of between £5,500 and £7,000 will receive accounts, and indeed have now actually received accounts, from consultants and so on and no regulations have yet been published, no indications have been given as to when and what the arrangements will be for the repayment of those?  Should persons hold these accounts, not pay them, and then when the arrangements are made send the accounts to the Department of Health, or what should they do?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In general terms, nobody in that category need have any worries.  In so far as people have paid since 5 July or will pay until next April any consultants' fees these will be repaid to them.  There would be a lot to be said for them submitting the bill that they get and getting paid on that and then paying the consultant.  That has to be worked out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 to 30, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme applies to persons in the age group 16 to 66 years who are living at home.  However, an allowance once <Col N="386" /> granted will be continued after pensionable age as long as the person meets the basic criteria.</P>
    <P>There is a means test similar to that which operates for the purposes of the Disabled Persons Maintenance Allowance, that is, that by reason of disability the applicant is unable to provide for his maintenance and his spouse, if any, is unable to maintain him.</P>
    <P>The basic medical conditions to qualify for payment of the allowance are as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The applicant is unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or is in such a condition of health that the extra exertion required to walk would be dangerous.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The applicant must not be forbidden for medical reasons from being moved.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The applicant must be in a position to benefit from a change in his surroundings.</P>
    <P>The scheme came into operation on 1 September and details are not yet available of the numbers approved by health boards for payment of the allowance.  It has been estimated that about 2,500 persons will benefit under the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister if he could review two aspects of the scheme.  First of all, regarding the £3 per week payable to such persons, is the Minister aware that the allowance in Northern Ireland, for example, is £12 per week and that really £3 per week would pay for only a couple of miles in a taxi in one direction only?  It is miniscule. Would the Minister urge the health boards to exercise compassionate criteria in assessing people in view of the stringent means test which has been brought into operation for a very small number of people in the nation, only 2,500?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that there was nothing <Col N="387" /> there before and there is something there now.  Admittedly, it is only £3 a week. The idea is that people in the category who qualify will have one outing a week. That is what is intended.  I know that the allowance in Britain and in Northern Ireland was £10 until recently and is being increased to £12 from 1 November. We are only starting this.  There was nothing there before and it is a beginning. It is something we will keep under review and improve it as we can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 32 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that the questions relate to section 247 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945 which requires the inspector of mental hospitals to submit to the Minister an annual report on mental institutions and provides for the laying of such reports before each House of the Oireachtas and that a copy be sent to the President of the High Court.</P>
      <P>I explained in a statement issued by the Government Information Services on 18 July 1979 that there is not the same need for such reports now as there was when the mental hospitals were closed institutions.  Much of the statistical information which would have been contained in these reports is now published in reports of the Medico-Social Research Board.</P>
      <P>I would like to make it clear, however, that the inspector of mental hospitals carries out the statutory inspections required by section 236 of the Act.  This section specifies that the inspector shall visit and inspect each district mental hospital at least once a year and each mental institution not maintained by a health board at least once in each half year.</P>
      <P>Reports on these inspections are furnished to me by the inspector and appropriate action is taken by my Department as required in relation to matters raised in the reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that I am reviewing the requirements in regard to the inspections of and reporting on mental hospitals in <Col N="389" /> connection with the preparation of new mental treatment legislation which I intend to bring before the House later in this session.</P>

That was only four hours before the House was due to sit.  Effectively this means a delay of another week in putting down an important question, a question that concerns the behaviour of the Government Information Services.  Surely it is not beyond the bounds of the capacity of yourself and your officials to decide at once whether a question is in order and to let the Deputy know the decision instead of informing him of the outcome six days later so that he must wait another week to have a shot again at extracting the information concerned.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very constructive Second Stage debate on this Bill.  In the course of the debate a number of practical points were raised and I propose now to deal with any of these that I had not referred to on the last occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputies White and Cosgrave raised the whole matter of research and the relationship of the new central board to the area of research particularly in regard to sea angling.  I assure the Deputies that so far as sea angling is concerned there is no intention in regard to this Bill to remove sea angling in any way in terms of research, development and management, from the responsibility of the new Inland Fisheries Authority. To strengthen that point I propose to bring in an amendment on Committee Stage to make it quite clear that the existing work being done by the Inland Fisheries Trust in this area will be continued <Col N="487" /> by the new central board and that the full research facilities available in Abbotstown will be there as a back-up to the new central board.  The research facilities of the Inland Fisheries Trust will also transfer to the board.  Research into various sea angling fish or commercial fish will continue.</P>
    <P>The other point made by Deputy White was in regard to eel development. I agree with him about the possibilities of the development of eels.  We realise the important contribution this development can make.  As far as the Galway fishery, which the State has acquired, is concerned the original purchase price will have been discharged within three years&mdash;which is not a bad investment&mdash;last year, this year and next year at the present rate.  A main contributor to that has been the commercial viability of the eel fishing involved.</P>
    <P>Strong comments were made by a number of speakers, particularly Deputy Treacy, in regard to drainage and its relationship to fisheries.  In this Bill we are not concerned with arterial drainage. The basic section in the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, that deals with this matter, section 10, is working very well in practice.  That is the section that makes it obligatory on the Commissioners to take such precautions as the Minister may consider adequate for the protection of and avoidance of injury to fisheries.  The Commissioners must take such recommendations from the Minister into account in the pursuance of any such arterial drainage scheme. We have set up a permanent working administrative arrangement between the Department of Fisheries and the Office of Public Works which ensures&mdash;it is becoming more effective as co-operation continues&mdash;that the Department, through their engineering and scientific personnel, are in on the early planning stage of any drainage scheme.  We are implementing this section to the fullest extent.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by Deputy Treacy.  There is the fullest co-operation and co-ordination between <Col N="488" /> the engineering personnel in my Department and the planning personnel in OPW.  I share with the Deputy concern in this respect.  This aspect was perhaps not fully attended to over the years but I am satisfied that it is now and that there is an awareness of the importance of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

      <P>The other point made by Deputy Treacy was in connection with staff.  He was not present when I assured the House on the last occasion that as far as the staff organisations are concerned&mdash;the staff association and the ITGWU&mdash;I am prepared to meet them to discuss the inevitable redeployment of personnel that will be involved arising out of this legislation.  Apart from the decentralisation move to Galway, because of the merging of the staff of the boards of conservators and the Inland Fisheries Trust there will be redeployment of personnel across the board.  I met the staff association on 29 May and the ITGWU on 6 April and discussed these aspects with them.  I shall be seeing them in the near future to discuss the implications <i>vis-á-vis</i> conditions of service and so on arising out of the redeployment of personnel that will occur.  There is no question of anything being opposed.  The fullest discussion will take place as regards that aspect.</P>
      <P>The whole thrust of the Bill is designed to ensure that we will have a more professional staff concerned with protection and development of our inland fisheries.  It is arising from that that I see the main benefit of the Bill: instead of having the <i>ad hoc</i> recruitment system we have at present through the various boards of conservators there will be a properly established system with properly trained, graded, paid and superannuated staff concerned with the protection, development and management of our fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Daly raised the question of the issue of licences.  Licences will continue to obtain on a regional basis under <Col N="489" /> the new arrangement.  He made an interesting suggestion about a consultative committee of all interests in the Shannon area.  I shall take that up with the new board in that area when it is established. Some Deputies, including Deputy White, seem to think that it would be an advantage if the ESB waters were acquired. Deputy Daly rightly paid tribute to the ESB because they, as an organisation, have put substantial money into the Parteen hatchery and have embarked on a highly progressive policy in regard to the Shannon area.  They have set up a division within the ESB and have developed spawning in the area.  The only spanner in the works as far as they are concerned is the illegal drift netting, which we are now tackling, off the Shannon estuary. This brings me to the point raised by Deputy White regarding hatchery policy.  One cannot have a hatchery policy run by the proposed central board or regional boards or by the ESB in the Shannon area&mdash;this has been the ESB's experience and they are pioneers in this area&mdash;unless illegal fishing outside the estuary is tackled.  We must get our priorities right.  There is no point in the State, through the central board, ploughing millions of £s into promoting hatcheries, organising spawning grounds and so on if at the mouth of the estuary the end product is decimated by illegal fishing.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for Defence and the Irish Navy for their part in co-operating with the protection staff of the Board of Conservators last year and this year and with the Garda in trying to make an indentation on the problem of illegal fishing. Last year we had over 200 prosecutions for illegal fishing mainly monofilament net.  We had over £¼ million of such nets confiscated and we hope to get orders, through the courts, for their destruction. Blatantly illegal netting has been the cause of reductions in salmon stocks and makes nonsense, as it has done to the ESB's hatchery programme, of any hatchery proposals, however wellintentioned, in which the State may engage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern spoke about the <Col N="490" /> various regulations made last year in regard to opening and closing times of the salmon season and the extra 24 hours mid-week closing and asked that the matter be treated more flexibly, which we propose to do in this Bill.  It is proposed, to adjust the position from year to year.  Heretofore, once such regulations were made, they were tied to a three-year period.  We now have a more flexible arrangement, whereby we can look at the situation as it affects the different areas, and adjust accordingly, from year to year.  The regulations, however, have worked very well in the past season.</P>
    <P>I made one point when closing on the previous occasion, which illustrates how successful the operation was in the interest of salmon stocks and, of course, in the interest of fishermen, both commercial and angling.  Deputy White rightly said that the figure for rod catch for the year before last was 2 per cent.  We estimate that the rod catch for last year was 3.47 per cent, which is nearly double the previous year's.  That is a very good barometer and indicates a greater escapement of salmon upstream to the spawning grounds, therefore greater breeding possibilities and probabilities. We regard the rod catch as a basic indicator of success in curtailing commercial catching&mdash;which, candidly was the whole purpose of the exercise&mdash;probably, and entirely, to allow a greater escapement of salmon.  The very fact that the rod catch upstream has almost doubled this year on last year is an indication that more salmon have come upstream, which should help in the revival of salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy made a number of in teresting points, some of which I have already dealt with.  He is right that the financial commitment of the community to this new fisheries structure and the professionalism of the new structure will be all important.  We have a new means of financing, by a levy on the first sale of salmon, which will help, coupled with an increasing Exchequer commitment to fisheries protection and development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to Bord na <Col N="491" /> Móna.  I assure him that there is a new attitude, in that Bord na Móna have now established a specific division within their organisation to deal with the whole question of pollution from their operations. It is known that in the early days of milled peat development there was undoubted damage caused to fish life, particularly in the whole midland region adjacent to Bord na Móna operations&mdash;the Shannon and its tributaries, the Brosna, the Suck and so on.  That at least is now being investigated and controlled to some extent and Bord na Móna have set up a scientific division to seek answers to a difficult problem.  I am not pretending that all the problems have been solved, they are still in the course of investigation in that area.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture has been mentioned by a number of speakers, particularly Deputy Deasy.  For the first time, in this Bill we have an administrative regime to cater for the acquisition of waters, the licensing of operators and the whole control of the aquaculture scene&mdash;aquaculture under the Bill including mariculture.  That is a specific part of the Bill, Part V.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy raised an important aspect concerning salmon stocks, that not alone have we problems controlling the situation off our coasts and in our waters but this is true of the whole North Atlantic, particularly Greenland, where there has been heretofore a certain lack of control.  I agree with the Deputy and this matter is on the agenda of the Council of Ministers, who will meet next Monday, and will be one of the items under discussion.  The American Government have taken an initiative in this respect and have got the agreement of the Canadian Government.  There will be representatives from the American Government speaking on behalf of the whole North American interests in Europe here early next month.  They will meet the Commission and various member country Ministers and myself here in Dublin, with a view to working out a regime of control in regard to the whole run of salmon in the North Atlantic.  The idea is to set up a convention or treaty <Col N="492" /> between Canada, the United States, Greenland and the Community whereby a regime be established and a permanent commission established, representative of both sides of the Atlantic and their interests, to secure some control and regime in regard to salmon.  This is very long overdue.  Over-fishing off Greenland has been a contributory factor in the reduction of salmon stocks on this side of the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>I think that covers most of the specific points raised.  Deputy Hegarty raised the point concerning factory ships and their effect on Irish stocks.  I emphasise that since 1 January 1977 we have had an exclusion of the worst of these ships, the Japanese, Russians and East European countries to outside the 200-mile limit. They are the main participators in that sort of fishing and their exclusion has been beneficial to our fishing stocks.  The regeneration of mackerel stocks in the past two years has been largely due to the exclusion of these factory ships.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that this is basically a Committee Stage Bill on which on each section there is scope for a full debate.  If I have omitted any aspects raised in the course of the very long discussion on Second Stage, they can be dealt with fully on Committee Stage.  Everybody in the House is agreed in principle on the Bill, but there are matters of detail in regard to specific sections which can be discussed on Committee Stage.  This is a comprehensive Bill which, overall, is in the national interest and if we can tease out matters on Committee Stage, so much the better.  There is general, broad agreement with the main principles and thrust of the measure.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> A considerable amount of publicity has preceded the introduction of this Bill which represents the fulfilment of the Government's undertaking to establish a Women's Service Corps, Cór na mBan. Deputies will, accordingly, be aware of my general intentions for the organisation of the corps which I now propose to explain in greater detail.  The Bill, as will be seen, is designed to amend the existing Defence Acts so as to provide in an express way for the enlistment of women into the Defence Forces, the appointment of women as officers of the Defence Forces, and certain other connected matters.</P>
    <P>Provision already exists in the Defence Act, 1954, for the appointment of women as members of the Army Nursing Service which is an integral part of the Permanent Defence Force.  The members of this service, who in their special role have given outstanding service over the years, are not, however, liable for ordinary military duties and are not subject to the military disciplinary code.  The Bill now before the House proposes the admission of women into the Defence Forces on precisely the same legal basis as men.  In practical terms, therefore, what the proposals envisage is the creation for the first time in the history of the Defence Forces of a body of women soldiers who will be integrated with their male counterparts in forming to-day's modern Army.</P>
    <P>I have had the most exhaustive studies carried out and I personally have given a great deal of thought to the question of how women might best be introduced into the military environment which up to now has been exclusively a male preserve.  Various alternatives have been considered, but I am convinced it is only in the fullest practicable sense of participation in defence activities that the aspirations and abilities of women who elect for a military career will find adequate expression.  Accordingly, apart from the fact that they will be non-combatant, it is my intention that women will be employed on a very comprehensive <Col N="494" /> range of duties and that there will be no question of their being allocated menial or subservient tasks or relegated to obscure or uninteresting appointments.</P>
    <P>I am most concerned that women should regard the Army as a worth-while and rewarding career.  Enlistment will be open to both married and single applicants, and the conditions for enlistment and discharge will be the same as those which apply to men, but with one important exception.  Women who wish to do so will be allowed to terminate their military service on marriage, or pregnancy, or for related domestic reasons.  Paid maternity leave will be granted on the same basis as applies elsewhere in the public service.  The levels of pay and allowances will be the same as for male personnel.  There will be an attractive uniform and the intention is that a good standard of accommodation will be provided, either by adapting existing buildings where practicable, or by erecting new buildings as part of the programme of providing improved accommodation for Defence Forces personnel in general.</P>
    <P>As to the actual intake of women into the Defence Forces, the initial step will be the appointment of a small number of specially selected officers who, following a period of familiarisation and training, will be required to supervise the training of the first general intake of female recruits.  The officer appointments, including if available some women with previous military experience, will be undertaken as soon as practicable following the passage of the Bill, and general recruitment will be introduced at an appropriate time thereafter.  No effort will be spared to ensure that in the shortest time possible the overall contribution of women to the Defence Forces both as regards numbers and appointments will be expanded to a significant degree throughout the country.</P>

      <P>As spokesman on Defence for the Fine Gael Party it is a great pleasure for me to welcome this Bill.  As this is the first opportunity I have had to speak for my party on matters relating to the Department of Defence, I should like to pay a special tribute to our Defence Forces, our Army at home and abroad.  The contribution they make to the commúnity and to world peace is of great credit to the nation, to the Army, and to our Defence Forces generally.  At a time when we are introducing a new dimension into the Army, a Women's Corps, it should be said that there are many in the community who do not appreciate or are not aware of the contribution our Army have made to world peace and to the community as a whole, in the Congo in the early sixties, subsequently in Cyprus and the Middle East, and now in the Lebanon where they have had very onerous and arduous tasks to perform sometimes at great danger to themselves.  They have performed their duties as a peace-keeping force throughout the world without fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I am glad to have the opportunity to welcome it and I wish it every success.  We did not get much information from the Minister in his introductory statement.  One important aspect of this Bill is the fact that it is doing <Col N="496" /> something new.  It is adding a new dimension to the Army by recruiting a Women's Corps.  There cannot be any lackadaisical approach to it.  The Minister and his officials must take the initiative and do a public relations job to make the corps attractive to our young girls.  I am glad the Minister said there will be full equality of the sexes.  In the Women's Corps they will not be discriminated against just because they are women.  I hope the pay and conditions will be comparable to employment in the community as a whole.  That is a very important factor.</P>
    <P>We are recruiting a Women's Corps against the background of a falling-off in recruitment to our Defence Forces.  This falling-off in recruitment could be a disadvantage and I sincerely hope the Minister and his advisers will be able to overcome it.  I mentioned the public relations aspect.  It is important that this corps should be given the status or the glamour it deserves.  The sporting and recreational facilities and the opportunities which will be available should be highlighted.  A wide variety of games and activities is available throughout the Army.  The sports facilities have been greatly improved and our Army teams can now compete on an international basis.  If all these facilities, including the Army Equitation School whose total prize money in 1978 was £26,000, were given more publicity, they would make the Army a more attractive proposition for young girls.  There is a job of public relations to be done in connection with the Army and I believe that this job will be tackled.</P>
    <P>Anything that releases our troops to perform their basic role is to be welcomed.  The majority of our soldiers spend their time doing house-keeping and clerical duties.  There is no doubt that women are more competent than men in the performance of most clerical and house-keeping duties.  They would even be as competent as men in the performance of driving duties, telephone duties, pay and intelligence duties.  These are all duties for which women have a natural aptitude.  I think the Minister <Col N="497" /> would agree that it is a waste of manpower to involve men in such jobs.  In some armies women have been trained in combat, but I am glad that the Minister has said that training in combat duties is not intended for the Women's Corps. During World War II all the jobs that I have mentioned were performed by women in the British and American armed services.  In Britain women also worked as air-raid wardens, fire-fighters and first-aid workers.  Their efforts in those areas were beyond praise.  We should not approach the recruitment of the Women's Corps in a lackadaisical manner.  One of the things responsible for the bad publicity is that our soldiers have been expected to do jobs which they were never intended to do.  If it is decided to enlist women they should be organised and trained in the same way as men.  Their ranks and rates of pay should equal those of the men they relieve.</P>
    <P>There will be great interest in the design of the uniform for the Women's Corps.  It should be possible to design a dual purpose uniform with slacks for different duties.  There is no doubt that the uniform would be an attraction to girls who were thinking of joining the corps.</P>
    <P>I should like to know the educational requirements for the Women's Corps.  I understand that the Minister intends to recruit female officers who will be specially trained to train other personnel. A great deal of thought should be given to the duties which the members of the Women's Corps will be expected to perform. Has provision been made for finance for separate quarters for the women?  Will they be expected to take up duty in the different barracks throughout the country?  In regard to the training of the recruits, a great deal of emphasis should be placed on fitness as most women are now very fitness-conscious. It should also be made clear to female recruits that it is possible for them to reach the top of their profession and that they will not be overlooked in any way.</P>
    <P>Even though I have read statements by the Minister about the attractions of the Army, I suggest that it is not sufficiently <Col N="498" /> attractive to interest our young men and women.  For example, the rates of pay do not compare favourably with the pay of dockers, building labourers and prison warders.  How do the rates of pay for prison warders' overtime compare with the rates of pay of Army personnel who work long hours of overtime? Soldiers are expected to perform their own duties and they are also expected to act as stop-gaps when civil workers strike.  It is wrong to expect soldiers to replace civil workers who are on strike, as happened in Dublin this year.  Soldiers are the custodians of our freedom and their duties are exacting. Their duties include the patrolling of 300 miles of Border, the guarding of prisoners and Government buildings and patrolling UN danger spots.</P>
    <P>Some of the jobs which I have referred to, such as guarding prisoners, could be done by some of our unemployed if they were trained to do them.  Of all the people involved in security work today, I believe that our soldiers are the least thanked and the worst paid.  In many cases I would go so far as to say that they are also the worst fed.  All these matters will have to be examined and rectified if we want to make the Army an attractive proposition for our women folk.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish this Bill a speedy enactment.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will give it the attention it deserves because it is important not to tackle this sort of new venture in a halfhearted way.  Nothing succeeds like success, so we should try to be successful from the start.  I wish the Bill every success and I hope that in the not-too-distant future the Minister will be in a position to announce to this House that his Bill was a success.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I want to ask the Minister about.  I would be pleased if the Minister would elaborate on section 5, which provides for the corresponding application in the case of women holding non-commissioned rank in the Defence Forces of section 99 of the Defence Act, 1954, under which the Minister may order deductions to be <Col N="499" /> made from the pay of a man holding non-commissioned rank in respect of the maintenance of his wife or children where it appears to the Minister that the man has deserted them or left them in destitute circumstances.  That may be very necessary but I would like the Minister to elaborate on it.  Is this the only area in State employment where the Minister has the right to take such action? Does it apply to the Garda Síochána?  Does it apply to other State employees?  If this is the only area to which it applies, then it is a reflection on the Army.  I would be glad if the Minister would deal with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the Second Stage of this Bill.  I am pleased that it removes the final discrimination against women in the organisation of our security forces.  It is some years now since ban-ghardaí were introduced and any objective assessment in relation to their role within the Garda Síochána would show that any misgivings or any outmoded concepts of the role of women in the work force and in the security forces have proved to be unfounded.  Accordingly, the decision of the Government to provide a direct opportunity for women to take up active careers in the Army is entirely welcome.</P>
      <P>Some sections of public opinion may regard the decision of the Government as being somewhat novel.  It is important to stress that it is in no way unique.  It is in no way unusual because in most of the modern conventional defence forces in Europe and in many other parts of the world women play a highly active role and have done so for a long number of years.  I do not have any direct information on it but I think we are the last country in Europe to abolish discrimination in this area and accordingly I strongly welcome this decision.  The only regret I have is that it has taken so long for that decision to be enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are all the usual questions one can ask in relation to a Bill of this nature and in relation to the intentions of the <Col N="500" /> Government.  One might ask when the initial enlistment is likely to commence. One might ask how many specially selected officers will be initially recruited and when this is likely to commence.  Is there a provision in the current Estimates or can it be absorbed into the ordinary Estimate of the Department?  I presume that it does not require segregation in the Estimate at this stage even for next year.</P>
    <P>There are also the conditions for enlistment.  It is provided that the conditions for enlistment and discharge will be the same as those which apply to men.  I presume in relation to the leaving certificate or different academic qualifications obtained by women as against those obtained by men in the normal course of events that there is a balancing factor here particularly where officers are recruited in on second level educational requirements.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on that.  Is there any consideration being given to that at this stage?</P>
    <P>A question which will inevitably arise is whether such recruits will have the opportunity for United Nations service.  I presume they will.  I earnestly hope that they would have total opportunity of being so involved.  Non-combatant duties are, I suppose, a conventional Army term but one must bear in mind that for every so-called combatant in the Army the back-up is two to three at least.  This means in effect that direct access to all roles within the Army will be open to women.  Indeed, the concept of combatant and non-combatant within an Army is usually dropped within a broad range of back-up and front line duties in any active Army force.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest that new accommodation be made available.  If the new recruits saw some of the older accommodation within the Army, the quarters still in existence for some married officers and particularly men in the ordinary ranks, it would not just turn them against the Army but would turn them against the Government.  I hope, therefore, that existing buildings will not <Col N="501" /> merely be adapted but that new buildings will be provided for such recruits.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that many Irish women will decide to enlist in the Army and that they will make a distinctive, positive and very definite impact in the contingent bringing up to full establishment the Defence Forces of the country.</P>
    <P>That is all one can say except to stress that this is a normal development and not particularly novel.  It is a development which is long overdue, one which every politician here will welcome and about which every woman in the country will say a hearty &ldquo;about time&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that the Minister is going ahead with the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1979.  It is, in fact, the fulfilment of a promise made in the election manifesto in 1977 when another knight acted as Minister for Defence. The establishment of the Women's Service Corps represents the biggest change in the composition of our Defence Forces.  It is nice to refer to another promise fulfilled.  Is é seo beart de réir ár mbriathar.  The decision is welcomed by many women I know in Kildare and also by some of the male members of the Defence Forces.  Many of these ladies have expressed very keen interest in the proposal.  I am aware, too, of the part played by members of the military nursing service in our Defence Forces and I am glad the Minister complimented them on this excellent service.  It was solely confined to professional nursing duties and now, 25 years later, we can celebrate the enlistment of women who will have full participation, apart from combat duties, and to whom promotional opportunities in the ranks <Col N="502" /> will be open.  Although members may be sent to different units for specific duties, they will also be attached to the Women's Service Corps.</P>
      <P>As other speakers have indicated, I feel that there will be some teething problems in the initial stages but that, once established, the corps will prove its worth and run itself, providing members to staff it successfully and fill any promotional gaps which may arise.  We have seen how successfully the banghardaí have been assimilated in the Garda force and the vital role they play. That is proof that within the Garda they are no longer looked upon as likely material for a cheap joke.  They have stood the test of time, as I am confident the ladies of the Defence Forces will do.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the Minister hopes to enlist about 270 women at the initial stage and that the majority will be trained in the Curragh, Ceannt, Clarke and McDonagh Barracks and the Military College have been suggested as likely locations and hopefully McGee Barracks in Kildare and Devoy Barracks in Naas will also be used.  An influx of ladies into the Curragh would be particularly welcome and would add a touch of colour to a camp that is particularly drab and male orientated. Bachelor quarters are often improved when a man decides to relinquish his bachelor status and bring in a women and I hope the same will happen in the Curragh Camp.  Some of the buildings there are very shabby and spartan and I hope the Minister intends to give them a face-lift very soon.  I have suggested that we could well afford to sell some valuable properties in Dublin and make the Curragh Camp a national headquarters and a showpiece.  This might be an opportunity of doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entry of women to the Military College is the ideal way to provide promotional opportunities in the ranks and I trust that the ladies will study the same course as the men and will have the same access to university and third level education.  It is vital that the Women's Corps will fill existing established places in the main and that there is no question <Col N="503" /> of women being asked to do menial tasks.  They will carry out the same duties as men, except for combat duties. This has been stressed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed expressed the view that some men were carrying out duties in the catering and office areas which were beneath them and I understood him to imply that these jobs could well be given to women.  I hope that is not his point of view.  Certainly it is not my point of view or that of the Minister.  I hope he is not suggesting that work should be given to women which men do not want to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I gleaned from the Deputy's contribution.  He also objected to soldiers taking on duties during strikes and said they should not do this.  Strikers in areas vital to the economy can hold the country to ransom, sometimes at the bidding of unions not based in this country, and in effect they declare war on this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I might be allowed to comment.  Such strikers declare war and it is the duty of the Army to defend the national interest. Soldiers do not object to this and are prepared to do so when directed by the Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Creed also mentioned that some of our soldiers are poorly fed.  I have gone unannounced to the new cookhouse and dining hall in the Curragh Camp and seen the ordinary menu provided and it is comparable to the menu here in the Dáil Restaurant.  To some that may not be an excellent recommendation.  On the day of my visit there was a choice of four main courses at the main meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great opportunities will be available for women in the area of physical education. <Col N="504" /> I know some candidates who are anxious to enlist and who have physical education very much in mind.  The Army give a wonderful training in this sphere and facilities for sport have been greatly improved of late.  It is very significant that two Kildare men who are members of the Army are on the threshold of qualifying for the Olympics in Moscow for the hammer and mile events respectively. They have been helped by the encouragement of the Army and the interest the Minister has shown in their accomplishment is much appreciated.  I am sure the Army will give equal encouragement to the ladies in the gymnasium.  I greatly admire the Army gymnastic team which up to now has been completely male.  They have given pleasure to many and are available for functions during the summer months in many areas of the country.  The nearest approach I ever saw to a gymnastic work of art was by a teenager performing on the parallel bars two or three years ago.  I hope the Women's Service Corps will make full use of the opportunities available to them in this sphere.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister whether lady members will be accepted in the FCA. They are already in Civil Defence and it might give the FCA a shot in the arm if ladies were allowed to enlist.  It is more than a coincidence that the present Minister, coming as he does from Connacht, should have referred during his speech to two madly militant western ladies, Queen Maeve and Grace O'Malley.  I doubt if this pair would be prepared to join our Army today in a non-combatant role.  I know many militant women today&mdash;I would hesitate to refer to them as feminists&mdash;who could well do with a spell of discipline in the Army.  When many people are unemployed or avowedly unable to obtain employment, a spell of compulsory military training for boys and girls for a year or so might work wonders.  Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire as ucht an Bille seo a thabhairt isteach agus seans a thabhairt dos na mná páirt fónta a ghlacadh i gcosaint na tíre.  Níl aon dabht agam ach go ndéanfaidh siad deaobair <Col N="505" /> agus nach fada go mbeidh Cór na mBan ar an gcór is fearr sa tír.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition said that we might not be approaching this problem in a realistic fashion and with the proper preparation.  I do not support that idea.  Douglas McArthur is credited with saying at the Republican National Convention in 1952: &ldquo;It is fatal to enter any war without the will to win it&rdquo;.  I am confident that the Minister has embarked on the setting up of the Women's Service Corps with the obvious will and intention to make a success of it.</P>

      <P>I wish to address a few questions to the Minister.  It may be that I am wasting the time of the Minister and the House because I freely admit and agree that these points occurred to me only when I was listening to Deputy Desmond a few moments ago.  Had they occurred to me earlier I would have looked up the relevant statutes and satisfied myself about the matters.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether it is intended that this Bill envisages the recruitment of women already married, if any discretion is proposed to remain with the Army authorities whether to accept or reject a married woman on the basis of, for example, her family responsibilities and, if so, what will be the lines of the criteria on which this discretion will be exercised?</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell the House if it is the intention of the Army to provide housing if it should prove necessary not only for the married woman soldier but for her husband and children?  In the case of the couples who may not have been able to obtain housing in the ordinary way, there might be a route to being housed not by the local authority but by the Department of Defence through the woman enlisting in the Women's Corps&mdash;although I cannot imagine that there would be a rush to do this.  No doubt all of these matters have been thrashed out by the Department but I should be glad for my own information, and perhaps other Deputies may also be interested, to hear the Minister's comments on these matters.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Defence (Amendment) Bill with great enthusiasm. I am very happy to see that we are leading the way to end discrimination against women in this area.  For far too long women in Ireland have been discriminated against in job opportunity, employment and equality.</P>
      <P>This Bill shows that at last we are being serious about the enactment of the Employment Equality Act, 1977. Young women will be more than enthusiastic about this Bill.  Earlier in the year numerous women put inquiries to me about this matter and I know that they are waiting for this Bill to be passed so that they may avail of the opportunity of enlisting.  I am absolutely sure that the Minister will not discriminate against women who enlist in the Army.  Deputy Kelly raised the question of married women joining the Army and I hope the Minister includes them also.  However, I should not like to see a married woman join the Army just to get living accommodation. That would be very wrong and I would not recommend it.</P>
      <P>When women who join the Army decide to marry and have families, I hope that they will be facilitated by the provision of nurseries for their children. This was not mentioned by the Minister when he spoke about the living accommodation that might possibly be built or renovated.  I hope the Minister will make provision for such facilities so that eventually women may leave their children in day nurseries.  This would be very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Creed horrified me.  I hope he was not serious when he spoke of the women in the Army doing the cooking and the cleaning.  In no way would that be equality for women.  In any event, men are quite good at cooking; some of them are much better than women at cooking and they should be allowed to do the job.  If women specifically say that they would like careers as cooks they should be accommodated but they should not be pushed into the job.  That is not what this Bill is about.  It is about equality of opportunity, work, pay and equality of human beings, of men and <Col N="507" /> women.  This is essential for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>For far too long women have been discriminated against.  Human dignity, the welfare of the family and society must involve the participation of women in all aspects of work and employment. The full and complete development of a country, the welfare of the world and the cause of peace requires maximum participation of women as well as of men in all areas.  There is no better place to achieve that than in the Defence Forces. Nowadays women are as strong as men. They do physical education at school and they are able to compete in sports on an equal footing with men.  They are becoming more and more competent in every area where up to now men had the edge in areas that were regarded as a man's world.  This is beginning to change but there is still much discrimination. This Bill will go a long way towards giving the women of Ireland a feeling that they are regarded as equal to men. The recruitment of women into the Ban-Gharda and in other sectors has worked well.</P>
    <P>As a previous speaker mentioned, I too hope that women in the Army will be allowed to pursue third-level education. This is very important but I do not think the Minister said anything about it in his opening remarks.  He said the women will have the same opportunities as the men and that they will be regarded as equal from the point of view of pay and in every other way.  I hope this will extend to education.</P>
    <P>I read recently that when women did an AnCO course in painting and decorating&mdash;what could have been regarded as a man's job in the past&mdash;they came first and second.  This shows that even in what was allegedly regarded as a man's world women very often come out best.  I hope that the women in the Defence Forces will show that they are as good as the men.  They should be given an opportunity to go overseas.  This is a great enticement to people to join the Defence Forces.  Many men join the Army just to see a bit of the <Col N="508" /> world.  I hope the women will be given the opportunity to do the same.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the wonderful advertisements on television for the recruitment of men into the Army.  They are glamorous, encouraging and enticing and they give the feeling that Army life is wonderful.  I must admit they fascinate me.  If I were not a Member of this House I would almost join the Army myself and perhaps if I lose my seat at any time I will do that if I am eligible.  I hope that when the Minister is inserting advertisements to encourage women they will be as colourful and as good as the advertisements used to encourage men.  No doubt the Minister will find that when women join the Army they will be quite capable of doing the job and I am sure they will all be very successful in their undertakings in the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House too long.  Any Bill to remove discrimination between the sexes is welcome.  The Minister for Defence among all his colleagues has the best record in this regard.  He is one of the few members of the present Government who has consistently supported the cause of equality between the sexes.  This Bill manifests the Minister's personal commitment to the removal of discrimination as far as is possible.  As far as I understand it, this Bill is being imposed on the military who oppose the introduction of women to the Army, so the Minister deserves all the more praise for seeing to it that his political will to remove discrimination where possible prevails over the convenience of the military.  However, we should not minimise the inconveniences that will arise if a large number of women come into the Army.  More facilities will have to be provided for an Army which is already short of the necessary facilities. These shortages can no longer be used as an excuse to delay the removal of discrimination against women in every sphere of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The move towards removing discrimination should not be misunderstood as a move to remove the differentials between <Col N="509" /> the sexes.  Deputy Lemass was quite wrong in saying that women are as strong as men.  They cannot compete equally with men in certain sports.  The physical differences between men and women must be taken into account.  I do not advocate that there should be specific categories of jobs for women in the Army but it is clear that there are roles in the Army which we could not reasonably expect to be filled by women. We must recognise the differences while doing away with inequalities and this should be borne in mind when we are debating other Bills in relation to equality.  Discrimination should not be confused with differentiation.</P>
    <P>The introduction of women into the Army will greatly improve it and I hope that there is a response from the women so as to fulfil the aims of the Minister. There is a very important place for women in the Army just as there is in other aspects of national life.  Sharing a constituency and a place on the Dublin Corporation with Deputy Lemass, as I do, I know that women bring a certain quality, a certain practicality into the business in which they are interested, which men do not.  Women have a more practical approach generally and I hope that the Army will benefit from this practicality and other undoubted qualities which are distinctly feminine.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister when replying to tell us what problems he foresees in the recruitment of women in the short term.  I hope that in six or eight months' time the Minister will not answer questions in this House by saying &ldquo;We intended to recruit women but we cannot do so because we have not the facilities&rdquo;. What target is the Minister setting in relation to the numbers to be recruited and the time for recruitment?  I wish the House and the people to be clear on what this Bill is doing.  It would be terribly wrong to raise the expectations of women, particularly students now contemplating a career, by telling them that there is a career in the Army if there is not.  I wish the Minister to assure us that there is a worth-while career for women in the Army and that they will be <Col N="510" /> able to get to the top in this Army as they do in other armies.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us what aspects of Army work will be prohibited for women and what posts they cannot expect to be appointed to?  What sort of work will they be excused from and why?  There was a case recently in England which has become known as the &ldquo;hair-do&rdquo; case where women were exempted from certain work in a nuclear power station purely because their hairdo's would have been upset if they did this dirty shift.  These women were being paid more or less the same as men for otherwise similar work.  In the interests of equality I would like the Minister to tell me that there will be no exemptions from certain work for either men or women just because the work is dirty or traditionally male or female work. Naturally, there will be legitimate areas where it would be unreasonable and unfair to expect women to operate.  That should not be construed as discrimination but as a proper differentiation in relation to the different abilities of the sexes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on his political will and on the direction of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the rest of the Deputies, I will be brief.  Having being unable to listen to the Minister I hope I shall not ask questions he has already answered.  I am really interested in only one aspect of this and that is the way in which it will be possible to introduce women into an Army whose function really is to spend their lives learning how to kill other men cleverly.  I think we must disagree with Deputy Lemass; I do not think we will get that kind of equality&mdash;I do not know if she wants it&mdash;that is, the right to be become combatant within the Army.  I would not want it for them; I do not even want it for men.  I hope it will not be taken as some kind of chauvinism to say that.  I am glad to hear that the women will not be combatant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> I have little experience of these matters myself except in the Local Security Force many years ago and I should like to know how one makes certain that women will not be involved on the combatant side.  If one has a small corps, a women's service corps, it clearly means they are not getting equality because they will only get the opportunity for promotion within that small corps.  On the other hand, if they are to be seconded to different sectors of the Army it will be on the administrative side, in telecommunications, clerical and recreational duties, truck driving and ambulance driving and all types of jobs which are the components of the fighting unit.  What is their position in that sort of dilemma?  Suppose they are in the Lebanon with a combatant patrol driving trucks, jeeps or ambulances?  Will they be unarmed?  Will they have the same status as nurses and doctors in the Army?  Is the Minister happy that they should find themselves in this type of situation where they will be shot at?  Attempts will be made to kill them presumably if they are working in a supportive role in a fighting unit.  In the process of the fighting unit discharging its function of killing other people as cleverly as it can and the Women's Corps members are acting in telecommunications, passing orders and so on, one cannot expect they will not be shot at and perhaps be wounded and killed. They are not able to fire back; apparently we do not want them as combatants. How does one deal with that situation?</P>
    <P>Or, are they not going to the front line?  If that is so, I do not think we will achieve what Deputy Lemass suggests, total equality within the service.  They will be restricted to headquarters staff duties, office work and catering and all kinds of participation in the component sections of the Army service.  If they are to be restricted to a corps which will do duties which will relieve men to become combatants, what is the line between combatant responsibility and non-combatant responsibility?  Do they go into action at all?  If they do, are they armed <Col N="512" /> and as regards prisoner of war status&mdash;it could easily happen&mdash;what is their position in relation to the Geneva convention.  Have they exactly the same status as any other combatant in the Defence Forces?</P>
    <P>I am not a great lover of any kind of army.  Fortunately, ours happens to be a defensive and not an imperialist force, a force we maintain for our own defence; and in its assistance to the United Nations it has done very fine work of which we are all proud.  If we must engage in discussion of the extension of women's role into Army service I should like to be sure that we have given thought to what the final implication could be for women who join the Army.  Leaving aside the colourful advertisements, which are always attractive and are obviously light years removed from what goes in wartime, I should like to be sure that the girls who join the forces will not feel that they are on the way to Moscow for the Olympics and that they might in fact find themselves in the desert being shelled by combatants in the Lebanon or in the Congo or in any of the dreadful fighting where our troops were involved and where they distinguished themselves. It would be misleading to women to recruit them into an Army whose job essentially is defending its country and which has to fight and kill or, even if it means the other position of joining a United Nations peace keeping force, it could be treated by people who do not accept that role for it as simply a number of human beings who have to be shot, wounded and killed as quickly as possible. What is the women's position in such a situation?</P>

      <P>In case Deputy Lemass should remain horrified, I did not say that the Women's Corps should be recruited to do kitchen work or cooking.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who have spoken. All of them have supported the Bill and I am grateful for that and I am also grateful to each of the political parties for their support in relation to this proposal.  Some questions have been raised in the debate and I shall attempt to give some information in reply to them.  At the outset, I should like to emphasise&mdash;and I ask Deputies to bear it in mind at all times when dealing with this change in the structure of the Defence Forces&mdash;that it is not the intention that women would be recruited to undertake female orientated tasks.  I must continue to stress that point.  In the discussion it did appear in regard to some Deputies&mdash;I think Deputy Creed will see this when he reads the record&mdash;that the impression he created was that he thinks some of the tasks that are at present being performed by men are a waste of the men's time and that it would be better if these tasks were performed by women.  He listed a series of such tasks&mdash;housekeeping, waiting, orderly work, office work, cooking and canteen work and so on.  I ask him to break out of the mould in which he seems to be gripped, that women can only perform such types of tasks.  It is my firm intention to integrate women into the Irish Army as far as practicable. Their training will be akin to the training courses already laid down for men enlisting as recruits and cadets.  As far as practicable, I intend to follow courses that have been tried and have already succeeded in bringing our soldiers to a degree of perfection in their profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was greatly disturbed by a lot of the comments of Deputy Creed because the impression he gave was that pay, food and accommodation were bad in the Defence Forces.  That is not true and it does not help a recruiting campaign to have a spokesman for a political party conveying the wrong impression about conditions.  I am not saying that everything is perfect within the Defence <Col N="514" /> Forces or that there is not room for improvement but we must be fair and just in our comments.  The rates of pay in the Army have been improved substantially in the past two years and they compare favourably with remuneration in outside employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Work is going on to improve quarters in the various Army barracks.  I hope Deputy Creed will avail of an invitation which was extended to his predecessor, Deputy White, when he was spokesman on Defence for his party, to visit some of the barracks to see the conditions that exist in them.  To say that the food is bad is a terrible indictment of the Defence Forces, particularly when it is not true.  The daily menu put up for the men in any barracks is first class.  A wide choice of wellcooked food is available and the best possible conditions exist in the canteens. Deputy Creed's image of the Army is one which he recollects from the dim and distant past and is not a true reflection of the conditions available for our men in today's Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could spend quite a long time setting out the role of women in the Army, the posts they will fill and the conditions that will apply to the jobs they will undertake and the methods of training but I did not want to delay the House giving such details.  I should like to inform Deputy Creed that great care has been taken to provide for all known eventualities before women are accepted into the Defence Forces.  Preparations have been made for their accommodation, uniform, and the tasks they will be asked to undertake.  There is no question of this having been approached in a lackadaisical manner.  I should like to give the House an idea of the number it is proposed to recruit and the type of employment they will be engaged in. Members of the Women's Service Corps will normally be employed in existing appointments of a suitable nature in various units or formations.  In other words a lot of positions that will be filled by women already exist in the Defence <Col N="515" /> Forces.  In some cases those positions are already occupied by men and it is the intention that some of those will be occupied by women members later.</P>
    <P>Initially, employment locations will include Army Headquarters, command headquarters and similar places throughout the country.  In a number of barracks in each command area posts will be allocated for members of the Women's Service Corps.  As I stated earlier, women will not have a combatant role and will not be employed on duties of a security operational nature under arms, that should answer the query posed by Deputy Browne with regard to the role of women and the possibility of them being involved in dangerous situations.  Deputy Mitchell asked me to outline the tasks that women would not be involved in. Globally it can be stated that duties of a security operational nature which are at present performed by men under arms will not be performed by women. However, the women will be given training in the use of small arms such as pistols, rifles or submachine guns.  To avoid disruption and possible resentment in the case of male members of the PDF it is desirable that the employment of women be phased in on a gradual basis. Deputy Mitchell was anxious to know if he would be in order in asking in six months' time if the 270 women it is proposed to take on had been recruited. Recruitment will take time and it will be a question of phasing them in.  Initially, it is proposed to appoint two officers who, after a short period of training, will be responsible for the training of female cadets and recruits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the women carry small arms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but they will be trained in their use.  Initially, the number recruited will be small.  I should like to tell the House that 233 existing appointments for non-commissioned personnel and 39 for officers have been earmarked as suitable for women.  An additional six <Col N="516" /> new officers and one NCO appointment will be required for administration.  The only addition to the existing establishment within the force is the creation of six new posts for officers and one new NCO post.  The 279 appointments will be allocated throughout the commands along the following lines: in the Eastern Command, which includes Army Headquarters and the Air Corps, 116; in the Curragh Command, 84; in the Southern Command, 39 and in the Western Command, 40.  The six new officer appointments consist of a director, a training officer and four command welfare officers. While the existing officer appointments which have been earmarked as suitable for women are mainly in the supply and administration areas, in non-operational units, the director of the Women's Service Corps, who will be based at Army Headquarters, will hold the rank of commandant. The lady training officer in the Women's Service Corps will hold the rank of captain.</P>
      <P>The occupations in which the non-commissioned personnel will be employed initially are: drivers, military police, clerks, printers, radio operators, line-projectionists, grooms in the equitation school, photographers, air traffic controllers, telegraphists and many other occupations at present occupied by male service personnel.  In fact, there are more than 100 different types of employment within the Defence Forces and 80 per cent of them are suitable for members of the Women's Service Corps.  Of the 279 women it is intended to recruit into the force 45 will be officers, 103 NCOs and 131 privates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to numbers and recruiting I should like to state that I do not expect that there will be any great difficulty in filling the establishment number for the Women's Service Corps in view of the huge response there has been to the announcement about the creation of the corps.  We could fill three times the establishment number of 279 from the number of inquiries we have received.  I hope that will allay Deputy Mitchell's fears in regard to the possibility of not succeeding in attracting women to join <Col N="517" /> the force.  Already there has been a great interest expressed in it.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised the question of pay. All I can say is that we are trying to integrate women into the force.  The pay will be exactly the same as is available to the male members of the Permanent Defence Force according to rank and the length of service.  There will be no discrimination in regard to basic pay. Because women will not be involved in security type duties they would not therefore qualify for the special security allowances payable in those circumstances. Outside of that, the basic pay will be exactly the same.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of uniform referred to by Deputy Creed, it is intended that it will be as attractive as possible. Some care has been taken in seeking to have a uniform designed that will be attractive to the ladies and an adequate range of pieces of clothing and equipment will be included in the official issue and will, of course, include slacks as well as a skirt and a combination of other items going to present a nice, neatly dressed lady member of the Irish Army.</P>
    <P>The educational requirements were raised here also.  Here again, because of our desire to have no distinction or discrimination and to seek to achieve as closely as we can an integrated system between the women and men in the force, the educational requirements will be exactly the same.  With the initial intake of officers there may be a need&mdash;because of the requirement of getting in officers of a certain calibre quickly to take up the more senior rank appointments&mdash;to have special requirements at the initial stage.  But once the corps is in full operation there will be no difference in the educational requirements for women cadets from those obtaining at present for male cadets, that is, the university entrance standard, five subjects, of which one must be maths or applied maths on the one hand and English or Irish on the other.</P>
    <P>I was asked if we had made financial provision for the introduction of the Women's Service Corps.  Already quite an amount of work has been undertaken <Col N="518" /> in regard to the provision of accommodation. Certain works have been undertaken at the Curragh and it is proposed to construct new accommodation there for the Women's Service Corps.  I hope work on that will commence next year.  In the meantime changes have been taking place.  In each command where posts have been identified which it is intended will be filled by members of the Women's Service Corps the officers in charge have been asked to initiate programmes for the preparation of buildings to receive the women members and to make whatever changes are required.  I was asked if the women members will be located throughout the country: they will.  I do not know whether the House wants me to go down through all the barracks at which they will be located.  The House can take it that each command will have women in the numbers I have already given.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed raised a query on section 5.  He asked if other Ministers in other Departments had the power that the Minister for Defence has in regard to making certain deductions from the pay of members of the force in the event of their deserting or abandoning their families.  The answer to that is that this applies in the Defence Forces because people who enlist in the Defence Forces come under a military legal code to which persons in other State Departments or in other State employment would not be subjected.  There is a commitment to give service for a fixed period on enlistment, the shortest period being three years.  Because of the exigencies of the type of service being given it has been a feature of military life that some of those who enlist may not desire to complete the period and may wish to avoid legal responsibilities into which they had entered and in deserting the Army in many cases they also deserted their families. Therefore it was a humanitarian measure to enable the Minister to make a decision, on compassionate grounds, that in fact pay would be paid to families of such people in certain cases.  Of course, in more recent times&mdash;in 1976&mdash;the Family Law (Maintenance of the Spouses and Children) Act makes provision <Col N="519" /> in similar circumstances for deductions to be made on a court order.  The occasion has not arisen very often when the provisions of section 99 of the 1954 Act have been actually operated by the Minister.  Naturally, we now give precedence to the 1976 Act, and section 98 of the 1954 Act enables the Minister to make deductions arising out of a court order under the 1976 Act.  Therefore, the answer to Deputy Creed's question is no, other Ministers do not have the power the Minister for Defence has in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy B. Desmond stated that most modern, conventional armies do have a women's corps or have women serving as soldiers in their armies.  The House might be interested to know of some of our colleagues in the EEC who have already introduced women into their armies. In Belgium 2.96 per cent of their defence forces are women members; the Netherlands has .9 per cent; Denmark 1.25 per cent; in France it is 2.38 per cent if the conscripts are taken into account; and in Britain it is 5.2 per cent, which is in fact 15,000.  Our proposals would mean that about 2.5 per cent of the force would consist of women.  It is interesting to note that two remaining EEC countries, Italy and Luxembourg, have not yet introduced women into their armies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond asked me when the initial enlistment would take place.  I have already indicated that as soon as the Bill becomes law steps will be taken to appoint two officers, the director and training officer, and from then on all steps will be taken to proceed with the initial enlistment of recruits, which will be approximately 50, comprising the first Women's Service Corps training class.  After the appointment of the two initial senior officers it will be the intention to appoint four female cadets and they will form the initial officers corps.</P>
    <P>Some provision, not a lot, has been made in this year's Estimates.  Some of it has already been expended in regard to accommodation and work has <Col N="520" /> proceeded in other areas in preparation for the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the old married quarters, to the poor state of the married quarters in certain places and indeed even of the billets.  I would agree with him that there are&mdash;and I have often said this publicly&mdash;married quarters in or attached to barracks which are far from being suitable.  As the House is already aware, I have initiated a programme to replace all the existing unsuitable married quarters.  That programme is under way but it will take some time before all of those unsuitable married quarters are either demolished or completely renovated.  It is a programme which is being tackled vigorously and after a few years I hope nobody will be able to point the finger at unsuitable accommodation.  Quite a lot has been done already.  The same applies to billet accommodation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power raised an interesting question with regard to whether women would be now entitled to join the FCA. The Bill before the House does enable the enlistment of women into the reserve force, An Fórsa Cosanta Átiúil.  It is not my intention at this time to enlist women into the FCA.  The only intention on the passing of the Bill is to enlist women into the permanent force.  This is a new step. It will cause a lot of problems in itself which we will be happy to tackle, and the House will agree that it would be unreasonable to proceed with bringing women into the reserve force before we bring them into the permanent force. That is the course of action I propose to take.  At some future time it will be possible to make a policy decision to enlist women into the FCA if that is decided at the time.  This legislation enables that to be done.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked whether, when the lady cadets commence training, they will qualify for participation in the university training programme.  At the risk of repeating myself, the women will be dealt with exactly the same as men.  Obviously, in regard to cadet training it is the intention when the scheme is in operation fully that those women who <Col N="521" /> are granted cadetships in the Army would have the same facilities with regard to third-level education as is available at present for the male cadets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly raised the question about the recruitment of married women.  Maybe he was not here at the start of the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not.  I apologise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when I mentioned that it was envisaged that married women would be able to enlist in the Defence Forces.  As regard cadets, the same rule would apply to women as already applies in the case of cadets, that those awarded cadetships cannot be married, but there is no bar to married women being enlisted in the permanent force as ordinary recruits.  Then he raised the question whether, because of their membership of the Defence Forces, and because they have a husband and children they would qualify for housing. All I can say in answer to that is that they would qualify in the same way as any other member of the Defence Forces.  Only a very limited number of married quarters are available, at any rate at present, and the system of allocating married quarters need not necessarily be changed to any great extent because of the introduction of women.  It would be a matter in each case for the commanding officer to decide from the applicants and from whatever married quarters became vacant to whom he should allocate them. There would be no bar on him giving them to a married soldier who would be bringing in her own family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of overseas duty, again there would not be any regulations debarring women from participating in UN peace-keeping missions.  It has not been the practice for the UN to have female soldiers serving with UN missions except in a back-up role, but I would not see any great obstacle to it.  It raises the question, that Deputy Browne referred to in regard to our troops coming under fire in certain circumstances, what would be the position of a woman if <Col N="522" /> she was a driver and was in an area where she happened to come under fire. She would be in exactly the same position as her colleagues; she would have to take the best precautions that she could. She would not be in a combat role so obviously she would not be armed, but if she was travelling in a dangerous area obviously she would not be travelling on her own.  I am sure that her commanding officer would ensure that proper military tactics were applied in assigning tasks in an area where there was difficulty or a danger of the troops coming under attack from whatever source.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell said that the Bill was being opposed by the Army.  That is not fair to a body of men who have given very loyal service to this State since its foundation and who have responded readily to the calls that have been made upon them by successive Governments. In whatever situations, we have been served loyally by the men serving in the Defence Forces, by the Officer Corps and by the many hundreds of thousands of men who have been soldiers in the Irish Army.  To imply in a Dáil debate that this wonderful body of men in some way are kicking over the traces against a major change at this time and that they are battling against it, is to create a very strong impression and to state an untruth. I must put on record here the very great degree of co-operation which has been forthcoming to me as Minister in bringing forward this new proposal. Naturally it is a change.  It is a radical change as far as many of the members of the Forces who have served loyally for most of their lifetime in the Army are concerned.  They are being asked to work in an environment which naturally will be changed substantially.  They have accepted the proposal very readily and have done everything possible to facilitate the introduction of women into the Army.  The truth is that there is a great expectation of the day when the first lady to don an Irish Army uniform will parade in an Army barrack area. There will be a great welcome from her male colleagues.  It is completely wrong to state other than that.  This is not the first time that Deputy Mitchell has tried <Col N="523" /> to create the impression that this move is being done against the will of the Army, whatever that is.  I have always found that the Army has supported fully the Government of the day and the policies of the Government of the day in regard to matters that came into the sphere of responsibility of the Army, and this is one such matter where they have been very helpful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell asked what problems I saw in the short term in regard to recruiting.  In view of the response I feel that there will not be any great problem. If there is, it is unforeseen at this stage and I cannot give any clear answer to the Deputy's question other than that the interest that has been shown has been quite astonishing.  I expect that the establishment figure that has been laid down will be filled easily.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the types of question that have come up without going into too much detail, which one is tempted to do in a situation like this.  I hope that I have given the House some indication of my sincerity in regard to this matter and my determination to have it done in as efficient a manner as possible and particularly to ensure that equality is a factor in all decisions that will be made when women are side by side with men in the Defence Forces.  I have had an opportunity of seeing women members of other armies and have had a briefing on the type of training programmes that have been undertaken for women in cadet colleges which traditionally had been male.  The instructors and training officers there told me of the very high standard achieved by the women in these courses.  In many cases they had far surpassed their male colleagues.  Therefore, I am in no way daunted or in doubt about the ability of the women to perform to the very highest degree of excellence in a military role.</P>

      <P>£750 chun teach a fheabhsú,</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> Is le tithe nua arna dtosú i ndiaidh 26 Bealtaine 1977 a bhaineann an £2,000 agus baineann na deontais eile le hoibreacha arna dtosú i ndiaidh 31 Deireadh Fómhair 1977.  Is méaduithe móra iad uile ar na deontais a bhí i bhfeidhm cheana agus tá siad ar fáil d'iarratasóirí cáilithe gan aird ar an teacht isteach a bhíonn acu.  D'oibreacha lena mbaineann na deontais sin tá deireadh le deontais fhorlíontacha ó chomhairlí contae.  Tá deontais níos mó fós ar fáil do mhuintir na n-oileán Gaeltachta amach ón gcósta: 50 faoin gcéad breise anuas ar na deontais atá luaite agam.  Tá forálacha sa Bhille seo freisin do dheontais a bhí i bhfeidhm cheana ó 1 Meitheamh 1972 agus 1 Eanáir 1973 ar aghaidh.  Ní miste a lua go raibh an Coiste um Chuntais Phoiblí ag gearán nuair nár tugadh isteach na forálacha ina leith i bhfad níos luaithe. Tá dúil agam go mbeidh gach uile dhuine sásta leis an mBille cuimsitheach atá anois againn.</P>
    <P>D'fhonn deacrachtaí faoi mar a bhí i gceist ag an gCoiste um Chuntais Phoiblí a sheachaint feasta tá prionsabal úr amháin in alt 7 den Bhille seo: is é sin go bhféadfaidh Aire na Gaeltacha, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais, &ldquo;méid aon deontais is iníoctha faoi na hAchtanna a athrú ó am go ham le rialacháin.&rdquo;  Ar ndóigh, beidh aon rialacháin a dhéanfar le leagan faoi bhráid gach Tí den Oireachtas sa ghnáthshlí.</P>
    <P>Ón mbliain 1929 i leith tá Achtanna speisialta i bhfeidhm ar mhaithe le cúrsaí tithíochta sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Bhí géarghá leis an Acht bunaidh a ritheadh sa bhliain 1929 i ngeall ar an drochbhail a bhí ar thithíocht sna ceantair Ghaeltachta an t-am úd.  Le himeacht ama, ar ndóigh, tháinig an-fheabhas ar thithe sa Ghaeltacht le cabhair na ndeontas speisialta i gcaoi gur beag ceantar tuaithe eile sa tír anois ina bhfuil tithe níos fearr le feiceáil.</P>
    <P>Cabhair chun tithe nua a thógáil nó seantithe a fheabhsú a bhí le fáil i dtús báire faoi na hAchtanna ach cuireadh leis an raon deontas ó thráth go chéile&mdash;mar is léir ón liosta atá tugtha agam cheana.  Tuigimid uile an tábhacht <Col N="526" /> a bhaineann leis an turasóireacht do na ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Is féidir a rá gur sa Ghaeltacht atá cuid de na ceantair is áille sa tír.  Lena chois sin, ar ndóigh, is í an Ghaeilge atá mar ghnáth-theanga i gcuid mhaith de na ceantair sin.  Ní ionadh mar sin go mbeadh tarraingt mhór ar an nGaeltacht go háirithe ag cuairteoirí a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge. Mar léiriú air sin chuaigh níos mó ná 18,000 scoláire chun na Gaeltachta i mbliana le cabhair scéime eile de chuid na Roinne chun slacht a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge.  Is mór mar a chuidíonn na cuairteoirí sin le teacht isteach mhuintir na Gaeltachta ach, murach an obair atá déanta leis na blianta ar mhaithe le cúrsaí tithíochta, ní bheadh ar chumas na ndaoine freastal ar an líon sin cuairteoirí.</P>
    <P>Tá an obair thithíochta ag dul ar aghaidh i gcónaí.  Dá chomhartha sin cuireadh críoch le breis agus 2,000 teach nua le cúnamh faoi na hAchtanna ó thús na seachtóidí agus íocadh deontais ar mhaithe le hoibreacha feabhsúcháin, seomraí breise, seomraí folctha, saoráidí sláintíochta i dtimpeall 10,000 cás eile.  Ó thárla gur i mBéarla a ritheadh an tAcht bunaidh leathchéad bliain ó shin is i mBéarla atá an Bille seo le rith freisin. Mar áis do Theachtaí sa díospóireacht seo, áfach, tá leagan Gaeilge den Bhille curtha timpeall chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Is ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta agus le leas na Gaeilge atá cabhair bhreise le fáil faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht).  Is deimhin liom go dtuigeann Teachtaí ar gach taobh den Teach an gá atá leis an gcabhair bhreise sin.  Tá dúil agam, dá bhrí sin, go nglacfar go fonnmhar leis an mBille atá á mholadh anois agam don Dáil.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir nár mhiste a lua ag an bpointe seo go mbeidh cúpla leasú le moladh agam ar Chéim an Choiste d'fhonn cur leis an gcúnamh atá ar fáil go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Is é atá i gceist sa chéad leasú ná cumhacht a fháil le go bhféadfaí deontas a thabhairt chun foirgneamh a oiriúnú mar bhrú.  Tá cumhacht sna hAchtanna le fiche bliain anuas chun deontas a thabhairt le &ldquo;brú a thógáil agus a <Col N="527" /> throscánú&rdquo; ach, más main le dream iontaofa foirgneamh atá ann cheana a oiriúnú mar bhrú, ní thig linn teacht i gcabhair orthu.  Cheal cumhachta den chineál atá luaite agam ní raibh dul as againn ach diúltú d'iarratas ó eagras deonach na gCampaí Oibre a bhíonn ag saothrú ar Oileán Chléire, Co.  Chorcaí, bliain i ndiaidh bliana agus Coláiste Gaeilge na gCampaí Oibre á reachtáil agus oibreacha eile á ndéanamh acu ar mhaithe leis an bpobal ar an oileán.  Is mór agam an obair a bhíonn ar siúl ag an dream díograiseach sin agus ba mhaith liom bheith in ann géilleadh don iarratas uathu agus d'aon iarratas eile dá leithéid a thiocfadh ar aghaidh.  Beidh ar mo chumas é sin a dhéanamh má ghlactar leis an leasú a bheidh á mholadh agam.</P>
    <P>Baineann an dara leasú le deontas cúlchoire nó gléas eile a dhófaidh crua-bhreosla a chur isteach d'fhonn uisce te a sholáthar&mdash;feabhsúchán atá an-tábhachtach na laethanta seo, go háirithe dá mbeifí ag brath ar ola.  Is amhlaidh atá cosc reachtúil ar dheontas chun na críche sin dá mbeadh deontas eile&mdash;deontas feabhsúcháin nó deontas tógála&mdash;íoctha le seacht mbliana anuas: beidh leasú á mholadh agam chun an cosc sin a chur as feidhm i gcaoi go bhféadfar brostú leis na háiseanna atá luaite agam.  Tá na leasuithe dréachtaithe agus, a luaithe a ghlacfar leis an Dara Céim den Bhille, cuirfear timpeall iad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is mian liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.  Faoi mar atá fhios ag an teach, rud ar bith a chuireann cúis na Gaeltachta chun cinn agus a chabhraíonn leis an nGaeltacht, an beagán Gaeltachta atá fágtha againn, is breá linn é agus ní chuirfímid cosc ná bac dá laghad ina bhealach.  Níl ach dhá phointe sa mBille seo agus ba mhaith liom iad a lua sa Teach seo inniu, pointí beaga iad agus níl amhras orm ach go mbeidh an tAire in ann freagra cuí a thabhairt orthu.  Éiríonn an chéad cheist as Alt 2 (4).  Sa tiontú oifigiúil Gaeilge séard atá ann ná an giota seo a leanas:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gcás ar deimhin leis an Aire nach <Col N="528" /> féidir le hiarratasóir atá i dteideal deontas tógála a fháil faoi alt 3 (1) nó 3 (7) (a cuireadh isteach le hAcht 1959) d'Acht 1929 teach cónaithe a thógáil.</P>
    <P>Anois ba mhaith liom a fhiafraí den Aire cad is éagumas ann san Alt seo?  Cad a chiallaíonn gan iarratasóir a bheith in ann nó &ldquo;nach féidir leis&rdquo; teach dá leithéid seo a thógáil?  An éagumas eacnamaíoch atá i gceist ag an Aire?  Nó éagumas a bhaineann le staid na háite, leis an láithreán, a éiríonn as croth an láithreáin, nach bhfuil sé oiriúnach le teach dá leithéid a thógáil?&mdash;mar ba chóir dúinn breathnú air seo, nach bhfuil i gceist againn ach teach an-bheag ar fad, ar éigean a d'fhéadfaí bothán a thabhairt air.  Sé an t-íos-achar atá leagtha síos ag an Aire don ghnáth-theach faoin bhforáileamh seo ná dhá scór méadar cearnach.  Anois is ionann sin agus a rá gurb é an teach atá i gceist ag an Aire, gurb é an méid a bheadh ag an teach sin 24 troigh ar fhaid, abraimís, agus 15 throigh ar leithead.  Anois teach an-bheag ar fad é sin, agus ba mhaith liom a fháil amach ón Aire cén saghas iarratasóir atá ar intinn aige nach bhféadfaidh teach den méid sin a thógáil. Arb é bochtanas an iarratasóra atá i gceist nó arb é croth an láithreáin atá i gceist a ligfidh amach an t-iarratasóir ó smacht an fhórailimh sin?</P>
    <P>An darna pointe, éirionn sé as alt 3 (2).  Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach ón Aire mar gheall ar na suimeanna atá luaite aige tríd síos sa bhfo-alt seo, cad faoi dhaoine lenar n-íocadh deontais cheana faoi na sean-Achtanna.  An bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Aire breis deontais a thabhairt dóibh anois i ngeall ar an obair chéanna?  An bhfuil sé chun breis deontais a thabhairt fiú amháin do na daoine a fuair deontais uaidh cheana féin, agus, b'fhéidir, a dhíol a gcuid tithe idir an dá linn?  agus má tá, an bhfuil an tAire cinnte gurb é is cóir a dhéanamh ná an breis deontais a thabhairt don iarratasóir tosaigh nó don té atá i seilbh an tí i láthair na huaire?  B'fhéidir nár thuig mé i gceart an tAire agus an Bille á thabhairt isteach aige, ach táimid ag labhairt faoi scéim a bhaineann le tithe a <Col N="529" /> tógadh le seacht mbliana anuas, cuid acu, agus is féidir linn a bheith cinnte gur íocadh deontas de chineál eicínt le roinnt mhaith de na hiarratasóirí sin, agus, má tá ceart acu anois breis deontais a fháil, an bhfuil an tAire le dul ag tabhairt breis deontais dóibh nó cé leis a bhfuil sé ag dul an breis deontais a íoc?</P>
    <P>Sin an méid ar cás liom a rá faoin mBille seo seachas fáilte a chur roimhe. Tugaim faoi deara ag éirí as alt 6 (2) nach raibh sé de dhánacht ag an Aire a oileán cónaithe fhéin a chur faoi scathán an Achta seo, ach go bhfuil Acaill gearrtha amach toisc an blúirín bóthair a nascann Acaill leis an mórthír.  Ach cibé ar bith, níl fhios agam arb é ar chuir an tAire faoi deara nach raibh Acaill istigh sa mBille seo chor ar bith toisc an bóthar, ach má bhí sé sin i gceist aige, más d'aon-ghnó a chuir sé an foráileamh seo isteach caithfidh mé a admháil go bhfuil creidiuint mhór ag dul dó faoina chalmacht.</P>
    <P>Ach cibé ar bith, fáiltím athuair roimh an mBille seo.  Tá súil agam go rachfaidh sé chun tairbhe na Gaeltachta, agus cibé bluirin pobail atá fágtha ann go bhféadfaí Gaeltacht nó cainteoirí dúchais a thabhairt orthu.  Tá faitíos orm go bhfuil achar an cheantair seo nó na gceanntracha sin ag maolú in aghaidh an lae, agus nach bhfuil b'fhéidir oiread agus deich míle cearnach áit ar bith in Éirinn a bhfeadfaí Gaeltacht ceart a thabhairt air.  Fiú amháin na daoine a tógadh le Gaeilge iad fhéin tá siad ag múineadh Béarla dá gclann, go díreach mar a rinne muintir na tíre seo céad bliain agus dhá chéad bliain ó shoin, toisc an oiread sin náire a bheith orthu mar gheall ar a dteanga dhúchais fhéin, agus toisc go bhfacthas dóibh go raibh baint eicínt idir an Ghaeilge agus bochtanas, aineolas agus an iargúltacht agus toisc go bhfacthas dóibh go raibh bua an domhain mhóir ag dul do lucht an Bhéarla.  Ní ar an Aire a chuirim an locht faoi sin ach is orainn go léir a luíonn an locht faoin rud seo.  Is trua an scéal i ngeall ar mhaolú na Gaeltachta agus níl mé cinnte an rachaidh an Billín seo mórán chun tairbhe don phíosa beag Gaeltachta atá fágtha, ach tá súil agam go rachfaidh, agus má théann fiú amháin <Col N="530" /> an beagán chun tairbhe na gceantracha sin tá obair mhaith lae déanta ag an Aire inniu.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin fáilte a chuir roimh an Bille seo.  Tá sé deireanach ach tá sé anseo anois agus is cóir duinn fáilte a chur roimhe.  As the Minister has said, it is basically a document which ratifies the scheme which has been in operation for some time.  The fault is not his that it has been so long in coming before us.  It is the fault of a system and range of political priorities which tend to put the Gaeltacht a bit further down the list than many other things.  I was interested to hear the Minister say that he will introduce some amendments to clarify certain points on Committee Stage.  It is not a contentious Bill and from a statutory housekeeping point of view it is appropriate that we should deal with it speedily.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask a question in relation to the grants that are paid for the construction of holiday houses in the Gaeltacht.  It is very clear that this form of construction in the Gaeltacht is one that has been growing in recent years and, while this has been welcomed on the one hand, it has created problems on the other.  It is sad to see&mdash;I make no party point on this because it has happened under every administration&mdash;the Gaeltacht emptying slowly in some areas of its permanent residences and giving place to houses which are occupied only on a transitory basis by people who are going to the Gaeltacht on holiday.  The last thing in the world I should suggest is that people should not go to the Gaeltacht on their holidays.  However the special nature of the Gaeltacht would seem to urge on any Government a scheme of grants which should place the stress on the kind of holiday that would enable such people to integrate themselves more closely into the Gaeltacht and less on the kind of holiday which would encourage them to act almost as an outsider or <i>voyeur</i> within the Gaeltacht situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must look at the scheme of grants <Col N="531" /> for houses in the Gaeltacht, especially for those who do not live there and cannot be expected to live there, to see whether or not it might in some way be facilitating the social and linguistic changes of which the Minister and successive Governments have been aware and about which they have not been able to do as much as they would have liked to.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he has considered the structure of the grants system in this Bill with a view to, if not solving the problem, at least alleviating the social pressures that too much of the wrong kind of building can have in specific Gaeltacht areas. With that reservation, I welcome the Bill.</P>

Is mian liom an tAire a mholadh as breis airgid agus árdú deontas a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta chun tithe nua a thógáil, chun seomraí breise a thógáil agus chun seallaí saoire a chur ar fáil.  Tá áthas orm leis go rachaidh an Bille seo chun tairbhe do mhuintir na n-oileán atá in a nGaeltachtaí.  Seo an chéad iarracht a deineadh taobh istigh de chúig bliain chun na deontais sa Ghaeltacht a ardú i leith tithe, seallaí agus seomraí.  Níor deineadh faic sa cheantar sin nuair a bhí an Comhrialtas i gcomhacht in ainneoin go ndearna an tAire a bhí ann a lán turasanna don Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Cabhróidh an Bille seo leis an tionscal togála agus leis an tionscal turasóireachta chomh maith.  Cuirfidh sé breis jobanna ar fáil sa dá cheantar sin.  Taobh amuigh de tionscal teallaigh, is dóigh liom gurb é tionscal na turasóireachta an tionscal is oiriúnaí don Ghaeltacht, agus ní féidir tionscal na turasóireachta a leathnú gan breis tithe agus breis seomraí a chur ar fáil.  Tiocfaidh siad sin go léir as an mBille seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anuraidh do thriail 19,000 ar an nGaeltacht, méadú 30 faoin gcéad.  Is é an gearán is mó a bhí ag túismitheoirí ná nach raibh na seomraí mór go leor agus fiú amháin nach raibh dóthain seomraí ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí.  Cuirfidh an Bille seo deireadh leis sin.  Is dóigh liom gur <Col N="532" /> céim mhór ar aghaidh é £810 deontas a bheith ann do thrí seomraí do chuairteoirí, taobh amuigh de seomraí breise do mhuintir an tí féin.  Tá mé cinnte go dtiocfaidh toradh céatach as an mBille seo don tionscal turasóireachta agus cruthú é de dháiríreacht an Aire chun dul chun cinn na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta taobh amuigh de dhul chun cinn sóisialta sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Bille gearr é agus, mar adúirt na Teachtaí eile, is beag eile atá le rá faoi ach rath Dé a ghuí ar an Aire agus ar an obair atá le déanamh aige.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis na Teachtaí as ucht an fháiltiú a chuir siad roimh an mBille seo.  Mar a dúirt mé, níl ann ach rud atá ar siúl againn cheana a chur ar bhonn reachtúil.  Tá na deontais á n-íoc cheana agu nílimid ach ag iarraidh cúrsaí a chur i gceart ionas go mbeimid in ann an t-airgead sin a thabhairt go dleathach.</P>
      <P>Bhí cúpla pointe ag an Teachta Kelly ar alt 2 (4).  Séard atá i gceist ansin, áit a bhfuil eisceacht i leith seanduine a dteastódh teach beag uaidh, go dtiocfaí i gcabhair air.  Ní rud é a mbeimid ag iarraidh a chur chun tosaigh nó a mholadh.  Is i gcás mar sin a bhainfear úsáid as a leithéid sin, is é sin, eisceacht a dhéanamh má tá seanduine go dteastaíonn cúpla seomra uaidh.</P>

      <P>Tá rud amháin eile a chuidíonn leis an Roinn sna cásanna sin, go mbíonn an deontas laghdaithe dá réir.  Ní bheidh an £2,000 le fáil i <Col N="533" /> gcásanna mar sin, agus sílim ar an gcaoi sin arís go bhfuil confidence, mar a déarfa, ag an Roinn san tslí a dtig leo an Bille a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>

      <P>Luaigh an Teachta Horgan tithe a thógtar sa Ghaeltacht agus daoine ag teacht ón taobh amuigh le tithe a thógáil agus an cineál a thógann siad.  Níl mé rochinnte an raibh sé i gceist aige go raibh deontais le fáil ag na daoine sin nó an raibh sé ag cur síos ar ghnáth thógáil tithe.</P>

      <P>Sa chéad áit, is ag an gcomhairle contae atá cead nó deis pleanála a thabhairt do dhaoine a théann isteach chun teach a thógáil.  Maidir le deontais do stróinséirí, tá riail ann go gcaithfidh duine bheith ina chónaí sa Ghaeltacht sular dtig leis deontas a fháil agus táimid dian go leor maidir le n-iocaíocht na ndeontas sin, fiú amháin tá daoine ón Ghaeltacht i Sasana nó i mBaile Atha Cliath agus iad ag obair agus ag iarraidh airgead a chur le chéile chun teach a thógáil, agus más rud é nach bhfuil siad sa Ghaeltacht féin nuair a chuireann siad an t-iarratas isteach diúltaíonn an Roinn deontas dá leithéidí sin agus, chomh maith le sin, mé féin mar Aire, bím ag caint le oifigigh na Roinne mar gheall ar chomh dian is a bhíonn siad i gcúrsaí mar sin.</P>
      <P>Tá an tAcht ann agus caithimid claoi leis an Acht agus é a chur i bhfeidhm.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh sé sin soiléir.  Is cuma an Gaeilgeoirí nó cén cumas Gaeilge atá acu, caithfidh na daoine, chun bheith sa teideal deontas a fháil, bheith ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht nuair a chuireann siad isteach an t-iarratas.</P>

      <P>Baineann an rud céanna leo.  Tá mé cinnte go nglacfar go fonnmhar leis na deontais seo.  Is fíor, mar a dúirt an Teachta Kelly, go bhfuil laghdú ag teacht ar na Gaeltachtaí, ach sílim, le cuidiú dos na daoine atá sna Gaeltachtaí agus le deontais den chineál seo, go mb'fhéidir go gcuirfidh sé fonn ar dhaoine níos mó aird a thabhairt ar an nGaeilge agus í a chaomhnú agus a chosaint.  Sin an fáth go bhfuil deontais bhreise le fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta, agus ba mhór an trua go dtabharfaidís cúl don Ghaeilge agus do na buntáistí seo, buntáiste na Gaeilge féin agus an saibhreas atá ann, agus go ndéanfaidís faillí sna cúrsaí sin.</P>
      <P>Tá mé buíoch don Teachta Kelly agus na Teachtaí eile.  Is maith an rud é, ó bhíos ag lua go poiblí go bhfuil meath ag teacht ar na Gaeltachtaí, go dtuigfimís go bhfuil dualgas orainn cuidiú leis na daoine atá sna Gaeltachtaí, a chur ina luí orthu go bhfuil oighreacht acu gur ceart doibh a chaomhnú agus a chosaint.  Sin an rud atá i gceist anseo san chuidiú breise atá le fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>Na Rialacháin um Thoghcháin Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979,</P>
      <P>ar leagadh cóip díobh ina ndréacht faoi bhráid Dháil Éireann an 16 Deireadh Fómhair, 1979.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Údarás na Gaeltachta Elections Regulations, 1979,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Regulations in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 16th October, 1979.</P>
      <P>Ó tharla gur gá rún mar sin a rith tá deis eile ag an Teach chun ceist na dtoghchán d'Údarás na Gaeltachta a phlé faoi mar a mhínigh mé nuair a bhí an Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta os comhair na Dála.  Is amhlaidh is mian liom brostú ar aghaidh anois leis na socruithe agus an chéad toghchán a chur ar siúl i mí na Nollag.  Go dtí go mbeidh an rún seo rite, áfach,&mdash;agus ceann eile dá leithéid rite ag an Seanad&mdash;agus na Rialacháin féin déanta agam, ní thig liom lá a cheapadh don toghchán.</P>
      <P>Is cuimhin le Teachtaí go mbeidh na limistéir oifigiúla Ghaeltachta roinnte i dtrí thoghlach:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Gaeltacht Dhún na nGall a thoghfaidh beirt,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;Gaeltacht na Gaillimhe, Mhaigh Eo agus na Mí a thoghfaidh triúr, agus <Col N="537" />&mdash;Gaeltacht Chiarraí, Chorcaí agus Phort Láirge a thoghfaidh beirt.</P>
    <P>Ach na comhaltaí sin&mdash;seachtar acu &mdash;a bheith tofa beidh seisear eile le ceapadh agus lá le hainmniú chun an tÚdarás a bhunú agus Gaeltarra Éireann a dhíscaoileadh.  Ar an tuiscint go mbeidh an toghchán ann i mí na Nollag is é an cuspóir atá agamsa ná an tÚdarás a bhunú ar 1 Eanáir 1980.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na dréacht-Rialacháin atá faoi bhráid na Dála anois is amhlaidh atá siad bunaithe cuid mhór ar na Rialacháin um Thoghcháin Áitiúla.  Is cuimhin le Teachtaí gur ritheadh an tAcht um Údarás na Gaeltachta i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla agus tá beartaithe agam na Rialacháin seo a dhéanamh sa dá theanga chomh maith. Tabharfar faoi deara, áfach, gur i nGaeilge amháin a bheidh na foirmeacha sa Sceideal a ghabhann leis na Rialacháin&mdash;páipéar ainmniúcháin, páipéar ballóide agus cárta vótaíochta. Feicfear freisin nach bhfuil i gceist ainm aon pháirtí polaitíochta a thaispeáint ar an bpáipéar ainmniúcháin ná ar an bpáipéar ballóide.  Is amhlaidh a mheastar gurbh fhearr gan cúrsaí polaitíochta a tharraingt isteach i ngnóthaí an Údaráis.  Tá dúil agamsa go nglacfaidh pobal na Gaeltachta go fonnmhar leis an deis a bheidh acu go luath anois chun ionadaithe cumasacha a thoghadh ar an Údarás.</P>
    <P>Is ar Rúnaithe na gComhairlí Contae sna contaetha Gaeltachta a bheimid ag brath chun na socruithe don toghchán a dhéanamh ar an láthair agus is iad atá le bheith mar chinn chomhairimh agus leas-chinn chomhairimh.  Bhí cruinniú agam leo agus tá na réamhullmhúcháin ag dul ar aghaidh cheana féin ar bhonn neamhfhoirmiúil.  Is mór agam a gcomhoibriú agus is mian liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl dóibh go poiblí.</P>
    <P>Beidh na costais údaraithe a bhainfidh leis an toghchán le seasamh ag mo Roinnse agus, chun na críche sin, beidh Meastachán Forlíontach le tabhairt isteach sa Dáil agam.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir dom a mhíniú go ndearnadh roinnt mionleasuithe sa dréacht de na Rialacháin a cuireadh timpeall ar dtús <Col N="538" /> agus gurb é an dréacht a leagadh faoi bhráid na Dála ar an 16 Deireadh Fómhair atá le ceadú anois.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Ó tharla go bhfuil Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta againn anois agus go bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltacha á bhunu chun áit, Ghaeltarra Éireann a ghlacadh, cé nach morán tábhachta eile a bhéas ag an Údarás Gaeltachta taréis an rí-rá go léir le deich bliana anuas, cé nach mbeidh smacht ar bith ag an Údarás seo ar chursaí pleanála, ná cúrsaí oideachais ná cúrsaí ar bith eile seachas na cúrsaí a bhí faoi chúram Ghaeltarra Éireann&mdash;d'ainneoin sin go léir, caithfimid rialacháin a dhéanamh anois d'fhonn udarás a cheapadh, d'fhonn an seisear nó an seachtar comhalta tofa den Údaráis a thoghadh.</P>
      <P>Ní dhéanfaidh an Teach dearmad de, go bhfuil 13 daoine ar an Údarás seo, an Cathaoirleach agus cúigear eile a ainmneofar ag an Aire agus seachtar a thoghfar ag muintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá sé soiléir go leor gur féidir leis an Aire oifigeach dá Roinn féin a cheapadh mar Chathaoirleach, agus sin rud a dhéanfaidh sé, tá mé cinnte; cúigear eile a ainmniú a bheidh, mar a déarfá, dílis go leor don Aire, agus nach seasfaidh fód i gcoinne toil an Aire nó i gcoinne toil na Roinne.  Cuirfimís i gcás nach dtoghfar ach duine amháin, ar an seachtar seo a thoghfar ag muintir na Gaeltachta, atá fábharach don Rialtas no don Aire, beidh tromlach ag an Aire a chuirfidh ar a chumas gnótha uile an Údaráis seo a stiúradh pé treo ar bith is mian leis féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní féidir agus ní cóir daonfhlathas a ghlaoch ar sin.  Is ionann é agus dá dtoghfaí comhaltaí do Dháil Éireann agus dá gcuirfi iad isteach le 150 daoine eile nach dtoghfaí iad chor ar bith ach go n-ainmneofaí iad ag Aire éicint agus go gcuirfí isteach freisin Cathaoirleach a n-ainmneofaí ag an Aire freisin.  Ní fiú trácht ar sin mar dhaonfhlathas, cé gur toghadh ag muintir na tíre seo 168 de na Teachtaí, má chuirtear iad i dteannta le lion mór daoine eile, a chiallaíonn nach gá ach fior-bheagán de na comhaltaí tofa a <Col N="539" /> bheith fábharach don Rialtas, cuirimis i gcás, le go mbeadh smacht iomlán ag an Rialtas ar imeachtaí na Dála, nó, sa cás seo, imeachtaí an Údaráis.</P>
    <P>Mar sin féin, caithfimid cur suas leis an cur i gcéill atá ar siúl i ngeall ar Údarás na Gaeltachta agus ag féachaint chuige go dtoghfar comhaltai an Údarás seo, an líon doibh a thogfar chor ar bith, ar chaoi atá ceart agus réasúnta.  Má fhéachann tú ar na rialacháin sin a luaigh mé, feicfidh tú go leor smála sin a iontu, agus caithfidh mé na smála sin a lua go hoscailte agus gan aon fhiacal a chur ann.</P>
    <P>An chéad smál ba mhaith liom a luadh, gheofar in alt 5 (5) é.  Baineann an t-alt seo le staisiún nó laithreán votaíochta, agus bíonn sé de dhualgas ar an cheann comhairimh laithreán vótála a ainmniú, ach deirtear i fo-alt (5):</P>
    <P>(5)  Ní chuirfear toghchán ó bhailíocht an fhoras aon neamhchomhlíonadh a dhéanamh ar fhoráil sa Rialachán seo ná ar fhoras aon neamhfhoirmiúlacht maidir le ceantair, áiteanna nó stáisiúin vótaíochta.</P>
    <P>Is ionann sin agus a rá nach fiú na rialacháin seo a bheith ann beag ná mór, mar níl feidhm dlí ag baint leo.  Tig leis an Ceann Comhairle&mdash;tá me cinnte más duine ionraic é nach ndéanfaidh sé, ach cuir i gcás nach duine macánta é no gur duine faillioch é tuig leis&mdash;cur i gcás gan laithreán vótála a ainmniú do shráid bhaile éicint nó do bhaile fearainn éicint. Is ionann sin agus a rá go mbainfear a gcuid vótaí de na daoine amach is amach ach ainneoin sin go léir toisc fo-alt 5 ní bheidh cúis gearáin ag na daoine sin a dúnadh amach ón toghchán ar fad. Ba mhaith liom an fo-alt seo a cur i gcomhortas le halt den sean-Acht toghcháin 1923 nuair a bhí an tír a stiúradh ag daoine a bhí éagsúil seachas an dream atá i gcumhacht anois.  Deirtear san alt 39 san Acht toghchán 1923:</P>
    <P>Ní fógrófar aon toghchán do bheith gan bhrí toisc neamh-choimeád ar na rialacha atá in aon sceideal dá <Col N="540" /> ngabhann leis an Acht seo toisc aon dearmad in úsáid na bhfoirmeacha atá in aon Sceideal dá ngabhann leis an Acht seo má samhlaítear den Bhinse, sin é, má samhlaítear den chúirt atá ag dul ag breithniú an scéil, má samhlaítear don Bhinse a mbeidh an cheist faoin bhráid gur treoradh an toghchán de réir na bprionsabal atá leagtha amach i gcorp an Achta seo.</P>
    <P>Sin &ldquo;saver&rdquo;, mar a déarfá as Béarla.  Fiú amháin má déantar neamhní d'fhoráil ar bith, ní féidir an toghchán a chur as bail má samhlaítear don chúirt gur coinníodh agus gur comhlíonadh prionsabail an Achta; ach tá an &ldquo;saver&rdquo; sin ar lár ins na rialacháin atá dá ndéanamh ag an Aire inniu.  Níl tada faoi &ldquo;má samhlaítear&rdquo; agus mar sin de, &ldquo;má samhlaítear don chúirt&rdquo; gur comhlíonadh nó gur féachadh chuig príomh-prionsabail an Achta.  Tá sé sin fágtha ar lár amach is amach.</P>
    <P>Anois an tarna smál a fhaighim fhéin ins na rialacháin sin, gheobhaidh tú in alt 21 (1) é agus (2) chomh maith.  Baineann an talt seo le rialú ar bhailíocht páipéar ainmniúcháin:</P>
    <P>Tabharfaidh an ceann comhairimh rialú ar bhailíocht páipéar ainmniúcháin laistigh d'uair a chloig taréis é a sheachadadh dó agus féadfaidh sé rialú a thabhairt go bhfuil sé neamhbhailí i gcás, agus sa chás sin amháin, ina measfaidh sé nach bhfuil sé déanta amach nó sínithe i gceart.</P>
    <P>Céard is &ldquo;déanta amach i gceart&rdquo; ann? Níl treoir ar bith dúinn sna rialacháin sin faoi cad is ciall le &ldquo;déanta amach i gceart&rdquo;.  An bhfuil sé sin faoi shaor-bhreith an cheann comhairimh?  Má tá, ba chóir don Aire é a lua agus é a rá go hoscailte.  Muna bhfuil, ba chóir dó a rá leis an Teach céard é an chiall a bhaineann sé fhéin as na focail sin, gan an páipéar ainmniúcháin a bheith &ldquo;déanta amach i gceart&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Anois, fo-alt (2) (a) den alt céanna</P>
    <P>Nuair a bheidh rialú tugtha ag an gceann comhairimh ar bhailíocht páipéir ainmniúcháin, cuirfidh sé nóta i dtaobh a chinneadh (ar cinneadh críochnaitheach a bheidh ann)....</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> An dtuigeann tú, a Cheann Comhairle, is iomaí uair a rinneadh rialtas nó Aire iarracht a chúirt a dhúnadh amach ó iniúchadh cáis, ach ní féidir é a dhéanamh agus tá diúltaithe ag na cúirteanna sa tír seo arís eile le 50 nó le 70 nó le b'fhéidir 100 bliain anuas ligean don Rialtas nó don Dáil féin iad a dhúnadh amach ó iniúchadh ceist a bhaineann leis an dlí. Ní féidir é a dhéanamh.  Tig leis an Aire an abairtín seo a ligean sa riocht ina bhfuil sé sna rialacháin, ach ní bhaineann bail dlí leis agus is féidir liom é sin a rá leis an Aire mar dlíodóir.  Má thagann iarrthóir agus má choinnítear amach as an toghchán é toisc gur dóigh leis an gceann comhairimh nach bhfuil a pháipéar ainmniúcháin &ldquo;déanta amach i gceart&rdquo;, cibé ciall a bhaineann leis an abairt seo, mar sin fhéin tig leis an iarrathóir dul chuig an cúirt agus éileamh ar an gcúirt an scéal a iniúchadh agus ordú a thabhairt don ceann comhairimh é a ligean isteach.  Níl sé ach ag útamáil leis an Teach agus ag útamáil le daoine simplí thíos faoin nGaeltacht abairtín dá leithéid a ligean isteach in Acht tar éis an oiread uaire a bhfuil sé leagtha síos ag na cúirteanna nach mbaineann bail dlí lena leithéid d'abairtín, beag nó mór, fiú amháin más é an Dáil fhéin a leagann síos é.</P>
    <P>Gheoghaidh tú an triú smál, a Cheann Comhairle, in alt 29 (3).  Rinne an tAire fhéin tagairt don rud seo nuair a bhí an óráid bheag á thabhairt aige noimeád beag ó shin.  Dúirt sé ina chuid óráide &ldquo;Feictear freisin nach bhfuil i gceist ainm aon pháirtí polaitíochta a thaispeáint ar an bpaipéar ainmniúcháin ná ar an bpaipéar ballóide.  Is amhlaidh a mheastar gurbh fhearr gancúrsaí polaitíochta a tharraingt isteach i ngnóthaí an Údaráis&rdquo;.  Bhuel nach neamhurchóideach an duine é an tAire, i ndiaidh a bhfuil caite aige de bhlianta sa bpolaitíocht, má mheasann sé dairíre gur féidir an pholaitíocht a choinneáil amach as cúrsaí na Gaeltachta, nó gur féidir i a choinneáil amach trí chosc a chur ar ainm páirtí polaitíochta a chur isteach sa phaipéar ballóide.  Nach amaideach an smaoineamh é sin?  Gabh mo leithscéal, a Aire, ach is amaideach agus is leibideach, d'fhéadfaí a rá, an <Col N="542" /> smaoineamh sin, gur féidir polaitíocht a choinneáil amach toisc amháin nach gceadaítear don iarrthóir ainm a phairtí fhéin a chur isteach ar an bpáipéar ballóide.  Anois, beidh an pholaitíocht ann in ainneoin an Aire, beidh sé ann in ainneoin an domhain agus is maith agus is rí-mhaith atá a fhios sin aige agus ag an Aire Stáit atá ina suí taobh thiar de.</P>
    <P>Beidh an pholaitíocht ann, agus tá an pholaitíocht ann cheana féin i gcúrsaí Gaeltachta, faoi mar is eol dó, agus is leibideach é bheith ag útamáil leis an Teach lena leithéid sin d'fhoráil.</P>
    <P>Ach cad tá cearr leis an bpolaitíocht, sin ceist ar mhaith liom a chur ar an Aire.  Cad tá cearr leis?  An dtitfidh an domhan as a chéile má cuirtear isteach ar phaipéar ballóide gur le Fine Gael an t-iarrthóir seo nó le Fianna Fáil an t-iarrthóir siúd?  An dtitfidh an spéir orainn?  Agus ní hiad na páirtithe polaitíochta atá i láthair anseo sa Dáil atá i gceist agam sa chéad áit i ngeall leis an alt seo, ach cad faoi grúpaí beaga áitiúla thart faoin nGaeltacht, eagraíochtaí Gaeltachta, b'fhéidir, &ldquo;cearta sibhialta Gaeltachta&rdquo; agus mar sin de.  B'fhéidir nach n-aontaíonn an tAire lena lán de na grúpaí sin, b'fhéidir nach n-aontóinn féin leo, ach céard é an dochar má cheadaítear dóibh ainm an ghrúpa a chur isteach ar an bpáipéar ballóide mar chabhair don vótálaí, mar chabhair don ghnáth dhuine nach bhfuil&mdash;b'fhéidir gur beag cás a mbeadh sé sin fíor&mdash;ach b'fhéidir go mbeadh daoine ann nach mbeadh sé ar solas acu sa Dáilcheantar seo nó sa Dáilcheantar siúd, go mór-mhór i Mumhain, mar nach bhfuil fágtha ach mion-Ghaeltachtaí atá scartha i bhfad as a chéile, b'fhéidir nach mbeadh fhios ag duine sna Déise cé leis, táim ag caint faoi ghrúpaí, cé leis iarrthóir as Contae Chorcaí nó cé leis iarrthoir as Contae Chiarraí go mbeadh sé ag vótáil dó.  Ní fheicim féin go mbeadh mórán dochair ann dá ligfí do na hiarrthóirí ainmneacha a gcuid grúpannaí a chur isteach ar na páipéir ainmneúcháin agus ar na páipéir bhallóide chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Anois an ceathrú smál, gheobhaidh sibh in alt 33 (1) é:</P>
    <P>Beidh gach toghthóir a ainmneofar <Col N="543" /> mar phostvótalaí ar an liosta toghthóirí do thoghlach i dteideal vótáil sa vótaíocht i dtoghchán don toghlach sin trína pháipéir bhallóide a chur leis an bpost chuig an gceann comhairimh agus ní bheidh sé i dteideal vótáil ar shlí ar bith eile sa toghchán.</P>
    <P>Tá sin ceart go leor ach tá an ceart i leith postvótála srianta ins na rialacháin sin.  Ní bhíonn cead ag duine ar bith vóta poist a thabhairt mura postvótálaí é ó thaobh toghcháin áitiúla.  Anois tá mé fhéin ag ceapadh go bhfuil rialacháin ródhaingean againn in ngeall ar phostvótáil agus is iomaí uair a rinne mé fhéin gearán faoi sa Teach seo ó bhí mé i mo Theachta Dála agus roimhe sin sa Seanad, an chaoi náireach suarach a bhíonn muid ag sodar i ndiaidh na Sasanach i ngach rud dá ndéanaimid agus go mór mhór i gcúrsaí dá leithéid seo.  Ar fhéach an tAire chomh fada leis an nGearmáin nó leis an bhFrainc nó leis an Iodáil chun a fháil amach cén chaoi a reachtálann siad siúd a gcúrsaí vótála ar phostvótáil.  Ní bhíonn post-vóta anseo abhus ag duine ar bith nach saighdiúr é nó gárda siochána.  Ach cén fath nach dtugtar post-vóta cuir i gcás don saoránach atá imithe ar a shaoire? Cén fáth ar chóir go mba ghá don saoránach a cheart vótála a iobairt toisc é a bheith ar saoire nó toisc é bheith as láthair ar ghnó éicint?  Agus cén fáth nach ndearnadh rialacháin i dtoghchán Dála agus i dtoghchán áitiúla le deis a thabhairt dó a thoil fhéin a chur i gcrích sa toghchán seo ainneoin é a bheith as láthair?  Anois tá deis ag an Aire anseo briseadh amach ó na seanphrionsabal agus rud nua a dhéanamh, agus tá an rud nua seo an-tábhachtach go díreach i leith na Gaeltachta, mar is é an rud is mó a bhánaigh an Ghaeltacht ná imirce agus is maith atá a fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil níos mó cainteoirí dúchais i Huddersfield, b'fhéidir, ná mar atá sa gCeathrú Rua.  Tá sin cinnte.  Bhuel, cén fáth nach dtugtar deis do imirceoiri ón nGaeltacht atá suite, ní as a dtoil féin ach toisc nach mbíonn jobanna ar fáil dóibh ina ndúiche fhéin, cén fáth nach <Col N="544" /> dtugtar deis dóibh vóta a chaitheamh ar leas a ndúiche fhéin sa treo is go mbeadh tionchar éicint acu ar chúrsaí a gceantair fhéin, go bhfuil siad b'fhéidir ag tnúth agus ag súil le deis a fháil teacht ar ais chuige agus teach a thógáil dá bhfaighidís job.  Anois níl gá ar bith, dá bhfeicim fhéin, go gcloífeadh an tAire le pátrún na dtoghchán Dála nó na dtoghchán áitiúla agus níl fáth ar bith, go bhfeicimse ar chaoi ar bith, nach dtabharfadh sé seans do na himirceoiri tionchar a bheith acu sa toghchán sin.</P>
    <P>Anois gabhaimís rud beag níos faide anonn chuig alt 39, sin pointe an-bheag ar fad.  Bíonn cur síos ar &ldquo;vótaíocht roimh ré ar oileáin,&rdquo; ach sa mBille a bhí á phlé againn cúpla nóiméad ó shin gearradh amach ón mBille, fágadh ar lár ón mBille, oileáin ar bith a bheadh nasctha leis an Mórthír trí bhóthar nó trí dhroichead-bhóthar.  Níl fhios agam cén téarma atá á úsáid sa mBille.  Tá sé sin réasúnta go leor; ach bheadh sé i bhfad níos réasúnta oileáin dá leithéid, cuir i gcás, oileán Acla, a fhágáil amach ó fhoráil mar seo mar níl fáth ar bith ann go mbeadh vótáil roimh ré ar Acaill seachas vótáil cuir i gcás i Maol Raithne nó i gCaisleán a Bharraigh agus má chinn an tAire foráileamh speisialta a dhéanamh d'fhonn oileáin ata nasctha leis an Morthir a fhágáil amach ón mBille a ritheadh cúpla nóiméad ó shin cén fáth nach ndéanfadh sé amhlaidh leis na rialacháin atá dá bplé againn i láthair na huaire anseo?</P>
    <P>Anois rud an-tabhachtach atá anseo, alt 41 (1).  Ní thabharfar cead isteach i stáisiún vótaíochta d'aon duine ach amháin ... agus ansin bíonn liosta ann de na daoine a ligtear isteach sa mbothán vótála.  Anois ná déanaimis dearmad ar seo.  Níl muid ag trácht ar bhotháin vótaíochta i Rath Maonais, Baile Atha Cliath, ná ar bhotháin vótaíochta ar bith sa Dáil cheantar a bhfuil sé d'onóir ag John Horgan agus agam féin bheith in ár n-ionadaithe dó. Táimid ag trácht agus ag cur síos ar bhotháin vótála a bheadh uaigneach go leor, suite amach ar na carraigreacha agus ba chóir don Aire é seo a choinneáil ina intinn.  Anois féachaimis cé mar a riarfar an toghchán seo i mbothán <Col N="545" /> vótála.  Ní thabharfar cead isteach sa stáisiún vótaíochta d'aon duine ach amháin an ceann comhairimh, an t-oifígeach ceannais, gníomhairí pearsanaíochta, toghthóirí a ligfear isteach chun vótáil, compánaigh toghthóirí a bhfuil mallachar radhairc agus mar sin orthu, comhaltaí den Gharda Síochána, teachtairí a chuirfídh an ceann comhairimh nó a chuirfear thar a cheann agus &ldquo;daoine dá n-údaróidh an ceann comhairimh a bheith i láthair sa stáisiún.&rdquo; Bhuel, ba mhaith liom a fhiafraí den Aire cén fáth a bhfuil an saorbhreith seo tugtha don cheann comhairimh.  Cé hiad na daoine go dtabharfadh sé cead a bheith i láthair dóibh?  Cén líon daoine atá ar intinn ag an Aire?  An bhfuil sé saor ar fad don cheann comhairimh leath an tsráidbhaile a ligean isteach, agus mura bhfuil sé saor, cá bhfuil an cosc nó an bac le feiceáil sna rialacháin sin?  Tá mé ag ceapadh go bhfuil b'fhéidir seanduine, nó b'fhéidir duine a thaobhaíonn le grúpa nach bhfuil tromlach na ndaoine fábharach dó, nó b'fhéidir nach bhfuil an ceann comhairimh fábharach dó, agus go mbeadh imní ar sheanduine mar sin nó ar dhuine ar bith, pé sean nó óg é, go mbeadh imní air b'fhéidir a rogha vóta a thabhairt dá mbeadh an bothán vótála plódaithe go doras le daoine go bhfuil fhios aige go bhfuil siad ina choinne, go bhfuil fhios aige nach n-aontaíonn siad leis agus b'fhéidir go mbeidís ag iarraidh magadh faoi nó imní a chur air i ngeall ar a vóta a thabhairt.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé ceart an foráileamh seo a ligean isteach sna rialacháin sin agus ba mhaith liom ar an ábhar seo agus ar na hábhair eile a luaigh mé go dtarraingeodh an tAire na rialacháin seo ar ais, go ndéanfadh sé athscrúdú orthu.</P>
    <P>Anois, rud atá beagnach dochreidte, alt 48 (2).  &ldquo;Más rud é an tráth a iarrfaidh duine páipéar ballóide i dtoghchán nó tar éis dó páipéar ballóide a iarraidh sula bhfágfaidh sé an stáisiún vótaíochta go ndearbhóidh oifigeach pearsanaíochta don oifigeach ceannais go gcreideann sé agus go ngabhann sé ar fhéin a chruthú i scríbhinn go ndearna an t-íarratasóir pearsanú, ordóidh an t-oifigeach ceannais do chomhalta den <Col N="546" /> Gharda Síochána an t-iarratasóir a ghabháil ar chúiseamh go ndearna sé pearsanú agus déanfaidh an comhalta den Gharda Síochána de réir an orduithe.&rdquo; Is ionann sin agus a rá go bhfuil ceart ag na gníomhairí pearsanaíochta, ag an oifigeach pearsanaíochta, go bhfuil sé saor dó duine eile a chur i mbraighdeanas.</P>
    <P>Is féidir le duine gan cháilíocht ar bith&mdash; ní leagtar síos cáilíocht dá laghad i leith oifigigh pearsanaíochta&mdash;is féidir le duine ar bith bheith ina oifigeach pearsanaíochta más cara é le iarrthóir, gan cháilíocht ar bith eile.  Má bhíonn an duine seo ina shuí ar an mbord agus go dtagann duine eile isteach gur námha dó é nó ar mhaith leis olc a chur air, tig leis a rá&mdash;cé go mbeidh sé i dtrioblóid níos deireannaí, tá mé cinnte&mdash;&ldquo;creidim go ndearna an duine thall pearsanú agus tá mé toileanach é a chruthú i scribhinn níos deireannaí&rdquo; agus ar an ábhar sin, níl an dara rogha ag an oifigeach ceannais seachas ordú a thabhairt do gharda an duine sin a ghabháil i ngéibheann.  Tá mé cinnte nach bhfuil sé sin comhriartha leis an mBunreacht.  Ba mhaith liom admháil go bhfeictear dom gurb as na rialacháin i leith toghchán áitiúla a rinneadh an foráileamh seo a chóipéail amach.  Tá sé díreach mar atá foráileamh den chineál céanna sna rialacháin i leith toghcháin áitiúla 1965.  Ach ní hionann sin agus a rá go bhfuil sé dleathach nó bunreachtúil. Tá mé féin cinnte nach bhfuil sé bunreachtúil; agus nach bhfuil sé saor don Teach rialacháin a dhéanamh a gcuirfeadh ar chumas duine gan cháilíocht ar bith duine eile a chur faoi bhraighdeanas.  Ba mhaith liom go ndéanfadh an tAire athscrúdú ar na rialacháin.  Níl siad ionghlachta dúinne sa riocht ina bhfuil siad anois.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one major point on which I would like the Minister to comment and which has been the subject of rumour since the passage of the Act to which the regulations refer.  It is rumoured that this particular structure is intended as a dry run, as it were, for an entirely new <Col N="547" /> system of local administration based on larger units and a different type of electoral system.  This rumour has been going around since the original Bill was introduced and I would be interested to know if there is any truth in it.  I would also be interested to hear the Minister's colleague, the Minister for the Environment, on the same question.</P>
    <P>I do not see as many difficulties in the regulations as does Deputy Kelly, but I would agree with him in relation to the postal vote.  There was an opportunity here for the Minister and the Government to take an initiative in relation to giving people a postal vote.  On the basis of exactly the same logic on which he expressed concern about the other Act, one would have thought that the Minister would have been anxious to include a postal vote for Gaeltacht people, whether living in the Gaeltacht or not. He need not have gone outside this country to give the vote to Gaeltacht people living abroad, although God knows there are enough of them.  Even if he had confined it to people living in this country it would have been a very positive initiative.</P>
    <P>I will briefly refer to a couple of points of detail.  The Minister made it clear that although the Act and the regulations will be in both English and Irish the various forms will be in the Irish language.  Am I not right in thinking, however, that there is no obligation on the officers concerned, under section 13 of the rules, to publish the notices about the election in the Irish language?  My reading of the regulations is that it is open to the officers to publish in either language.</P>
    <P>An innocent from abroad reading these regulations would get the most amazing idea about the kind of elections we have in Ireland.  If he looked at pages 96 and 100 of the regulations he would get the impression that we were doing nothing but beating each other over the head and living up to certain stage Irish notions of what elections are like.</P>
    <P>Article 79 of the regulations states that a person shall be guilty of an offence who, in relation to an election, directly or indirectly, makes use of or threatens to <Col N="548" /> make use of any force, violence or restraint against or inflicts or causes or threatens to inflict or cause any temporal or spiritual injury or loss on or to any person.  It goes on to deal with abduction, duress, fraud and the rest.  I am intrigued by the phrase &ldquo;spiritual injury&rdquo;, especially when I think about which of the three parties in this House is most likely to be the recipient of episcopal or sacerdotal thunderbolts.  In that connection I suppose I must look upon article 79 of the regulations as another addition to the valuable list of regulations designed to preserve endangered species west of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>Article 82 states:</P>
    <P>(1)  A person shall be guilty of an offence if, between the date of publication of the Notice of Election and the date on which the return is made of persons elected to be members of an tÚdarás, he acts in a disorderly manner at a lawful public meeting held in connection with an election to an tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>It seems absurd to put in special regulations about this.  If he is acting in a disorderly manner he is in breach of the peace.  The idea that all these elections are to be conducted in an atmosphere of permanent mayhem is an interesting one, to put it mildly.  I would be interested to know whether this is new law or whether it simply replicates existing and, perhaps, rather outdated law.</P>
    <P>I am also interested to note that there seems to be provision for compensation for persons wrongly accused of personation. I would have thought that the maximum amount fixed is comparatively low at £100, bearing in mind other awards in court during the past few days.</P>
    <P>The most amusing feature of the regulations is in relation to the specimen ballot paper, which intrigues me.  It shows how little has changed and, in other respects, how much has changed. In 1923 we had the first specimen ballot paper in an electoral Act.  We had another in 1963 and another one here. This ballot paper replicates two significant features of the draft ballot paper in <Col N="549" /> the 1923 Act and the 1963 Act, in that it includes only one woman and one person who might, by some stretch of the imagination, be regarded as a Protestant. In 1923 and 1963 the woman's name was Jane Ellen Lynch and she has now become Éilis Ní Ghríofa.  Cad a tharla do Jane Lynch?  An féidir leis an Aire Gaeilge a chur ar &ldquo;Jane Lynch&rdquo;?  An raibh deacrachtaí speisialta ag baint leis an ainm seo?  Níl a fhios agam ar chor ar bith.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to a gentleman called Mr. William Thompson.  In the 1923 Act he appears at 14 Queen Street as a silversmith; in 1963 he had moved to Dereen Park and become a farmer; and here, in healthy retirement, he is at Woodford and there is nothing about his occupation. Someone should look again at these specimen ballot papers and the next time there is an electoral Act I hope they will give us a more reasonable one which reflects more accurately the balance and realities of the population.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Restoration of Food Subsidies: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy B. Desmond on Wednesday, 17 October 1979:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, aware of the serious economic mismanagement of <Col N="550" /> the economy by the Government and of the major increase in inflation in 1979 which is now projected at 13 per cent for this year and further aware of even larger price increases in certain basic food commodities, emphatically calls on the Government to restore food subsidies so that the living standards of those most affected by this regressive policy, namely, the poor, the elderly, the unemployed, the underprivileged and large families are not further eroded.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;aware of&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the difficulties facing the economy both at the national and international levels, endorses the policies of the Government to promote social and economic progress, including its policy to phase out food subsidies in order to make additional funds available for productive investment while protecting the interests of the less-privileged through the medium of increased social welfare payments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Economic Planning and Development).</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>When they were in Opposition Fianna Fáil called for the introduction of food subsidies.  In 1977 the sum paid on food subsidies was £66 million.  This was a genuine attempt to help the poorer and less well-off sections. It also helped to keep down our inflation rate.  I put it to the House that in withdrawing portion of the food subsidies&mdash;approximately £22 million&mdash;at the beginning of the year the Government made major blunders in three important respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the most important was that with regard to wage negotiations it made it absolutely imperative for the trade unions and the workers to pitch their demands for wage increases at a higher level than they would otherwise have looked for.  How could one expect the trade unions to do otherwise when the poorer sections were being hit by the withdrawal of the food subsidies and <Col N="551" /> when the wealthiest in the country were allowed exemption from wealth tax?  The workers and unions had to look for increased wages and this in its own way helped to generate inflation.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the withdrawal of the food subsidies led to an increase in the consumer price index of between 1 per cent and 2 per cent, thus causing inflation. Thirdly, people on low incomes and on short-term social welfare benefits were hit particularly badly.</P>
    <P>I have before me the speech of the Minister for Finance when introducing his budget when he stated that short-term social welfare benefits would be increased by 12 per cent.  This affected people on unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit and maternity allowances but they did not receive the increases until April.  At the end of August the rise in the consumer price index was 13.6 per cent.  There is no doubt that people drawing social welfare benefits suffered a drop of 1 per cent to 2 per cent in their standard of living.  This may not appear to be much but its effect on the recipient of social welfare benefits, disability benefit and so on was severe.  The Government made a major blunder in respect of these people.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a reasonable, responsible member of the Government and I put it to him that there is an obligation on him to give the House an undertaking that the rest of the food subsidies will not be removed during the remainder of the term of office of this Government.  People are anxious and concerned that the existing subsidies of approximately £40 million be retained during the remainder of the term of office of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday I asked the Minister to restore the subsidies the Government have withdrawn but from his answer I do not think the Government will do so. If they did we would applaud the Government and the Minister for their generosity, decency and commonsense but I do not think they will do so.  People have suffered as a result of the withdrawal of the subsidies.  In the past Fianna Fáil looked after the unemployed <Col N="552" /> and the poorer sections of the community but they have now gone in a different direction.  They have made a major blunder with regard to the removal of the food subsidies and if they restore them they will win the respect of many people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsidies have been regarded by all parties as a very blunt instrument. They are probably unfair to the poorer sections of the community whom the Labour Party in their motion state they are seeking to protect.  I should like to give some figures to illustrate my point.</P>
      <P>Subsidies are not selective; they are indiscriminate.  The reduction of the food subsidies in January resulted in an increase of 31p per week in the cost of food to households with an income of less than £50.  The saving to the Government was £22 million.  If this saving had been given directly to social welfare recipients each person concerned would have received about 65p per week&mdash;more than double the extra cost of food.  In fact, the increases given by the Government were far in excess of that amount.  For example, an old age pensioner received an increase of £2.55p per week in the budget in February and a further increase of £1 per week since the beginning of this month, a total increase so far this year of £3.55p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to spell out the increases in real terms given to social welfare recipients under the Fianna Fáil Government. I am speaking about social welfare recipients because the cry from the Opposition is that the removal of subsidies hurts the poorer sections of the community most of all.  The Government do not believe this.  The advantage of direct social welfare payment over indiscriminate food subsidies can be seen even more dramatically in the case of the most recent increases.  The net annual cost to the Government of the £1 per week increase in social welfare benefits paid from the beginning of this month will be £19 million per year.  If this was spent on food subsidies instead, it would reduce the bill of households earning under £50 per week by about 19p per <Col N="553" /> week.  On that assumption it was decided to subsidise milk by 1½p per pint, butter by 6p per pound and flour by 2p per kilo.  In the case of high income families earning, for instance, £180 per week these subsidies would reduce their food bill by 36p per week, which is almost twice as much as the reduction for lower income families.</P>
    <P>From 1969 to 1973 the increase in real terms for social welfare recipients was 6 per cent and the increase during the period 1973 to 1977 under the Coalition Government, allowing for their high rates of inflation, was 2 per cent.  Fianna Fáil returned in June 1977 and the budget of the following year gave increases of 6 per cent in real terms.  During the period 1978 to 1979 the increase in real terms to social welfare recipients will be between 8 and 10 per cent.  The removal of food subsidies put .75 per cent on the consumer price index as against 2½ per cent caused by the rise of 30 per cent in the cost of our oil imports. During the period of office of the Coalition, food prices rose higher than other items but under Fianna Fáil the reverse is true and non-food items are rising at a higher rate.  We are doing the very best we can.</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave, has been quoted <i>ad nauseam</i> but since this debate has come up again we should bear in mind what he said. When the 1975 packet of subsidies was being introduced by the Coalition, the Taoiseach said, as reported in the Official Report of 27 June 1975 at column 2159:</P>
    <P>Our aim must be to reduce the rate of inflation to a single-digit figure within a reasonably short period and thus to bring about a situation where subsidies will no longer be necessary. No one believes that subsidies are a desirable method of dealing with a situation.  They are justified in very exceptional and limited circumstances. It has been repeatedly said that they have many and substantial drawbacks. They are a wasteful way of helping those in need because they apply equally to everyone.  They involve a substantial increase in public expenditure <Col N="554" /> when its size and financing are already exerting their own inflationary pressures.  They increase the proportion of public expenditure devoted to current consumption rather than to investment. In this way, they are, in the long term, inimical to employment. But in the conditions of today, which are unique in our country's history, the Government are convinced that subsidies are essential to begin to get the rate of price increases down.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the subsidies was welcomed by the then Opposition as reported in the Official Report of 26 June 1975 at column 1993:</P>
    <P>All of the subsidies on bread, butter, milk, CIE fares, gas, are steps in the right direction, but why so late, why when they are now costing 15 per cent more, why now when they have cost so many thousands of jobs?  Why did they not do it when we told them to do it?  Why did they not do it in January at the latest?  We urged all of those things including the abolition of VAT on electricity, but it was not feasible or worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The reason these subsidies were in troduced was to obviate the implementation of the second phase of the national wage agreement.  The then Taoiseach in his own way said that subsidies were a blunt instrument.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday night the Minister for Economic Planning and Development made the point that money spent on food subsidies went in the proportion of five-sixths to the better off and onesixth to the less well off, the less well off being those with incomes of less than £50 per week in the 1977 household survey. The point can be further underlined if we take the case where a weekly income was less than £80 in 1977, about £98 in this year's terms.  Included in this category are all those mentioned in the Labour Party motion, the poor, the elderly, the unemployed and the underprivileged. Of every £ spent by the Exchequer on food subsidies, only 42 pence goes to the lower income groups and the rest goes to the higher income people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> Clearly, expenditure on food subsidies is weighted in favour of the relatively affluent.</P>
    <P>We are discussing a motion on the removal of subsidies.  Of all the parties in this House the Fianna Fáil Party is the most socially conscious.  These subsidies benefit the wealthier sections rather than the less well off.  By increasing social welfare benefits, children's allowances, old age pensions and so on, 68p in every £ goes to the broad category of low income families, families with incomes of up to £98 per week while only 32p goes to the more affluent.  There is no doubt that it is much better to assist the less privileged members of society by increasing social welfare payments than by granting blanket food subsidies.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Enright quoted from the Official Report of 18 February 1975 he said that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy was in favour of food subsidies while in Opposition.  But inflation at that time was very high.  During the first quarter of 1975 the rate of inflation was 23.8 per cent; during the second quarter it rose to 24.5 per cent; the food index was increasing even more rapidly at 22.7 per cent in the first quarter and no less than 28 per cent in the second quarter.  In those circumstances subsidies were justified.  Inflation was out of control and unemployment was growing. One must compare that with the record of this Government.  When we reduced the subsidies&mdash;we did not phase them out yet and we did not say that we would do it in one, two, three or four stages&mdash;inflation had been brought down to 7.6 per cent, the single digit figures which Deputy Cosgrave referred to when he was introducing food subsidies. The rate of inflation for 1975 was 20.9 per cent, for 1976 it was 18 per cent, in 1977, 13.6 per cent and in January 1978 it had fallen to 7.6 per cent.  Certainly, by all the arguments put forward by the Coalition Government of that time, the time had come to begin to phase out subsidies and this we have done.  In contrast with the Coalition action while inflation was raging and unemployment growing, Fianna Fáil have <Col N="556" /> created 30,000 new jobs.  We have 30,000 more people at work now than we had two years ago.  This year we estimate there will be 15,000 new jobs created in spite of the high rise in oil prices.  This is quite an achievement when one realises how much better we are doing than some of our counterparts in Europe.</P>
    <P>The inflation rate in 1978 fell to 7.6 per cent, the lowest annual rate of increase since 1969.  During the present year, in common with most western nations, we have seen an upturn in inflation, the main cause being the increase in oil prices.  While the reduction in the subsidies had the effect of putting .75 of one per cent on to the CPI the effect of the 30 per cent increase in oil prices has actually put on 2.5 per cent.  To the actual food index itself it has added 2.2 per cent.  The less well off section of the community, those in receipt of social welfare benefits, have been more than compensated for the phasing out or reduction of these subsidies&mdash;I find myself talking of subsidies being phased out; they have been reduced.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the most important priority of a Government is the creation of employment.  We adopted very ambitious targets in that regard. Not all will be reached but it is more important to have a target and a plan as to how to achieve the target than to have no plan, like Deputy Richie Ryan when he said there was no point in making any plan because conditions were changing from day to day.  In 1978 we created 17,000 new jobs, the highest figure on record since the State was founded.  This year, even allowing for a shortfall on our target, 15,000 new jobs will be created which is a very fine performance.</P>
    <P>In 1977 the gross domestic product increased by 5.6 per cent.  That was followed in 1978 by a figure of 6 per cent, the fastest growth in the EEC, and in fact twice as rapid as the average in the EEC and significantly greater than that achieved by almost all the development countries.  This year the growth rate will be in the region of 4 per cent, 2 per cent less than our target of 6 per cent which was set before the oil crisis <Col N="557" /> developed to its present extent.  Even to achieve 4 per cent with all these difficulties is a great credit to the Government when you consider that this will be higher than most other countries in the western world.  This is no accident; it was brought about by direct Government control.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to expenditure has been very different from that of the Coalition.  Instead of spending most of the taxpayers' money on endless dole queues this Government have invested vast sums in the capital programme.  The public capital programme rose by 21 per cent over the 1977 figure.  This year's provision is £974 million, 22 per cent above the out-turn for 1978, and over 40 per cent of the programme is earmarked for directly productive purposes.  We believe in planning the economy.</P>
    <P>The people are not happy about the price increases, we all know that, but they understand that we are combating the situation far better than the Coalition did.  There was a joke at the time of the Coalition that you had better do your shopping in the morning because by the afternoon prices would have gone up again.  We are not witnessing anything like the rate of inflation that we saw under the Coalition.  If such a situation arose and our inflation was again in the twenties and unemployment was on the increase, under such conditions the Government would increase subsidies. That is exactly what we wanted the Coalition to do they were in office but they did not so it in time and caused enormous hardship.  Because of their delay more unemployment was created and inflation raged out of control; people could not cope.</P>
    <P>My late father told a story years ago about how outside the Yellow House in Rathfarnham somebody said to him; &ldquo;What about the penny on the pint?&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;What about it?  Is it not better to put a penny on the pint and have the money to pay for it than to take a penny off the pint and not have the money to pay for it?&rdquo;  I do not think there was any retort, not that my father told me.  The social welfare recipients have always <Col N="558" /> been better looked after by Fianna Fáil.  I remember going on deputations to Deputy Cluskey, now Leader of the Labour Party when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, asking him to extend the free fuel scheme to people using gas or electricity or other forms of heat apart from turf.  We wasted our breath: it took a Fianna Fáil Minister to introduce such a scheme.</P>
    <P>This year the present Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Haughey, introduced that scheme.  It has been very much welcomed.  I noted many questions on the Order Paper today about fuel being made available for old people.  They will always have top priority with Fianna Fáil as those less well off have always had.  The record speaks for itself.  The Opposition are not upset by us throwing in their faces 10p per year of an increase to social welfare recipients as was done by the National Coalition.  That represented in real terms an increase in income of 2 per cent.  We are all aware that stagnation followed but we do not have stagnation now, in spite of all the difficulties experienced by the Government. The Government are not sitting back and letting things happen.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to pick out one area and say that the Government are falling down on their job.  It is not correct to claim that the Government are falling down on their job because of their failure to keep food prices down.  The Government adopted a comprehensive and integrated approach to economic matters. We were told in the national understanding that the proper approach was to consider together policies dealing with employment, taxation, improvement in social welfare services and other social and economic policies.  When it was announced last December that there would be a reduction in food subsidies people screamed that such a move would mean the end of a national pay agreement but had we done that after negotiating such an agreement it is my view that that agreement would have been destroyed.  Those who negotiated that agreement on behalf of the trade unions and employers knew the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> They knew that they had to take into account the fact that food subsidies would be reduced with the result that the less well-off sections of the community would be affected.  In my view we more than justified the removal of those subsidies as far as the less well off sections of the community were concerned by granting increases in social welfare payments. We will continue to grant such increases to the less well off.  We all hear about deficits in trade and speculations about next year's budget, but I predict that social welfare recipients will be given an increase in the budget in line with the increases granted to other sections of the community.  We will grant them an increase that will enable them improve their standard of living.  That has been Fianna Fáil philosophy through the years.  We have always been concerned about the standard of living of the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil mission is to ease the burden of the less well-off.  One of the great mysteries of our time is that we were not told what happened to the £200,000 which the National Coalition allocated in an effort to combat poverty. That State money disappeared and we did not get anything in return.  We were never told how that money was invested or what happened to it.  However, those people had to wait until Fianna Fáil came to power for an improvement in their circumstances.  We gave this nation back its sense of pride and gave our people employment.</P>
    <P>It is never popular to defend price increases but, while I accept that prices are increasing they would have gone up at a greater rate under a National Coalition Government.  It must be remembered that under Fianna Fáil employment has improved.  When people are asked to judge us on our performance in Government in the next election I have no doubt that they will come down on our side. They will accept that, while everything was not in order during our term of Government, we brought them through difficult times and kept them in employment. We will continue along the path of progress.  I have read many statements <Col N="560" /> to the effect that the Government's economic policies are in tatters.  That is not true.  We have taken some shells broadside but have managed to withstand them; we did not fall apart and sink beneath the waves.  We are still in control of the situation and making greater progress than our counterparts in Western Europe.  That is the best way to judge a Government.  Things would be a lot worse if we were living under a National Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment Deputy Briscoe on his stout defence of the Government.  He did his best and we will bear in mind his advice about the traditional faith of Fianna Fáil supporters.  The Government appear to have given up the struggle to contain rising prices, as one can judge from the price situation in the last few months. The November to November figures will show an inflation rate for Ireland in excess of 15 per cent and in the last three months we have all the items that concern ordinary people&mdash;food, clothing, fuel, lighting, footwear and transport&mdash;increased in price.  Coal, a fuel which is now so extraordinarily important in view of the increase in the price of oil, was increased in price last week and I presume that will be added to in the coming months because the application from the company concerned was for a 20 per cent increase.  The company was granted an increase of 7 per cent and it can be woefully assumed that a further increase will be sought by Coal Distributors Limited in the coming months.  Presumably, we can sadly look forward to artificial shortages of coal while that company awaits further increases from the National Prices Commission. The real world keeps breaking in on the arguments posed in the debate by the defenders of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Economic Planning and Development last week expressed surprise that we should be discussing this trifling matter once more, but there may be further occasions when we must warn him from these benches as the prices situation worsens.  The phasing out of food subsidies was decided upon by the <Col N="561" /> Government because, as they claimed, the inflation rate was dropping.  In those circumstances the Minister for Economic Planning and Development came forward to explain that now that the days of inflation were behind us it behoved the Government to remove those food subsidies because they were no longer necessary.  However, this situation has changed.  Our claim is that the Government, since their expectation that inflation was dropping is no longer tenable, should at least postpone the phasing out of the remaining food subsidies.</P>
    <P>Our inflation rate is now inexorably rising.  We are falling behind in the antiinflation league of the EEC states.  I think we stand about seventh in that league.  Annualised our rate of price increase stands at 15.5 per cent in the six months to August.  Those are the figures produced by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Over the rest of the Community the rate of inflation is 11.4 per cent. Therefore we can see that our position in combating inflation amongst the other European states is a poor one.</P>
    <P>Our request to the Government is that this rapid increase in the consumer price index should naturally cause the Government to revise their declared policy of phasing out the remaining food subsidies.  There are approximately 14,000 people claiming unemployment benefit, and they have children dependent on them.  There are 17,000 claiming unemployment assistance who also have children dependent on them.  These families, we believe, who are in the low income bracket spend a staggering 35 per cent of their weekly income on food. That means that a family with three children on £50 average weekly income will spend something like £18 per week on milk, cheese, bread, butter and sugar, some of the staple family food items which have increased in price over recent weeks.</P>
    <P>It is in those circumstances&mdash;not for the purpose of having just another political exchange here in this House&mdash;that this party put down this motion in an effort to put the case to the <Col N="562" /> Government and especially to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development who has expressed himself before now as of the opinion that if the inflation rate turned around adversely of course the Government would consider revision of their policy of phasing out remaining food subsidies.  Surely that time has come now; surely that revision of their stated intention to phase out the remaining food subsidies should be engaged in.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government here this evening to state clearly their intentions in respect of the remaining food subsidies. Our economy has returned to double digit inflation.  Clearly the expectations which the Government held in January that our rate of inflation would continue to decline is no longer tenable.  It is in these circumstances we ask the Government, through this motion, to revise their intentions.</P>
    <P>It was strange that in his contribution to this debate the Minister for Economic Planning and Development should actually bring forward the recent increase of £1 to explain the good works of this Government, how well spent was this money, and to make the case that, since the phasing out of food subsidies benefited rich and poor alike, it was better, as he put it, to help the most needy rather than continue to assist the process of holding down food prices.  That was the essential argument and he was certainly selective in the area he put forward for argument.  I make the point here that it would undoubtedly help those people who have been paying more for food over the past few months, it would have assisted them&mdash;and this is beyond argument&mdash;had the food subsidies been retained.  It is true that those other than the very poor would have benefited as well; I do not deny that.  But this argument that more than the poor would benefit from the maintainance of the food subsidies, strangely enough, did not hold when the Minister for Economic Planning and Development came into the House to defend the removal of capital taxes; only the rich benefited there.  Yet we did not find any suggestion from the Minister that we <Col N="563" /> should not proceed to give those benefits to the rich or that we should alter the policy of phasing out those taxes.  They benefited only the rich.  Yet the Government insisted on proceeding to give this benefit to the very wealthiest in our community.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of special pleading in the Government's case in relation to all of this.  I do not think it does any of the defenders of the removal of the food subsidies any good at all to repeat those kinds of arguments.  The defence has been put here in this debate that the rate of increase of food prices in the latter part of this year has not been as extreme as in the earlier part.  It would be very difficult indeed for food prices do maintain the kind of rapid increase they maintained earlier this year in the latter part of the year.  They were record high earlier this year.  It is not in the least peculiar that they should not maintain that rate in the latter part of the year. But there is no getting away from the argument that maintenance of food subsidies would have assisted people who find ends very hard indeed to meet in the matter of food.  The argument has been made here repeatedly&mdash;and no one denies it&mdash;that there is a very high proportion of the budget of families on the low income scale, those on £40 a week, below £50 a week, spent on the purchase of food.  There is no point in coming to such a man and his family and saying: have comfort, have consolation, the rate of price increase in food in the latter part of this year is not as bad as it has been; it will not uphold the record level it held in the earlier part of this year.  That is no consolation at all to that man as he sees the price of margarine go up 2p a half pound again in October, as he sees the price of coal continuing to go up&mdash;and the poor, like the rich, must use coal, must have heat, must have lighting.  Indeed they received information today about further increased charges on the part of the ESB. What is the point?</P>

      <P>I am explaining some facts of the real world to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, who protects his case behind these specious arguments that things will not be as bad as they were three months ago for the next three months, arguments from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development who apparently sees the great crime in maintaining food subsidies that those who are not exactly on the breadline would also benefit.  I am pointing out the inconsistency of his case in that he and his Cabinet abolished wealth tax.  When the benefits of that abolition applied solely to the rich what is the point in coming in here and using those kinds of silly arguments?  Of course, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is one of these people fated in politics to show themselves obdurately unaware of the facts of the real world&mdash;the real world of rising bus fares, rocketing house prices, coal prices that never seem to stand still, the rate of increase in food prices.  You make a defence for food price increases by saying: &ldquo;Ah, but it is not as bad as it was in May.&rdquo;  These are the arguments of someone with his feet not really on the ground.  He reminds me of Bunsen Honeydew on the Muppet Show.  I do not know if the Minister has time from his industry of producing these strange defences of price increases to look at that programme now and again, but Bunsen Honeydew is the professor on the Muppet Show who operates on and gives strange remedies to his patients.  It does not seem to work; they never recover.  I suppose the point could be made that it is not really a fair analogy because at least the Muppet Show is entertaining. Of course this is in a sense a Muppet Cabinet.</P>

At any rate I am making the point that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, coming in and making the defence, as he did in his contribution here last week, that the maintenance of the food subsidies was inequitable because it would benefit all of the population, it was not an appropriate measure; this was one of the defences&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>An unemployed man on assistance with three children receives at the moment the princely sum of £36.55 per week or if paying stamps, with a similar number of children, he receives £42.10 a week.  It is clear from the household surveys done that a great proportion of that man's budget is spent on food.  Nobody argues against that in this debate.  In these circumstances it is clear that the decision to continue the phasing-out programme for the food subsidies kicks directly that man's standard of living.  It does the same to everybody else's standard of living but it hits his most grievously of all.  If the only obstacle preventing the Minister from <Col N="566" /> dealing with the very real problems of this man was that the subsidies benefited all alike, he could have, by some means, assisted that man's income further.  He did not do so.</P>
      <P>We have now rising inflation&mdash;15 per cent to November.  The situation in relation to inflation is totally different from what it was in 1977.  Now it is increasing and the Government do not appear to have the answers.  The last speaker said that perhaps we would always have rising prices.  This is the band who won that stunning election victory.  They had the answers to rising prices.  They do not appear to have them now.  The wicked oil sheiks are responsible.  It is always somebody else.  Today the Minister for Finance said that we did not get sufficient money in this year from tax because of the postmen.  They were responsible for this.  It was not the fake budget produced earlier this year or the faked receipts of revenue that were responsible.  It was not the overestimation of revenue.  It was the wicked postmen who were on strike for seven or eight months.  It was chiefly the responsibility of a Minister who could not negotiate with them or decide how the matter could be settled.  That it was the responsibility of no-one was the constant story of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is a political fact of life.  Our administration suffered because there was inflation over our period.  We believed that there was some defence for that situation because of external factors. The Opposition at that time denied that there was such a defence.  They denied that a three-quarter increase took place in energy prices in the autumn of 1973.  They denied all these things.  At any rate, whether we liked it or not, the electorate took the old-fashioned view that the Government who claimed to govern the country were responsible for the rate of inflation of the country.  No amount of argument in this House trying to shuffle off the blame elsewhere will rid this Government of the kind of feeling growing amongst the public that as a Government they are not capable of containing prices, that they are doing very little about them and are showing <Col N="567" /> themselves unaware of the real effects of rising prices.  Those real effects cannot be disguised by saying that it is not quite as bad at this time of the year as it was some months ago.  There is no cure in the offing for our 15 per cent rate of inflation, as far as we can see.</P>
    <P>The defence put forward in this debate is that there was a £1 increase in the welfare categories in October.  How much will that £1 increase purchase in terms of more heat or food?  What will it do to increase the old age pension of a person who wants to buy an extra pair of shoes?  There has been a very big increase in the price of footwear and clothing.  There are constant increases in the price of heat and lighting.  We hear no answer to these real problems except that things will improve in the by-and-by.</P>
    <P>We must be seriously concerned, and we were correct in bringing forward this motion in an effort to face this administration with the kind of experience being felt at present by ordinary people who must pay for the increased bus fares, who must go out and buy the turf briquettes, wherever they can get them, at an increased price.  These are the people who see constantly the kind of increases registered all around the country and apparently there is no solution and no comfort.  In January we put down a motion similar to this and we deplored then the decision of the Government to phase out subsidies.  We said then that we believed that the decision would increase the price of butter by 8p per lb., milk by 2p per pint and flour by 3p per kg.  We said that all these effects would follow, and they did.  We pointed out then that the policy would have an adverse inflationary effect on the living standards of the poor, the elderly, the unemployed and those with large families.  In January our rate of inflation was 7.6 per cent.  Today it is more than double that rate and rising.</P>
    <P>One does not know when the next stage in the phasing out of food subsidies will be.  Last year it occurred before the budget.  No one was really responsible for it, it just happened.  By contrast the <Col N="568" /> budget was made to appear a little better than it was really.  Nobody knows on what date, what late Friday evening or what holiday eve the next phase in getting rid of the remaining food subsidies will occur, but the Government this evening have an opportunity to give some good news to the country of their intentions in relation to the remaining food subsidies.  As they have stated, they could now, without dishonour, say that since the rise in inflation is greater than anticipated in January they do not intend to phase out the remaining subsidies. That would be consistent with previous statements and it is what they should say here this evening.  We would be the very first to congratulate them on their consistency in this decision.</P>
    <P>Our motion relates to our concern for what is happening in the outside world. With our rate of inflation undoubtedly those thousands of families in the social welfare and large family categories, a great proportion of whose budgets are spent on food, would be assisted by a decision not to continue with the phasing out of the remaining food subsidies.  The inflation rate earlier this year was 7.6 per cent.  Now all reputable authorities expect it to be in excess of 15 per cent.  The economy is back firmly into double digit inflation.  Increases in the price of electricity have been announced and an increase in the price of coal is probably in the offing.  No one knows really about the oil situation, that continues to be uncertain. Milk prices have increased.  The Government who themselves had done all in their power to dam back and control inflation at home could turn to the electorate and, with at least an appearance of justice, say: &ldquo;Many of these factors are beyond our control&rdquo;. However, that cannot be said by this Administration who by their own deliberate domestic policy phased out food subsidies.  In their own publication is listed their part in the rising inflation that has been a feature of this economy in 1979.  The <i>Economic Review and Outlook Summer, 1979</i> on page 15 states:</P>
    <P>In early 1979, certain special factors, such as the reductions in food <Col N="569" /> subsidies, indirect tax increases and the unusually high seasonal increase in certain food items due to severe weather conditions contributed to a deterioration in the inflation rate.</P>
    <P>Actions of this Government contributed in no small measure to the deteriorating inflation rate which has been such a sad feature of our economy this year.  The spokesman of such a Government cannot come in here with clean hands and say that there are so many external factors over which they have no control and that they have done the best they could to hold back inflation.  They have not. Their own domestic policies have contributed to rising inflation.  Therefore, it is not excessive or unfair for an Opposition to demand at this time of rising inflation that they declare unequivocally what their future intentions are in relation to phasing out the remaining food subsidies.  From their own point of view it might be the best time to announce their decision.  Defending themselves behind such arguments as, &ldquo;If we were to maintain food subsidies the wealthy would benefit just as much as the poor&rdquo; is specious coming from an administration who themselves unilaterally have abolished capital gains taxes from which action only the wealthy could benefit. The whole point of maintaining food subsidies was that if such did benefit all concerned, if it did benefit sections who were not exactly on the bread line, the major assistance it offered was given directly to those who spent the biggest proportion of their family budget on food.  That meant it went to the very worst off, the people with large families, those whom it is difficult to assist by normal means.  Surveys show that the largest families are those with the lowest incomes.  The food subsidies went to assist those families.  In conditions of rising inflation it would seem to be on very sound grounds that the subsidies should be maintained.  Whatever factual foundation could be given to the argument earlier this year that the inflation rate was dropping and that food subsidies were not necessary, although one might at that stage have disagreed with that <Col N="570" /> prognosis, that cannot be maintained at this point.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the estimate in the Government's mind is for the inflation rate in 1980.  Certainly the omens do not look good and it does not seem to me that we can come back from double digit inflation in 1980.  It will continue to be a fact of life that in 1980 the proportion of the budget of the lower income families which is spent on food will continue to be high.  Whilst we may be in the seasonal part of the year, when food prices do not maintain a very high profile, the fact is that in the coming winter months that will obviously be changed.  On grounds of what we may forecast is in the economy, on grounds of justice, there does not appear to me to be any really sound argument which can be put forward by members of the Government against the terms of our motion.  No reputable argument can be put forward that we are in a period of falling inflation.  The inflation rate is worsening and the actions of the Government have contributed to that.</P>
    <P>The living standards of the families concerned will be adversely affected by the removal of the remaining food subsidies and there do not appear to be any good grounds for proceeding with a policy which could not be adequately defended on social justice grounds earlier this year and no valid arguments can now be put forward for a continuation of that policy at this time.  That is why in our motion we call on the Government to clarify their intentions in regard to the remaining food subsidies. Even if the inflation rate continues to worsen the Government by reversing the policy of phasing out the food subsidies can at least constructively contribute to holding down the impact of rising prices on the budgets of the most needy families.  The Government have the power to do that.  I call on them tonight to do it because the inflation situation no longer can give them sufficient defence for a policy which was mistaken in the first place and which cannot be defended on any grounds of equity at this point.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the amendment which reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;aware of&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the difficulties facing the economy both at the national and international levels, endorses the policies of the Government to promote social and economic progress, including its policy to phase out food subsidies in order to make additional funds available for productive investment while protecting the interests of the less-privileged through the medium of increased social welfare payments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When the Opposition made their case they gave no credit to the Government for making funds available for productive investment or how successful their programme has been over the last few years.  They must all agree that the interests of the less privileged people were protected by social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Reference was made tonight to the number of jobs secured over the last few years when the Government have had the greatest record in that regard over any other Government.  The Government's policies have been successful even though they had to face many difficulties at national and international level.  I believe that most people will recognise that food subsidies are a very blunt instrument as far as a social policy is concerned.  We have only to compare the increases given in social welfare this year with the reduction in food subsidies. The reduction in food subsidies last The reduction in food subsidies last January resulted in an increase of about 31p per week in the cost of food to a household with an income of under £50 a week and saved the Government £22 million.  In the budget of last February old-age pensioners got an increase of £2.55 a week and in October they got a further £1, giving a total for the year of £3.55.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government by switching the emphasis from food subsidies to additional social welfare benefits have helped families and individuals.  If one examines the social welfare benefits for the previous year one finds that there has been an increase of between 20 per cent <Col N="572" /> to 24 per cent.  If one examines the rates of inflation in relation to increases in food prices from November 1978 to November 1979 one finds this is in the region of 13 per cent.  It is very hard to understand how the last speaker could claim the hardships heaped on the people were caused by the withdrawal of food subsidies.  He spoke about the action of the Government and said that we claimed that the wealthy would benefit by food subsidies.  The wealthy must benefit by food subsidies.  Let us take a family where the wage earner earns around £50 a week.  Proportionately, in terms of food subsidies that man's family are not benefiting to the same extent as would the family of a man whose income was in the region of £150 per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The answer to that is that the first family are consuming less sirloin steak but more bread, butter and milk than are the other family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is accepted that the lower income household&mdash;the household with an income of £50 per week or less&mdash;are only benefiting to the extent of about 16 per cent of the subsidies and that most of the benefit from the food subsidies is derived by the higher income families.  Admittedly, sirloin steaks were not subsidised at any time but Deputy Fitzpatrick must accept that families who buy sirloin steaks also buy bread, butter and milk and buy these commodities in larger quantities than is the case of the family in the lower income group.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary, too, expressed concern about the larger families but in terms of the national understanding these families are being helped.  It would be difficult to put forward a good argument for indiscriminate food subsidies <i>vis-á-vis</i> the advantages of social welfare payments and the Government have not reneged on their duty in terms of providing for increased social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of productive investment, I think Deputy O'Leary must agree that the moneys that have been <Col N="573" /> channelled into this activity have been well justified.  An examination of the effects of the IDA activity will indicate that this was one sphere in which productive investment has been shown to great advantage.  Only yesterday in my area there was an IDA announcement of a proposal to set up structure unit factories even in small- and medium-sized towns.  This is another indication of the thinking behind the Government policy in terms of production and the provision of employment generally.</P>
    <P>None of us welcomes increased food prices, but the Government are making every effort to ensure that any increase as a result of the change in subsidies will have the least possible effect, especially for the less well off.  I am confident that overall this year there is an increase in the standard of living of the lower paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate has been illuminating in so far as there has not been any indication so far of the change of strategy in the minds of the Government. One would have thought that after about two-and-a-half years in office the Government would have initiated a serious examination of the extent to which transfer payments operated.  This is a fascinating subject, but apart from some working documents during the years within the Department of Finance &mdash;and these are now somewhat dated&mdash;and apart from some other working documents that emanated in the 1973-76 period in the Department of Social Welfare, in terms largely of reaction to the Department of Finance, there has not been any real work done in Irish society on the question of the transfer of payments and the effects of subsidies. Admittedly, the NESC have commissioned work and have issued some useful publications on this question; but, again, in terms of the last general election these are rather dated because since then we have had a whole series of new subsidies.  There was subsidisation in terms of foregone revenue as a result of various taxation elements.  There were increased subsidies for CIE in the intervening <Col N="574" /> period and these were of the order of £15 million per year.</P>
      <P>In addition, there have been other areas of massive subsidy in terms of the loss of Exchequer revenue.  For example, there was the increased subsidies in respect of married persons at work <i>vis-à-vis</i> the income tax system.  These relate largely to married couples rather than to married persons at work.  There were also massive subsidies in terms of the elimination of rates on domestic dwellings and of the abolition of car tax on private motor vehicles.  Therefore, this area has changed dramatically and, consequently, one would hope that the Government and indeed the Department of Economic Planning and Development would initiate a major investigatory, objective and rational analysis of the role of subsidies in our society.</P>
      <P>I remember arguing this matter with Deputy Tully, when he was Minister, in relation to the subsidy we initiated concerning tenant purchasers and when we sold tenant purchase houses at £600 or £700 in accordance with the relevant local authority scheme.  There have been various other subsidies, too, whether in respect of house mortgage or in terms of pensions premiums in respect of which there have been income tax subsidies. There has been an element of tax subsidy on ordinary overdraft interest. Overall the area is one of major concern to economists and in particular to the Minister for Finance.  In the sphere of agriculture there is the question of the operation of massive transferred payments and of the role of subsidies. Perhaps that is the area which is worthy of the greatest examination and it is not only the area of rates remission, of farm modernisation or of the rural dole but the whole area of the massive role of subsidies within agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, what we are talking of tonight is not one of these elements which cost not just a miserly £22 million or so in terms of subsidies nor are we talking of other subsidies, even those in relation to higher education grants, because relative to all of these food subsidies are miniscule.  Therefore, what has irritated profoundly the Labour Party <Col N="575" /> and has upset those whom I would regard as serious politicians, is that we find the area of subsidisation attacked on a particularly narrow and unnecessary front.  We find the searchlight being beamed on a specific area, an area which is perhaps the least worthy of such examination in terms of relative waste or relative use and so on.</P>
    <P>What was particularly infuriating to many Deputies on this side of the House relative to that was that Fianna Fáil went into the last election on the absolutely clear public opinion appreciation that there was going to be no change in food subsidies.  When I was discussing the matter with Deputy Fitzpatrick from Fine Gael this evening he brought to my attention a furore at that time.  I was never able to track down the date of the particular newspaper cutting but Deputy Fitzpatrick has loaned it to me for the conclusion of this debate.  It is a statement made by the current Minister for Agriculture in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 8 June 1977.  Deputy Gibbons was Fianna Fáil spokesman for Agriculture then.  It reads:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil today pledged that it will increase the present level of subsidy on butter, cheese, milk and bread if it regains power in the General Election. Agriculture spokesman, Jim Gibbons, said that existing Government expenditure of £60 million was inadequate. In a heated debate on RTE radio with Agriculture Minister, Mark Clinton, Mr. Gibbons said that it should be possible to provide substantially bigger subsidies as the agriculture industry continues to develop but he did not specify where the money would come from.  Mr. Clinton hotly rejected Mr. Gibbons' proposals as another product of the Fianna Fáil promise factory and pointed out that previous Fianna Fáil administrations had twice removed the subsidies.</P>
    <P>Here we have a fact of life.  I met it going around the constituency I represent, as Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy David Andrews are well aware.  I did not <Col N="576" /> meet on the doorsteps of the Dún Laoghaire constituency in the last election one single individual&mdash;I got it in the neck from quite a few in terms of reaction&mdash;who said to me if we vote for Fianna Fáil they will take away food subsidies.  The reverse was the impression that was created.  We have the quotation from the <i>Evening Herald,</i> which at the time was not denied.  The £60 million of two-and-a-half years ago in terms of inflation has been a constant price figure.  Relative to total Government expenditure, £60 million is probably worth something in the region of £40 million to £45 million.  Of course, £22 million of it has been slashed under the abolition of subsidies.  I do not know where the <i>rationale</i> comes from in relation to the decision of the Government on this aspect.  I am bemused that the Government should have adopted a policy of this nature.  I would have thought that any serious individual would have said to himself that it would not do those with real wealth in our community any harm to pay 1 per cent or 2 per cent of taxation on their wealth in order to continue subsidies.</P>
    <P>Last week I put down a question to the Minister for Finance.  I asked him the total value of the assessment for wealth tax for the period 5 April 1977.  It was really illuminating.  I asked him the value of holdings held outside the State, the value of agricultural land, the value of stocks and shares and other forms of property in the total value and the number of individuals assessed.  It brought home to me the people who ran this country in June and July in the run up to the election and the people who put their financial muscle behind the Fianna Fáil Party and the question came home to me as having great relevance.  The Minister for Finance said on 17 October that the assessment of the Minister for Finance on 5 April 1977 was that approximately 6,500 people had been assessed for £1,313,596,862.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry.</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of assessed persons as of that date was 4,399.  The number of discretionary trusts was 2,300 and the number of private non-trading companies was 2,800. The total was 9,600.  There was the important rider that we all know about, that some persons occurred twice or three times in the total of individuals, discretionary trusts and non-trading companies. Supposing the Minister had decided that to pay for food subsidies we should put 2 per cent tax per annum on £1.3 billion assessed on those individuals, a miniscule 2 per cent, there would be £26 million income per annum which would more than pay for the abolition of food subsidies.  But no.  The most influential group of people in our society went berserk in 1975 and 1976. Is it any wonder that there was a special room set up in the Burlington Hotel for the Fianna Fáil Party to meet them and obtain their contributions for the general election?  These were the realities of life. The Coalition were kicked out because they attempted to suggest to people that they should pay a small percentage of their annual income to afford such elementary things as food subsidies.  At that time I predicted that the chickens would come home to roost and in many ways they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have a situation where this week we have an increase of 10 per cent in the price of electricity.  My understanding is that something in the region of 16 per cent plus 2½ per cent fuel variation was recommended to the Government and the Government decided they should sanction 10 per cent.  The rest will come after the byelection. Before Christmas there will be another dollop of ESB charges.  I have no doubt about that.  I understand the Government cannot make up their mind whether to sanction an increase this week or not of 2p per pound on butter.  I challenge the Government on that issue. I expect it will be announced next Friday <Col N="578" /> night about 9 o'clock when Deputy Enright and I have gone home.  The comment will say&mdash;not the Minister, he has nothing to do with these things&mdash;that the National Prices Commission have announced it and the Minister in a footnote has sanctioned it, needless to remark.</P>
    <P>It has not really dawned on the Government that, if a housewife walks down the street and buys a loaf of bread and a pound of butter, it costs £1.  That does not hit the consciousness of some Fianna Fáil Deputies.  That is what an old age pensioner in Blackrock has to pay.  If food subsidies had been on and if the Government had kept down the price of stable commodities, the pensioner would be saved 10p or 12p over the period of three years with the development of the subsidies in those areas.</P>
    <P>The Government should seriously examine the role of subsidies in our society. It is a difficult, complex and politically unrewarding area.  There is no joy in it for any of us.  I concede sympathy to any Minister trying to introduce rationalisation in terms of subsidies.  I suggest to the Government that they have been caught up in a school of economics&mdash;and there are more than Deputy O'Donoghue involved in it&mdash;who simply hold that social subsidies are a distortion of the market economy situation and that they destroy the free functioning of the market economy. They pick on an item and unfortunately it was food subsidies.  The empty subsidy philosophy which is growing in Irish society has to be opposed in the national interest.  There are better ways and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has undoubted competence in that field.  He must have second thoughts on the situation and I hope these will manifest themselves in next year's budget.  In the interim period, we remind the Government that we are profoundly unhappy about the position.</P>

      <P>I have set up a liaison committee of representatives of my Departments, Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council, and the Eastern Health Board, to ensure the successful operation of the fuel schemes this winter.  While I have no power to issue directions to fuel suppliers in the way suggested I feel assured that their co-operation with the authorities concerned will be forthcoming in ensuring that our aim is achieved.</P>
      <P>I might mention that for participants in the fuel scheme in the Dublin city area supplies of turf are being guaranteed by Bord na Móna to those who require the fuel and arrangements have been made to ensure a regular free delivery service for infirm and disabled persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a press statement which I issued early in September about heating <Col N="396" /> arrangements I suggested to health boards which are operating local schemes that they should ensure that fuel will be available in the event of shortages at normal outlets and that they should consider what other improvements they could make at local level to improve the effectiveness of their schemes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has under consideration any contingency measures to deal with rising inflation; the annual inflation rate now accepted by his Department in the preparation for the 1980 budget; and if he anticipates any moderation in the rate of inflation during 1980.</P>

      <P>I do not contemplate at present introducing further measures to combat inflation. The reference in the Deputy's question to the annual inflation rate accepted by my Department presumably refers to 1979.  It now seems likely that the increase in the consumer price index this year will be about 13 per cent.  I would hope that the inflation rate will moderate in the course of 1980, but this will depend on international price levels, notably that of oil, and on the level of wage settlements emerging during the currency of National Understanding provisions and subsequently.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have received proposals under the Coast Protection Act, 1963, from Waterford County Council for coast protection works at the following locations: (1) Ardmore/Curragh, (2) Ballyvoile, (3) Cunnigar, (4) Glencorran/Ballyquin, (5) Tramore, (6) Whiting Bay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commissioners are awaiting the completion of certain statutory requirements by the county council in relation to the applications submitted in respect of Ardmore/Curragh, Cunnigar, Glencorran/Ballyquin and Whiting Bay.  The application for Tramore is listed for a statutory preliminary examination but because of prior commitments it is not possible at this stage to say when this will be carried out.  The question of the relative proportion of Exchequer and county council funds to be spent on the Ballyvoile proposal has delayed progress here but a decision on this aspect will be made shortly and the Ballyvoile proposal will be proceeded with as quickly as possible having regard to other commitments, the protracted statutory processes under the 1963 Act and the availability <Col N="410" /> of engineering and other staff to carry out the work.</P>

      <P>Army service during the Emergency may be taken into account for civil service superannuation purposes provided certain conditions are met.  One of these conditions is that the service must have been reckonable for purposes of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes.  Service in the auxiliary services is not reckonable for purposes of those schemes because it was not whole-time paid service and it cannot, accordingly, be reckoned for civil service superannuation purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service when it is expected to introduce the necessary legislation and to complete outstanding measures necessary to facilitate the transferability of pension rights within the public service; and if he will ensure that any public servant, who may retire before completion of the scheme of transferability, will not be disadvantaged by reason of non-completion of these arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Colley) Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Colley)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is that the final draft of a comprehensive scheme for transferring service for superannuation purposes was circulated to organisations covered by the existing arrangements for transferring pension rights in April of this year asking them to indicate whether they accepted its terms.  Other public sector organisations were also circulated. Replies from a number of organisations are still outstanding and, when these have been received and certain matters raised by other organisations have been clarified, arrangements will be made for the formal implementation of the scheme and the enactment of the necessary legislation.  Every effort is being made to expedite replies from the organisations concerned.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question the position is that the terms of the scheme provide that organisations may participate with effect from a date, not earlier than 1 June 1973, of their own choosing.  A person transferring between two participating organisations on or after the relevant operative date would automatically benefit; the scheme may also be applied, at the discretion of the final employing organisations, to persons who transferred before the operative date and are still serving on that date, and, in so far as their pensions are concerned, to persons who retired before the operative date.  Accordingly, a public servant with service in two or more organisations which join the new scheme would not be disadvantaged by reason of the fact that he retires before completion of the arrangements for introducing the scheme.</P>

A more thorough analysis of the census returns and its effects on health services planning will be undertaken when more detailed information, particularly in relation to the age and sex structure of the population, becomes available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the annual report of St James's Hospital.  The report refers to the difficulty of recruiting and retaining nurses but does not state that there is a chronic shortage.  In fact the report mentions that the nursing establishment of the hospital was maintained at a reasonable level all through the year. The hospital has confirmed that the problem in the geriatric wards is not one of shortage but of frequent turnover of staff.  When my Department made inquiries last week there was no vacancy in the geriatric wards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it seems that geriatric work is not very attractive to nurses I am not aware that there is a general shortage in this field.  A special allowance is payable to nurses in geriatric hospitals and units. <Col N="431" /> The new training programme for general nurses requires that student nurses in the course of their training must acquire clinical experience in geriatric nursing. This period that they will have to spend in the geriatric area will, it is hoped, give them a greater appreciation of such nursing and stimulate their interest in that area.</P>
    <P>I expect very shortly to have the views and recommendations of a working party which has been carrying out a wide review of the nursing services in this country.</P>

Mentally handicapped children are entitled to free hospital in-patient and out-patient services and free drugs and medicines under the long-term illness scheme.  In many instances the parents are receiving the constant care allowance.  However, it has been said that in some cases parents do experience hardship in relation to general practitioner services for these children.  I am asking chief executive officers of health boards to ensure that sympathetic consideration is given to any such cases.</P>

      <P>I am aware that some do-it-yourself blood pressure recording machines for public use have been installed in shopping centres and other areas.  Their use is not likely to be harmful and could be helpful in keeping a check on blood pressure between visits to a doctor.  One danger is that users of these machines might regard them as being a suitable basis for self-diagnosis and might not consult their doctors about their blood pressure. However, notices are affixed to the machines which warn users that the machines are not substitutes for the checking of blood pressure by a doctor. The Irish Heart Foundation feel that, on balance, they are of benefit.</P>

      <P>RTE say that while reception on medium wave in parts of County Mayo may be less than adequate, because of the distance from the low powered transmitters used for the service, satisfactory reception should be possible on VHF in these areas.  They emphasise that to obtain good VHF reception an external aerial may be necessary.  If the Deputy supplies details to RTE of any individuals whose VHF reception of Radio na Gaeltachta is less than satisfactory they will be happy to investigate the matter further.</P>

Since June 1974, when Fenian House was first occupied by my Department, staff representations were received concerning such matters as delay in replacing broken window panes, draughty windows, sun glare, seepage of sewage from an adjoining premises and rat and insect infestation from the same premises.

      <P>The consumer price of town gas in Cork city has increased by 55.79 per cent since July 1977.  I might add that the Cork Gas Company are in receipt of a very substantial Government subsidy which was increased in August 1977 and, but for this fact, the consumer price of town gas in Cork would now be more than 15p per therm or 22 per cent dearer.  The increase in the price of town gas in Cork is in line with the increase in the cost of naphtha which is the raw material used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of any system of <Col N="465" /> registration of security firms raises issues of considerable difficulty.</P>
      <P>The first question to be decided is whether the registration system is to be one that provides for scrutiny of those entering the business with a view to excluding certain people whose honesty is or may be in question or whether, on the other hand, it is to be designed to set quality standards for the service provided, or whether it is intended to achieve both objectives.</P>
      <P>A system providing for exclusion of persons from the business on the basis of, say, a past criminal record could raise serious issues relating to the rights of the people concerned, perhaps especially so if the exclusion were discretionary as questions could arise as to the reasons for excluding one and not another.  On the other hand an automatic exclusion of the basis of a criminal record would be open to obvious other criticisms and, moreover, if that were to be the objective it could be provided for directly by law without any registration requirement.  Even more difficult issues would be raised if what was involved was the denial, or revocation, of registration on the basis that the person's reputation was not good, even though he had not been convicted.  It is clear that issues on which a person's livelihood would depend could not be decided arbitrarily but only on the basis of evidence and that the evidence would have to be such as to satisfy a court. There would be a question of what qualities, or lack of qualities, would form the basis of the decision.</P>
      <P>The matter is further complicated by the fact that not only the members of the firm but also any employees would have to be assessed if the registration system were to achieve the objective sought. Apart from the wide-ranging scope of such a system there would be a question whether persons who had been convicted could reasonably be expected to volunteer that information to prospective employers and, if not, how the restriction on them, even if it were thought to be reasonable, would be enforceable.</P>

    <P>If the registration scheme were to attempt <Col N="466" /> to provide for minimum standards of commercial practice by those engaged in the business, serious questions would likewise arise as to the criteria to be applied in the determination of those standards&mdash;serious because of the inherent seriousness of any system in which the livelihood of a person, or perhaps of many persons, would be in danger of being taken away and because this is not something on which recognised guidelines are available.  The difficulties of establishing guidelines will be evident.</P>
    <P>Presumably because of difficulties of the kind mentioned, it is not alone in this country that the question of supervision of firms engaged in the provision of private security has presented problems which, according to the information available to me, have so far not been solved.  In virtually all Western European countries the growth and development of the private security business have given rise to much the same questions &mdash; and much the same problems.  In some countries there are controls concerning the use of firearms by such firms, as of course there are here.  In some others there is a form of registration but not, apparently, one of a kind that provides any really effective control over standards.</P>
    <P>The issues are, therefore, very complex. I have been in consultation with interests in this country who have made representations to me and I have received submissions from some of them. Those submissions are being examined.  I am also keeping in touch with developments elsewhere in Europe because, as I have indicated, both the growth in the security business and the difficulties of providing for standards in it are problems for most of the countries in question.  It will be apparent, however, that I cannot at this stage give any indication that the fundamental problems I have touched on are likely to be quickly resolved.</P>

      <P>The European Regional Development Fund of the European Communities contributed 50 per cent of the cost of the Cross-Border Communications Study for the Derry and Donegal Area, which was completed and <Col N="468" /> published in December 1977.  The amount involved was £35,000 divided between the two Governments.  As regards the implementation of the recommendations of the study applications for ERDF aid in respect of road and telecommunications projects in that part of the study area which lies in County Donegal have been accepted with total commitments to date from ERDF funds being slightly in excess of £1.6 million; a roughly similar amount of ERDF funds has been made available for projects in that part of the study area which lies in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated also that Border areas in Ireland will benefit under the recently established non-quota section of the ERDF.  As the Deputy will be aware, 5 per cent of the fund has been set aside for special Community-related projects over and beyond national quota allocations. Following representations by the Irish Government at the time when the fund regulation was under consideration by the Council it was accepted that projects in Irish Border areas would be eligible for consideration.  The Commission of the European Communities has recently adopted and forwarded to the Council of Ministers for approval a number of proposals for measures under this heading including a proposal to make available 24 million units of account (£16 million approximately) for tourism and craft industry projects in the Border areas.  While the details have yet to be worked out, the Government naturally welcome the proposal and will be pressing for its early adoption by the Council of Ministers.  We will be working in close co-operation with the relevant British and Northern Ireland authorities in relation to all aspects of this proposal.</P>
      <P>In addition to assistance being made available through the ERDF the European Communities are also assisting cross-Border studies presently under way in the Erne catchment area and in the Mourne Herring Fishery under Article 266 of the Communities' budget.</P>

This report, which was received from the council in July 1978, showed that the section of road from Whites Cross to Kill Lane, which represents the bulk of the road referred to by the Deputy, should be the last section of the Bray Road to be improved&mdash;the time scale being 1987 to 1989.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the recruitment campaign which was conducted in the United Kingdom in June of this year to attract skilled workers who are in short supply in this country.  As a result of that campaign 223 persons of whom 68 are not Irish nationals, have so far been interviewed by employers and 66, including 23 non-nationals, have been placed in employment.</P>
      <P>In connection with the campaign it has been decided that the grants payable under the resettlement allowances scheme to workers coming from abroad should be increased substantially.  The grants payable were all increased with effect from 21 May 1979.</P>
      <P>Up to the present, interview grants of up to £70 have been paid to 30 of the 223 workers who have been interviewed and applications from others are currently receiving attention or are awaited.</P>
      <P>In the period from the beginning of 1979 to 21 May 1979, when a lower rate of grants applied, 91 persons coming from abroad received interview grants averaging £40 each and 18 persons, who came to take up jobs here and were fully resettled, got grants averaging £197.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the increase in average earnings in 1979 will be of the order of 16 per cent.  This estimate is necessarily tentative as the latest official earnings data relate to a week in the middle of December, 1978.</P>
      <P>I cannot at this stage provide an estimate for the increase in average earnings in 1980.  The carry-over effect of pay increases from 1979 into 1980 together with the payment of the second phase increase under the National Understanding will of themselves result in an increase in average earnings of about 12 per cent in 1980.  This estimate excludes any provision for wage drift in that year.  The scope for any further increase following the expiry of the national understanding is, therefore, very limited especially in view of the energy situation and the need to decelerate inflation.</P>
