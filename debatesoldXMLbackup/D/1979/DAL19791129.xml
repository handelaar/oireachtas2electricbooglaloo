      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There is a motion in my name on the Order Paper seeking to annul the Public Bodies (Amendment) (No. 2) Order which postpones estimates meetings of local authorities from October-November to February-March. The Minister has made a very important amendment in the law and it has far-reaching consequences for local authorities.  I want the Tánaiste to provide Government time to discuss that motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have that considered, but, on the face of it, it would not seem to be something that would warrant Government time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Surely it is of the utmost importance because, unless the order is amended, county councils&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss that now.  The Deputy is asking whether Government time would be granted or not and we cannot have a discussion on the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="339" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> We have been told by the Tánaiste that he does not think it warrants Government time and I am anxious to show the House that it does. Unless the order is revoked public bodies will spend one-third of the year without any works programmes and without knowing the finance they will have to provide services and public works during the year.  Surely that is of the utmost importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has overlooked the fact that the order was made because of the change in the State financial year which provides most of the money for local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> That is not correct.  I am well aware that the order was made because the Minister for the Environment does not know the amount of money he will have available until the Minister for Finance tells him but the net result is that public bodies will be marking time for one-third of the year unless the order is revoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained the order was made because of the change in the accounting year for the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated that I will have a look at this matter, but on the face of it it does not appear to be something that would warrant Government time.  The reason I made that statement was that the order was made for the reason I outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I suggest that the Tánaiste look into this matter because he will find that the order was made consequent on the abolition of rates on private houses and consequent on a limit imposed on the amount of revenue local authorities may raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy in <Col N="340" /> favour of the reintroduction of rates on private dwellings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am in favour of works being carried out during the year and business being done in an orderly fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>They are getting more money than they ever did.  The Deputy is aware that in his own county of Cavan we have an increase of 185 per cent for local improvement scheme works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There are potholes all over the place and the Minister for Education would need to be careful or he will get lost in one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase was of the order of 185 per cent and the Deputy is aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> We had to put down a resolution to get the Minister for Education to provide enough money for scholarships.  It was not until we did so that the Minister had second thoughts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not want to listen to what I have to say; he is play-acting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Education is finished with constituency matters I should like to raise a point of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will finish as soon as the Opposition Spokesman for the Environment cops himself on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be expecting an election.  I wish to raise a point of order in relation to the growing tendency to legislate by way of ministerial order.  I should like to know if there is an obligation on the Government to provide time at the request of the Opposition <Col N="341" /> or any Deputy to discuss such orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a point of order.  The Deputy is continuing an argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a point of order and raising a constitutional point. Is there an obligation on the Government to provide time to debate changes made by ministerial order?  That is a very basic and fundamental point and one which I consider to be serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is raising a legal matter which is for the Government to decide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I adjourned on this miserable piece of legislation.  I had the honour previously to describe it as a lousy piece of legislation and was told by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that it would be preferable to use more parliamentary vocabulary.  The reality, however, is that the 1969 Housing Act was drafted not, in effect, in this House but on the streets of Dublin.  It was badly drafted and was pushed through against the judgment, and certainly the will of some of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Despite the fact that it was defended at that time as being a temporary measure, we are yet again renewing it.  It has been renewed on three separate occasions, in 1972, 1974 and 1977.  We are again, in this penultimate month of 1979, asking to renew it for another two years.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the legislation, as I said in my speech on this very order on 7 December 1977, was to protect the interests of people who for economic reasons were subject to the mercies of a market economy, could not afford to house themselves properly and were living in what could be described as cheap accommodation.  The Act has manifestly failed to protect the interests of those people.  That is my judgment the verification of which is the consensus figures the Minister's Department published recently. Let me welcome the fact that the Minister's Department did produce that consensus.  It should have been produced in 1976, but that is another day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are no longer talking, as I was in 1977, about an estimate of the degree of <Col N="347" /> failure of this legislation.  The reality of the failure is embodied in the figures produced by the 1979 consensus, which showed a dramatic drop in housing in the central city area.  I do not wish to go over the polemic grounds which I covered reasonably accurately on the last occasion and also when we discussed this measure in a much more comprehensive way in 1977.</P>
    <P>Having had, as the House will agree, a fair wallop at the Minister of State, I wish to suggest, constructively, that one does not have to bury oneself in this legislation indefinitely and that the endless policy review, which is now two-and-a-half years in progress, should turn towards a system of comprehensive rehabilitation and renewal for housing in urban areas or inner city areas, by which I do not mean exclusively Dublin.  The validity of the point of view I am about to elaborate upon applies equally to Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Galway and, to a lesser extent, to the smaller towns around the country.  There is undoubtedly a case for positive legislation and, indeed, for positive ministerial order, framed within this enabling legislation recently passed in this House, for a system of comprehensive grants for the rehabilitation and conservation of housing in the urban areas.</P>
    <P>We are fooling ourselves in the belief that by yet again renewing the life of this miserable legislation we somehow or other, under the 1969 Housing Act, have protected our housing stock.  The numbers game implicit in the way in which that Housing Act operates, ensures that we do not, as such, protect the population of inner cities for which it was primarily designed.  We simply supply a legal vehicle which did not exist before to enable a developer to take out of a particular area low standard, yet economic, housing units and replace them by high standard and expensive residential units. By definition this means that the previous occupants are unable to remain in the area in which they lived.  From my experience the people who come in- &mdash;because in my constituency there is a lot of such development&mdash;in the nature <Col N="348" /> of things, tend to be transient and do not have the sense of community involvement of the previous residents.</P>
    <P>Perhaps sometimes criticism comes too easily from this side of the House.  I realise that the topic about which we are speaking is not one that is readily or easily remedied.  Two things are required; first of all, the explicit political courage required on that side of the House to say that the nature of the housing problem is not the same throughout the State, that there are certain parts of the State's housing stock&mdash;and from now on I am speaking of the existing housing stock, which is 850,000 units or thereabouts&mdash;which, even with building something in the region of 25,000 to 30,000 new units per year will increase only in the region of a maximum of 2 per cent.  Therefore <i>inter alia</i> the concern of any housing Minister must be as much with the existing housing stock as with new houses.  There is a precedent in the Minister's Department for recognising that the housing need, in terms of housing demand, is not uniform throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Therefore the political battle on which I am now asking the Minister to embark is not a fresh one.  There is a precedent, that the previous Minister for Local Government recognised that the housing demand in some parts of the country was greater than in others, and that he would direct the limited amount of capital resources for a housing construction to the area of greatest need; that was for capital allocation to local authorities.  I am now asking the Minister to do something similar in relation to rehabilitation grants.  The £600 grant has been distributed throughout the country rather like confetti.  It is very much welcomed by those people who receive it but is totally inadequate for people living in a certain category of house which has got no more than, say, five or 10 years effective life left in order to classify it as reasonable accommodation, as distinct from somebody living in a 12-year-old house who is simply seeking a grant to convert the garage.</P>
    <P>The need for State funding to assist in <Col N="349" /> the rehabilitation of those two categories of houses is manifestly much different. Therefore, the equal treatment of £600 for both makes nonsense of the commitment we must have to preserving our housing stock.  There is no doubt&mdash;as the Minister's Department can readily testify&mdash;but that the cost of replacing old housing units in the inner city area of any part of the State is extremely expensive relative to the cost of extending their useful life by between 10 and 20 years. The Minister is aware of this; there are schemes in his Department awaiting sanction and decision in relation to a number of city housing sites.  My colleagues in Dublin Corporation have told me that they are not so much delayed but being queried because of the high replacement cost implicit in inner city construction.  The reality is that, even with a positive and good inner city housing programme&mdash;the Dublin Corporation one, with which I am most familiar, initiated by the previous Minister with the co-operation of the housing co-ordinator, Mr. Molloy&mdash;at maximum we are talking about 70 acres only of inner city land and of a maximum density of 20 houses per acre. Therefore we are talking about only, say, 1,400 or, being kind, no more than 2,000 houses.  There are thousands of houses in the inner city areas of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, to name but three of our major cities, which would benefit from a scheme of rehabilitation grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech in the Seanad a couple of weeks ago that the implementation of this Bill and the whole area of policy for which it is designed is as much concerned with planning as with housing.  I should like the Minister to avail of the opportunity&mdash;which I maintain he has under the Housing (Miscellaneous) Act&mdash;to ask those local authorities who wish to do so to draw up a scheme for the rehabilitation of certain areas of their inner city which they reckon could benefit from a scheme of unique rehabilitation grants, loans and so on.  This is not new territory for this House, and certainly not for the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>When last speaking I made brief <Col N="350" /> reference to the most recent joint housing conference between the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland and the Minister's Department from which a number of recommendations and proposals emerged now on file in the Minister's Department.  The Minister has the expertise.  Additionally, there is now sufficient accumulated experience in other western European countries, with similar legal and political systems to ours, to enable a scheme such as the one I propose to be drafted, not with ease but certainly, with hindsight, benefiting from the wisdom of experiences in other cities and States.</P>
    <P>In relation to the City of Dublin where the major problem exists, it is fortunate that we have at our disposal an immensely useful piece of housing research which was produced by Deirdre O'Connor, an architect, funded by the Cement-Roadstone group of companies. She obtained a Housing Research Fellow for 1976-77 and produced this report entitled <i>Housing in Dublin's Inner City.</i>  Undoubtedly it is the most definitive work that has been produced in terms of field survey.  It makes fascinating reading to the extent that it demonstrates what is the capacity for a creative programme of rehabilitation, on the one hand, and, on the other, what are the dangerous implications for not just pockets of the city but virtually entire zones within the area between the canals if some scheme of rehabilitation and conservation, with financial aids and loans, is not produced when many of these houses will get into a serious condition of obsolescence before the end of this century. We know the cost of replacement of units is extremely high, added to which there is the interim period of blight which has so scarred this city since 1965 or thereabouts.  Undoubtedly the Minister's Department have a copy of this report.  However, I should like to briefly put on the record of the House part of its conclusions and recommendations because undoubtedly it is the concern expressed in 1968-69 which produced the legislation we are now seeking to renew.  The Minister said in <Col N="351" /> his opening speech that the policy was under review, that whereas two years ago he thought he had got the policy right, he admitted now that he had second thoughts about it.  I welcome that kind of honesty in this House.  There is never anything lost by saying that one is looking at something openly.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister has opened the door I will suggest one candidate for entry into the policy that might be produced.  On page 97 of Deirdre O'Connor's report she states:</P>
    <P>It could reasonably be stated that Dublin's Inner City is experiencing a severe housing problem.  Combined as it is with a complex variety of other urban problems, it is apparent that without immediate action the residential population in the area will continue to decrease, and housing/environmental conditions continue to decline.  The Inner City communities have actively protested against their living conditions and the general public expresses little desire to live in the area given the adverse conditions. Present State policy follows the European and American attitude in wishing to preserve a residential content in the area, but may be in danger of failing in this aim unless it recognises the real extent of the present housing problem and combines general urban and housing policies with a serious strategy for residential renewal.</P>
    <P>She goes on:</P>
    <P>Given the available land in the Inner City it will be difficult to maintain the existing population level; to increase this level would require a radical change in present land-use and development policy.  However, it is possible to halt the present rapid decline in population and to provide good living conditions for present and future residents in the area.</P>
    <P>A policy of extensive rehabilitation combined with a steady input of redevelopment could improve existing housing conditions and prevent the <Col N="352" /> loss of more housing, upgrade the environment and provide new housing for persons living in overcrowded and unsuitable accommodation. </P>
    <P>She makes a number of recommendations which should go on the Official Report because they are the objectives of any policy that the Department might seriously consider.  This was a considered piece of research.  She says:</P>
    <P>Present redevelopment programmes and rehabilitation policies are inadequate, and cannot provide a solution to the housing problem.</P>
    <P>Future redevelopment must be more extensive if it is to eliminate overcrowding and solve the problem of housing shortage.</P>
    <P>Redevelopment must provide a sufficient range of house types and sizes to suit a variety of household groups.</P>
    <P>To prevent increasing social polarisation in the area, and to contribute to the development of a heterogeneous community, housing must be provided for all socioeconomic groups.  The Corporation must use its existing powers to encourage this development.</P>
    <P>To preserve the existing urban form, environmental standards should relate specifically to the Inner City rather than to suburban locations, and regulations governing redevelopment should be applied more flexibly.</P>
    <P>Present rehabilitation policy should be revised and should encourage more individuals to improve their dwellings by providing better grants.</P>
    <P>The Corporation should undertake the initiation, management and control of rehabilitation schemes, operate area rehabilitation programmes and engage in environmental improvement work.</P>
    <P>Before a realistic policy can be formulated to deal with housing problems in the area, it is essential that a conditions survey is undertaken to gauge the exact extent and location of the problem.</P>
    <P>The success of any future policy depends fundamentally on a serious State commitment to the renewal of the residential areas in the Inner City. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" /> This was a Dublin-based study but it could equally apply on a reduced scale to areas in Cork, Limerick and specifically in Waterford, because at the housing conference a field work study done in Waterford was presented by a Mr. Eugene Gribbin and a colleague whose name I cannot remember.  What Deirdre O'Connor called for here was a detailed survey on the ground.  She has provided the basis of where to look and how to do it.</P>
    <P>This is essentially the responsibility of the local authority and all I am asking the Minister to do is to give the green light to the local authority to initiate this kind of work and to make provision for adequate finance to be made available.  I am asking him to clear the ground in relation to queries that will undoubtedly be made by my colleagues in the housing authority as to whether the funding of such a study, which would amount to about £20,000 or £30,000, will come from the capital allocation deemed to be part of the construction account or whether it will come out of the housing revenue from rents and so on.  These points need to be clarified.  The Minister, as the political master responsible for housing and for the maintenance and management of housing stock, has&mdash;admitting the inadequacy of this legislation&mdash;the responsibility to give them the green light.</P>
    <P>The range of solutions exist in principle but what they need is the initiation of a course of solutions that will produce the detailed form of the scheme for which I am looking.  This will require a recognition in principle by the Minister and the Minister of State that part of the total housing budget currently made available for grants or an extra amount of capital, depending on how much the Department can get from the Department of Finance, will be set aside with a view to designing a special grants scheme for certain parts of the State where the existing housing stock is at risk of approaching obsolescence in a reasonably short time, with serious planning implications for the adjoining areas. It is also required that the Minister <Col N="354" /> release the hands of the local authority so that they can do the kind of research work that can only be done by them.  I do not expect the Department of the Environment to do the kind of detailed on the ground study that Deirdre O'Connor has referred to.  I have previously criticised the Government for increasingly tying the hands of the local authority.  In order to release the hands of the local authority so that they can respond to a politically originated motion of the housing committee of the corporation, it must be made clear from the Custom House where the funds required for such a study will come from.  They are not there at the moment.  If I am wrong in that, I would be happy to be corrected.</P>
    <P>The local authority who are always tight with money will not initiate a programme of study which will cost something in the region of £20,000 if they feel they will get no money at the end of it.  The Government should indicate, without committing themselves, that they are contemplating setting up such a scheme, that they recognise in principle the problem, and that in principle subject to a local authority putting forward a pilot scheme of rehabilitation, the Department will respond positively. We should certainly look at the problems of implementation which were thrown up in the British and Dutch experiences of housing action, because we can benefit from it.</P>
    <P>When I refer to the local authority producing a viable scheme I mean viable in the sense that the administrative procedures attaching to such a programme have been worked out in considerable detail.  This is a complex area which is compounded, in the context of Dublin, by the nature of the ownership of many of the houses and housing areas to which I refer.  Frequently the houses most at risk are not owned by the residents in legal terms but in terms of security of tenure, which they hold under the Landlord and Tenant Act.  They might as well own the house because they have full protection under the 1931 Landlord and Tenant Act and <Col N="355" /> their grandchildren and great grandchildren can stay in it.  Frequently they stay in these houses at ludicrously low rents, with the result that the landlords will not do repairs because they are not getting any revenue from those houses.</P>
    <P>Some legal method has to be found to overcome the reluctance of some landlords to carry out repairs.  A one-off <i>ex-gratia</i> payment could be made to landlords who withhold permission for rehabilitation grants on the ground that they have not got any return from those houses for 25 years.  The local authority grants scheme enables local authority tenants to get housing improvement grants for the local authority houses in which they are the tenants, not the owners.  I am not sure if the same procedure exists for privately owned houses.  If that is the case, the problem to which I am referring does not occur.  There will be a reluctance on the part of some tenants to carry out repairs when they do not own their houses and many people may not be in a position economically to pay for the repairs.  The scheme of rehabilitation referred to, and which is in existence in Britain, Holland and other parts of Europe, requires that a whole area be done at the same time rather than the individual owner-occupied orientated rehabilitation scheme we are talking about.  Frequently rehabilitation will include area improvement works in the streets, gardens, footpaths and so on, which form part of the residential environment. This problem has to be recognised and overcome.</P>
    <P>I could go on at some length about this but I do not think it is necessary. The political will required to initiate this scheme is now extremely urgent.  The 1977 statistics were used in the Deirdre O'Connor report recently published.  The 1979 census figures confirmed the rapid decline to which she referred in population in the inner city, and the trend is accelerating.</P>
    <P>This Act which we are being asked to renew in reality does nothing to protect the housing stock, although its one <Col N="356" /> defence is that it brings into the inner city area certain high income socioeconomic groups to which she referred and who would otherwise not come in there.  Regrettably from experience I know their tenancy is much more transient than the lower income group who lived there before.  The population for the inner city is declining despite the presence and continued renewal of this Act.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to consider positively my suggestions, to begin a process of discussion and negotiation with the major authorities affected and to invite the local authorities which might be interested to respond.  As the Minister said, the operation of the 1969 Act confined itself in the main to two major authorities, Dublin and Cork Corporations, despite the fact that 38 authorities operated it at different times.</P>
    <P>The political will across the board at local level in Dublin Corporation would respond positively to the type of schemes I am suggesting.  If the Minister has come to a cul-de-sac in one particular policy review in relation to this area, I am suggesting another area he might look at.  I hope he respects the fact that these suggestions are made in a constructive sense.  Having made what I think were legitimate political criticisms of what I consider to be a bankruptcy of policy, I am now suggesting something which does not necessarily have to be considered to be partisan, and it is something my constituency colleague, the leader of the Fianna Fáil group, Deputy Seán Moore, would welcome.</P>
    <P>We want the Minister to study this report and the reports made by his own officials on the joint housing conference and to invite the affected local authorities to discuss the problem and the possibility of movement in that area. They will look for a financial commitment to a specific exclusive system of grants at serious economic levels.  Last day Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke in terms of £5,000 and £6,000&mdash;I am not going to put a figure on this&mdash;but we are talking about something beyond the £600 grant and the £2,500 local authority <Col N="357" /> loan.  We want some kind of serious financial commitment designed exclusively to confine itself to the areas where this problem exists.  There is ample precedent with Gaeltacht housing grants, for example, and with the skewing of the local authority construction capital to certain areas of the country, for the Minister to deal with any political criticism&mdash;criticism that will fall on any Minister&mdash;coming from his own colleagues as well as the Opposition&mdash;about being unfair to one part of the country at the expense of another because the housing problem is universal and so on.</P>
    <P>I recognise that that argument could be put forward, but the Minister could defend it on the grounds that there is a precedent and, on top of that, there is a critical need to defend and hold part of the housing stocks of our inner cities because the cost in money terms of replacing them would be enormous.  The other political commitment required is to get local authorities to do the basic research and field study which is a prerequisite before they can come up with a detailed programme of rehabilitation plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of this opportunity to say a few words on this order which relates to a major problem, that is, the shabby rundown state of Dublin city, although I suppose the same could be said to be true, perhaps to a lesser extent, about some of our other cities and towns.  I believe this problems is rooted in the lack of political will to do something about it.  When I say that I do not mean to cast aspersions on the present incumbent of the Department of the Environment. For a long time all Ministers at the Custom House failed to provide political structures and to give the necessary political go ahead for the local authorities to solve the problem of dereliction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor with which this continuance order is connected, so far as Dublin city is concerned, is the housing situation.  It might be odd to say that the shortage of housing contributes to the <Col N="358" /> dereliction of houses but it does in my view.  Due to the grim shortage of houses in Dublin, which is becoming more acute every day, there is a huge demand for private accommodation so much so that a lot of people are prepared to live in extremely overcrowded conditions, in extremely puny accommodation.  It is common for families with one, two or three children to live in a very small room.  It is very common, as anyone who represents the city knows, to have seven or eight families in a seven or eight roomed house, in other words one family per room and eight families sharing the same bathroom and toilet.  Nothing contributes more to the running down of the housing stock than over-tenanting.  There may be 25 or 30 people in the same house none of them responsible for the upkeep, repair or cleaning of the house. This is a major problem.</P>
    <P>I have said many times before that this city is being &ldquo;ghettoised&rdquo; in this fashion.  That is not too strong a word to use in this context.  There are housing by-laws which Deputy Quinn was instrumental in having drawn up in Dublin Corporation.  I am a member of the housing committee as I was when the by-laws were drawn up.  We discussed this problem last week in Dublin Corporation. The fact is that even though there are housing by-laws they are not enforced.  One might ask why they are not.  The answer is probably two-fold. Firstly, the officials in Dublin Corporation feel they cannot pursue landlords who might proceed to let their tenants go and thereby increase the demand on Dublin Corporation for housing.  It is directly linked with the insufficiency of the housing output by local authorities in Dublin.  Secondly, they do not have enough staff but even if they did the conviction would not be there to pursue the implementation of the housing by-laws.  I am not casting any reflection whatever on the officials of Dublin Corporation because if I was in their position I would lack the moral conviction to do so.  It has to do, as Deputy Quinn said, with the need for political will to sort out the problem.</P>
    <P>I believe that the &ldquo;slumification&rdquo; of <Col N="359" /> Dublin city will be a highly sensitive political issue before long.  More and more people are embarrassed when anybody comes to visit their city from abroad.  I have heard many people say this and also members of the diplomatic corps who are accredited to the country and have an affection for it.  When visitors from their countries come here they bring them on certain routes to avoid the dereliction of the city.  It is very bad when it gets to that stage.  There will be no issue more sensitive or burning than this one in a short time.  It is already building up.  The restoration of some kind of beauty to Dublin city would have to be considered in a wider context than this order but it is related.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is broadening it a bit.  This order deals only with the change of use and the demolition of habitable housing.  I will give the Deputy a lot of latitude, but the question of dereliction in the centre of Dublin is a broader issue than that.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so far as it applies to residential property.  It is not directly relevant to other properties but it is connected. As a former Lord Mayor of this city and as a humble citizen, it is something which concerns me greatly. When I was Lord Mayor I was pressed to say that Dublin reminded me of a second-rate knackers yard.  That is strong language and was quoted recently by <i>The Irish Times</i> in an article on this issue.  It is a disgrace and something will have to be done about it.  It will only be done if the people in the Custom House begin to tackle the problem and provide the political structures to tackle the problem which are not there at present. The former Dublin city manager Mr. Molloy, said in a speech he made about 18 months ago that the political structures are archaic and were designed to meet conditions of 50 years ago and <Col N="360" /> were not suited to the conditions of 1980.</P>
      <P>In relation to the technicalities and so on of restoring or maintaining the housing stock I would have to yield to the vast knowledge and experience of Deputy Quinn on the subject not only as an architect but as a very active member for many years in the housing area in Dublin city.  I support what he and Deputy Fitzpatrick said about the need for substantial grants way outside the normal home improvement grants for the maintenance and restoration of the housing stock.</P>
      <P>Why is the problem of dilapidation such a unique Irish problem? Throughout western Europe one does not see anything like the dereliction of Dublin city or, to a lesser extent, Cork city.  What solutions have they come up with abroad?  What have they done in London, Paris and Copenhagen?  How have they coped with the problem?  We should be looking at the solutions achieved elsewhere to see if we can apply them to our situation.  I should like to make a heartfelt plea that something major be done to attack the problem of dereliction in urban areas and to restore grace and beauty to this city of ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the contributions made to the debate which were, by and large, constructive. I appreciate the tenor and motivation behind what was said.  Some Deputies queried the powers available to housing authorities under the 1969 Act in relation to private houses being allowed to fall into disrepair until they become unfit for human habitation.  Section 5 (1) of that Act provides that where a housing authority is of the opinion that a person caused or permitted a house to deteriorate to the point where it became uninhabitable for the purpose of evading the provisions of the Act, the housing authority may serve a notice on the owner or on anyone with an interest in the house requiring them to make it habitable within a specified time.  If the person fails to carry out the work section <Col N="361" /> 6 (1) provides for a fine of £100 on summary conviction and also empowers the housing authority to carry out the work. Section 7 of the Act makes provision for recovery by the housing authority of expenses incurred in carrying out the repairs.  There is a right of appeal to the circuit court against a reinstatement notice or against the housing authority for the recovery of expenses.  This is just for information.</P>
      <P>In general, the debate on this motion has provided a useful exchange of information and opinions which will be helpful when the future form of legislative controls over the demolition or change of use of habitable houses is being decided.  Some statements made by Deputies opposite were, perhaps, completely predictable.  By and large I thank the Deputies who spoke for their responsible approach to a matter the principles involved in which are of common ground to all political parties.</P>
      <P>Because of the reasonable attitude of speakers, I have no desire to introduce a controversial note in these concluding remarks.  However, to set the record straight, I find it necessary to remove doubts to which some statements may have given rise and to correct other comments which were not completely in accord with facts.  Deputies criticised the failure of the Minister to fulfil the undertaking given in 1977 to produce proposals for permanent legislation before the expiration of the current continuance order.  In my earlier statement moving the motion I explained why it has not been possible as yet to formulate these proposals.  The different points raised by Deputies on the subject during the debate in themselves bear out the difficulties to which I referred&mdash;that it is extremely difficult to devise controls which will be socially and economically acceptable, which will be enough to provide a desirable measure of flexibility and, at the same time, deal fairly with the question of compensation in cases of genuine hardship and firm enough to ensure fair play for those displaced or discommoded by the operation of the controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="362" /> It is fair to point out that some of the reasons for the delay in bringing forward a permanent core arose directly out of arguments advanced during the last decade in this House, including those put forward at the time by Deputy Quinn, who was particularly critical of the delay.  Others arose subsequently when revised proposals were drafted and were carefully considered by my Department and other interested Departments.  I put it to the House that the reasons I have stated confirm that there are difficult legal, administrative and social problems involved which are not easy of resolution. But these issues are so fundamental that they must be resolved before we can decide on the form that new permanent legislation for the purpose should take. We now intend to take a very definite decision shortly in relation to this whole matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that the demolition of houses could be controlled by removing that work from the exempted development regulations made under the Planning Act, 1963.  This suggestion was made by him in December 1977, when the previous continuation order in relation to the Housing Act, 1969, was before the Dáil.  It was carefully considered at that time, but it was found then that the controls under the planning code would not be an adequate substitute for the 1969 Act.  In operating planning control, a local authority must have regard to the proper planning and development of their area. In other words when considering matters within the planning code a local authority or a planning authority is restricted to considering matters relating solely to the proper planning and development of its area.  Where a sound and occupied house is in an area zoned for mixed development a local authority could not legally refuse planning permission for the change of use of the house from residential to commercial purposes. The considerations which govern controls under the 1969 Act are strictly housing ones which are not appropriate to planning controls.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to the need to <Col N="363" /> have regard to the relative urgency of housing needs in various areas when the total capital allocation for local authority housing is being apportioned amongst local authorities.  I want to assure the Deputy that this has been the practice and policy of my Department. Dublin Corporation in particular cannot complain in this regard&mdash;about 25 per cent of all housing needs in the country are located in Dublin city, but the corporation has been allocated some 33? per cent of the total capital available this year for local authority housing, although the proportion of families on the Dublin waiting lists comprising three or more persons, is lower than in many other areas, including my own county of Kerry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to the desirability of providing a special scheme of grants for inner-city rehabilitation. While such a scheme could have attractions, the Deputy will appreciate that public capital resources are not unlimited and to give preferential treatment to one localised section of housing means that other sections must be deprived.  I have sympathy with the idea, however, and the new Housing Act has been so drafted that such a scheme could be legally provided when resources for the work can be allocated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also stressed the need for a specially generous scheme of grants to encourage the conservation of existing houses.  In fact, the Minister for the Environment introduced just such a scheme in December 1977.</P>

In the full year 1977, 11,211 reconstruction grants were allocated by my <Col N="364" /> Department.  So far, in 1979, a total of 53,000 applications for house improvement grants have been submitted to the Department.  This shows the direct result of the improved grants and that they do offer an incentive to people to preserve existing housing stocks.</P>

      <P>The difference is so large and is so encouraging that I do not have to elaborate.  The number of grants allocated in 1977 was 11,211.  So far this year 53,000 applications have been submitted to the Department.  In passing I want to qualify Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion that the construction grant prior to December 1977 was £400 in every case.  In fact the maximum State grant was £200.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, plus other incidental grants which have been substantially improved.  I refer to water and sewerage grants.</P>
      <P>With regard to the inner city areas and their preservation and revitalisation as living neighbourhoods the Government is very concerned to help in achieving this objective.  However, I would point out that the control of the demolition or change of use of housing is but one of the considerations which are relevant and, on the basis of appeals made to my Department, not as important as Deputies might expect.  Less than half of the appeals received in my Department since 1 January 1978, have related to inner city properties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the more positive side of reviving old residential areas, especially in central Dublin, I must mention the local authority housing developments there which are tremendously expensive undertakings compared to providing similar houses outside these areas.  I would also remind Deputies of the Government's clear and unequivocal commitment to the inner city, exemplified by their setting up an interdepartmental committee in July 1978, to examine in depth the varied and complex problems of the Dublin inner city area, in establishing an inner city group to implement the recommendations of the Committee and develop action programmes, and in allocating £1 million this year to underpin the efforts of this group.  With due respect to the Deputies <Col N="366" /> opposite who, when in office, did little effective for the inner city beyond extending this Act for a period of three years from 1974 to 1977 and who also, while in office, stripped housing policy of any effective method of preserving the inner city, I do not think I need apologise for the present Government who, since they came to office, have revitalised all arms of housing policy.</P>
    <P>I do not deny the shortcomings of the existing housing controls, though I would point out that housing authorities have adequate powers under permanent housing legislation to deal with major financial institutions who, it is alleged, hold mortgage and title deeds to vacant houses should these houses be let fall into disrepair.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies that the problem of effective controls can best be resolved by consultation with local authorities who are most directly concerned with the problems these controls have been provided to ease.  This is precisely why I am assembling all available information, all informed opinion and, in particular, the fruits of practical experience at local authority level so that a set of controls most appropriate to the present problems can be devised.  While this exercise is being carried out&mdash;and work on it is now in progress&mdash;it would be unwise to allow the current controls to be dismantled.  For that reason I ask Dáil Éireann to agree to the motion I have moved.</P>

      <P>Is é príomh-chuspóir an Bhille seo cumhachtaí reachtúla a thabhairt dom chun rialacháin a dhéanamh maidir le deimhniúchán mairnéalach agus gnéithe a bhaineann leis sin.

      <P>This Bill is a straight-forward enabling measure.  It empowers me, as Minister for Tourism and Transport, to make regulations specifying the number of qualified officers which a ship must carry; to specify standards of competence to be attained and other conditions to be satisfied by officers; and to make provision for the conduct of examinations and for the issue of certificates of competency.  The remaining provisions of the Bill cover such matters as exemptions, offences, penalties, repeals and inquiries into an officer's conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement that officers acting in certain capacities on board certain ships must hold certificates of competency is, in origin and in essence, a safety requirement. An insufficiency of competent officers <Col N="368" /> on board a ship might imperil the safety of the ship, the crew, the passengers and the cargo.  The existing statutory requirements governing the certification of seamen on board Irish ships and on foreign ships carrying passengers between places in the State have their basis in the Merchant Ship ping Act, 1894 as amended by the Act of 1906.  In recent years it has become evident that the existing legislative provisions in relation to the certification of ships' officers required up-dating to enable the merchant shipping industry to keep pace with modern developments. The aim and tendency of the modern shipping industry are to have larger ships with more automation and smaller, more adaptable and more highly trained crews.  The maritime authorities of most mainland European countries have in recent years altered the manning requirements of their national fleets, thus giving them a competitive economic edge over the Irish and, indeed, the British merchant shipping industry.  This has been recognised in the findings of two committees of inquiry into aspects of the British shipping industry, the Pearson Report 1967 and the Rochdale Report 1970.</P>
    <P>The British authorities have already made arrangements for the introduction of a new updated certification structure for deck officers for merchant ships under regulations made in 1977 and 1978. The new UK regulations will become compulsory from 1 September 1981.  In the meantime the British authorities are operating a dual certificate system with the old certificates under the 1894 Act and the equivalent new certificates being awarded to successful candidates.</P>
    <P>There is reciprocal recognition of certificates of competency granted by Ireland, Britain, Australia, India, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and New Zealand.  These reciprocal recognition arrangements provide considerable employment opportunities for Irish ships' officers particularly in the British merchant fleet.  Having regard to the small Irish merchant fleet, it is desirable that these employment opportunities should continue to be available.  This requires <Col N="369" /> that the reciprocal recognition of Irish certificates of competency by Britain should continue.  To achieve this it is necessary to move in concert with developments in Britain and, therefore, enabling legislation on the lines proposed in this Bill is required without delay to facilitate the introduction here of a new system of certificates of competency with whatever adaptations may be appropriate to Irish conditions.</P>
    <P>I propose to make the necessary regulations for the new ships' officer structure and related matters as soon as possible after the passage of this Bill. The shipping sector here&mdash;through the medium of the Irish Chamber of Shipping&mdash;have already submitted very useful comments to my Department on certain aspects of the proposals and I will be taking these into account in making the new regulations.  I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the valuable and informed observations which are submitted on a regular basis to my Department by the Irish Chamber of Shipping on shipping matters.</P>
    <P>Associated with the revised structure of certificates of competency, the British authorities have also re-defined the &ldquo;trading areas&rdquo; which govern the manning complement of British ships.  The Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, provides for &ldquo;foreign-going ships&rdquo; and &ldquo;home-trade ships&rdquo;.  There is also the law at present in the case of Irish ships.  Under the British Merchant Shipping (Certification of Deck Officers) Regulations, 1977, the trading areas have been re-defined.  The old home-trade limits have been replaced by two trading areas, namely, the near continental trading area and the middle trading area.  I intend in the proposed new regulations to re-define the trading areas governed by the 1894 Act as they apply to Irish-registered ships.  While the re-defined areas will probably follow fairly closely the British precedent, the matter is being examined and discussions have been taking place with the Irish merchant shipping industry with a view to meeting as far as possible any special requirements of the industry.</P>
    <P>The law governing merchant shipping <Col N="370" /> here is extensive and complex.  It is, in addition, based on legislation which in many cases goes back a long time.  My Department have been endeavouring to up-date and codify the various enactments involved, but this is a slow process as Deputies will appreciate.  The present Bill may be regarded as a further and significant step in this updating process.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the present Bill provide a basis for the continued development of the Irish merchant shipping sector.  The Bill will enable us to move into line with international practice especially in the UK and it will also facilitate the preservation of the reciprocity arrangements I have mentioned in relation to the recognition of certificates of competency.  I am happy, therefore, to recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister stated, the Bill is quite straightforward and contains no very tremendous controversial points. Obviously, we welcome any Bill which improves the safety of ships at sea.  The Bill begs the question as to what is the definition of &ldquo;ship&rdquo; and what size vessels are covered by the legislation here before us.  Does it apply to any vessel which is registered in the State or does it apply to boats which are not even registered?  I would like the Minister in his reply to endeavour to clarify that.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill refers to ships operating from this State and between ports within the State.  Does it provide that they be manned by properly trained personnel and sufficient numbers of properly trained personnel?  Does it make provision for ships coming from other states having a deficiency in personnel and in training?  That must give rise to considerable concern.  The section says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.&mdash;This Act applies to every ship registered in the State under the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1968, and also to any ship registered elsewhere which carries passengers between places in the State or on voyages which begin and end at the same place in the State and on which <Col N="371" /> the ship calls at no place outside the State. </P>
    <P>Why is there not some provision to cover a ship which starts its voyage in another state and finishes its trip in this State?  It is obvious that a number of nations throughout the world have standards which are not satisfactory and which must have caused serious accidents and disasters at sea and will cause others in the future unless something is done.  The Minister has said in his speech that there is reciprocal recognition of certificates of competency granted by Ireland, Britain, Australia, India, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and New Zealand.  That is all very fine, but it leaves a huge vacuum. What about the hundreds of other states which are operating maritime fleets whose standards obviously are not too high?  We are tagging along with British standards, as is stated in the Bill and in the Minister's statement.  Those standards are probably the highest in the world, but what about Liberia and Panama, for instance, two countries which are notorious for operating shipping fleets under flags of convenience?  I have grave doubts about the competence of their crews, their qualifications and their numbers.</P>
    <P>It has been stated in shipping circles in this country over the years that our shipping companies operate at a great disadvantage in that our rules governing the manning of ships are so stringent that we are quite uneconomic when it comes to competing with other countries such as those I have mentioned which do not have the same stringent manning regulations and thus can operate at a far lesser cost.  Until such time as there is an international agreement between all maritime countries&mdash;all countries for that matter; we have heard, for instance, of the Swiss navy and whether it is fictitious or factual I do not know&mdash;which operate fleets of ships ensuring that the same standards operate within all those fleets, the situation will remain very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have had a whole <Col N="372" /> series of disasters involving ships, in particular oil tankers, not too far off our coast; in fact some of them ended up on our coast.  This must cause concern.  Until an international convention such as I have mentioned is drawn up to ensure a uniform level of qualifications and of manning amongst ships, any ship which does not reach the standards that we are setting by means of this Bill should not be allowed into our waters.  It is about time that the responsible maritime nations of the world got together to see that this type of action is taken to safeguard their own shipping fleets and the people of other maritime countries who would be threatened by the consequence of any major disaster, principally pollution.  The disasters which have occurred must bring into question the competence of the people operating those ships.  Liberia and Panama seem to operate a considerable percentage of the world's tonnage of oil tankers and if their standards are not up to scratch it is high time that something was done about that.</P>
    <P>This country is a member of the InterGovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices in that organisation to see that uniformity is brought about.  We cannot afford to have a <i>Torrey Canyon</i>-or an <i>Amoco Cadiz</i>-type disaster though we had some lesser problems in recent years.  Apart from the environmental damage that would result from a major disaster, the cost to the country would be immense and we are inviting that type of disaster by not insisting that those who operate ships in our waters comply with our regulations.  Last year there was an incident in which an oil tanker, admittedly small, was damaged after hitting rocks off the west coast and immediately being ordered out of British waters and into Irish waters, subsequently finishing up off the Irish coast.  More recently, in September last, there was a collision off the Wicklow coast between an oil tanker and a cargo ship.  Luckily the oil tanker was empty, because otherwise we would have had a major pollution problem around our coast.</P>
    <P>People in shipping circles are not convinced, and I do not think that the <Col N="373" /> Minister is convinced either, that the people operating ships in our waters have the necessary qualifications or that the vessels are being manned at the proper level.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to ensure that there is set up an international convention so that we might ensure that nobody entering our waters would risk disaster merely because they do not apply the proper safety regulations or do not have the proper trained personnel or manning numbers.  The reason for foreign countries being able to compete at rates much lower than ours is that they are not providing either the proper type of trained personnel or personnel in sufficient numbers.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to Mr. De Courcy Ireland who has repeatedly been pointing out the hazards that have been created by the lack of proper standards and who continues to call for a proper set of standards.  Obviously, there is apathy among the public in this regard. The only time there is an outcry or a demand for improved standards is when there is either a disaster or a near disaster. This is not good enough.  We must ensure, by the imposition unilaterally of proper standards, that the risk of disaster in the future is eliminated in so far as possible.</P>
    <P>Regarding the smaller type vessels, including trawlers and cruisers, I asked originally for a definition of a ship.  I would imagine that any vessel registered to carry passengers or cargo could be classified as a ship but I know from experience that the standard of personnel operating boats such as cruisers or trawlers which are registered leaves much to be desired.  It is surprising that there are not more accidents in this area. Quite frequently there are accidents involving such vessels off the west coast but this is not surprising when usually the outcome of an inquiry into any such accident reveals that the crew were not properly trained, that they did not have a skipper's ticket and were not able to operate the radar system or other navigational aids in the boat concerned. It is not uncommon in this age of affluence <Col N="374" /> for people to have some very sophisticated equipment on board but not having the necessary training to enable them to use that equipment so that what they have in effect is a status symbol type of equipment.</P>
    <P>Recently BIM stated that they would not give grants to people who are not qualified skippers.  That is a wise decision because up to now boats have been operated by people whose training left much to be desired and which certainly was not geared to operate the equipment that is essential for those engaged in such activity.  Some of these boats or ships do not have such basic equipment as flares or life-jackets.  Is it fair to our lifeboat men that they should have to put to sea in extremely bad weather conditions because of the incompetency of the personnel on those boats that get into difficulty?</P>
    <P>This legislation should extend to every boat registered in the State, be it a ship, a trawler a cruiser or anything else.  It is not right that any of the life-saving service people should be put at risk to save people who fail to make the proper arrangements for safety before putting to sea.  This situation was brought to our notice very strongly in August last in regard to the Fastnet yacht race.  Admittedly, August is not a month in which we expect to experience storms of the magnitude experienced on that occasion, but severe gales are not unprecedented around the middle of August.  When that disaster occurrred in August, the lifeboat men on the southern coast put to sea in desperate conditions to rescue dozens if not hundreds of people.  Much credit is due to them for their efforts on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of training and of sufficient personnel, there is also the problem of our not having a proper radio service around our coast.  About 10 years ago there was a disaster involving an aircraft flying from Cork to London in which a considerable number of people were killed.  Some hours had elapsed before there was an indication that the disaster had occurred and even yet nobody knows for certain where the accident <Col N="375" /> occurred.  The reason for this is that there was not then a sufficient radio link between the south coast of Ireland and the west coast of Great Britain. There is the same difficulty today in regard to shipping.  There are blind spots around our coast where if ships run into trouble, there is no way in which a distress single can be picked up by the radio stations.  We are far too dependent on Lands End and other British radio stations to do our work for us.  They are the people who usually find out if a vessel is in trouble off our coast.  At the time of the Fastnet disaster there was proved the need for proper radio facilities, especially off the south and east coasts.  What happened then was that the signals from the boats in distress went to Lands End, from where they had to be transferred to the rescue co-ordinating centre at Shannon and from Shannon transferred to the various lifeboat stations around the coast.  This operation entailed delays of minutes and in some cases of hours in effecting a rescue operation.  We must ensure that there is set up a proper rescue service operation with radio stations at strategic points around the coast.</P>
    <P>The increase in shipping and boating activities makes this Bill imperative.  We cannot afford to take the risk of organised confusion which really is what we have now.  The British and French authorities have gone to great lengths in the last couple of years in regard to the Channel, where they have set up a system of laneways.  Ships operating in those waters must conform to very stringent regulations.  We do not have a similar system but it is essential that such be introduced in the Irish Sea in particular because those waters, according to my information, are being used as a route for ships that are not put into the Channel because their equipment may not be up to the standard required by the British and French authorities.</P>
    <P>The lame ducks in the shipping world are using the Irish Sea more and more.  I am told there is no regulation of traffic there; it is getting heavier and heavier <Col N="376" /> and is criss-crossing in a very dangerous fashion.  The time is overdue for regulations to be made to cope with this problem.  There is a constant stream of traffic from the port of Dublin and from Dún Laoghaire to Liverpool and Birkenhead, from Belfast and Larne to Stranraer, Port Patrick, Heysham and other places.  It is only a matter of time before we have a serious accident or a series of accidents in the Irish Sea.  As I pointed out earlier, there was an accident last September off the Wicklow coast. We must provide a proper laneway system.  It is not sufficient to have our ships properly manned with trained personnel if other countries are operating a haphazard manning system with poorly trained personnel.  We should see to it that these people obey our laws and regulations.  Negotiations should be entered into with the British authorities to ensure that proper lanes are set out in the Irish Sea in order to reduce the possibility of accidents occurring.</P>
    <P>The time is long overdue for us to provide a coastguard service, to watch for irregularities and dangerous practices and to be on the alert when a tragedy occurs. We are leaving far too much to chance and that should not be the case. There should be proper supervision, adequate safeguards and observation of what is going on.  At the moment if an accident occurs we hear about it probably from Lands End radio station and, as a result, our rescue services then come into operation, quite often belatedly.  I should like to see us operating our own safeguard systems. At the moment we are not facing up to our responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am perturbed about section 2.  I repeat I do not believe that the ships of any country should be allowed into our territorial waters when they are not fulfilling the same stringent regulations that we are demanding of our own shipping companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on this measure on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Corish, our spokesperson on tourism and transport.  I am also particularly <Col N="377" /> pleased because there are in my constituency and in my party organisation a number of people who have talked to me about this Bill and who are working seafarers with much experience.</P>
      <P>In his opening statement the Minister declared that this was a straightforward enabling measure.  Perhaps the Minister will be in a position to confirm that it will enable us to meet the SOLAS Convention of IMCO.  When the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EEC discussed the marine pollution convention and SOLAS, we were informed by the relevant departmental authorities that enabling legislation was required to meet the SOLAS convention.  In so far as this measure enables us to do that, the Labour Party welcome it.</P>
      <P>The whole question of shipping traffic around our coasts and the competence of those who operate that traffic is a matter of increasing concern, as Deputy Deasy outlined.  Frankly, he has covered most of the points that needed to be made and there is no need to repeat them.  I said yesterday that the marine resources of the State, taken in terms of the percentage of coastline which we have as a ratio of the total area of this island, are probably higher than in any other country in the EEC and any damage to those resources is potentially enormous.  Last week the Minister for Finance sought a Supplementary Estimate to cover merely the inquiry costs of the Whiddy disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about something that is of increasing relevance and importance to the economic and environmental life of this State and in this measure we are talking specifically about regulations which the Minister has yet to produce but which he will be empowered to enforce under this legislation.  They will cover the working conditions and the safety standards of workers at sea, male and female.  The Labour Party welcome the introduction of such an enabling measure.  The conditions for workers at sea, as set out in the 1894 Act and in the supplementary Act introduced in the early part of this are adequate. The rights and responsibilities of <Col N="378" /> such workers do not meet with modern standards and certainly they do not meet with trade union practice on land.</P>
    <P>I note with some concern that while the Minister has consulted with the Irish Shipping Chamber he makes no similar references to the trade union counterpart. We have a developing merchant shipping sector.  The most healthy part of it is the State sector&mdash;Irish Shipping declared a profit last year and the B &amp; I shipping line are displaying vigour with regard to the development of new modes of shipping.  Deputy Deasy raised the question of what constitutes a ship.  Undoubtedly a jet foil would fall within that category.  When drafting the regulations that will become operative under this legislation, I hope the Minister will consult with the ICTU, with the Irish Seamen's Union and with the British-based seamen's union which has a considerable number of members who are Irish nationals and to whom the question of reciprocity is important.  I hope the Minister in his reply will indicate, if possible, the time-table envisaged in relation to such measures.</P>
    <P>I think that on Committee Stage the interpretation of section 2 may be clarified.  It appears to exclude a large number of merchant ships that come into our waters on the grounds that they are not registered within the State and are not regularly plying passenger traffic between an Irish port and another port.  I am assuming that the second category of vessels would be regular passenger vessels such as the Le Havre-Rosslare ferry or the B &amp; I ferry.  In the latter case it is Irish registered but its counterpart would be the British rail ferry from Holyhead to Dún Laoghaire.  However, what is excluded is the category of merchant vessels who regularly ply commercial trade into our ports and who are registered in another State.</P>
    <P>There may be a good reason why this section is so confined.  It may be that, taken in conjunction with SOLAS, the kind of added protection the Labour Party and Deputy Deasy are looking for is covered.  I hope the Minister will be able to clarify that point.  If he is not able <Col N="379" /> to tell us that SOLAS covers our concerns, we should have another look at the section because it is of considerable importance.  The rest of the Bill hangs on that section which determines to which category of vessel, or crew, the other provisions of the Bill apply.  If we exclude a large proportion of the vessels coming into our ports which constitute the sort of threat Deputy Deasy referred to in the Irish Sea, then how enabling is this piece of legislation?</P>
    <P>I am sure all Members will agree that we have not seen enough marine legislation here from different governments.  I will not place on the shoulders of the Minister responsibility for neglect in the past, but I query the wisdom of the Minister confining himself in such an enabling piece of legislation to ships of a particular kind, that is ships registered here&mdash;that makes sense&mdash;and ships that ply a certain type of traffic on a regular basis between our ports and other ports. The Minister should include in an enabling Bill provisions for future regulations to apply to a wider category of ships and, at the same time, the orders he is about to make should be confined to the categories of ships defined in section 2. That is not an unreasonable request and, given the nature of the legislation, it is something the Minister should seriously consider.  In four or five years' time we could find ourselves in a situation seeking to have implemented on third-party vessels, vessels that do not meet the qualifications under section 2, the same standards <i>vis-à-vis</i> competency and so on, and finding that we were debarred from doing that because section 2 is so restricted.  We should not lose this opportunity to broaden the potential scope of this legislation while at the same time recognising that for a variety of administrative and legal reasons the regulations the Minister proposes to introduce will, for the time being, be confined to the two categories of merchant traffic to which section 2 applies.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Chair has been lenient in enabling a discussion to take place about radio control and so on <Col N="380" /> around our coast, areas of growing concern to all Members.  It is not coincidental that those who have spoken represent coastal areas and have a direct and critical interest in such matters.  From my point of view I can testify that that interest and awareness are growing.  There is a public demand for a better understanding of what is happening around our coast and beyond the horizon.  It behoves the Minister concerned to move in the direction of a comprehensive marine policy of which this legislation would be a part.  Questions have been asked in the House about such matters as a life-saving service, a coastguard service and adequate radio communication. They are all relevant and do not necessarily fall within the realm of this Bill.  However, the Minister should indicate if we can expect from his Department in the next few years&mdash;I am aware of the personnel constraints that exist&mdash;a White Paper or Green Paper on Irish marine policy or if we can expect a series of discussion documents which would address themselves to the problems referred to by Deputy Deasy.</P>
    <P>I would like those documents to deal with the question of sea traffic in the Irish Sea because there is no doubt that the volume of traffic there is becoming increasingly critical.  The volume of traffic appears to have increased considerably. The crossings from east to west and west to east are constant and the vessel to be used on the B &amp; I jet foil service will cross that sea at great speed. Lack of knowledge of the traffic in that area will intensify the possibility of an accident.  That vessel will travel at a speed faster than any of the traditional orthodox vessels that will be in the Irish Sea at the time.  We desperately need to know the volume of that traffic and the method of monitoring it.  We need to have in some embryo form regulated shipping lanes, not as elaborate as the British Channel because the volume of traffic would not warrant it.  We need something to accommodate the increase in traffic.  That requires co-operation between the shore-based authorities on both sides of the Irish Sea, a co-operation that <Col N="381" /> did not exist at the time of the <i>Cristos Bitas</i> incident 18 months ago.</P>
    <P>That requires the provision of extra financial resources to oversee the competency of the supervision up and down the Irish Sea.  I hope the commercial viability that has been demonstrated by the B &amp; I and Irish Shipping Limited will be such that we could reasonably hope to levy part of the cost of those extra measures.  In this regard we are talking about the safety of workers at sea, of passengers and the safety of property carried by workers at sea in the form of cargo.  In addition, we are also talking about the safety of the coastal zone of our State and that of our neighbour from damage brought upon it by the destruction of vessels due to mistakes, incompetence or lack of standards which could wreak enormous environmental damage. Members are aware of the Whiddy Island disaster and they recognise how serious and realistic such a disaster could be.  We have an added reality in the Irish Sea from Windscale.</P>
    <P>A small ship was in the Irish Sea yesterday protesting about the lack of adequate safeguards in relation to the movement of nuclear waste up and down that sea.  I look forward to the Minister publishing the regulations and I urge him to ensure that there are adequate consultations with the trade union movement in general, if he has not done so already.  I should like to know if it will be possible for the Minister to ensure that a discussion paper is published in the near future on where the Government and the Department see marine policy developing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  This is important legislation which involves, not only safety but job opportunities. It is vital that we have competent personnel looking after our ships and that the safety standards which protect passengers, crew, ships and cargo be maintained.  People who go to sea must have opportunities for self-advancement. With this enabling legislation there are such opportunities.  This legislation will enable the Minister to <Col N="382" /> bring in standards of competency on a par with those required in other countries. If we were seen to lag behind, opportunities for our seamen would slip away.  It is vital that they should not be limited in scope for self-advancement, and I welcome the opportunities given to them under this legislation.</P>
      <P>We are continuously improving technology and automation and it is vital that people be equipped to deal with these factors.  Certification is important and recurrent courses are necessary.  The Minister, in his Second Reading speech, drew attention to the fact that we are not working in isolation, but in conjunction with other countries and in agreement with them, which is as it should be.</P>
      <P>The importance of safety at sea cannot be too highly stressed.  This is vital for not alone passengers and crew but for cargo and ships.  Deputies have stressed the importance of looking after our coastal waters and seeing that our coastal stretches are not interfered with, or polluted, due to inadequate precautions. Legislation is complex and difficult, but I am pleased that the Minister intends to introduce further legislation in due course.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer, at this point, to the necessity for radio and radar transmitters along our coastline for communication purposes.  These would lessen the hazards.  It would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to the lifeboat service&mdash;a band of dedicated people who continuously monitor weather conditions and who set out in all sorts of perilous situations, putting the safety of others first.  I hope this service will go from strength to strength.</P>
      <P>I welcome the certification involved in this legislation, which will bring about an improvement and continuous up-grading of safety standards.  I wish the Minister well in the speedy introduction of the necessary conditions, when this legislation is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies for their very useful contributions to the debate on this Bill.  This <Col N="383" /> is enabling legislation, the provisions of which are largely self-explanatory.  The existing law governing the certification of our seamen is outdated and no longer appropriate to the conditions and requirements of modern merchant shipping. We must bring ourselves into line with international practice, especially in the UK.  The Bill will enable us to do this and, in addition, will help us to preserve the reciprocal recognition arrangements to which I alluded in my opening statement.</P>
      <P>The regulations under this Bill will cover a complex range of matters, from seamen's qualifications and experience to new manning levels for vessels of varying tonnage, revised trading areas and so on.  The over-riding concern, however, is safety of life at sea.  With this in mind, the proposed regulations will have, as a main objective, the maintenance and possible improvement of the high standards of competence of Irish seamen.  In addition, the regulations will have regard to the practical requirements and operating conditions of Irish merchant ships.  For this reason my Department have had consultations with the Irish shipping industry.  In reply to Deputy Quinn, I see no problem in having consultations, if need be, with the Congress of Trade Unions in respect of the regulations under this Bill.  The point was raised as to whether the passing of this Bill would bring us in line with the SOLAS Convention.  The answer to this is no.  There is need for very considerable legislation before we can become a party to that convention.  This matter is receiving consideration at present.</P>
      <P>The present Bill and the regulations to be made under it will provide the additional legislative powers necessary to satisfy the 1978 IMCO Convention for Standards of Training and Certification and Watch-keeping for Seafarers, to which Deputy Deasy referred.  The aim of that convention is to promote safety of life and property at sea, the protection of the marine environment by establishing, in common agreement, international standards of training, certification and watch-keeping for seafarers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="384" />
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister how world wide is that convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We would hope that it would become world wide, but it has not been adopted by very many countries as yet.  It is a very recent convention, adopted only in 1978, and it will be some time before countries have the opportunity of providing legislation in compliance with this convention.  We will thereby ensure that seafarers are qualified and fit for their duties.  The convention establishes basic requirements for training, certification and watch-keeping on an international level.  It lays down the mandatory minimum requirements for certification and continuous proficiency of masters, deck engineers and radio officers. It also lays down mandatory minimum requirements for the training and certification of masters, officers and ratings of oil, chemical and liquified gas tankers.</P>
      <P>On a matter raised by Deputy Deasy, it is true that certain countries may operate with less than the appropriate manning levels.  The question of the specification of foreign ships coming into our ports is a matter for the international authorities involved.  However, we do have the power to inspect and detain ships under the 1894 Act when we have doubts about safety.  The Deputy will recognise that ships of all nations are free to travel to and from our ports, and if we were to attempt to enforce our certification requirements on all foreign ships entering our waters we would, in effect, need to certify the ships of all nations, which would be an impossible task.  Also we could run into very serious international difficulties.  Our best option is to leave certification to national authorities but, at the same time&mdash;and I agree with the Deputy in this&mdash;to seek international harmonisation by concerted multilateral action.  The 1978 IMCO Convention to which I have referred is a good step in that direction.  But we would not have the power under this Bill to make regulations in respect of ships except those registered in the State and foreign ships carrying passengers between places in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> Deputy Deasy referred also to laneways.  Again, a laneways system is not a national matter.  We cannot interfere at will with foreign ships when they are on the high seas, and action along these lines would also have to be concerted internationally.  Certainly we would be anxious to increase and improve safety at sea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider discussing the matter with the British authorities in relation to the Irish Sea, because I believe that the British and French have done just that with regard to the English Channel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we would be willing to do that.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also raised the question of medium frequency radio coverage of the south-east coast.  As I think I said previously in reply to a debate, the position there is that there are a number of marine radio stations on the west coast of Britain which, like Valentia and Malin Head, maintain a constant listening watch in accordance with international arrangements.  These stations provide ample coverage for shipping in the south-east area, and there would be no point in duplicating the already adequate facilities by providing further manned coast radio stations to serve that area.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general question of the provision of VHF radio facilities around the coast, this has been under very active consideration.  A pilot survey has been under way for the past year and the matter will be determined when we obtain the results of the survey.  I might say that the survey is very nearly finished, and I would hope early in the New Year to get some information in relation to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-Central):</i> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a straightforward Bill, the primary purpose of which is to provide for an increase of £10 million in the limit on repayable advances that the Minister <Col N="387" /> for Finance may make to RTE for capital purposes.  The Bill also contains two small technical amendments to the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1960 to 1976.  I shall refer to these later.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 provides that the Minister for Finance may make advances from the Central Fund to the Authority for capital purposes on the recommendation of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The 1960 Act sets a limit of £2 million on the aggregate amount of advances that could be made to RTE but this limit was increased by three subsequent Acts.  The present limit of £15 million was fixed by section 9 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976.  Section 2 of this Bill proposes to increase the limit to £25 million.</P>
    <P>The initial capital cost of establishing the television service was financed by Exchequer advances.  Thereafter during the 1960s RTE met their capital needs almost entirely from internal sources, that is, from revenue surpluses and depreciation funds.  From the early seventies on, however, the growth in advertising revenue and in the number of television sets slowed down and RTE had to rely to a greater extent on Exchequer advances to finance capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>Between 1975 and 1978, RTE's capital expenditure totalled £14.4 million of which £10.4 million was advanced from the Central Fund.  At the end of 1978 all but £631,000 of the £15 million provided for under the 1976 Act had been advanced.  This amount was advanced earlier this year.  The Public Capital Programme for 1979 made a provision of £2.45 million for capital advances for RTE but the balance of £1,819,000 cannot be paid over until this Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure in the period 1975 to 1978 was incurred on the provision of the second television transmitter network, the renewal and improvement of the existing TV network and various television and radio production facilities <Col N="388" /> and support services.  The contribution of over £10 million made by the Exchequer to this expenditure reflected the effects of inflation on RTE's own funds and the substantial capital costs of providing the second television network.</P>
    <P>RTE envisage further capital expenditure of about £23.5 million at 1979 prices over the next four to five years, of which £14.9 million would be on new studios and equipment for increased home production on RTE 2 and renewal and development of existing production facilities.  RTE also have in mind spending £4 million on improving reception of both television and radio services in different parts of the country, and £4.2 million on radio production facilities, and regional broadcasting centres and Radio na Gaeltachta.  The proposed increase in the limit on Exchequer advances that may be made to RTE does not imply a commitment to make any advances, nor does it imply any approval of the capital expenditure envisaged by RTE.  Expenditure and advances will, as always, have to be subject to consideration and approval annually in the context of the Public Capital Programme and in the light of RTE's financial performance each year.</P>
    <P>RTE are paying interest on the Exchequer advances they have received for capital purposes, but so far they have not repaid any part of the principal.  The question of requiring them to begin repaying the advances is at present under consideration.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset this Bill also proposes to make two amendments of a technical nature to the Broadcasting Authority Acts.  The first of these, provided for in section 3, is intended to clarify the position of the Authority with regard to the establishment and maintenance of local broadcasting services. For some years past RTE have been providing (1) a local radio service for an hour a day on weekdays on the Cork medium wave transmitter (2) Radio na Gaeltachta which is broadcast on medium wave in Gaeltacht areas and on VHF nationally, and (3) experimental community radio services for a week or <Col N="389" /> two at a time in various locations on low powered medium wave and VHF transmitters.  Section 16 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 reads as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Authority shall establish and maintain a national television and sound broadcasting service and shall have all such powers as are necessary for or incidental to that purpose&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>It had been considered that the section conferred power on RTE to establish purely local radio services.  However, doubts were raised recently as to whether the section as it stands gives RTE such power.  It would be prudent to remove any doubt on the matter, and this is the purpose of the amendment. The provision is purely enabling and does not place any duty on the Authority to provide local broadcasting services.  It merely clarifies RTE's position in regard to the maintenance of existing local services and the establishment of any local services that may be approved by the Minister in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides that any officer or servant of RTE shall stand seconded from employment by the Authority if nominated for election to the Dáil or Seanad or nominated to the Seanad directly.  In recent years a provision on these lines has been included in legislation setting up new State-sponsored bodies, and the opportunity is therefore being taken to bring the legislation dealing with RTE up to date in this respect.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>We have no objections to section 2 of the Bill, which deals with providing extra capital for RTE, because we are aware that extra capital is essential, but we are confused by the fact that there is no clarification of section 3 either in the Minister's speech or in the explanatory memorandum which we received with the Bill.  I am well aware that there was strong opposition in RTE to the setting up of an independent broadcasting authority which would have the power to issue licences for local radio.  In a speech at the Jacobs Radio <Col N="390" /> and Television Awards on 30 March last the Taoiseach intimated that such an independent local radio authority would be set up and that facilities would be made available for the issuing of licences to independent groups for the operation of local radio.  There is no mention of that in this Bill.  We will have to oppose the Bill on those grounds.</P>
      <P>We are in favour of the setting up of independent local radio licensed by an independent authority to be established under stringent conditions by legislation giving safeguards to the public and financial safeguards to RTE.  We would like to know exactly what section 3 sets out to do.  Will it retain control of local broadcasting within RTE or will we get the independent local radio authority which was promised by the Taoiseach on 30 March last?  The Taoiseach's statement published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday 31 March is as follows:</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, Mr. Lynch, last night announced plans for the establishment of an Independent Local Radio Authority...</P>
      <P>The decision to establish the Independent Local Radio Authority was taken by the Cabinet last week after Ministers had heard a detailed report about legal and practical ramifications, domestic and international, from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Mr. Faulkner.</P>
      <P>Last night the Taoiseach said there had been evidence of a significant demand for purely local radio services to complement national services.  In the larger centres at least, the local services should be supported by advertisements.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Having considered the matter in depth,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;the Government has decided that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should arrange for the preparation of new legislation to provide for the establishment of an Independent Local Radio Authority. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the Taoiseach's statement we are entitled to know why this promised local independent radio authority has not been set up and we would like to <Col N="391" /> know why it is not specified in this Bill. The Bill does not eliminate the possibility of such an independent authority being set up, but until such time as we are satisfied that the Government intend to set up an independent authority we will vote against the Bill strictly on those grounds and not on financial considerations as outlined in section 2.  We fully agree with section 2.  If the Minister can satisfy us on section 3 that provision will be made for an independent authority to issue licences, we will be satisfied.  The Bill as it reads does not eliminate that possibility but it does not state that there is a possibility.  We want that point cleared up before we will agree to the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>We are told that television was set up with three main functions, to inform, to educate and to entertain.  I have no doubt that certain of these functions are being fulfilled quite well by RTE.  We owe them a debt of gratitude for their work over the years.  In a sparsely populated country such as ours with difficult geographical terrain it is not easy to operate a satisfactory television service at a reasonable cost, but RTE have worked very effectively and have achieved a significant amount so far in providing a service to virtually every part of the country which is comparable with any other European country considering the density of population in other parts of Europe.  Unfortunately for RTE, comparisons are frequently drawn with the BBC and the ITV television networks in Britain.  These works are probably the most outstanding in the whole world, and from time to time RTE are severely criticised for not having a comparable standard or the same material to offer to viewers.  Anyone with a reasonable knowledge of television services other than the ones mentioned will agree that the service provided by RTE is excellent in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the field of entertainment RTE are doing a very good job.  Both services are quite good.  While I was not an advocate of RTE 2 originally&mdash;I would have <Col N="392" /> preferred relaying BBC1 or ITV or a mix&mdash;it has worked out quite well.  The promises made by the authority have been kept and we are getting some excellent foreign programmes and the entertainment value of that channel is extremely high.</P>
    <P>With regard to radio, the bringing in of the new second radio channel has been a great success.  It has very large audiences throughout the country and is competing successfully with BBC and Radio Luxembourg.  Its creation was obviously necessary and it is doing quite well.</P>
    <P>The second of the three ideals put forward was informing the public.  RTE are doing a good job in this area. Newscasts are well constructed and presented but I noticed a deterioration in the standard of documentaries and, in particular, of political discussion programmes.  They are not comparable with the standard which existed some years ago.  I do not know why this happened, whether it was lack of trained personnel or difficulty in finding finance to produce such programmes.  Most people in the political world agree that the high standards set by programmes like &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; has not been maintained and that there is a need for a resuscitation of some kind in this sector to get back to the previous high standard.  I ask the Minister to bring these observations to the notice of the authority.</P>
    <P>If RTE fall down on any of the three ideals I mentioned, it is on education. The educational content of the programming is not as good as it might be.  It is sad to learn that educational programmes are not being produced by RTE, or, if they are, only on a very minor scale.  No longer do the Department of Education give RTE a grant to produce educational programmes.  The only educational programmes being shown nowadays are repeats or imported programmes.  Our own creativity in this sector has ceased.  Perhaps the Minister could give us some hope for the future that things may improve.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that with the <Col N="393" /> advent of RTE 2 we would have considerably expanded educational opportunities on television, but this has not been the case.  For instance, the 45 per cent of the population who can receive British television have the opportunity to do a university course.  The other 55 per cent do not.  Programmes such as &ldquo;Open University&rdquo;, are a considerable advantage to the people who avail of the opportunity to do a degree.  Perhaps the Minister would ask RTE to consider using RTE 2 to provide an extended service in this area.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister referred to existing legislation.  He said that this legislation gave RTE 2 the power to establish purely local radio services. Doubts were raised recently as to whether the section as it stands gives RTE such power.  Was that prompted by a statement made by Deputy Kelly who last year in an article pointed out that the broadcasting monopoly which RTE took for granted was not reconcilable with Article 40.6.1 of the Constitution or with Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights?  He felt that any citizen of the State was entitled to put forward his views, either through the spoken word or through the media, as long as there was not anything corrupt or salacious in what he was saying.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement may have been brought about because Deputy Kelly said RTE were not necessarily entitled to a monopoly.  He did not say they were not entitled to a monopoly; he said is was debatable.  It would appear that the Minister, his senior civil servants and the Government have come to the same conclusion&mdash;that legally it might not be possible to prevent individuals or groups of individuals from applying for and obtaining, if need be through the courts, a licence to operate a local radio or television service under certain conditions.</P>
    <P>Why is there a need for local radio? Why do we in our policy document, issued earlier this year, advocate that this should include independent operators?  It has been obvious for some time that there is a need for local radio. Where local radio stations have been inaugurated <Col N="394" /> they have been very successful. The only instances of local radio we have are the Cork station and the community radio which is a mobile unit and goes all over the country.  The Cork local radio station, which operates for about one hour each lunch time with a programme called &ldquo;Corkabout&rdquo;, has proved to be a tremendous success in the Cork area and there has been an outcry for a similar service in other parts of the country.  The British independent local radio stations have been in existence for the last six or seven years and for a longer period under the aegis of the BBC.  They have proved tremendously successful.</P>
    <P>Nothing adds to the argument more than the fact that the pirate radios which have been set up in recent years have been extremely successful and have a great appeal especially to the younger members of our population.  They wanted something different.  They liked the innovations which were brought about by such radio stations and there is obviously a need for such operations in our community.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the operators of such stations are labelled as pirates and as people who are breaking the law.  The fact is that they are good people who have a certain skill and acumen and are using it as they see best.  They are giving good employment and great enjoyment to large sections of the community. Rather than prosecute and label them as law breakers we should be endeavouring to bring them within the ambit of a legal broadcasting system and give them the opportunity to partake in the independent local broadcasting system throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This has been done with great success in Britain.  In areas where there is local broadcasting run by the BBC competing against local broadcasting run by stations licensed under the Independent Broadcasting Authority it seems to be the case that the independent stations have a greater listening audience and are providing a more popular service.</P>
    <P>To go back to the original local radio service we must go back to 1964 when <Col N="395" /> Radio Caroline was set up.  At the time that was labelled a pirate radio and the name has stuck.  It may be pirate for two reasons.  First, that it was poaching frequencies which it was not legally entitled to do and secondly, that it was a radio station at sea.  I could never discern which of the two reasons was more valid.  We have had a succession of pirate radios since then.</P>
    <P>In 1970 local radio was a considerable election issue in the British general election of that year.  Despite the opposition of the Labour Government at the time the Conservative Party campaigned on the basis that they would consider the setting up of local radio stations run by independent operators under licence. They gave that election promise and were successful in that general election. In 1973 they set up the Independent Broadcasting Authority who are entitled to give licences to responsible groups who provide a comprehensive service to the public.  At the time it was felt&mdash;I feel the same is true here at present&mdash;that these stations, if set up, would fill a gap in the communications media which is now being filled illegally.  We have an obligation to see that the gap which exists is filled legally.  To say that there are not sufficient frequencies available is not correct.</P>
    <P>In 1979 in Great Britain&mdash;I should say Britain, it is no longer great&mdash;it was discovered that despite the case made by the then Postmaster General, Mr. Stonehouse, who has been heard of in other spheres since, there were not sufficient frequencies available, it turned out on investigation that there were 115 frequencies available for medium wave transmitters.  It was not a genuine excuse. It is not an excuse to say that the frequencies are not available in this country.  The Taoiseach on 30 March and the Minister, Deputy Faulkner, have stated that some of these pirate stations use frequencies which interfere with rescue services, police services and other vital and necessary services and are giving cause for concern because they could <Col N="396" /> be responsible for an accident or fatality of some kind, or could cause undue suffering because the proper authorities could not be notified due to the fact that the frequency they were using was taken over by one of these stations.  The way to eliminate that abuse is to license these people who are deemed to be fit to raise the finance and run a local broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>We would have no objection to the Government proceeding with the new Bill which was published last April with the objective of suppressing illegal broadcasting.  It has not yet been debated in the House because this Bill was to be passed first.  We understood that to-day's Bill in being passed would allow, as I have said, for the licensing of these local independent broadcasting systems.  A praiseworthy effort has been made by RTE in recent years who set up a chain of local studios, television and radio throughout the country.  Unfortunately it seems to have got only as far as the radio stage so far.  I understand that RTE have radio studios in Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Galway and Sligo. These studios provide a long-awaited need but I sometimes wonder if they are being utilised to the fullest advantage.  I doubt that they are.  The reason is probably lack of finance.  We do not seem to get as much provincial news as we would wish on the national broadcasting systems.  When we do get such news it is generally a day or several days out of date.  I would like to see the studios being utilised in a manner which would do justice to the expenditure involved. They are not being utilised to a reasonable degree.</P>
    <P>The lack of use of these studios was noticeable during the European and local elections last June.  As politicians we would notice whether something was covered or not.  The coverage of these elections and particularly the local elections, which had a vast significance, was considerably less detailed than in 1974 or in 1967 when previous local elections were held.  Surely the setting up of studios should be to cover major events such as those in a comprehensive mannner?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> Those elections barely got a mention on the national network.  The local studios were used to a limited extent in this regard.</P>
    <P>Besides having radio facilities in these studios I should like to see RTE providing television facilities.  We could have a vastly improved new service involving the provinces.  The statement has often been made that Dublin is Ireland and when you watch television news broadcasts too often you get that feeling. This happens more and more as time goes on because major events taking place down the country are quite often completely neglected or given very poor coverage.  The day has come when we should be able to feed back information from the provinces to the Donnybrook studios in a matter of minutes and such events should be televised and covered by radio as they actually take place.</P>
    <P>I know there is a new technique involving portable electronic television cameras which has revolutionised the whole TV system, especially the news broadcasting system in America, Britain and other major countries.  Could the Minister let us know if this technique will be introduced here in the near future?  It means that news items from centres around the country can be directly injected into news bulletins.  One does not have to wait, as is now the case until, the following day or week for events to be televised; they can be transmitted on the spot and shown on the national television network at the instant at which they occur.</P>
    <P>The same could be done with radio. There seems to be some fall-down in technology here or perhaps it is lack of finance, but the direct transmission of news items from provincial studios to Donnybrook does not seem to be occurring. The only place from which we seem to get direct transmission is Belfast where there is obviously a comprehensive studio.  Not only do we get radio news on the spot but we also get TV shots from Belfast.  There is no other centre in the country, to my knowledge, where the same facilities exist at present. This gives cause for concern and should <Col N="398" /> be rectified as soon as possible.  We can hardly boast that we have a truly national communications network when we cannot transmit pictures or radio signals on the spot from the more important centres in the country.</P>
    <P>At present, as mentioned in this Bill, RTE are spending a vast amount of money in providing new studio facilities in Donnybrook.  The figure mentioned is £14.9 million, part of £23.5 million which is to be spent over the next four or five years.  That is a very large sum and obviously there is need for vastly improved studio facilities.  But the vastly increased facilities beggar the question of how the studios will be manned and from where the money will come to man them. Could the Minister spell out for us today what the capital expenditure by RTE will be in the coming years?  In the RTE 1978 report it is stated that approximately half the expenditure by the Authority is on wages and salaries.  Total expenditure for the year ended 30 September 1978 was about £25 million, and half of that goes on wages and salaries. If we have greatly improved facilities and increased capacity for such facilities it is obvious that the work force, particularly the number of skilled technicians and personnel, will be considerably increased and that there will be need for a much greater income.  At present RTE meet their expenditure on programmes and payment of staff from income from TV licences and advertising revenue. Just a year ago we saw that the licence level was reaching the point beyond which it will be very hard to push it further.  The licence fee for a colour television is now £38 and for black and white, £23.  These do not make a good comparison with licence fees in other countries and obviously there will be certain resistance by the public to any further increases.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, advertising revenue, while it has increased appreciably in recent years, must also have a limitation.  So, there is fear that with the vastly increased facilities now being provided at Donnybrook and in the form of regional studios around the country <Col N="399" /> there will not be sufficient money to operate these facilities.  I should like the Minister to tell us what financial arrangements the Government have made to see that the studios in question are properly utilised, because it may be a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  We all know it costs a much greater amount of money to produce a home programme than it does to import canned programmes from America, Britain or any other country.  If extra money is needed to pay the increased staff&mdash;obviously there will be greatly increased expenditure on extra staff&mdash;does it mean that the amount of home-produced programmes will be reduced?  I cannot see the economics of the matter balancing out otherwise.</P>
    <P>It appears that to finance the staff and provide the equipment necessary for the expanded facilities&mdash;I am not complaining about expansion; obviously it is badly needed&mdash;will require extra finance and we would like a clear idea of where the money will come from.  If we have not such an explanation of where the money will be found, we must assume there will be a cutback in home-produced programmes and a greatly increased proportion of imported canned television.  Sometimes, the imported programmes are quite good, but I think the public will demand that the present ratio of home-produced programmes will be at least retained, if not increased.</P>
    <P>I understand that in 1978 the amount of home-produced programmes on RTE was 44 per cent, an increase of 9 per cent over 1977.  We had a 9 per cent increase in one year but to bring that about the capital involved was increased by 29 per cent.  The House will see the relevance of my point that if you are to maintain or increase the amount of home-produced programmes you will have to provide a vastly increased amount of finance.  I should like the Minister to spell out the answer quite clearly to the question I am asking, because it is giving rise to concern in television circles.  I do not think the <Col N="400" /> public would like to see a reduction in the number of home-produced programmes.  The clamour from cultural groups and language groups in particular has been for an increase in the number of home-produced programmes. This demand has increased since the advent of RTE 2.  They feel that that channel should be used more and more, even at off-peak hours, for the production of more home-produced programmes.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, advocated in 1976, when he brought before this House legislation to set up a second RTE channel, that we endeavour to beam television and radio signals from this State into parts of Northern Ireland which presently cannot receive RTE radio or television.  That point was never pursued, and it is worthy of consideration. I would ask the Minister to make some reference to that in his reply, because if there is anything conclusive to continuing animosity and trouble between the two communities in Northern Ireland it is ignorance.  Surely a television channel beaming signals from this State into Northern Ireland would be an element in eliminating the obvious ignorance that exists at the moment.  I would like to see such an arrangement brought about.  I do not believe that there would be any objection from the British authorities.  I am sure they would be only too delighted to see an equitable solution to the Northern problem and anything that would help to create such a solution would be welcomed.  There would probably be objections from bigots on both sides in the Six Counties, but bigotry exists and it will come to the surface at every available opportunity so we might as well face it head on rather than pretend it does not exist.  It would be a very worthwhile exercise if approaches were made to the British Government with a view to beaming in television and radio signals to all parts of the Six Counties. In particular I understand that there is a difficulty in regard to Belfast; the geological terrain surrounding the city is such that it is difficult to get a radio or television signal into that city at present. I am told there is a mountain range in <Col N="401" /> County Louth, and one peak in particular, which would be ideal for beaming signals to all parts of the Six Counties, particularly Belfast.</P>
    <P>We have the facility whereby 45 per cent of the population here have the advantage of getting signals from Britain through the BBC or ITV networks.  The British people, on the other hand, do not have the same opportunity to receive Irish television.  Some people along their west coast and in parts of Wales get RTE signals but that is the most sparsely populated part and the numbers are limited.  The numbers in the Six Counties who can receive RTE television are quite small because the bulk of the population in the Six Counties is in and around Belfast and north of Belfast and they are not in a position to get these signals at the moment.  So it would be a worthwhile exercise if we made moves in this direction and showed the other side how we live and that we are not the awful demons that some of their politicians and particularly some of the media make us out to be.  That would be providing a television service where it does not exist at present.</P>
    <P>There are areas in the Twenty-six Counties at the moment which suffer from a lack of television reception.  From time to time there are questions raised in this House asking when a television service can be provided for a particular place, be it in Kerry or Galway or some area which is hidden behind a mountain range so that it is very difficult to beam television signals into it.  The Minister makes the point that £4 million is being provided to improve reception of both television and radio services in different parts of the country.  That statement is welcome.  In my own county there is a valley between two mountain ranges where television reception is non-existent most of the time.  When it exists it is purely because of climatic conditions, but that is difficult to overcome, and I would not envy the Minister his task of trying to provide 100 per cent television reception throughout the country.  Even in Britain and other European countries with their high density of population a <Col N="402" /> 100 per cent television service has not yet been attained.</P>
    <P>What causes concern is the fact that quite large areas of the country have yet to get RTE 2 television.  Will the Minister be specific in telling us when the present blank spots will be serviced?  I know that in terms of population it may not be more than 10 per cent but the areas concerned generally coincide with the areas which are not receiving BBC or ITV so they feel that they are not getting value for money in terms of their licence fees.</P>
    <P>In regard to licence fees, I want to refer back to the RTE annual report for 1977-78.  It is disquieting, to say the least, to learn that in 1977 £1.5 million was lost because of evasion of licence fees.  Has the Minister any proposals to make on that serious shortfall in the financing of RTE?  It is not fair that a sizeable element of the public should be welshing when it comes to paying their rightful dues to the RTE authority.  This figure was £1.5 million in 1977 and we are told in the report that in 1978 it was well in excess of £2 million.  That is not a sum to be sneezed at.  The Minister should make a very serious effort to eliminate this evasion.  It is recommended in the 1978 RTE report that a system of collection of licence fees by computer methods could be successful in eliminating present abuse.  I wonder if the Minister has any comment to make on that statement?</P>
    <P>The <i>RTE Annual Report 1978</i> states:</P>
    <P>In the period under review&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is up to 30 September, 1978&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>this shortfall&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the non-payment of licence fees&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>was estimated at well in excess of £2 m. and represents a significant charge which has to be borne by those who pay licence fees.  In this connection the Authority reiterates the view which it has previously expressed that a computer-based collection system would help to combat evasion and would facilitate the introduction of some form of instalment payment. The Authority is aware that this matter <Col N="403" /> is of concern to and is being considered by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and hopes that some progress will be made in the near future. </P>
    <P>I would like the Minister in his reply to tell us what progress is being made and if he is in agreement with the suggestion by the authority that a computer-based collection system be adopted.  If it would provide extra finance to the tune of well in excess of £2 million as stated in this report, then surely the matter should be pursued with all possible vigour.</P>
    <P>In the same report we are told that there are approximately 100,000 unlicensed television sets in the State.  It is estimated that there are 700,000 television sets in the Twenty-six Counties and only 600,000 of those are licensed at present.  Some network must be set up to eliminate that abuse.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to our reservations about the Bill as a whole and particularly in regard to section 3.  I am dubious as to whether the Minister intends to set up an independent licensing system for local radio because it is not stated clearly in the Bill or by the Minister that this is the intention.  I am dubious also because of the opposition which has been voiced by senior executives within the RTE structure and in particular a statement which was made by the Director-General of RTE, Mr. George T. Waters, on 29 August 1978, that is about 15 months ago, when he was opening the Radio and Domestic Appliance Dealers' trade exhibition at the RDS Simmonscourt extension.  He spoke very strongly against the involvement of any independent operators in local radio and he said that the campaign was coming from banking, the media and other commercial concerns whose main objective was to make money.  That is not a fair comment.  The interests to whom I have spoken in the local radio business, although they are termed &ldquo;pirates&rdquo;, are upright, intelligent and well-meaning individuals who like <Col N="404" /> doing this work and would like to do it under a legal guise.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the statement of the director-general on 29 August 1978.  I do not agree with the <Col N="405" /> sentiments that he expressed in that statement.  He said that commercial operators who would operate such independent stations if they were granted licences would be interested only in big cities where the money was.  He gives the impression that nobody other than RTE could operate such a service and that they have the personnel, the equipment, the best raw materials, the best amalgam of programming and the best and most varied use of the relatively few frequencies available for radio broadcasting.  He says that it is not necessary to set up independent radio to provide local radio, that RTE can do it and nobody else should be allowed to do it in those circumstances. To summarise, he said that radio should remain under the control of the national broadcasing system.</P>
      <P>Obviously, from popular demand the need exists for a second point of view. Why not allow an authority to be set up to give this second point of view?  It has been proven elsewhere, albeit by the ITV television network in Britain, that that second point of view is a very valid and quite different point of view which has a contribution to make and so should be entertained.  For the benefit of the community at large a local radio service should have a second voice.  Let RTE partake in it, but let us not give the monopoly or majority holding to them. Let interested groups, such as the operators of existing local radio, pirates or otherwise, become involved.  Let the local provincial newspapers have a say. Get all the interested bodies and set up legislation to found a licensing body who will see that all the necessary criteria which should be observed will be observed. If they make money it need not necessarily be to the detriment of the finances of RTE.  Under a licensing system they could be charged a sizeable amount of money for the franchise and that money could be channelled back into the coffers of RTE.  That is the policy which we have promised and published and we would like to see it enshrined in this legislation before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to spell out whether <Col N="406" /> it is intended to go along with the statement made by the Taoiseach on 30 March this year when he said that the Government were going to do this.  We are very disappointed to pick up this Bill and find that that announcement by the Taoiseach is not incorporated in the Bill. We would like to know why it is not included. That does not mean that the possibility that what the Taoiseach advocated could be done in the Bill is eliminated, nevertheless it is not spelt out.  We await the Minister's reply with interest.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> In recent times at least one Bill and a number of Estimates have been introduced into this House and the House was asked to pass them at short notice or with little or no debate on the grounds that the money which they would provide was absolutely necessary for the ACC, the Garda Síochána or the Attorney General.  Here we have yet another Bill which seeks more money for RTE and I understand that the Government expect it to be passed by this House without delay and they expect&mdash;I am not saying that they will get&mdash;all Stages of this Bill by next Tuesday.  The Government could and should be blamed for organising their business in such a way that they introduce Bills here increasing the borrowing powers of RTE from £15 million to £25 million without proper and adequate debate.  The request might be understood if it were not for the fact that the occasion is availed of here to insert section 3 into the Bill which, as I have said, is a very far-reaching section, a section which proposes to confer on the RTE Authority the right to establish and maintain local broadcasting services throughout the country.  This is in the nature of an innovation.  It is giving to the Authority a right they did not have before.  The Minister has stated that it was understood that a section of the 1960 Act confers such powers on the Authority and he went on to say that section 3 here is introduced for the purpose of clarifying the position and of removing doubts.  He went on to say also that it is an enabling provision which <Col N="407" /> does not place any duty on the authority to provide local broadcasting services but merely enables them to do so.  That would be all right and would be understandable were it not for the fact that this change, this power to establish local broadcasting stations is being conferred on RTE in the middle of a national debate as to whether there should be an independent broadcasting authority which would have the right to issue licences to local stations.  It is Fine Gael published policy that there should be independent local broadcasting stations. We made that policy public early last year.  I understood that this was Government policy also because, as Deputy Deasy has reminded us, the Taoiseach, speaking on 30 March last at the presentation of Jacobs Radio and Television Awards at Leopardstown Racecourse, seemed to put the matter beyond doubt in relation to his favouring independent local stations.  The following day we read in <i>The Irish Times:</i></P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, Mr. Lynch, last night announced plans for the establishment of an Independent Local Radio Authority and the introduction, soon, of the long-promised Bill to deal with unlicensed broadcasting. </P>
      <P>In the same report we read that:</P>
      <P>The decision to establish the Independent Local Radio Authority was taken by the Cabinet last week after Ministers had heard a detailed report about legal and practical ramifications, domestic and international, from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Mr. Faulkner.</P>
      <P>Last night the Taoiseach said there had been evidence of a significant demand for purely local radio services to complement national services.  In the larger centres at least, the local services should be supported by advertisements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Having considered the matter in depth,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;the Government has decided that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should arrange <Col N="408" /> for the preparation of new legislation to provide for the establishment of an Independent Local Radio Authority.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will operate broadcasting transmitters for local radio services, under licence issued to the Authority by the Minister.  It will enter into contracts with organisations for the provision of local radio services and it will regulate and control independent local radio broadcasting generally. </P>
    <P>There we have an announcement of a very detailed decision taken at Cabinet level to establish an authority which would facilitate independent radio and there is a promise from the Taoiseach that legislation would be before the House in the autumn of this year to establish such an authority.</P>

Therefore, RTE will have the right now to establish themselves in the market and in that way to prejudice the establishment and running of independent <Col N="410" /> radio stations.  The Government are trying to rush this Bill through the House.  RTE must have been thinking seriously about the establishment of these stations.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> RTE must have been considering seriously the establishment of these stations on a much more elaborate scale.  The Minister said that thought had been given to them and that it was doubted now whether they had the right to do that.  This section should be deleted from the Bill.  The Minister should introduce the Bill that the Taoiseach promised and which is in line with Fine Gael published policy on independent radio stations, a policy that was accepted by the Taoiseach at Leopardstown.</P>
      <P>That is what I am complaining about. This is a sneaky little operation to put section 3 into the Bill.  The Government are pretending to the House that it is really to clarify something when, in fact, it is going to give to RTE the authority to establish local radio stations.  They will not be independent radio stations but will be offshoots of the present radio stations.  That is why I am objecting to the section.  I am objecting to it particularly when the Taoiseach and the Government accepted the policy of establishing independent radio stations. This was spelled out by the Taoiseach in his speech at Leopardstown Race course at the presentation of the Jacobs awards on 30 March 1979.  There should be local radio stations.  Secondly, I believe they should be independent and, thirdly, I believe that in order not to damage or put out of business local newspapers they should be given a considerable stake in local independent radio stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to wihdraw this section.  It should not be put into this <Col N="411" /> Bill, which is essentially to provide capital, to increase the borrowing powers of RTE from an original figure of £2 million, which was later increased to £15 million.  It is now proposed to increase the amount to £25 million.  In his statement the Minister stated that a sum of £2.45 million by way of advance authorised in the capital programme of 1979 cannot be implemented fully until this Bill is passed.  I have no wish to prevent the remainder of that capital being advanced.  I think it is necessary and I am fully in favour of it.  However, I object in the strongest terms to the Government putting in section 3 in the hope that it would not be noticed.  It was obviously their intention not to debate this matter in the weeks prior to the Christmas recess.</P>
    <P>The Minister should withdraw section 3.  If he does that he can have the remainder of the Bill.  I do not propose to detain the House with a general discussion of the various programmes on radio and television.  Indeed, I doubt very much if Deputies, particularly rural Deputies, could be good judges of the programmes because they do not have the time to look at them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Deputies work long and unsocial hours and the only opportunity they have of listening to RTE radio is when they are driving.  I am not going to attempt to take up the time of the House on this matter.  At first sight one would take this Bill as merely a measure to provide capital that might be given without debate.  I was horrified to read section 3 in the Bill and I doubt the bona fides of putting it into the Bill.  The attitude of the Government was &ldquo;Do not hit me now with the child in my arms. We must get the Bill because we want the capital.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make a strong appeal to the Minister <Col N="412" /> to delete section 3.  If he does that he can have the remainder of the Bill.  The section could be more appropriately discussed in the Bill dealing with independent television which the Minister has said will be introduced soon; and if it cannot be put into that Bill it should be put into another measure that could be introduced here and discussed.  This section should not be enacted now to give RTE an unfair advantage over other stations that it is proposed to establish.  No one knows when the other Bill referred to by the Minister will be introduced.  It might be the end of next year.  However, the stations could be established in the spring and could be in operation very soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a deceptively simple Bill but it raises a number of major issues of principle on which we should comment at this stage.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to increase the limit on repayable advances that may be made by the Government to RTE for capital purposes.  The sum of £25 million has been mentioned but, in his speech, the Minister pointed out that this did not imply a commitment to make any advances whatever nor did it imply any approval of capital expenditure envisaged by RTE.  We need a little more information, to put it mildly, from the Government before we can agree holus-bolus to an increase in the limit concerned of £25 million which is not chicken feed even in these inflationary days.</P>
      <P>It would be interesting to know, for example, what type of capital expenditure RTE envisage, what kind of project is involved, whether any formal requests or submissions have been made to the Government by the RTE Authority, and when the Government propose to conclude their consideration of the requests from RTE for finance for these capital projects.  I find it inconceivable that the Government would ask us to increase by £25 million the limit on the money they can lend to RTE without having some kind of an idea of whether any or all of this money will be required, and what it will be required for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very least the House is entitled to <Col N="413" /> in courtesy&mdash;even in broad outline&mdash;is a little further information about RTE's capital development programme.  When I say that, I should not be taken as implying any criticism of RTE's financial matters or, indeed, of their capital plan.  To the best of my knowledge, the public broadcasting service provided by RTE to date has been provided, in relation to capital at any rate, in such a way as to give us extremely good value for money. I do not think any of us can complain too much on that score.  I am not to be taken as criticising anything RTE may be looking for money for.  It is important that, if we have a national public broadcasting service, it should be a good one and it should be adequately capitalised.</P>
    <P>Another issue we have to look at is dealt with by the Minister in his speech. He said:</P>
    <P>RTE are paying interest on the Exchequer advances they have received for capital purposes, but so far they have not repaid any part of the principal.  The question of requiring them to begin repaying the advances is at present under consideration. </P>
    <P>Those are two very pregnant sentences. We need to know a little more about the kind of assumptions on which RTE's handling of revenue and capitalisation programme are based.  If successive Governments have given RTE to understand that what is involved in capital advances is merely a matter of making capital available, subject to RTE's liability to pay interest charges, it seems a bit odd late in the day for them to say to RTE: &ldquo;That is not really what we meant.  We actually want you to start paying back capital as well.&rdquo;  Was it intended, when the RTE Authority were set up, that borrowed capital should always be repaid, or that the Government should be put in a slightly less favourable position in that borrowed capital from the Government might be dealt with more flexibly?</P>
    <P>In fairness to RTE and to their budgeting and their planning&mdash;and among other things this involves things <Col N="414" /> like increases in the licence fees&mdash;they need clear guidance from the Government. If they are expected to pay back capital borrowed, let them be told at the time the capital is borrowed and not a couple of years afterwards.  Let them be told on what basis the capital repayments are to be made.  No organisation can have a reasonable budgetary programme without having that kind of knowledge well in advance.  If the Government have not done this up to now in relation to RTE, they should certainly start now.  The Minister could start immediately by giving us in this House, when he replies to this debate, some indication on Government thinking in this area for the guidance of the planners and budget-makers in RTE.</P>
    <P>It will not have escaped the notice of the House that, if RTE's revenue and finances are calculated on the basis of the assumption that they do not have to repay capital, then a Government decision to seek an early repayment of part or all of those capital advances will have one of two effects or, perhaps, a combination of both.  Either programme activities will have to be cut back, or the licence fee will have to be increased.  The Government cannot conceal their basic responsibility for either of those two events occurring, or any combination of them, by a rather bland phrase in a ministerial speech about requiring them to begin repaying advances, as if advances and capital repayments could be conjured out of thin air.  This is an important financial measure.  The Minister's speech is of considerable financial significance for the organisation concerned.  The House and the organisation are entitled to more detail in relation to it.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second main provision in the Bill, that part of the Bill relating to RTE's functions in connection with local broadcasting, I am in total disagreement with the line of country travelled by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I know Deputy Fitzpatrick adopted that line with the best of intentions, and in full accordance with his own party's policy. At this time, when local broadcasting on <Col N="415" /> radio and television is becoming an increasingly live issue, it is doubly important that we should strengthen the arm and the role of the public broadcasting service in any way we may consider necessary.  The section involved is described as merely a clarifying section. Obviously it does fulfil that function.  It is important to look at the direction in which the clarification is taking place. We are not clarifying things in such a way as to imply that RTE should be given less freedom to engage in local broadcasting. We are clarifying things in such a way as to imply that RTE should be given more freedom to engage in local broadcasting.  This is a point of view with which I fully concur.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that this was a sneaky provision, and he argued that it should be withdrawn from the Bill until we have had time to consider the other Bill promised by the Taoiseach on local broadcasting.  I share with Deputy Fitzpatrick a concern about the lack of speed with which this other measure is travelling towards this House, but I do not share his opinion that, for some reason, we should shelve this proposal until we have seen the other.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick argued very strongly in favour of what he described as independent local broadcasting.  The implication of his remarks is that what we are trying to do in this Bill is to give RTE, this great monolith, this creature of the State, this shapeless authoritarian monster, further and more detailed control over even the smallest of the local communities in our State.  Set against that model, like St. George against the dragon, is the model of independent local broadcasting.</P>
    <P>A couple of implications in that line of argument are very serious.  One is that independent local broadcasting is independent. When you look at it more closely, however, you realise that the only thing independent local broadcasting is to be independent of is the Government and RTE.  By definition the one thing so-called local independent broadcasting is not independent of is the <Col N="416" /> desire to make money.  This is the first, middle and last objective of so-called independent local broadcasting.  These objectives are on occasion linked by a very tenuous web of public interest and information. The primary purpose of independent local broadcasting is not public information but the creation of a profit for its organisers and owners.</P>
    <P>The other point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick that local newspapers should be given a say in the extension of local broadcasting on an independent basis is something which I would put a major question mark against.  We have a great number of local newspapers in the country. There are local newspapers which play fairly by their communities and by all sections of opinion within them but there are others which do not.  On several occasions, as a former journalist, I have had representations from people from my party in relatively small urban provincial communities which could prove to my local satisfaction that their local media were biased against them either from an editorial or a proprietorial point of view.  They asked what could be done about it and the answer is nothing. Our press is free to be biased.  I shudder at the possibility that an extension of so-called independent local broadcasting would, instead of adding to the variety of the sources of information, simply create another source of information under the same effectively monopolistic control.</P>
    <P>The other implication of what Deputy Fitzpatrick said was that public service broadcasting is falling down on the job, that it is not unbiased, that it does not fully and fairly reflect the needs of the community.  I would like to ask him how he can even think that a broadcasting service, founded and run on the principle of profit alone, will ever give to minority groups in our society, to public issues which are not related to generating large profits, to the arts and to associated enterprises and areas of activity, anything like the coverage air time and air space they deserve.  Not only do I not see anything sinister in this aspect of the Bill, I see it as entirely praiseworthy and as something which should probably have been done a long time ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> The third aspect of the Bill, which in a sense is a tidying up provision, is in relation to members of the staff of the authority.  Section 4 provides that where a person who is an officer or servant of the authority is nominated a member of Seanad Eireann or for election to either House of the Oireachtas he shall stand seconded from employment by the authority and shall not be paid by the authority for the period of nomination for membership of either House and that a person may not become an officer or servant of the authority while he is entitled to sit in either House.  I share a constituency with a Deputy who will be covered by this aspect of the Bill.  I would hate to think that his election to this House would in any way jeopardise his right to remain in employment or to return to employment with the authority should the electorate in their wisdom at the next general election decide to dispense with his services.</P>
    <P>Two points of detail arise here.  The first one is the meaning of the word &ldquo;secondment&rdquo; As I understand it this implies that a person who is employed by the RTE Authority and is elected to this House or fulfils one of the other things referred to in the Bill, is entitled at the end of his services in the House, whether voluntarily or involuntarily terminated, to return to exactly the same position he held prior to becoming a Member of this House or the other House.  Does this not unduly restrict the kind of flexibility that organisations need?  My fellow Deputy from the Fianna Fáil Party in the South Dublin constituency may be here for four years, ten years or 40 years.  It is surely absurd to suggest that at the end of 10 years or 20 years he should go back into RTE at exactly the same job he was doing at the time he left.  Other things may have happened in the meantime.  Another person may have been employed to do the same work.  He is surely entitled to the same kind of position, the same kind of level, the same kind of responsibility, certainly no worse than that, he had when he left. Is he, at the same time, entitled to the <Col N="418" /> identical job specification?  That would be putting unnecessarily fine print on it. The general entitlement to a similar kind of job, similar kind of entitlement, level of financial remuneration and responsibility would be adequate to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>I use this occasion to appeal to the Minister, even at this stage, to give us any reason why he has not, within the compass of this Bill, done anything about the political rights of large numbers of other employees of his Department. One of these employees was a candidate for the Labour Party in the recent by-election in Cork city and actually had to leave his job in order to fight that by-election without any guarantee that he would get it back.  Why should one category of people under the Minister's jurisdiction be treated more favourably than another in this regard?  The Government have promised a review of the situation, but this promise has not been lived up to so far.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about this at the earliest possible opportunity so that people's political rights, apart from their basic civil rights, are fully recognised.</P>

      <P>I would like to pay tribute to RTE for what they have been doing with very limited resources.  It is a step in the right direction if providing extra money for them will improve their performance in any way.  Since the beginning RTE made a brave effort to include a number of home produced programmes in their schedule.  Those programmes in the beginning were a bit amateurish.  The Riordans programme, for example, improved with time.  We need to have more of this type of programme especially for politicians and people who are working all week.  On Sunday night RTE should give us some decent home produced shows instead of the antiquated type of American wild west programmes that have been dished out to us over the last few months.</P>

There are no official arrangements for the use of telephones at other centres on the lines mentioned by the Deputy.  In this connection, I would remind the Deputy that appointments, cancellations, and so on, are effected through headquarters.</P>
      <P>The conduct of driving tests in Killarney is temporarily in abeyance but new accommodation for a test centre has been procured and will shortly be ready for use.  Meanwhile, any applicants who urgently desire a driving test can be accommodated at Tralee, if they so wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the facilities for driving tests are inadequate and that his response does not recognise that inadequacy?  I am not saying that he is exclusively responsible for the situation, but would <Col N="420" /> he not agree that it is extraordinary that Killarney of all places, which is the home of the Minister of State for the Environment, has been left in the ludicrous position of being evicted from premises which it should have been able to retain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened in Killarney was that an eviction order was served on the Board of Works.  No time has been lost in procuring alternative accommodation. It is expected that the alternative accommodation should be available for use within four weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that out of 47 centres only nine have direct telephone facilities.  I accept that appointments are made through the central office but the reality is that people try to contact their local centres.  My information is that all sorts of Micky-Mouse arrangements exist whereby people are ringing the office next door or the office upstairs to try and contact the driving centre.  Would the Minister not agree that, if we are to avoid a repetition of the unfortunate backlog that occurred in the past, the provision of the balance of 30 telephones is necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Telephones have been provided in nine centres.  As the Deputy probably knows, most test centres are manned only during the period of testing, which may be once a week or once in two weeks.  The nine regional centres have telephones and there are extensions from Council switchboards in a few others like Letterkenny.  That is the position at the moment.  If all the centres had telephones it would be on a temporary basis because they are manned only for a short time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The tenant purchasers concerned have already been granted substantial concessions to compensate them for having paid higher prices for their houses under tenant purchase schemes made between 1967 and June, 1973 than they would have paid under the July 1973 tenant purchase scheme. A reduction of up to one-quarter of the original repayment period is being given to those who are purchasing on an annuity basis.  In addition refunds of one-quarter of the difference between the two prices are available to those who purchased for cash and to those who originally purchased by annuity but who redeemed their annuities prior to 1 March 1978.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that in May 1977 his colleagues in Government granted the concession only to tenant purchasers purchasing on an annuity basis.  It was left to me to give relief to cash purchasers and others who had already redeemed their annuities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will grant a reduction in the rent, under the differential rent scheme, to all the tenants of the low cost National Building Agency housing schemes in Tipperary and Cahir, County Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The national differential scheme was evolved after consultation with representatives of local authorities <Col N="425" /> and of the National Association of Tenants Organisations.  Any departure from its terms to effect a reduction in rent payable by tenants of any particular housing scheme would be contrary to the principle of means-related or differential renting on which it is based and would not be justified.</P>
      <P>However, I might add that the scheme provides that a local authority may, in cases of exceptional hardship, accept from a tenant for a specified period a lower rent than that required under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that these houses are now regarded as substandard having been built by his colleague, Deputy Molloy, without chimneys.  The tenants in Tipperary and Cahir find it impossible to meet the exorbitant cost of electricity.  As a concession to enable those tenants meet the cost of heating those houses I was anxious that the Minister give them a reduction in their differential rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities can make provision for reducing rents because of the circumstances of tenants. The average rent of the 90 houses in Tipperary is £3 to £3.50.  Local authorities can take steps, where circumstances warrant it, to reduce rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the figure given by the Minister but some tenants are paying the maximum which is £10 a per week while old age pensioners and those on unemployment assistance pay the minimum of 10p per week.  In Cahir the average weekly rent is £6 to £7 per week.  Will the Minister consider directing the local authorities to grant exceptional aid in those cases by reducing the rent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>

In those circumstances would the Minister recognise that they are in a unique category?  A decision such as the Minister suggested, to reduce the rents of local authority houses in such circumstances, would mean a shortfall in the revenue of that authority.  Will the Minister pick up the tab between what should be charged for those houses and what is being charged to compensate for a wrong decision made in the past?  That is the kernel of the issue.  If a local authority propose to reduce the rent of local authority housing by an amount equal to the cost of providing alternative heating will the Minister pick up that tab for the balance and not leave a local authority with the deficit?</P>

      <P>With the Chair's permission, I recognise that there is a flexibility in the Minister's Department regarding the interpretation of maximum, but would the Minister not agree that, for example, the proposals for the Corporation's housing at Queen's Terrace, Macken Street, are currently stalled in his Department over the question of layout cost?  Would he not consider that my question was designed to obtain from his Department, without trying to get any rigidity of answer, some indication as to the guidelines used by the officials&mdash;guidelines which the local representatives frankly never see?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not specifically mention the proposal about which he is speaking.  As far as my Department are concerned, the only fair way to judge if a cost in any particular scheme is acceptable is to take all the relevant factors affecting it into account, which would include site acquisition costs, site conditions, extent of roads, water and sewerage services necessary, densities, environmental features affecting layout and requiring costly factors in layout, the level of competition for tenders affecting rates for superstructure, labour availability and cost in the area, delays in preparation of alternative plans or in re-advertising, levels of fees and possible additional fees on re-design, cost of security and supervision, contract <Col N="430" /> completion period, likely future maintenance costs, recent tender experience, availability and cost of bonds and estimated impact of price variation clauses.</P>

      <P>Through the Chair, the organisation, whose name is not relevant to the debate, have made ten separate applications to the planning authority as set out in this Act.  The planning authority have processed the application on ten separate occasions, on each occasion saying it was in contravention of development.  The cost of the administration of this processing has been carried entirely by the Minister and myself and the taxpayer.  These, I would argue, are vexatious applications, as distinct from vexatious appeals, under the meaning of the 1976 Act.  In the light of that application, which comes from a colleague of the Minister's own backbenches, would the Minister not consider, under the orders open to him under the 1976 Act, suggesting provision for the recognition of what I would describe as a vexatious application, which the Harcourt Street Terrace application undoubtedly is?</P>

      <P>All oral hearings are held in a very informal way by An Bord Pleanála.  It is a matter of choice with regard to the authorities concerned.  Not trying to cast any aspersions on the legal profession, often a person with commonsense and no legal knowledge can explain his case just as effectively.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I appreciate that, but would the Minister not bear in mind that this question of planning law is a highly specialised section of the law, is so recognised and was so stated not so very long ago.  There are only about five or six people here really specialising in this part of the law.  In those circumstances, objectors, in particular, could find themselves at a decided disadvantage or, indeed, a poor applicant for planning permission could find himself faced by a very heavy armoury of legal people in support of an objection.</P>

      <P>That is right.  It can happen. There are very many planning applications coming under the recently popular heading of planning appeals, which are vexatious and done on a kind of professional basis by certain individuals. It would not be proper for such people to have legal representations for this kind of appeal, or for an oral hearing either.  Apart from the question which is down, there is no pressure for legal representation.  I do not know.  It may not be a good thing to have legal representation.</P>

      <P>In the first ten months of this year expenditure on housing grants was 55 per cent up on the corresponding period last year.  In that period a total of 9,775 new house grants and 23,158 house improvement grants, excluding special solid fuel grants, were finally paid compared to 10,631 and 14,121 respectively, in the first ten months of 1978. Figures are not yet available for the month of November, but I expect that a further 900 new house and 4,000 improvement grants will have been paid during the month compared to 1,166 and 3,067 in November, 1978.  To date this year some 53,000 applications have been received, compared with 41,500 last year and it is obvious from this that grant-aided work is continuing at a highly satisfactory level.  It is an unfortunate consequence of the postal dispute that the number of grants paid this year will be less than had been anticipated at the beginning of the year.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputies' questions relate to the proposals of Dublin County Council, for a new road between the Naas Road at Red Cow and Harolds Grange, which I approved in principle on 3 October, 1978.  The timing and execution of road works in that location, including the acquisition of any necessary land, are primarily matters for Dublin County Council.  In the current year I have allocated road grants totalling £1.135 millions to meet the construction and land acquisition costs of a section of the route in question which has been planned by the council.  The provision of finance for construction and land acquisition costs of further sections of the route will, in the normal course, be considered when acceptable proposals are received from the council.  The project for the construction of the new road is the subject of continuing consultation between officers of my Department and of the county council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Dublin city and county area, I am informed that to date 168 units of accommodation for travellers' families have been provided on serviced sites, and 42 places have been made available at fully serviced halting places. I am also informed that 180 families are at present in trailers on unauthorised sites of which 40 families are known to be transient families.  The local authorities in the Dublin area, acting <Col N="452" /> through a joint committee, are pursuing a programme of settlement with a view to accommodating the families who wish to settle.  Trailers on the authorised sites will be available for those in need of them.  A complete welfare service, comprising five social workers, is devoted to assisting families who wish to settle.</P>
    <P>As regards the country as a whole, including the Dublin areas, I am aware from a count taken by local authorities on 16 October 1978, that although 1,122 families occupied houses, or chalets or trailers on approved sites, 946 families were still camping on the roadside of whom 687 families desired to have settled accommodation.</P>
    <P>I have written to local authorities asking for intensification of efforts to provide for travellers' families.  I asked that each would prepare a plan to deal with the total problem in their area.  Such a plan would in most cases include provision of standard houses, chalets on residential sites and halting places for transient families, according to the individual needs of the families camping in the area.  I suggested consultation between local authorities in the case of providing for transient families, so as to ensure location of halts to best advantage.</P>
    <P>The primary responsibility for providing accommodation and facilities rests with the local authorities.  My Department give every encouragement and assistance including financial assistance at the rate of 100 per cent of the capital cost of providing residential sites and halting sites.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has written&mdash;I am not sure when he did so&mdash;to all local authorities to ask for an intensification of efforts in this regard, does he propose, if such local authorities take up his offer, to make adequate additional resources available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 100 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It will depend to what degree they do it, but a 100 per cent grant is available to them and many authorities are doing it.  With regard to another part of the Deputy's question, 17 August was the date of the letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister, even if belatedly, has come to a realisation of the importance and impact of this question.  Does he consider in this, the International Year of the Child, and as regards the emphasis he places in his answer in providing, among other things, more trailers for families to live in, that that is the right kind of approach to take?  Does he accept that there are hundreds, as his answer and certainly my question stated, of families living on unserviced sites, that is, sites without basic hygiene facilities or normal facilities which would be essential to a decent standard of living?  Could the Minister take a new initiative on this matter and not just appeal to the local authorities but take action himself to ensure that this scandal comes to an end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>They are under continuous pressure from me to end this scandal.

I will continue to pressurise them to deal with the problem until it is eliminated from our society.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister consider it just that he should imply that he is right in this and that it is due to some recalcitrance on the part of local authorities that the problem has not resolved itself?  If the Minister has been consistently pressurising the local authorities and if the problem is still there in gigantic proportions with the enormous hardships involved, is it not clear that the traditional type of approach to the problem is inadequate and that some new initiative is necessary and not vague references to local authorities who are not here to defend themselves?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not finding fault with local authorities.  Many of them are complying with particular programmes and availing of the grants.  They will continue to do so and more of them are doing so now than previously.  I expect that this problem will be eliminated in the future.  There are some people who do not want to settle.  Hopefully the ones who do will be settled in as short a time as possible.  As Minister, it is my duty to intensify the programme and make moneys available.  It is all happening in recent years, as the Deputy knows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I was dealing with the work of RTE and making the point that we could lawfully exclude the more trivial and antiquated imported material from peak viewing times.  Peak viewing time is a debatable matter, but for most people it is Sunday evening.  It is a pity that we should be subjected to very ancient and rather stupid films of yesteryear on the only opportunity we have of enjoying television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE could do a little more about choosing films which would be less insulting to public taste.  I have had a lot of representations in the last 12 months complaining about the amount of violence on television.  We have more than our share of violence here at home, but for RTE to continually portray violence, successful bank robberies and general vandalism, is to say the least undesirable. Surely the better side of life could be shown on television.  It may be more humdrum but, for parents particularly, it would be more successful. We had wonderful programmes such as &ldquo;Landmark&rdquo; which, for some amazing reason, has disappeared.  We should have some more industrial type programmes showing, for example, a new industrial complex, people at work, programmes indicating how people have succeeded in agriculture, such as the <Col N="467" /> McCartin brothers, or in small industries. If that were the case we would be pleased to allocate more funds to RTE.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo;. This was a good programme and a very entertaining one but it missed the point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting into a debate on the programmes which would not be relevant to the Bill.  I will allow the Deputy to make passing reference but we cannot debate programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see why we should have clauses about local radio inserted into this kind of Bill, which should be a financial one.  I am convinced that, as it has been brought in, I am entitled to discuss it.  &ldquo;Talk about&rdquo; has been on the air for some time and is doing a terrific job.  It has satisfied the needs of that area.  Despite that there are many independent pirate radios providing an additional service and there is a case to be made for an independent community broadcasting authority.  It would give people an alternative to RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would designate its functions as to examine and assess the nature and extent of the demand for alternative local radio. In some areas there may be no such demand. It would also determine how this demand could be met in a controlled and orderly fashion, lay down the criteria for the granting of licences, allocate broadcasting licences, supervise programme standards and control advertising, as we do at present in relation to cigarettes and drink.  Some of our major companies can still advertise drink on UTV.  Companies unable to do this, because of the fact that in some areas UTV is not transmitted, are grumbling.  We must face up to that situation, I am not saying I am all in favour of banning the advertising of drink but it is unfair that a major operator in the drink business should be able to get around the law.  Another of its functions would be to control the finance of the stations by entering into contracts <Col N="468" /> on the basis of franchise fees which would of course be related to the financial returns achievable in the particular circumstances.  The produce of these fees would be available to the Authority to finance public service broadcasting.  That brings me to another point.  I am of opinion that in the event of the new Bill coming out shortly and in the event of an independent broadcasting authority being set up, in that context, I should like to see RTE getting out of the advertising business altogether.  I think the revenue is about £10 million and if, as Deputy Horgan pointed out, the commercial people are in it for the loot, if, as was said in the UK, commercial radio is merely a licence to print money, we need have no hesitation in extracting from commercial radio the fees that would normally go to RTE.</P>
    <P>The new Authority I would have in mind could ensure that the best use be made of frequencies so as to avoid overlapping and maximise opportunities for local stations.  On that point, we in Cork have a problem.  Since RTE 2 came on the air our local frequency has been taken over by it which means that those of us who want to get RTE 1 on the car radio locally find it difficult to do so.  I believe that all this is due to some hold-up within the Minister's Department.  Apparently, the frequencies are there but due to problems not yet overcome we are deprived of a first-class service from RTE 1 which is surely a minimal requirement at this time.</P>
    <P>I should also like to think that membership of the Authority would be representative of a broad spectrum of interests, economic, social, cultural, community, youth, agriculture and so on.  To be successful it must have a high degree of local autonomy.  In my own area, and I am sure in every area, there is a wealth of resources, commercial and community, private and public which could be mobilised and harnessed to provide a comprehensive local broadcasting service including some people who are already involved in broadcasting, unlicensed as it is at present.  I believe there is on tap in each locality a large pool of <Col N="469" /> professional communicators in provincial newspapers.  It should be envisaged that the provincial news media would have an important role in the evolution and development of a local broadcasting service.  It can be validly argued that the development of local broadcasting could play a major role in regional economic and social development.</P>
    <P>This would raise a number of issues, such as the placing of stations.  There would be massive demand for that type of operation in densely populated areas and you would probably have an equally valid demand in a less densely populated area.  With that in mind the Authority should contemplate the twinning of stations. The most important thing we would have is that in this independent broadcasting service people would have an opportunity to give another point of view not necessarily shared by the Authority.  Young people would get a chance to participate in local debates. This is vitally important.  If there are local problems such as the dumping of effluent or something that concerns a particular area then local radio and local television when it comes would provide proper media.  Such a matter might be of no concern to people in other areas but in the local communities these are the important things as I have found because they concern local people.</P>
    <P>I am also in favour of RTE debating our real social problems such as housing and unemployment which are among the things we should be talking about.  With the possibility of an alternative service, if people did not want to listen they could switch over.  Certainly, I should like to have much more positive debate on solutions to our major problems because I am convinced that television and radio as media are not there merely for entertainment. They have an educational function and a duty to help society. Possibly in the case of education&mdash;I think a Deputy this morning pointed out the advantages of the UK classroom system&mdash;we could be doing much more in this sphere.  For instance on Saturdays and in the evenings when children are available to watch television, not <Col N="470" /> necessarily Telefís Scoile, we should have more educational programmes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now debating programmes again.  I said I would allow passing references but we cannot debate radio and television programmes on this Bill. We can do that on the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the provision in the Bill whereby members of the Authority are seconded if they stand for Parliament, I think this could have some serious repercussions.  I should like the Minister's views on it but, as I interpret it, it would mean that the job somebody held in RTE would be frozen or retained for him in the event of his not being successful, which is a hazard of politics.  To use an extreme case, if a political correspondent were to stand for Dáil Éireann and not be successful it would be unfair to him to find on the evening of his defeat or the following morning that he would have to take over his particular role having already identified himself with a particular political party.  The existing system within RTE, where that gentleman could be put into the shadows and offered some less conspicuous employment and gradually brought back into publicity again in due course, is a much more desirable one.</P>
      <P>I would hope, then, that the Minister will bring in his new Bill on independent radio and television.  It is unfortunate that these announcements have to be made in Leopardstown.  Surely the Dáil is the place to discuss these matters and to make these announcements.  Will the Taoiseach dissolve the Dáil down in the Mardyke?  I hope that in future when new legislation is being brought in it will be done in this House in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the new broadcasting authority will have the type of muscle and independence that is required of it.  I agree that commercial radio will be of great benefit to the community and also to its sponsors as a source of advertising. In that event I recommend that RTE be freed of their responsibility with regard <Col N="471" /> to commercial advertising.  Also, in the event of independent broadcasting being a reality, I hope that RTE will settle down to the more serious programmes and to the job of education.  I would like to see the involvement of the local press and indeed the national press in this new Authority.  Above all, this new Authority would be of particular benefit to young people, who at the moment are clamouring for it and seem to think pirate radios and so on are the answer.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the future RTE or the new Authority will look more to what is happening elsewhere and, so far as programmes that I have seen in the North are concerned, that they would concentrate more on issues of importance to the people in these areas.</P>
    <P>I do not begrudge RTE the additional money.  How and where they are going to spend it has already been questioned. I hope they will spend it wisely and well. I hope they will heed the few points I have made with regard to violence on television and with regard to viewing times for people who are at work and who rarely see television but who, on a Sunday evening, get an opportunity to do so.  Frankly, if we had this type of acceptable viewing the fees probably would not be objected to.</P>
    <P>In rural areas which only have RTE it has been a real boon.  In city areas people always had the advantages of the cinema and television was not such a wonderful innovation.  But in rural and remote areas it is a wonderful thing that films from all over the world can be seen on colour television.</P>
    <P>I agree with the previous speaker who said that we should be doing a lot more to ensure that films of important events such as ploughing matches, racing, GAA games and so on are shown on the evening of such functions.  At the moment if something happens in Moscow or Iran the film can be shown on the same evening, but if it happens in Ballycotton there seems to be some problem.  Something should be done to overcome that technical difficulty.</P>
    <P>These are my few remarks on the Bill. <Col N="472" /> I wish the Minister well in his efforts to help the Authority and I hope that shortly we will have a new Bill for an independent broadcasting authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that there are not more Deputies in the House, because this Bill is not the relatively insignificant measure which it purports to be and which the Minister quite wrongly implied it is.</P>
      <P>It is a much more fundamental Bill and it has to do with fundamental freedoms.  James Joyce once said that ideas in this country when they take flight have nets thrown at them to keep them from flight.  I often wonder why when some new development or initiative takes off, the first reaction of the politicians and of many people and of the various vested interests is to control it.  I am a believer in a free society, a society which refuses to be seduced into introducing, as in this case, a whole cobweb of regulations and hindrances to people in the business of expression and communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill here undoubtedly has a number of obnoxious elements in it.  I believe that either deliberately or by accident it has been designed with a view to achieving an essential diminution of freedom of the individual while trying to dress it up in the respectable and generally approved proposal that more finance be made available to RTE.  I question the integrity of the stance which puts both of these in one Bill because they are two very separate issues.  As far as I am concerned, finance for RTE which is hardly something of which there would be much condemnation or inquiry about in this House or elsewhere for one reason or another, can only by vaguest peripheral reference be seen to be relevant to the contents of section 3 or section 4 of the Bill, both of which in themselves are different. I am not much concerned about what the tradition may have been because there are some traditions that do not necessarily merit great respect, though in general terms obviously one has a regard for tradition.  On the one hand, in section 2 of the Bill we talk of <Col N="473" /> increasing the amount of money available to RTE.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that to be a suitable matter for legislation at all.  That is not suitable for legislation.  A wise approach to that would be to allow the Government of the day the power in the context of their total budgetary programme, which is approved by the Dáil, unfortunately so often, long after it has been spent.  That matter should not be dealt with by the main House of Parliament so occupying its valuable time.  Who is going to suggest that RTE or any other national institution should be brought to their knees by the recalcitrance of Deputies in an Opposition party towards voting more money for them?  That is a waste of time, and we need some sort of enabling legislation which will allow Ministers to carry on with the proviso that the general budgetary strategy of the Government is approved by this House to vote money as necessary to national institutions.</P>
    <P>Section 3, however, is very different. This morning the Minister quoted section 16 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 as follows:</P>
    <P>The Authority shall establish and maintain a national television and sound broadcasting service and shall have all such powers as are necessary for or incidental to that purpose. </P>
    <P>He went on to develop this and implied somehow that that paragraph was intended to give power and in Government thinking, clearly exclusive power, a monopoly, to RTE to produce a local broadcasting system in this country.  To put it bluntly, that is a complete misstatement of fact.  I would consider that downright deceitful if I did not know the Minister too well to have such an opinion. He said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>...doubts were raised recently as to whether the section as it stands gives RTE such power.  It would be prudent to remove any doubt on the matter and this is the purpose of the amendment. The provision is purely enabling and does not place any duty on the <Col N="474" /> Authority to provide local broadcasting services.  It merely clarifies RTE's position in regard to the maintenance of existing local services and the establishment of any local services that may be approved by the Minister in the future. </P>
    <P>If the English language means anything, how can the Minister justify a paragraph in the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 which says that the Authority shall establish and maintain a national television and sound broadcasting service, and then pretend that section 3 of this Bill is a justification arising out of that Broadcasting Authority Act for the handing over to RTE exclusively of &ldquo;the establishment of any local services that may be approved by the Minister in the future&rdquo;?  It merely indicates the lack of understanding by this Government of what communications policy is all about. They cannot even distinguish between national broadcasting policy and local broadcasting policy.  It indicates a lack of sensitivity on the part of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the Minister of State and the whole Government to this area which has been relatively controversial in recent times in view of the raising to prominence of the pirate stations by people with entrepreneurial flair, a sense of adventure and a desire to communicate at local level.  What happened? They were branded as law-breakers, their doors were kicked in and they were attacked and vilified in this House.  I am not defending everybody who becomes involved in a breach of the law, but the clear decision by the Government to pursue this group of people in preference, so to speak, to other people who are engaged in breaking the law towards whom this Government are often extremely soft&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I repeat, and the record will show, that I did not accuse any member of the Government or any other Member of breaking the law.  I said that there is a difference in emphasis in the way that this Government pursue categories of people who breach the law.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of this Bill is nothing more than a continuation of the now traditionally accepted philosophy of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to broadcasting which is to see it as an extension of Government.  To my knowledge this philosophy was first enunciated by a previous Taoiseach, the late Deputy Lemass.  That is the first distinction we have to make.  Is broadcasting an arm of Government or is it a medium of exchange and of communication of ideas by a free people as untrammelled by bureaucratic legislation and ministerial dictate as is humanly possible with only such ministerial intervention as is necessary to protect public order and to regulate the air-ways?  On the contrary, the thinking behind this type of philosophy is clearly to garner the power of communication in the hands of a government.  I am not suggesting that this Government are lacking in charity or wisdom in this regard, but when we put on the Statute Book any type of legislation we must not assume that we shall forever have benign government and people who are motivated by the highest ideals, even assuming for the moment, to put the most charitable interpretation on it, that that is the spirit in which this Bill has been drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill at its heart is repressive legislation, the thin end of the wedge. When we come to debate our response to local broadcasting we will be told that <Col N="476" /> local broadcasting is being taken care of adequately and that any suggestion that it is not is a reflection on the integrity, calibre and competency of RTE.  For example, the Minister says that section 16 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1961 confers power on RTE to establish purely local radio services, although he knows that there is no truth in that.  If that is the case, why is it written in here? The table to section 3 states:</P>
    <P>The Authority shall establish and maintain a national television and sound broadcasting service and may establish and maintain local broadcasting services and shall have all such powers as are necessary and incidental to these purposes. </P>
    <P>The Minister distinguishes in this table between national and local broadcasting services, but in his sales talk which accompanied this Bill not only does he not make a distinction but he implies that there is no distinction.  He says that section 16 (1) which allows the authority to maintain a national television and sound broadcasting service is an instrument whereby they may establish a local broadcasting service.  That is a contradiction, if not worse, and it is a disservice to this House.  We must not be guiled or gulled into thinking that this legislation is somehow part of a package, that the other pieces will come in due course and that the possibility of giving licences to duly accredited applicants which the Taoiseach has promised are all going to come, and therefore this is one nice, tidy, round package.  Each item of legislation must not be seen in the context of promised legislation or in the context of an environment created by such promises, because such promises are losing their value and their coinage daily.  It must be seen on its merit, in isolation.  Other pieces of legislation may never come or if they do come they may be repealed.  This legislation says that for the first time ever, clearly enshrined in the hands of a State monopoly, local broadcasting is to be entrusted without any guarantee that anybody else will have access to it.  Not merely is that a <Col N="477" /> bad recipe for local broadcasting or for community broadcasting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will tell me when he replies.  That is the implication that I draw from this and I believe I am right.  Not alone is it a bad recipe for local broadcasting, it is a very dangerous political precedent.  We have enough monopolies in this country and it is fewer of them we need.  The mergers and monopolies legislation promised by this Government might help in that regard.</P>
      <P>Therefore I consider this section to be a dangerous device, perhaps not intentionally but capable of being used as such.  Furthermore, it may be unconstitutional. The Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926 which is quoted regularly by the Minister as being the basis on which licensing is not now possible to independent interests, has a very shaky constitutional foundation.  There cannot be either in terms of natural justice or of common sense any justification for giving to one group the exclusive right to broadcast.  Such a policy is particularly repugnant when that group are stewarded by a handpicked board of a government, regardless of which government may be concerned.  That is a dangerous situation.  It is anti-democratic.  If the issue were to go to the European court it might very well be found to be unconstitutional because it seeks to arrogate to one authority the right to communicate, using technical means, and this surely is the right of all people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 contains similar risks.  Why should an officer of a State or semi-State body be restrained in regard to his freedom?  I can understand the possible thinking behind this&mdash;that a member of RTE who might be nominated for the Dáil might be expected to be given undue favour or preference in respect of the kind of exposure that might be given to him.  I should like to think that the men and women in RTE would not seek to use such a device and that neither should they be open to such an implicit accusation. <Col N="478" /> Again, that is an infringement of human rights and civil liberties which is unnecessary if the experience we have to date is anything to go by.  Fortunately we have had experiences here of very eminent members of RTE having been put forward as candidates in elections and in most cases being successful.  Why should we seek so glibly to limit the freedom of any group of people?  There are precedents for this but they are similarly obnoxious.  We had an example of it in Cork in the recent by-elections when a person had to give up his job in Posts and Telegraphs in order to put himself forward as a candidate.  We should be striving towards the broadening of freedoms and not towards the limiting of freedoms.  We should be endeavouring to encourage maximum freedom of expression, of people's right to communicate or to seek public office. We should not aim at immediately crowding in on such people, people who wish to see a new dimension to their lives but that is what we do if we have petty regulations and an over-burdened bureaucracy, often of a very dubious nature.  I do not see any reason for such a situation and to be frank I do not believe that it is meant sincerely.</P>
    <P>The tradition and the thinking of this Government, as enunciated by one of their most prominent leaders is to see broadcasting as an arm of Government. If that is the case, a worrying and basic question must be asked, that is, is the role of broadcasting in the State an ordered extension of the communication of government or is it something far more expansive which embraces all people and in which all people are entitled to share, which is the view I chose to take? Therefore, this Bill, deliberately or otherwise, will have the effect only&mdash;apart from the initial financial sanction with which we all concur but which should not be a part of this Bill at all&mdash;of tightening up individual freedoms.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the Minister will say that section 3 does not give to RTE the exclusive right to broadcast but I contend that the giving to the authority of the right to establish and maintain local <Col N="479" /> broadcasting services and the conferring on them of all such powers as are necessary or incidental to these purposes is a proposal so wide as to imply clearly that the Government, by way of ministerial decision, can decide to adjudicate that purposes incidental to the maintenance of local broadcasting could include not giving licences.  Therefore, we are seeking to enshrine and are encouraging the enshrinement of the exclusive monopoly of broadcasting in the hands of one group.  Regardless of who that group might be, they should not have that exclusive right.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that we have never heard any demand from RTE for such rights.  I am aware of their concern about the development of broadcasting, including local broadcasting, but any professional body of communicators would be so concerned.  However, RTE have never asked for and, to my knowledge, do not seek now the exclusive right to broadcast because they realise the invidious position in which that places them.  We are told by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy that free enterprise and competition is good in certain sectors.  Apparently, it is not good in this area.  Competition, contrasts and the right to varying shades of view are all good in society and should not be circumscribed or limited unless such a situation is warranted by the most extreme circumstances and then only for the most temporary and transistory period.</P>
    <P>In a review of the year published in the RTE authority report last year on the question of radio development the authority said they had long been of the view that a single radio channel was inadequate for a full range of programmes and of programme choice for listeners. They said that on a number of occasions attention had been drawn to the need for a second national radio channel and that moreover the need for local radio stations offering a community-based radio service to the public was clear also.  They said, too, that while every effort had been made within the constraints of the <Col N="480" /> single channel to offer as comprehensive a programme service as was possible by providing some programme choice through the VHF band and by increasing the number of programmes originating outside Dublin, these measures were by definition of limited effect.</P>
    <P>The point is that RTE do not seek an exclusive monopoly on broadcasting. We are fortunate in having so many professional staff in RTE and in particular that there is an independent spark activating many of them but these people realise that if they are isolated, if they have not the possibility of moving from one area of the communications industry to another, that if their communications outlet is limited to a State-governed authority, their freedoms are restricted as is the development of their professional ability, with a consequent disservice to everybody.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider these sections.  There is no public demand for such legislation and I do not know why these sections were inserted at the end of this rather tatty and brief Bill which ostensibly, is enabling us to give more money to RTE.  The Minister's concise preamble to the Bill is interesting.  In a very brief statement, two pages are devoted to the granting of a sum of money to RTE and then, slipped in at the end in two paragraphs are the references to the obnoxious elements in sections 3 and 4.  Not one Government backbencher has come in to offer to contribute to the debate, but I intend to right that situation now and to ensure at least that some of them will be here to listen because the House must not be treated in this way.</P>

Anyone who puts down a parliamentary question will be accused of not having any confidence in RTE. That position is unfortunate and is a disservice to the House and to the country. Perhaps I would not be so concerned if there was a good record with regard to promises.

      <P>If the Deputy wants the names of members of his own party who did so also I will be happy to give them to him.  I suggest he stays quiet about the matter.  The Government have overreacted in regard to this matter.  Although the words &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; and &ldquo;exclusive right&rdquo; are not in the Bill they may be reasonably interpreted from the reference to the giving of power to the RTE Authority to take to themselves &ldquo;all such powers as are necessary for or incidental to those purposes&rdquo;, those purposes being the establishment and maintenance of national television and sound broadcasting services and the establishment and maintenance of local broadcasting services.  If we are to introduce here a measure that seeks to give to RTE &ldquo;all such powers as are necessary for or incidental to those purposes&rdquo;, how can the Minister suggest that one such power might not be the effective refusal to grant licences to others?</P>

      <P>Article 40 of the Constitution guarantees <i>inter alia</i> liberty to citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions subject to public order and morality.  In keeping with that right there should be greater freedom of the air waves, not less.  Granting effective local broadcasting services to RTE or to any body is a diminution of that right. The Minister may talk about proposals which he will introduce to widen and broaden local broadcasting, but nothing like that is on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>His colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, has already ruled out quite categorically the suggestion that it is legal to broadcast without a licence.  I contend, as does my colleague Deputy Kelly, that there may be a constitutional reason for suggesting that there is no basis in the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, for such an attitude.  Assuming that is correct, the facts are that the only reference by this Government to local broadcasting, apart from after dinner speeches which run glibly off the tongues of some, the only policy statement, the only decision, is contained in section 3 of the Bill.  The effect of that is to seek to enshrine for all time the power to maintain local broadcasting in the hands of RTE.  That is regrettable.  It is a disservice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to analyse whether it is right in political terms or whether it is a question of individual freedom.  Let us ask ourselves how it can be done and how suited RTE are to the job of instituting and maintaining local broadcasting.  In case there is any misrepresentation, I <Col N="486" /> want to put it on record that nobody wants to undermine RTE.  We all seek to support them in every way possible.  We want to grant whatever moneys are deemed to be necessary for the proper running and management of RTE.  Many of us are fulsome in our praise of them. They did a splendid job recently on the occasion of the Papal visit when they showed themselves capable of not just competing with but surpassing some of the finest broadcasting networks in the world.  Their integrity is not in question. Their competence is not in question at national level.</P>
    <P>However, local broadcasting is something else.  It is not a question of the national network getting themselves organised along the lines suggested in this document which is a report on &ldquo;Radio Telefís Éireann, Ireland's National Radio and Television Service&rdquo;, published earlier this year.  In a paragraph headed &ldquo;Community Radio&rdquo; it is stated:</P>
    <P>This facility is provided either by a mobile studio and transmitter unit parked in a village square or city side street, or from one of the regional studios.  Broadcasting at low power on VHF or medium wave, the studio has an effective range of 3-5 miles.  On average, some five hours of programming per day are presented during a week's visit to each center.  Members of the local community plan, research and present all programmes. </P>
    <P>That is a very good initiative and one we would all commend and respect.  Unfortunately, it is no substitute for any kind of community or local radio policy.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>RTE confines its involvement to provision of the mobile studio and technical staff.  A senior producer is assigned to manage the studio and advise the participants.  He does not make programming decisions.  In choosing centers to be visited, RTE aims to serve both rural and urban communities.  The visit of the mobile studio is normally timed to coincide with a festival or other major local <Col N="487" /> event, not in order to cover the festival but because the presence of an active committee facilitates planning. </P>
    <P>The demands which I suspect such a welcome although meagre service place on RTE are significant.  If a decision was made which was considered to be wise and proper, to ban the advertisement of something injurious to public health, RTE might feel constrained to curtail services for reasons arising out of lack of revenue or the Government's reluctance to increase licence fees or raise revenue in some other way.  Even the meagre community oriented services operating at present and doing a good job would be the first on the list to get the axe.</P>
    <P>Is there a difference between the ability of RTE to handle a national network and local community based broadcasting?  There is.  They are totally different.  The fact that there is general public subscription to the concept of community based broadcasting means that we will have local management structures and local resources under significant local control or influence. Local broadcasting in the hands of RTE would not permit of that sort of approach. The responsibilities, whether statutory or not, are vastly and fundamentally different.  I contend that RTE are not the vehicle through which local broadcasting policy should be carried out.  I believe in their heart of hearts RTE would agree with that view.</P>
    <P>Local broadcasting is a fundamentally different concept from some sort of quasi extension of what RTE are engaged in at present.  What is local broadcasting?  I should like to quote from a brief document submitted by the Bray association for local community radio.  It is an outline of the Bray local broadcasting radio project and a brief summary of the role of local radio in that community.  They say:</P>
    <P>The basic difference between community local radio and nationwide broadcasting is that with local radio complete two-wave communication is possible and more relevant.  Local <Col N="488" /> radio is an active process where the local community concerned is at one and the same time the author, the subject and the receiver of the transmitted message. </P>
    <P>As local radio is germane to this Bill, it is reasonable to mention this point.  The difference between local broadcasting and other broadcasting services is that one is based in the community, reflects community values, is structured with a view to community priorities and is managed by the community.</P>
    <P>I want to quote from another document the source of which I have not got to hand:</P>
    <P>Local radio should bring a community together, its value in combating loneliness, isolation and fragmentation is all out of proportion to its modest cost.  Local radio with its unique service can greatly help people who find it difficult to leave their homes, mothers with young children, blind and handicapped people, older citizens.  These groups need no longer feel alienated and isolated from what is going on in their locality.  The benefit to the community of local radio is immense and the costs are low.  It seems a shame not to make use of the potential of radio. </P>
    <P>If we are to involve communities with their individual sensitivities, with their concern for the local social problems, local personalities and local issues, RTE, a nationally based and nationally oriented service, may not be the vehicle through which that can be orchestrated. Their whole momentum, their whole way of thinking, their whole outlook and philosophy, their responsibility and unanswerability to the Minister, are in a different focus and on a different plane.</P>
    <P>It would be far more healthy to have separate responsibility.  That is why I oppose section 3 of the Bill.  It is regrettable that this Bill is not in the context of the kind of broadcasting policy which we assume the Government want to introduce and which they said they want to introduce, that is, a policy whereby&mdash;if I understand the Taoiseach <Col N="489" /> correctly in his remarks on this about six months ago&mdash;the national broadcasting network will be in the hands of RTE willingly supported by the unanimous views of this House and it should be adequately funded and resourced to do the job.  Accompanying this and parallel to it there would be an independent broadcasting network with licences granted by the Government to people who accord to certain criteria, which should obviously include a reference to the ability of such people to carry out their responsibilities properly, barring the likelihood of them defecting after causing public outrage and things like that.</P>
    <P>A third stratum would be the area of local broadcasting, community broadcasting, which some of the stations broadcasting without a licence have been involved in.  They have the ability to focus on a much smaller community. Even though I do not consider the stations broadcasting without a licence to be what I would consider to be the epitome of community radio they, nevertheless, make a reasonable stab at it.  We are talking then about a situation in which a local radio has a certain amount of local management skill, in relation to local issues and deals with them in a way which is fundamentally different from what I believe RTE can ever do under this Bill.  I do not believe RTE can cope with that and there are others who agree with me.</P>
    <P>There was an article by Edward W. Ploman in a recent broadcasting review, in which he stated:</P>
    <P>There are three main reasons why we need a communications policy, first, we no longer have any choice in the matter, second, we can no longer afford not to have one, and third, we continuously make decisions which amount to unintentional policies. </P>
    <P>This Bill is a decision in isolation.  It bears the hallmark of a thinking which says that local broadcasting should best be left in the hands of the &ldquo;professionals&rdquo; or maybe the &ldquo;politicians&rdquo; if tradition and what is on the record is to be accepted.  That is dangerous, unhelpful and will do the <Col N="490" /> broadcasting services and the full network of such services a disservice.  It will not enhance the prospect of good broadcasting.  It may distract energies, resources and initiatives from the standards and calibre of the present RTE services.  It deprives people at local level of a certain amount of local autonomy in democracy, which I consider they are constitutionally entitled to as they are in the business of communications.  It also deprives them of the right to make the input, which they have to give, because of their individual skills and so forth.</P>
    <P>Who is this Bill designed to serve?  I am omitting section 1, which is the financial enabling part of it.  We have a tradition in the House where we have options in relation to a Bill.  We can either vote for or against it or we can abstain.  We can, of course, try to amend it but I have no doubt that such amendments would get short shrift here.  I believe it would be a waste of time to try to amend this Bill. If this was a sincerely meant Bill I would have thought, in view of what Mr. Ploman said, and what many other communicators have said, that references to local broadcasting and the allocation and assignment of powers in respect of local broadcasting for the future should best be left until we have a comprehensive document enabling us to view in a critical manner how broadcasting for the future should go.</P>
    <P>We are told that there is other broadcasting legislation on the cards and that one Bill has already been published.  If the debate on broadcasting is to take place shortly why was it found necessary to bring in this insidious Bill at this time? It is a mistake.  I hope it is an error of judgment rather than a deliberate mistake. How can the Minister justify the extraction of one fundamental element of broadcasting policy, for example, the question of the power of control and autonomy relating to local broadcasting, and bring it to a decision now while contending that we will soon be discussing broadcasting policy and the opening up of the airways to people, not necessarily RTE?  This seems to me to be a most unsatisfactory way of doing business.  I <Col N="491" /> would like to hear an explanation from the Minister.  At the moment it leads one to the conclusion that there is some desperate reason for it.</P>
    <P>The Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, according to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, gives the exclusive right to RTE to broadcast.  RTE is the only station licensed to broadcast under that Act.  I do not know if there is a licensing capacity in the Act.  Under what licence, statute or authority do RTE broadcast? What are the legal processes which allow RTE to broadcast?  Are RTE also broadcasting without a licence?  The Wireless Telegraphy Act is an enabling Act.  What are the specific rubrics by which RTE occupies their broadcasting position at the central stage of Irish life? The position of exclusive monopolies, which is behind this Bill and the other Bill which is promised, is untenable and is repugnant to this party.</P>
    <P>The Minister must agree that the Bill effectively limits freedom for RTE employees in section 4 and for people wishing to get involved in local broadcasting, in section 3.  We have, to some extent, very adequate limitations on our freedom already, some of which have very dubious value.  Thank God, they have not been excessively abused.  I contend it is dangerous to have them there because there can be times of mass emotion and public reaction when politicians, with less wisdom than they might have on occasions, may seek to use such legislation for very temporary ends and when there could be massive inroads on the kind of freedoms we all seek to enjoy. I know that all legislation is a response to something.  This Bill presumably is a response to some request from somebody some place.  I see no demand whatever for sections 3 and 4.  I do not know of any person who has asked for an exclusive monopoly of broadcasting for RTE.  I do not know of any person who has sought to limit the freedoms of RTE members in relation to their access to this House.</P>
    <P>I often wonder why it is that people who aspire to this particular profession <Col N="492" /> are somehow tainted with the kind of brush which says that their freedoms should have more restrictions.  What makes this job different?  It is only a job, even though it may be argued whether it is an important one or an irrelevant one. Why should it be that every time a person raises his head and says he would like to exercise his constitutional right to run for the Dáil or Seanad we all say to him that he must lose his job, that he has to be seconded from his job, that we do not trust him because he is a political animal?  If politicians were not so thick-skinned they would resent that. It implies that a person interested in politics, by definition, is a different person. That is not constitutionally sound and it is not acceptable.  I ask the Minister to consider that also.</P>
    <P>In an article in the <i>Political Quarterly</i> of April/June, 1976 called &ldquo;Freedom in Broadcasting&rdquo; by a writer called Tony Firth, he said:</P>
    <P>Since the end of the nineteenth century, then, the trend of regulation and legislation has been to define, more and more narrowly, that freedom which radio and television might finally enjoy.  I say &ldquo;finally&rdquo;, because I am not suggesting that these powers, where they were not concerned with the details of licensing and such matters as endowing the Post Office with some probably necessary monopolies, were other than to be held in reserve. </P>
    <P>Even in relation to a brief resume of the history of broadcasting, particularly from the point of view of the freedoms in it, we see that the tendency has always been to circumscribe those freedoms. Politicians attach great significance to the impact of broadcasting.  Sometimes they exaggerate it slightly.  Why are we all getting upset about licensing in this area?  Why do we need a licensing system?  The newspapers do not need licences.  I accept that technical adjustments may be necessary to allocate frequencies to individual stations but that is not what we are talking about.  We are talking about the freedom to broadcast. We are talking about the basic freedom to communicate which is enjoyed by the <Col N="493" /> media.  Neither the Minister nor I would suggest that the newspapers should be licensed or should have their power circumscribed by section 1.  Nobody would suggest that and God forbid that it should come to pass.  Why is this desire so articulated in relation to radio and television?  Is it because television has more impact than newspapers?  If the concept of the need to license people to communicate in an organised way through the media is valid in relation to broadcasting, it seems that it should be valid throughout a range of publications, including the new citizens' band radio, to which, of course, our first response would be to eliminate it or to introduce a regulation condemning it.  We would rush in immediately.  We should not rush in because it is a good development.  I am not worried what they are communicating on their radios if they are speaking privately to themselves.  I would like to keep an eye on it to make sure that it was not doing a disservice to public order.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that we should license newspapers.  I am suggesting that the non-licensing of newspapers is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that there is no rationale for licensing in relation to radio and television broadcasting above and beyond the technical and mechanical matters of allocating airways.  I do not believe that the Minister paid any thought to that concept.  If he has, I should like to hear about it.</P>
    <P>Another reason why section 3 is unacceptable is that the character and sensitivities of local radio need a substantial amount of local input; in fact, they should be primarily locally managed.  In an article by John Saunders in relation to the role of local radio in community education, published in the <i>European Broadcasting Union Review</i> of May 1976, Mr. Saunders, being the education programme services organiser of BBC local radio, there is a quotation to the effect:</P>
    <P>The special aim of the local station will be to build a vigorous and satisfying local life, with a wide and progressive outlook.  It would do <Col N="494" /> much to make people proud of their community and willing to take part in its affairs.  It would be at war against rootlessness to which so many social shortcomings are largely attributed.... </P>
    <P>He develops this theme which has as its basic philosophy the need for strong local control of local broadcasting.  He was specifically referring to education which has enormous local implications for good.  If local broadcasting is to succeed, how can it be administered nationally?  Is it not contradictory to pretend that the best local broadcasting can only be administered by a national effort? He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Community education&rdquo; in the way we had seen it means putting back more where now there is less.  It means establishing the individual firmly in the community in which he lives and which he understands and trusts.  Seen in this light, there is perhaps little that is broadcast on local radio that falls outside our definition.  It is, for example, significant information to be told that a piece of music is being played by a local musician.  We do not, however, have to rely on such abstruse detail since the evidence quite clearly shows that BBC local radio is a major force in &ldquo;community education&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>There is no way in which we can deal with nationally organised local radio. There is a further reference from a series broadcast by Radio Stoke in autumn 1975 which expressed the essence of community education on local radio. Called &ldquo;Time to Care&rdquo;, the aims of the series were explained in the booklet to accompany the programmes:</P>
    <P>One of the most encouraging and significant ways in which the community is beginning to care for itself is in the development of &ldquo;good neighbour&rdquo; schemes and &ldquo;community care&rdquo; groups.  The series &ldquo;Time to Care&rdquo; has been designed to encourage and support the development of such groups and to share and publicize their experience.... </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> The Minister should reconsider the wisdom of depriving local communities of the power to organise their own radio service and of the power to give it the insights and expertise which such a process would inevitably mean.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister mentioned that.  The Minister is longer here than I am but I know enough to know that I would be a fool, as would this House be very foolish, if I were to base my attitude to current legislation on a promise.  The only thing that concerns us today is this Bill.  Who knows what tomorrow holds?  If the Minister is basing his attitude on future packages of reforms, I suggest that his approach to legislation is fundamentally wrong.  The only Bill before us is this Bill.  We cannot be beguiled into moderating our views in the expectation that tomorrow will bring <Col N="496" /> something else.  The promised legislation may not be introduced for a hundred reasons&mdash;because the Government might change their minds, because the order of priority of the Government might change, because the Government may fall, because a roof may fall.  If the two Bills were alongside each other I still would not accept such an approach.  If assurances are needed about the integrity of this step, it should be in the Bill.  It is wrong to pretend that that approach is acceptable because it depends on promises which may not be delivered. Even if the promises were delivered, what is to prevent the repeal of one measure while leaving the other measure extant?  If the Minister wants the support of this side of the House he must have inserted in his Bill the enabling process whereby freedom of the airways is guaranteed in the letter as it is in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (a) the dates on which approval in principle was given to each of the several schemes to amend the Bord na Móna superannuation scheme 1963 now contained in the 1978 amendment scheme, the date of approval in principle for the amending schemes for 1972, 1973 and 1975 not yet formally approved; (b) if he will clarify the position of the scheme approved in principle but not formally approved, in relation to any appeal made by a contributing member under the 1963 scheme, if a contributing member may rely on schemes approved in principle as if they had been sealed by the Minister; and (c) the date on which the further amending scheme for added years of service was received in his Department and the latest date of approval.</P>

      <P>(a) The 1978 amendment scheme incorporates three proposed amendment schemes, one submitted for approval in 1968 and two in 1970.  Overall approval in principle was given for the proposed amendments on 2 December 1970, the operative date to be 4 June 1970 except in the case of the amendment in relation to the contribution year contained in the 1968 scheme which was to operate from 27 March 1969.  In the scheme signed on 13 December 1978 the particular provision relating to deduction in respect of death duty was for legal reasons made effective <Col N="463" /> from the date of formalisation of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The dates of approval in principle of the amending schemes submitted in 1972, 1973 and 1975 are as follows: 1972 scheme: 17 November 1972 to operate from 31 August 1972; 1973 scheme: 25 January 1974 to operate from 29 March 1973; 1975 scheme: 31 October 1975 to operate from 1 October 1975.</P>
      <P>(b) Amendments which have been approved in principle would have the same effect as if they had been formally approved in an amendment scheme and could, therefore, be subject to an appeal by a contributing member in the same way as regulations contained in the principal scheme.</P>
      <P>(c) The proposed amendment dealing with added years of service was received in September 1976 and was approved in principle on 11 June 1979.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Authority have established a special unit in their east region office to promote industrial development in the Dublin inner city.  The unit will help to secure suitable sites and buildings as part of their effort to encourage the establishment and expansion of small industries in the inner city.  The unit are at present engaged in a major programme of consultation with community groups in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Authority have acquired a site at East Wall Road at which approximately 100,000 sq. ft. of advance factory space will be provided.  These units will be <Col N="464" /> available to suitable industrial projects, probably principally in the engineering and clothing sectors, from 1980 onwards.  It is expected that this development will provide about 250 jobs when fully occupied.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of new jobs will also arise from expansion of industries in the area, which of course may avail of the full range of IDA incentives. The Authority expect that up to 1,000 new industrial jobs will be created in the north-east inner city in the period up to 1982.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the report in question which refers to a paper delivered at a Conference on Environmental Impact Assessment held on 8 and 9 November 1979 which was organised by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  Legislation governing environmental impact assessment is contained in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts 1963 and 1976 and in regulations made thereunder.  Under these provisions which came into operation in March 1977 an application for planning permission for certain types of development must be accompanied by a written study of what, if any, effect the proposed development, if carried out, would have on the environment.</P>

      <P>I am fully satisfied that the liaison between AnCO and the IDA with regard to industrial expansion planned and industrial training facilities provided by AnCO for residents of North-Central Dublin, will ensure that the maximum possible number of local residents will receive relevant industrial training to equip them to take up employment in new industries destined for location in that area.</P>
      <P>To this end AnCO have been working in close co-operation with the inner city unit of the Industrial Development Authority.  AnCO are fully aware of the extra training facilities which are required to cater for the needs of the area. At present over 300 people are in training in inner city locations, including Beresford Place, where a range of courses are available.  Of this total approximately 250 actually reside in the North-Central area.</P>
      <P>AnCO recently conducted a survey on youth employment in North-Central Dublin, which indicated that most of the unemployed school leavers were educationally and socially disadvantaged and not in a position to avail of normal AnCO main stream courses.  In recognition of this situation AnCO operate a number of vocational preparation and special workshop training courses.  Some of these courses are run in conjunction with local community organisations.</P>
      <P>In addition, AnCO are seeking a suitable site in the area on which to erect a 200 place permanent training centre.  I am confident that when this centre is available the industrial training needs of North-Central Dublin will be comprehensively catered for on the basis of continuing assessment of likely job opportunities and related to the individual training needs of the local population.</P>
