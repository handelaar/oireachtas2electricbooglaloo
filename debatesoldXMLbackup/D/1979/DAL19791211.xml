      <P>In this House in which he has served for so many years as Deputy, Minister, Taoiseach, and for a period Leader of the Opposition, I should like to express again formally what I was glad to have the chance to say last Wednesday through other channels, my sincere regret at the departure of the Taoiseach from his office and the respect which I and my party feel for his service to the State.  My predecessor, Deputy Liam Cosgrave, has spoken of Deputy Lynch's unique popularity as a political leader.  This is a reflection of qualities of warmth, spontaneity and sincerity which attract our people naturally. I have admired also his tenacity and political skill exercised frequently in the interests of leading his party along the path of moderation in relation to Northern Ireland and his almost unfailing courtesy even when his patience has been tested, by me amongst others. History will in time give an interim and <Col N="1324" /> later a more definitive verdict on his place in Irish politics.  I can only record regret that at the end he was brought down before his time by smaller ambitious men who have little mercy for a man who has served them and his country well.</P>

      <P>He knows and his wife, Maureen, knows in what affection she is held by people of all parties and how much we, who know what a burden politics impose on those people engaged in them, respect the support and encouragement which she was always able to give him in bad times and good.  I hope that he will wish to remain in this House for a long time to come.  If he does I am sure that the electorate in Cork will oblige.  On behalf of all my colleagues I wish himself and his wife a long and happy retirement together free from the burdens of office.</P>

      <P>On the announcement by Deputy Lynch of his relinquishing the office of Taoiseach of this country after 13 years, on behalf of my party I would like to express to Deputy Lynch our appreciation of the service he has rendered to Ireland over his period in public life.  I have had and still have profound differences of opinion with him regarding economic and social policies and on occasions on reconciliation with Northern Ireland and the means by which it can best be achieved in our country.  There has never been the slightest doubt on the part of either friend or foe about the personal integrity of Deputy Lynch.</P>

      <P>Neither has there ever been any doubt about the motivation for his service to this country.  There has never been any question of personal advantage or ambition on the part of Deputy Lynch.  For the most part of the past ten years he has had the responsibility of presiding over the affairs of this nation in an extremely difficult period&mdash;perhaps one of the most difficult <Col N="1325" /> since the foundation of the State&mdash;but he undertook that responsibility, according to his lights, in the best interest of the Irish people.  However, that difficult and turbulent period deprived Deputy Lynch and his wife of many of the domestic compensations that one would be entitled to expect in married life.  On behalf of this party I can only express the sincere wish that Deputy Lynch and his wife may now have an opportunity of making up for the sacrifices they have had to make in the service of Ireland.  I wish them a long and happy life together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The occasion of the election of a Taoiseach is not any ordinary debate.  We are not here merely as representatives of parties seeking office in competition with one another on this occasion.  My task is correspondingly difficult.  In a way that has no precedent I am conscious of speaking for a large part of the Irish people, regardless of party, and I am very conscious of the difficulty of responding adequately and sensitively to this unique situation.  I must speak not only for the Opposition but for many in Fianna Fáil who may not be free to say what they believe or to express their deep fears for the future of this country under the proposed leadership, people who are not free to reveal what they know and what led them to oppose this man with a commitment far beyond the normal.  I hope that some at least may feel able to express their feelings, their very real patriotism and their deep concern for Ireland, but few or none may be able to do so.  If that is the case, this task falls to others and, in the first instance, to me.  I trust I may be equal to it, that I may say what needs to be said and can be said, recognising how much I cannot say, for reasons that all in this House understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take no pleasure in what I have to say.  I have known Deputy Haughey for more than 35 years.  I have never suffered insult or injury from him nor exchanged with him bitter words at any time.  I would find my task today easier if <Col N="1327" /> we had not had this long relationship with each other, a relationship that was never intimate but never hostile.  But I must do my duty regardless of these personal considerations.  At the outset I must recognise his talents&mdash;his political skills and the competence he has shown in the past in the administration of Departments.  These are important qualities in a Taoiseach, but they are not enough.</P>
    <P>This country has had six heads of Government since the State was founded. These were: William T. Cosgrave, Eamonn de Valera, John A. Costello, Seán Lemass, Jack Lynch and Liam Cosgrave, all different kinds of men, God knows, but they all shared one common bond.  They came into public life to serve this country and stayed on with that single purpose.  None of them was ever alleged, even by his most unrelenting enemy&mdash;and some of them had unrelenting enemies on both sides&mdash;to have entered public life for any motive but the highest.  Moreover, whatever their contemporary opponents may have said of them, whatever history's interim or later verdict on them may be, all were men who commanded the trust of those close to them.  From a recollection of their virtues we may draw sustained hope for the future of this State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey presents himself here, seeking to be invested in office as the seventh in this line, but he comes with a flawed pedigree.  His motives can be judged ultimately only by God but we cannot ignore the fact that he differs from his predecessors in that these motives have been and are widely impugned, most notably but by no means exclusively, by people within his own party, people close to him who have observed his actions for many years and who have made their human, interim judgment on him.  They and others, both in and out of public life, have attributed to him an overweening ambition which they do not see as a simple emanation of a desire to serve but rather as a wish to dominate, even to own the State.</P>
    <P>This judgment will be contested by others.  It cannot be more than an imperfect <Col N="1328" /> assessment of the man but it is incontestable that this view of him is widely and most passionately held by people in his own party.  If elected, he will be the first in a line of hitherto patriotic men who will have been viewed in this way by many contemporaries and many of his colleagues.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of the election of this man as Taoiseach which must disturb deeply every democrat is that, whatever may be the result of the vote&mdash;and I think that is a foregone conclusion&mdash;he knows, I know and they all know that he does not command the genuine confidence of even one-third of this House, never mind one half.  No previous Taoiseach has been elected in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>Formally, of course, he will secure a majority of votes.  He will fulfil the constitutional requirement to form a government. He will then constitutionally be Taoiseach.  As democrats we must respect the forms of democracy, even when the true spirit of the democratic system is not breathed into these forms but though we must respect these forms we are entitled to comment on the emptiness of this formality.  The feet that will go through that lobby to support his election will include many that will drag; the hearts of many who will climb those stairs before turning aside to vote will be heavy.  Many of those who may vote for him will be doing so in the belief and the hope that they will not have long to serve under a man they do not respect, whom they have fought long and hard, but for the moment in vain, to exclude from the highest office in the land.  These men and women who, while they may give their formal consent, withhold their full consent in the interior forum include a clear majority of those who have served with him in government, who know his abilities better than most but are repelled by other defects which they see as superseding all considerations of mere competence, political skill or adroitness.</P>
    <P>Who are the men, three out of ten Members of this assembly, who have placed their full confidence in Deputy Haughey, electing him to the leadership <Col N="1329" /> of his party?  Do they include the members of the party opposite who, whatever criticism may be and has been made by us and others of their political judgment, are recognised outside their party as within it as people of integrity?  Do they include the Taoiseach, because he is still Taoiseach until his successor is elected? Do they include Deputy Colley, Deputy O'Malley, Deputy O'Donoghue, Deputy Wilson, Deputy Faulkner, Deputy Dennis Gallagher, Deputy Molloy, Deputy Woods?  I need not continue with the list and no one need feel slighted if I omit honourable names.  These are people who are respected outside Fianna Fáil as within it for their genuine patriotism however much we on these benches may at times have to question their judgment or the wisdom of their policies in the national interest.</P>
    <P>It is not from such as these that Deputy Haughey won his majority.  His majority comprises men judged inadequate in office in the past; men ambitious for office but disappointed of it hitherto; men fearful of losing office because they backed the wrong horse; and, above all, at least 18 men who scraped home narrowly in 1977 and who, fearing for the seats that were so unexpectedly won for them by the gamble of the manifesto, have now switched their bet to another gamble, the gamble of Deputy Haughey.</P>

      <P>We are electing the leader of this State and I will not be silenced in doing my duty in this House as I see it.  I want to say one thing more in fairness to Deputy Haughey's supporters. Not all of them are drawn from these categories.  They include also a few <Col N="1330" /> people who are not personally motivated, but who are inspired by a narrow and dangerous nationalism that is the antithesis of everything Tone and Davis stood for&mdash;a patriotism that effectively, even if they do not admit it even to themselves, excludes one million Irish men and women from the nation as they conceive it; men and women who do not believe in seeking unity by agreement but who crave after unity by constraint; men and women who, whether they themselves realise it or not, think in terms of imposing one Irish tradition on those who, with their ancestors for generations past, had honoured a different but also an Irish tradition.  These men and women who voted for Deputy Haughey on grounds of idealism&mdash;misplaced as I see it&mdash;and free from personal interest are, I believe and the great majority of almost five million Irish people believe, not merely misguided but dangerously misguided.</P>
      <P>Taken together these groups of self-interested and fatally misguided defectors from the Republican tradition of 1798 and 1848 make up three Deputies out of every ten in this House.  Yet, this motley minority may, and I think will, at the end of this debate make this man Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Why so?  The Irish people are entitled to ask this question.  What worries me is whether I can honestly answer, if asked what the reason is, other than that, though many on both sides of this House have honourably struggled to break free from Civil War politics, nevertheless these politics, through the shackles of the party system that emerged from that Civil War, still bind some of the Members of this House in thraldom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If those on both sides of this House who see the dangers for this State that lie almost inexorably and fatally embedded in the nomination now before us cannot find it possible at this moment to come together in face of this danger and make common cause for Ireland, can we truthfully say to our electorate, some of them born almost 40 years after that event, that there is any reason for this other than the origins of the parties to <Col N="1331" /> which we belong&mdash;origins that many of us had hoped were now totally irrelevant to the contemporary political life of this State?</P>
    <P>The long shadow of that darkest hour of our history, when Irishman fought Irishman, when families were divided, brother against brother, husband in conflict with wife as happened in my own family&mdash;that long shadow which many of us had led ourselves to believe had long since lifted, darkens our understanding here today and inhibits this House from dividing along the lines of deepest conviction, along the lines that divide those who honestly seek Irish unity by agreement, and by agreement only, from those who, while they talk of peaceful means, still think at least subconsciously of constraint.  It also divides true patriots from mere political opportunists.</P>
    <P>I would like to believe that there is still hope, still a possibility, that we could face this crisis in our affairs, throwing off these shackles and coming out from under this shadow.  Perhaps it is too much to hope of men and women who are under intolerable pressures of tradition and convention at this point.  However, if it does not happen today, that does not mean that it may not happen at some point in the middle future.  For the mixture of men and motives artificially concocted to create a formal majority for Deputy Haughey when this debate ends must be frail and fragile; it cannot survive indefinitely the pressures on it imposed by his&mdash;I must say it&mdash;flawed character.</P>
    <P>There will be those around Deputy Haughey who will scoff, or perhaps purport to scoff, at these reflections.  Some of them who see power as an end in itself rather than as a means to serve the public interest, may claim to see in what I have just said nothing more than regret that we on this side of the House cannot come to power now through a realignment of forces in this House.  They are welcome to this interpretation which would accord with their view of politics.</P>
    <P>But others will understand that I have spoken in these terms not from ambition <Col N="1332" /> but from conviction.  Yes, I and those around me have the ambition to serve this country in office, a task for which we are seeking to prepare ourselves.  But we can bide our time, all the more confident in the verdict of the people because of the choice inflicted on Fianna Fáil by a narrow majority of its members in circumstances which are already the subject of bitter recrimination within that party.  I know that those who chose Deputy Haughey for the most part did so because they thought it to their electoral advantage.  They will, I believe live to rue that misjudgment.  By their action they have torn asunder their party, and no amount of patching or crack-papering can put it together again whole, so long as Deputy Haughey remains its Leader.  These divisions will have inevitable electoral consequences, consequences which they have failed to foresee, so confident were they that, if only their candidate could be bulldozed into the leadership, all would be well.</P>
    <P>If I were speaking here in party terms, if I were thinking narrowly in terms of the welfare of this party, I should be welcoming in a relaxed way the imminent advent to power of Deputy Haughey.  I know that many decent people in every part of Ireland who have cast their votes for Fianna Fáil candidates are repelled by the thought of Deputy Haughey in power and, however skilfully and energetically he may strive&mdash;he will strive skilfully and energetically, he has those qualities&mdash;during the next year or two years to apply his undoubted talents to the task of Government, he will not persuade these people to cast their votes for a party led by him, even if that party were to be a united one, which palpably it will not be.</P>
    <P>But if Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach is an uncovenanted bonus to Fine Gael, a precipitating factor that will bring to our support many good and patriotic people of integrity who for many years have cast their votes for Fianna Fáil under Deputy Jack Lynch, he cannot be seen in the same light so far as the national interest is concerned.  On this <Col N="1333" /> occasion I have to say, with regret&mdash;even some bitterness&mdash;that the interests of my party and the nation do not coincide.  I have the interests of this nation sufficiently at heart&mdash;I think in saying that I speak for my party also&mdash;to prefer to take our chance with another Fianna Fáil leader who would not provoke such mistrust amongst the electorate and who would be correspondingly harder to beat, than for the country to have to take a chance with Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <P>Why is it such a chance?  There are many reasons.  I shall give only a few; some are not to be raised even in this privileged assembly.  The first is that there is a question-mark that remains over a man who was accused of conspiracy to import arms to the IRA and after he had been found not guilty of that charge chose to seek the plaudits of the crowd for a man who represented that organisation at that time, saying of him: &ldquo;he is one of the finest persons I have known in all my time in public life and politics&rdquo;.  For nine long years after that day&mdash;nine long years&mdash;he refused to utter one word of condemnation of the IRA until faced with a question on this issue at a press conference following his election to the leadership of his party.  I say &ldquo;refused&rdquo; advisedly.  Deputy Haughey disingenuously told his questioner at the press conference on Friday that the reason he had never expressed any condemnation of the IRA up to that moment was that: &ldquo;up to now responsibility in regard to Northern Ireland policy has been something for the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In what way, I ask the House, would that allocation of responsibility preclude any Minister in an Irish Government from expressing his abhorrence for the IRA, for its murders and robberies North and South, its orgy of destruction, its threat to our democratic institutions, institutions which it refuses to recognise in this State and which its spokesmen recently threatened to destroy?  If Deputy Haughey abhorred the IRA and wished, as any decent man would wish to do, to clear his name of any sympathy with <Col N="1334" /> them after the experience of being accused of conspiring to import arms for their benefit, he could have done so at any moment since that trial ended, in full accord with the policy of successive Governments.  He chose, most deliberately, not to do so.  He refused to entertain questions on this issue from journalists. He preferred to maintain an indecent ambiguity over his attitude until safely ensconced in the leadership of his party.  Did he fear that if he had any earlier than Friday afternoon last said the words, &ldquo;I condemn the Provisional IRA and all their activities&rdquo;, he might have received less enthusiastic support for his candidature from some of the&mdash;the politest word is greener&mdash;members of his party?  Now that he has the job, does he feel he can safely condemn what he was so careful to avoid condemning for nine long years?  The question mark on this issue which Deputy Haughey has chosen deliberately to allow to linger around him for all those years is one reason&mdash;the highest of all reasons&mdash;for refusing him confidence.  It is one reason why so many of his colleagues do not have confidence in him.</P>
    <P>The second reason is that, arising from this deliberate ambiguity Deputy Haughey, as leader of his party and, perhaps, soon as Taoiseach, is and will be an obstacle to Irish unity to be achieved by agreement.  No one with that background of silence&mdash;to put it no higher&mdash;could, by any stretch of the imagination, offer reassurance to Northern Protestants looking southwards, as many have begun to do in search of a permanent solution in conjunction with the people of this part of Ireland.  As an Irish nationalist who, I believe, with the exception of Deputy Harte, has devoted more time than any other Member of this House to the cause of peace in Ireland and of a new political relationship between North and South I cannot endorse the candidature of a man who seeks to be Taoiseach of this State, but who in that capacity will represent a barrier to unity by agreement.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, while I have already <Col N="1335" /> remarked on Deputy Haughey's political ability and administrative competence he has shown himself, especially and most relevantly in this decade, more concerned with public relations and less with achievement than is acceptable in a Minister.  He has been in the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  He neglected the latter Department almost totally, while in the former he dragged his feet on all awkward issues, from contraceptive regulations to nurses' pay, putting in time until his moment should come to replace the man he had for so long worked to undermine.  In passing, I must repeat what I said on the Bill dealing with contraception which was that this legislation by the very terminology it contains and uses to describe forms of family planning is denominational.  By its introduction Deputy Haughey reinstitutionalised denominationalism in Irish legislation in total disregard of the principles of republicanism, at least as Tone and Davis understood them and in equal disregard of the interests of bringing North and South together which he claims to be committed to.  On the blatant hypocricy of this Bill, taken in conjunction with his protestations of republicanism which suddenly blossomed for the Pádraig Pearse centenary, he deserves to be rejected as Taoiseach of this State, a State whose people aspire to unity by agreement between the people of North and South.</P>
    <P>The fourth and final reason, as far as I am concerned in this debate why Deputy Haughey is to be rejected is his failure to articulate any idealism that might inspire the younger generation and because of his own life style.  This failure to articulate any idealism that might inspire that generation makes him particularly unfitted for the task of leading into the eighties a State half of whose population are under 25 years of age.  It is on those four grounds, amongst others to which I do not propose to refer, that I propose the rejection of Deputy Haughey's nomination as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I have not found that speech easy to make.  It is distasteful to have to argue the merits of an individual rather than a <Col N="1336" /> policy and to reflect so critically on the performance and character of a parliamentary colleague I have known for many years.  I am conscious also of the tension between the duty I owe to the State in speaking frankly on these matters and the duty I owe to Parliament not to overstep the mark by entering into areas inappropriate for debate, or by using harsher language than is minimally called for by the occasion.  I am sure that fault may be found on both grounds with what I have said and I beg the indulgence of the House if I have offended in either respect.  I have had to decide where my duty lay and although I have seen public advice offered as to the desirability or not of making such comments, I have had to decide in the interest of the State as I see it to reject that advice and to take any criticism that may come as a result.  I move, in the name of my party, and on behalf also, I believe, of many who will have to remain silent during this debate, and may not even feel free to vote with their feet according to their inclinations, the rejection of the nomination of Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indictated in a statement made last Friday it will be my party's intention to vigorously oppose the nomination of Deputy Charles J. Haughey for the position of Taoiseach. We do so for purely political reasons. There have been some suggestions that our opposition to the nomination of Deputy Haughey was inspired by personal considerations.  Our opposition is based on an examination of the political record of Deputy Haughey over a considerable number of years.  It is based on three things: his economic and social policy and philosophy and the non-expression of his thinking on the question of peaceful conciliation between the communities in Northern Ireland and the eventual reunification by agreement and by conciliation of the peoples of this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish society today is being widely commented on by many leading personalities representative of a wide spectrum of Irish life.  We have heard comments <Col N="1337" /> on the sad state of our society by leading churchmen of all denominations, leading businessmen, social workers and trade unionists who have abhorred the development of our society into what it is today, a society of materialism, sectional strife, and naked self-interest with a large section of our people living in conditions that can only be described as human misery.  There is, added to that, a total lack of social concern at the top of our political life.  While all the comments have been made regarding the state of our society very few people have tried to analyse when that development really commenced, what was the main impetus in that development and who were the main motivating forces behind that development.  I believe that Deputy Charles J. Haughey played a major part in allowing events to occur which have brought Irish society to the state it is in today.  I further believe that if, as it appears on the cards, Deputy Haughey is elected to the top political post in the country today the trend towards the type of society we have developed into will be very vigorously enforced and accelerated.</P>
    <P>When we cast our minds back to the mid-sixties we recall that there appeared on the Irish scene in the political and the business world a group of young, well educated, very clever, highly articulate young men, who also had one other quality, they were totally ruthless and they had a clear indication of what their personal ambition was.  They also had a clear insight as to how their personal ambition could be fulfilled.  They had another thing in common, a philosophy of life that was dominated by the principle that the end justifies the means. Those people, small in number, set out to acquire great personal wealth, influence and political power.  The pinnacle of the success of their personal ambitions was during the period when Deputy Haughey occupied the position of Minister for Finance in the late sixties.  The philosophy of life which those people hold is also held, I believe, by Deputy Haughey.  He was the political counterpart of the group of ambitious, ruthless <Col N="1338" /> young men of the middle and late sixties and being of the same mould or, as he might prefer it, out of the same stable, he was only too willing to ensure that as far as he could, by virtue of the political office he had, he would facilitate them in every way in the achievement of their ambition, the acquisition of great personal wealth, influence far out of proportion to their numbers, and the sympathetic ear of one of the most politically powerful men in our society at that time.</P>
    <P>Those people, with all those dubious qualifications achieved their ambition. They did not choose to enter into the normal business and commercial life of the country, which under its rules is a capitalistic society by the wishes of the majority of the people, although this party disagree with that system.  They chose to operate in what could only be described as a grey area of Irish business and commercial life, the area of the land speculator, the office builder, the gerry house builder.  They identified those areas as being lucrative which they knew, properly facilitated by the laws of the land, would enable them to reach their stated personal goals.</P>
    <P>They were enabled to reach those goals.  Some curtailment was put on the activities of those gentlemen later but the fruits of their activities, the attainment of their vast personal wealth, influence and power had an end product which is still in Irish society.  Its physical effects can be seen all around us in our capital city and our other cities, particularly in the inner city areas.  The moral effects of those gentlemen and their activities can be seen in the sharp decline in moral standards in Irish society today.  When I speak about moral standards I am not referring to sexual behaviour.  There are other forms of moral standards.  The results can be seen at any political or, unfortunately psychiatric clinic, any day of the week.  The results of the unbridled activities of those gentlemen and their end product have been very considerable human misery for a large number of our people.  They can be counted in broken homes, broken marriages, marriages <Col N="1339" /> that, given the basic human necessity of homes, could have been successful and happy marriages.  They can be seen in the number of young housewives who have had nervous breakdowns or are being treated because they are on the verge of nervous breakdowns.</P>
    <P>A major part of the responsibility for that sad, sick part of our society can be traced back to the appearance on the Irish scene of these same young hot shots of the sixties.  The term &ldquo;mohair suit&rdquo; was not used to describe a mode of dress.  It was a term that described a philosophy of life, a philosophy of life that meant that there should be unbridled opportunity for the economically strong, the clever, the sharp; a philosophy of life that totally exploited the basic needs of the majority of our people.  Apart from the normal intelligence which most of us have, only one thing was needed, that was, a total lack of scruples, a total lack of principle and a total lack of either personal or business integrity.  These gentlemen had all of these things and they were guided, and are still guided, by that same philosophy: that the end justifies the means irrespective of what the consequences are or would be upon their fellow Irishmen and women.  I say with total personal conviction that Deputy Haughey was regarded by them as their political champion and the one whose ear they had to ensure that the way was made quite clear for them to engage in that type of operation.</P>
    <P>Anyone who doubts what I am saying should have been here last Friday around noon and seen the specimens of so-called Irish business and commercial life that, after a number of years, were again emerging from underneath the stones under which they had been hiding.  Some of the people who are here today are here because they anticipated, probably correctly, that after the vote through the lobbies the gravy train that is fuelled by human misery will go into full operation again.  We can anticipate an acceleration in the deterioration in our national society.  We can anticipate further division on sectional grounds, <Col N="1340" /> further human misery, more broken homes, and more and more personal wealth being accumulated by a small group of people, along with influence and political power.  That is one reason why this party opposes the election of Deputy Haughey as political leader of this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey, through a successful PR operation, has managed in financial terms over a difficult two-and-a-half years to portray himself as a man with some social concern.  I think it would be legitimate to examine his record over two-and-a-half years in two major social ministries dealing with the most deprived and underprivileged section of our community.  As far as the Department of Health are concerned, there has been a fade by a skilful PR operation of limited success in that Department.  We have had a great deal of publicity on television and in the press on dental hygiene, although apparently the party are not too concerned with political hygiene.  We have had free toothbrushes for the children, although many of their parents are not in a position to buy toothpaste.  We have had an emphasis on jogging, good health and clean living, from our sex life to our drinking and smoking habits.  All of these things are admirable in themselves. Deputy Haughey enjoys the reputation among the public of being a brilliant administrator, but in the areas that matter, and matter most to the people, his tenure in the Department of Health can only be described as a failure.</P>
    <P>We have seen the sleight-of-hand attempted on the Family Planning Bill.  He saw that a confrontation with the medical profession would be politically damaging to him at a time when, above all else, that could not possibly happen. Instead of confronting the doctors to ensure that there was adequate health care for the majority of our people, he choose to buy them off with public funds&mdash;not because he did not realise that, if we are to have an adequate health service for the majority of our people, a confrontation with the medical profession was <Col N="1341" /> necessary but because he realised that a confrontation with that profession would be prolonged, would be bitter and would damage what was uppermost in Deputy Haughey's mind: to get to the position in which he now finds himself in this House today.</P>
    <P>One can admire Deputy Haughey's political skill, his tenacity and the determination over a long period of time with which he pursued his ambition. However, at the end of it all I was left with a rather sick feeling in the pit of my stomach as to the way that personal ambition was pursued.  Ambition is not wrong.  Ambition is necessary and desirable in political leadership. However, the question must be asked: is it not at least equally important what is motivating that ambition and, above all, how the attainment of that ambition is pursued?  I have already answered that question, as far as Deputy Haughey is concerned&mdash;the end justified the means.</P>
    <P>As regards the other major social Department over which Deputy Haughey presided for two-and-a-half years&mdash;the Department of Social Welfare&mdash;there was not even the fade of the PRO operation to try to cover up the dismal failure of Deputy Haughey in that Department.  I have some knowledge of that Department, from the last administration.  In that Department, there were a number of issues needing to be tackled, lying on Deputy Haughey's desk, of which I shall mention just a few. There was the pay-related pensions scheme, which was at a very advanced stage when the last administration left office; it has not been heard of since. There was a Consolidation Bill which had won the approval of all sides of the House as being a necessary and very desirable advancement in the area of social welfare.  These issues were not tackled, not because they were difficult but because the Minister responsible for the administration of the Department of Social Welfare was otherwise occupied. His mind was on other things; he had not time to give his undoubted administrative and political skills to the administration <Col N="1342" /> of a Department which catered for the most deprived section of our community.  His lack of understanding of the position of recipients of social welfare and of the major problem of poverty in our society is perhaps best illustrated by his attitude&mdash;on taking up office and persisted in over the last two-and-a-half years&mdash;towards the National Committee to Combat Poverty.  He has obstructed the work of that committee in every way possible, short of taking any action that would have political repercussions against himself.  That, also, would run contrary to his persistant aim of maintaining his personal ambition to be where he is today&mdash;leader of Fianna Fáil and yet to be voted Taoiseach in this House.</P>
    <P>One could continue at considerable length on this subject, but it is not necessary.  The point has been well made.  However, there is one issue, on which I would briefly comment&mdash;the question of Northern Ireland and Deputy Haughey's thoughts, attitudes and proposed actions regarding that problem.  Before this vote is taken the people of this House and of this country are entitled to know, in clear, unambiguous terms, precisely what Deputy Haughey's attitude is, in relation to that disastrous situation within our national community and within our country.</P>
    <P>Over the last nine years Deputy Haughey has acquired for himself a reputation on Northern Ireland of being a hardliner.  Some would go so far as to say he was hawk.  How was this reputation achieved?  It certainly has not been achieved by any public statement issued by the Deputy, who has kept his head well down on the question of Northern Ireland.  This reputation has been acquired by a series of nods, winks, clever silences at the right time, absences from venues where he should have been and allowing his name to be closely associated with other members of his party, and not of his party, regarding views on Northern Ireland.  Deputy Haughey has managed very cleverly, through the media, to portray this image of the great republican on Northern <Col N="1343" /> Ireland, by speeches made by Deputy Síle de Valera, and by occasional utterances of Deputy Bill Loughnane.</P>

For a man who aspires to be Taoiseach, for a man who held a senior Cabinet position and, particularly, for a man who stands before this House today to be elected Taoiseach of this country, is it legitimate to ask if his views coincide with those which Deputy Blaney publicly stated four weeks ago?

Is the incoming Taoiseach's policy the same as expressed on his behalf by Deputy Neil Blaney, that this money should flow again to the front organisations for the Provisional IRA?  Surely they are legitimate questions that should be answered by Deputy Haughey before the vote on his succession to the highest political position in this land.</P>

      <P>Do not be too encouraged, boys, you will be hearing from me again, often.  The people about whom I spoke, the speculators, the dealers in land, the peddlars of human misery, who I believe form Deputy Haughey's main political constituency, will take great heart from his apparent election as Taoiseach in this House today.  As far as this party are concerned, we also have reason to take great heart from it because it is now in clear terms, unobscured by the personal qualities of Deputy Jack Lynch, what that party really stand for and what is their real political constituency, what price ordinary people in this country have to pay for the pandering and the catering to that <Col N="1345" /> small, vicious group of men of no conscience. We take heart from it because we believe, and believe sincerely, that the vast majority of the Irish people, particularly the young, will oppose the decline of Irish society in that direction, that they will recognise the socialist policies of this party as their rallying point and as the most effective way in which to give voice to that opposition.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Haughey is today elected Taoiseach by the votes of the Fianna Fáil Party I can only say this to him: in my opinion he is undoubtedly entitled to the same degree of support and loyalty which he gave to his predecessor, Deputy Jack Lynch.</P>
      <P>I have one final thing to say to many people on those benches.  Leaders of political parties are elected in committees. They are elected by members of that political party.

      <P>This is not the right place, if ever there is a right place, to make a comment on the press in general.  But one of the Dublin newspapers this morning wrote an editorial in which the Opposition in this House were counselled to treat this morning's motion with reserve, to play it down, to keep it cool.  The reason we were to do that was essentially that the neighbours were looking at us, because the foreign press, particularly the British press&mdash;which never loses an opportunity to blacken us&mdash;would be paying careful attention to what was going on here and because the rest of the world would be doing the same.  The editorial concluded with the words:</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the duty which lies on an Opposition here is to speak its mind, although I believe there is not a single man or woman on the Opposition benches who has any personal pleasure in making a personal attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> But I think that the impression that this is somehow an occasion like any other occasion when power shifts is a totally wrong one.  I can scarcely believe that it is an opinion genuinely held by the person who wrote that editorial, or by his colleagues who have not conveyed the degree of consternation which last Friday's event has produced.</P>
    <P>This, Sir, is a unique occasion.  There have been six Taoiseachs in this country. One or two of them were people who were intensely contentious in their own right.  Awful hatreds built up around them.  As Deputy FitzGerald said, families were divided on account of their beliefs and their actions.  They were all political animals, all six of them.  What looks like being our seventh Taoiseach is also a political animal, but he is a creature of a different species.  Every Member of this House, whichever side he is on, knows that that is so.  He knows that any attempt to play down the significance of what is going through today is something not worthy of a free people, or of their organs of opinion.</P>
    <P>The reason I regard the Fianna Fáil Party's new leader as unfit for the office to which he pretends, and indeed unfit for any office on the Government front bench, has very little to do with the events of 1969 and 1970.  Probably I am in a minority on my own side in saying this, but let me say it just the same.  1969 was a year very different from 1979.  In August of that year the Catholics in Belfast seemed to be in genuine danger of being massacred.  The IRA had not yet appeared, and were not to appear for well over a year thereafter.  It is not venial in anybody to put a gun into the hands of somebody whom he cannot control, and it is less venial than in anybody else's case if that act is associated with a Government.  While it is inexcusable, at the same time some degree of understanding might be found for it.  I do not condone it, but I recognise that if my party had been in Government in 1969 we would have been subjected to exactly the same pressures as the Fianna Fáil Government and their Members of 1969.  I recognise that, but I hope that <Col N="1348" /> we would have not yielded to them. Remembering the very strong feelings in my party at the time when the Northern police were shooting people and when the IRA had not yet reappeared, I cannot be absolutely certain that we might not have become entangled, although I believe that it is unlikely.  That is why I do not specially hold against this candidate anything that happened in those years.</P>
    <P>What I have against this candidate is more impalpable, less easy to put into words.  I have against him the degree of ambition which he so shamelessly displays. In fact, the degree of shamelessness with which his ambition is pursued says something about his temperament which ought to make the rest of us take fright.  We are all ambitious&mdash;none of us would be here if we were not.  Every member of the smallest or most obscure council or board of town commissioners has a grain of ambition of the same kind.  But it has run to seed in this candidate; it has run wild, and the reaction which it causes in me is one of fear.</P>
    <P>This ambition is pursued by methods which are perhaps not unique to Deputy Haughey but which I find repellent&mdash;remorseless self-publicity, which arranges that even events or speeches which do not in any way concern him are accompanied by his photograph, the employment of press agents, and the employment and the retaining of people whose only purpose is to build him up.  They are employed to build up what?  Not a philosophy, or, if so, I have never heard of it; not a policy, because we do not know what that is either; but an image.  Did Deputy de Valera, the founder of his party, ever worry about his image?  Did he know the word or use it?  What would he have felt about his successor but three, whose election is due to his image?  What would Deputy Seán Lemass have said or thought about it?  Did he ever worry about his image, or did he retain men who went round sowing stories, photographs and slanted lines to the press in order to put himself in a position where he could do&mdash;what?  We do not <Col N="1349" /> know.  We have the awful sight around this House of the flattering of his junior colleagues, the back-slapping, the arm around the shoulder and presumably the sedulous propagation of their constituency interests.  Every Coalition Minister when in office had to deal with his colleagues.  Some of them dealt with them in such a way that they were thought generous, and some of them caused only grumbles among their colleagues.  But I have never, in my party nor in the Labour Party, seen this awful currying of favour, the kind of thing which a schoolboy would recognise as contemptible but which somehow is supposed to be acceptable among grown men and women.</P>
    <P>In that nature, so carefully covered by a veneer of polish, there is something else; and it can be seen when the veneer scratches, when occasionally the facade slips.  When it slips something very ugly comes to view.  Small things in their way can tell one more about somebody or a situation than larger things.  I remember the sight of Deputy Haughey's face when from this bench he called the then Deputy Cooney a fascist.  That is his belief.  Although I mentioned that several times in the House in Deputy Haughey's hearing, I never heard a withdrawal or an apology from him.  Evidently that is his belief, or what he wishes people to think is his belief.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey chose the day after the defeat of his party the day after his leader's disappointment&mdash;in which in the present conjuncture I take no special pleasure, as it is a matter of unimaginable triviality compared to what we are now facing&mdash;to issue a script in which he described, among other things, the Irish Parliamentary Party as having &ldquo;degraded parliamentary life so that nobody of sensitivity or idealism could have anything to do with it&rdquo;.  We are not going to rake up the Irish Parliamentary Party.  Some of them left their bones in France in the mistaken idea that they were fighting for small countries; and others worked their hearts out and died poor; and I do not recall that any of them found time, on the side, to become <Col N="1350" /> millionaires during the course of their public lives.</P>
    <P>These are small things.  Anybody can be betrayed into saying more than he means, into an ugly expression or into an insult which he might immediately regret.  But everybody in the House has seen that side of the Deputy who is now being proposed to us.</P>
    <P>I find that side repellant.  Just like the leader of my party, I have never experienced insult or injury, apart from the ordinary give and take of the House, from this Deputy.  But I could not let this matter go, any more than anyone on this side, without expressing a conviction that he is absolutely unfit, to the inner core of his being, to hold the office to which he aspires and for which he has, with an inhuman relentlessness, worked for the last 20 years.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cluskey said, he has allowed, by a system not so much of saying things, but of nods and winks and silent absences, an aura to grow up around him which gives light-witted people, soft-witted people who never heard a shot fired in anger and would be scared if they did, the notion that he is a republican.</P>
    <P>There was a time when every Member of the House could have called himself a republican without worrying about the consequences.  That phrase has been appropriated and misappropriated.  But the one person who, above all, should have protested about that is a person who aspires to national leadership.  Was there ever a word of protest along those lines? Did we ever hear reservations from this Deputy about the sick philosophy which has overtaken a section of this people?  It was allowed to be supposed that Deputy Haughey had strong feelings about the North.  What were they?  After the shock of 7 May 1970, when Deputy Lynch had to request his resignation when Deputy Haughey then disobeyed the Constitution by refusing to give his resignation and when the former leader of his party, President de Valera, had to invoke a never before invoked section of the Constitution and fire him, the sensation <Col N="1351" /> among most people was surprise&mdash;not about Deputy Blaney, because he had been making hawk-like noises at the previous year's Ard Fheis and before that, but at Deputy Haughey, whose associations were as Deputy Cluskey described them.  No one thought that Deputy Haughey had the least interest in the North.  Suddenly a grandmother was dug up from County Derry and that was supposed to be a sufficient reason for his interest in the North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to say anything hurtful or anything else about anybody except the person who is under discussion, but reasons were sought to explain this sudden passion for the North.  They were not to be found certainly in his public record.  During the sixties Deputy Haughey was promoted by the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass.  Deputy Lemass presided over this country from 1959 until he retired in 1966; and it is fair to say that in that entire period one would have difficulty in filling ten columns of the Dáil Reports with anything about the North, good or bad, except pig smuggling or egg smuggling.  There was not the least bit of interest taken in the North by Deputy Lemass, at least on that level.  There was no speechifying, no interest in the Catholic minority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Lemass did&mdash;and he did two very important and constructive things, and I would like to know to what extent they represent anything Deputy Haughey would agree with&mdash;was that he travelled without any protocol or precedent to Belfast, and by that act recognised something which had never <Col N="1352" /> been formally recognised here before, and met the then Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who was the only man who might have had a chance to stop the disasters and horrors we have seen since; and he set up an all-party committee on the Constitution, which he joined in 1966 after he retired.</P>
    <P>That committee recommended the deletion from the Constitution of Article 3 and its replacement by a more pacific formula.  That committee contained, apart from Deputy Lemass, several members of this Government&mdash;I will not go into individual names.  I want to know whether Deputy Lemass's contributions to Irish reconciliation represent the sort of republicanism the present candidate supports, which I and every man on this side of the House would respect, or whether it is something else which cannot be given a name.  If we are to judge by anything public in the record of the candidate being here proposed, it is a nameless miasma, not a philosophy, not anything honest people can work for and believe in.</P>
    <P>What has happened here has another dimension.  It &ldquo;has been known&rdquo;, in the way these things get known, &ldquo;for a long time&rdquo;,&mdash;in the journalists' phrase&mdash;that Deputy Haughey profoundly disagreed with the programme of the Government on which they were elected.  If so, why did he not take the course Deputy Paddy Smith took when he disagreed with the Government with whom he worked? Deputy Smith's disagreement was about something far less radical than a manifesto.  He left Deputy Lemass's Government because he thought they were being too soft on the unions.  Let him be right or wrong about that, that is water under the bridge.  If there was this profound disagreement, why did it not surface earlier in the shape of a resignation? Why did this Deputy not behave as a man would and say &ldquo;I regard this as wrong from start to finish.  I am not going to go through the charade of accepting and holding office in a Government elected and holding office under this programme&rdquo;?  Even that amount of principle was not to be found in him. Now that things have changed we can <Col N="1353" /> widespread acceptance of the many expect to find the manifesto torn up.  It will not be of any relevance any longer. The people who believed in it, and I know there are people who believed in it and perhaps still believe in it, will be automatically discredited and put out of countenance merely because it was &ldquo;known&rdquo; Deputy Haughey profoundly disagreed with something but never carried his disagreement to the point that a man of character would bring it to.</P>
    <P>There is a certain disenchantment in the Government party&mdash;I suppose there would be in any party who ran into difficulties, even difficulties for which they might be entirely to blame&mdash;and a sensation of looking round for something new, to get something else started.  I think I detect from the far side, among those who support this candidate today, a sensation such as might have been felt in Italy in 1921 or in Germany in 1932: &ldquo;we want someone who will make the trains run on time.&rdquo;  I have no doubt they have got such a man.  I give him the same credit Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Cluskey did in that regard.  I believe he has a capacity along those lines; but what worries me is the price that will be paid for it on other fronts.</P>
    <P>Before I finish I would like to say something about that price in terms of the situation of the colleagues who will have to exercise their vote here today.  It is easily said and they may not worry too much what I say either way, but I genuinely feel for some of them in their situation.  I do not want to say anything hurtful because I can imagine the reasons of solidarity and long-ingrained habit and the anxiety not to destroy the moral community of which they are members, which will lead them to do something for which they are sick at heart.  I understand that and I do not want to belittle them in any way for making the choice they feel forced to make.  I do not know exactly to whom I am speaking but I know they are there.</P>
    <P>I want to ask them this: is this the party they worked for?  Is this the party to which they have given the best years of their lives, because none of them is <Col N="1354" /> young any longer?  Is this the party for which they trudged around on wet evenings, stood at cold chapel gates, collected money for, bore all kinds of drudgery and insults and disruption of their private lives?  Is this the result of what they worked for?  Perhaps it is too much to ask these Deputies to change their minds on account of words spoken here today but I want them to ask themselves those questions.  I would also like them to ask themselves if this is not a juncture at which we might put an end to the civil war.</P>

      <P>There is a strain in the Irish temperament, and I suppose in the genetic mix of the Irish people, which guarantees there will always be a proportion who are irreconcilable and unwilling to abide by the rules.  In a sense I suppose there will never be an end to some kind of civil dissension here.  There will always be a turbulent and impossible section of the people.  I do not flatter myself that we will ever seriously and finally do what John Costello once thought we could do&mdash;take the gun out of Irish politics for good.</P>
      <P>I wanted to say to Deputies who are distressed at what is happening here today that on this side of the House&mdash;in saying this I do not compromise one iota of the principle which we have tried to stand for&mdash;there is a feeling among us of a kind I never saw in my party before, a feeling of compassion and an anxiety to see if something good can come out of this, an anxiety which stretches out hands to pass over things and to say sorry for the things we regret.</P>

If there are enough of these people here, and if there is the will, I would like to ask them to re-establish in this House and in this country unity of purpose which the civil war shattered, but which corresponds to a whole range of sensation and beliefs which is alive in the heart of everyone on this side of the House, and I believe is equally alive in the hearts of many on the other side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That nomination was made, apparently.  I have no personal animosity whatever towards Deputy Haughey.  I have served in this House with him for the past ten years.  I have never had the slightest acrimony with him.  We have served on joint committees <Col N="1357" /> and I was chairman of one of those committees at which Deputy Haughey made fine contributions.  It is not an issue whether or not he was a good Minister for Agriculture or had a row with the farmers in the sixties.  It is not really an issue whether or not he was an effective Minister for Finance in the sixties or whether he has been a mediocre or otherwise or successful Minister for Health and Social Welfare. The fundamental issue is one of trust, basic political trust in the capacity of a man, a Taoiseach designate, a Deputy, which must be reposed in him by all of us in the country and not just Fianna Fáil.  It is the trust which must be reposed in any individual to discharge the onerous functions of Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>I wish to say to Deputy Haughey as one who was in this House during the arms trial crisis in 1970 and who contributed in that debate, as one who was appointed by the late President to the Council of State, as a member of Dublin County Council and as Chief Whip of this party, that I cannot in conscience endorse the candidature of Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach designate.  I wish we would not have this debate.  According to <i>The Irish Times</i> we should not be having it at all.  The situation is quite simple.  We have observed the situation over ten years, right from the bringing of Deputy Haughey before the courts.  The statement made by the outgoing Taoiseach was that he did not have political trust in Deputy Haughey. He used the word &ldquo;trust&rdquo; which is a sacred political criterion of assessment of a person's capacity to lead.  Without trust in somebody there is nothing.  It does not matter whether one is a millionaire or a brilliant politician, if one cannot trust somebody everything is irrelevant in the context of political activity and contributions whether on Northern Ireland, economic and social development or Green or White Papers. They are irrelevant.  They are only paper. It is human character and capacity that is the issue at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On December 8 in <i>The Irish Times</i><Col N="1358" /> Seán Cronin reporting from Washington said:</P>
    <P>Charles Haughey called Neil Blaney yesterday to tell him the news. Mr. Blaney was very elated, he was up early in the offices of the Irish National Caucus behind Capitol Hill, waiting for word from Dublin.</P>
    <P>Admittedly the <i>Irish Independent</i> said that Deputy Blaney called Deputy Haughey at lunch time.  We are not quite sure which.  We do know that down that corridor, in the medical room of this House, there was a long involved discussion between Deputies Haughey and Blaney and it was not about what was running in the 2.30 at the Curragh.  One knows what is going on.  One does not have to be an absolute fool.  &ldquo;Heads will roll&rdquo;, said Deputy Eileen Lemass in the <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
    <P>At least four and possibly five or six holders of big Cabinet posts are going to be axed altogether from ministerial life, according to Mrs. Eileen Lemass, sister-in-law of the Taoiseach-elect, writes Jim Farrelly.</P>
    <P>Is this Ireland's entry into the eighties of collective Cabinet responsibility?  I do not know.</P>
    <P>I said my contribution would be brief because I would be ill if I had to endure this for much longer.  There was a classic remark of Deputy Noel Davern that the 13-year war is over.  On Saturday, 8 December he added that he was delighted.  It was the end of a 13-year war and it had to come to an end some time.  That brings me to my endorsement of what the Leader of my party and Deputy FitzGerald said in relation to An Taoiseach.  I want to be associated with those remarks and I do not accept&mdash;I say this with profound regret&mdash;that An Taoiseach's going was of his own making. The white smoke was sent up while he was in America and the petitions were circulated as we well know.  The lines were drawn and unfortunately the Taoiseach received some bad advice from some campaign managers who thought they had 50 votes in the bag. Even the most casual observer in the <Col N="1359" /> House, including myself, was able to say at any one time that Deputy Haughey had about 46-48.  We did not have to put any money on it.  The knives were out and the opportunity was there.  Unfortunately some Ministers twisted in their beds one night and decided they would vote otherwise than they should have in the context of supporting their Taoiseach.  It is a sad scenario and a regrettable situation.  The country will have to live with it for the next two years or less.  It will not be a pleasant time. Deputy Haughey is, by repute, a vindictive man.  I do not relish what I am saying here because frankly I would be afraid of what might be kept in store whether at constituency level or any other level.  I would not like to be a member of the Garda Síochána or of the Special Branch&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would not, because it has been said by the said Minister on other occasions that he would deal with those men when he had the opportunity of so doing.  I would not like to be in the security forces of the State.  Therefore, I make the point that it all boils down to us giving an endorsement of trust to Deputy Haughey.  I am not saying this just as Opposition Whip because my father was a founder member of that party.  My father resigned in 1939&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I deeply regret that I should have to make a contribution of this nature in that tone and with that content.  I regret it as an Irishman.  I am aware that the world press will look on us in this situation but I am not prepared to stand by and have the position that, without comment, the security apparatus of the State would be put exclusively into the hands of a former Minister whose trust and capacity in that regard was called so much into question and which apparently in the past eight or nine years has remained utterly in question right through that period.  It will go down in history that Deputy Jack Lynch moderated the extreme republicanism and outbreaks of nationalistic rhetoric within his party and introduced an element of calm assessment of a situation in Northern Ireland.  If he passionately believes in anything I think it was that he tried to take the gun out of that situation. It was very evident that it was the most important contribution that the outgoing Taoiseach made in his administration all through the seventies.  It was a personal passion and belief that was easy to detect in this House.  I admired him for it and every Member admired the efforts of Deputy Lynch to contain his party, prevent them from going off the rails and indulging in mad escapades of one kind or another in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was vilified for it in his party.  I even heard Deputies on his own side saying: <Col N="1361" />&ldquo;That is what he got for going to the Mountbatten funeral; we got him,&rdquo; for going to Westminster with his wife and paying elementary tribute following a murder in this country.</P>
    <P>I feel so strongly about the situation that I believe there is an obligation on us here to place clearly before the Irish people our repugnance of what we face, or fear of what we face.  Perhaps there will be an opportunity for Deputy Haughey to clarify what precisely he means in regard to his policy on Northern Ireland. The Taoiseach will have that opportunity. If he mends his ways, if he clarifies that situation, I would be quite prepared to eat my words in this House and would willingly do it with no sense of shame because I think he owes it to us to give this clarification.</P>
    <P>But I am fearful of the consequences when I read the kind of nonsense in the <i>The Irish Press</i> editorial on 10 December when the statement was made that &ldquo;A new Ireland has dawned, in which a new Taoiseach has many problems to solve&rdquo;. The same editorial writer goes on to say that Rev.  Ian Paisley knows very well, despite his trumpetings, that he himself can do no fighting in the last analysis if the British go, without the support of the UDA and the UVF and that support is far from certain.  He then goes on with ráiméis about &ldquo;A post-British-withdrawal Ireland is a sane respectable vision ...&rdquo;  That is the vision of 2,000 dead over the past nine years and 20,000 injured in a period when apparently, Deputy Haughey was able to remain silent on that political situation.  In the privacy of the Taoiseach's room when he got back on to the Front Bench he gave the Taoiseach a private assurance that he would endorse the Taoiseach's policy and from then on he remained silent.  The days of silence in relation to Northern Ireland for Deputy Haughey are over. He will now have to state his position clearly and unequivocally, not with vague references to British withdrawal and 1975 policy.  These are irrelevant in the nitty-gritty of what the situation demands in real leadership.  If Deputy <Col N="1362" /> Haughey wants to go on mouthing that we must have British withdrawal and that there must be interim solutions between the British withdrawal and the final withdrawal, he will be laughed out of the country in the next general election.</P>
    <P>The situation is more complex, more difficult and more demanding of rational solutions.  That would not be a solution because Deputy Haughey is an intelligent man and an acute person, highly competent and for him to advance that kind of retrospective, republican rhetoric which has no meaning in the context of the alleged 1975 policy of his party is no answer.  He should credit us with something more in our capacity to assess such a situation.  Therefore, my party will vote against Deputy Haughey's nomination.</P>
    <P>I did not wish to have to make this contribution but I make it because I find his nomination repugnant, dangerous and undesirable.  Personally, I would have preferred Deputy Colley if I were a member of Fianna Fáil.  He was defeated by Deputy Haughey.  But perhaps from an Opposition point of view Deputy Colley would be far easier to beat in a general election&mdash;I do not have the slightest doubt of that.  But that was not the issue: the issue is: which man has greater personal integrity as an individual? That is the real issue.  Who could you really trust when the chips are down and a national security situation is ready to boil over?  As far as I am concerned no matter how insensitive the man may be, no matter how much he may be lacking in charisma I would put my money on Deputy Colley.  It was because he was not prepared to go wheeler-dealing through the country in the past few years presenting toothbrushes and taking the British-made mark off them before presenting them that Deputy Colley, in the last analysis, did not succeed.  I respect Deputy O'Malley for standing up and quoting Deputy Colley because Deputy O'Malley is a straight person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude by saying that in 1977 the people did not vote for Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach; they voted for the return of Deputy Jack Lynch as Taoiseach.  They knew that in due course there would be a contest but, in 1977, the overwhelming majority of the people never thought that they would finish up in the situation where Deputy Haughey would be Taoiseach.  I would hazard a guess that if that prospect had been before him in 1977, notwithstanding the many mistakes made by us in Coalition, we would probably have got the endorsement of the people instead of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that in the next general election the country will not respond to the past.  There is an obligation on us in Dáil Éireann to spell out the past and the consequences no matter how many wounds are opened here because we have a young generation of voters who are 25 years of age and who were 15 years of age at the time when a man's real character and trust were put in the dock and, as far as I am concerned, were found wanting in the context of a Cabinet involvement at that time.  It was not just Deputy Haughey who was found wanting because the master mind, Deputy Blaney, was found more wanting than he and he used Deputy Haughey; Deputy Haughey fell for it and wanted to do a favour but the favour became unstuck and Deputy Gibbons got involved and the two of them finished up, in the classic, celebrated statement of an assessment of a judge of the courts, describing their capacity of trust, one for the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the youth of Ireland were only 15 or 16 years of age at that time and they have never until now had to face the reality that this man is going to lead them, there is an obligation on us in this debate.  I hope that when we finish tonight it will be the end, in many respects, of that debate but today we <Col N="1364" /> have a fundamental democratic responsibility to put all this on the record.  After today I will never again, either in public speeches or in Dáil contributions, come back on that event.  I thought it would have been over; I hoped it was gone and I would have hoped to give more respect for the political institutions of the State to my children.  I am profoundly ashamed that, in the presence of Deputy Haughey's family, friends and comrades, I should have to say these things.  It is no joy to me or the people but it has to be said and it must be put on the record because we would be utterly failing in our responsibility as Dáil Deputies if we did not do so.  Therefore I am ashamed of the disastrous example we are going to give the youth of Ireland today and of the disastrous example which Fianna Fáil gave when they, in the words printed in <i>The Irish Press,</i> voted to save their seats.  It is about time Fianna Fáil voted to save the country because the country is more important than any one of our seats.  My mother used to say to me &ldquo;show me your company and I will tell you what you are&rdquo;.  That has been enough for me in the past ten years.</P>

      <P>As has been said, this is no ordinary debate.  It ought not to be about party politics.  It ought to be taken out of that realm altogether because the decision taken by this House here today will affect every man, woman and child in this country.  I would like to be able to say of the immediate future that today's decision will be crowned with success but I am afraid that, for many reasons I look forward to the future more in hope than in confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duty which we are performing in this House today is a duty we owe to the people, that is, scrutinising the suitability of the man now proposed to hold the office of Taoiseach.  We have a responsibility and a duty to go into detail on what we think are the qualities and the characteristics of a person who would make a success of that office.  We have a duty to the electorate who have been denied the opportunity to speak for themselves because, as has been said <Col N="1365" /> here on more than one occasion, the fact is now that one-third of this House is backing the leader of the country.  That is one of the inadequacies of our democratic system but it is a reality and it ought to be spelled out because, in the short-term, depending on what happens and on the reaction of the people, they may demand that they be given an opportunity to voice their opinion.  That opportunity should not be denied them.  We will, later on today in this House, go through the formal procedure demanded by tradition and by the constitution and, indeed, by the democratic system, of voting for our next Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>In going through that procedure we will, no doubt, witness a facade of unity, a facade of stability.  But we all know, and many thousands of people outside the House know, that it is only a facade because of what has gone on in the precincts of this House in the last couple of months.  As a result of the goings and the comings in that period, dozens of Deputies opposite who have sat there this morning will find it very difficult to walk into the lobby to vote for the man now nominated to become Taoiseach. Indeed one cannot but admire the degree of commitment which brings about the kind of situation when a Deputy can ignore the promptings of conscience, throw discretion to the winds and walk in behind somebody in whom he has no confidence or trust and, for reasons best known to himself, for whom he has not voted.</P>
    <P>However, if one looks at the motivation that brings about that kind of commitment one cannot look with the same kind of admiration on the person endowed with it.  That motivation is based on possibly many traits in our human make-up, traits which many of us call on in times of major emotional upheaval but which people of integrity do not call on in times of political expediency.  What has been said and quoted in the House today that the man proposed, Deputy Haughey, would be the best suited to ensure the winning of marginal seats, is the kind of motivation which I said is not to be admired.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. O'Kennedy, a man for whom I have great admiration in his offices as Minister and of the Presidency of the European Council, disappointed me greatly when, asked last Sunday why at the last minute he had made public his decision to vote for Mr. Haughey, on at least three occasions he said he had felt that Mr. Haughey was the best man for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>He should be referred to as Deputy Haughey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not say one iota about the fact that Deputy Haughey would not be Taoiseach of Fianna Fáil but Taoiseach of the country, representing all of this country.  That is the kind of motivation which in other circumstances might be admirable but not in this one.  As I have said, we in the House who have been close to these things in the past few months have witnessed what has been going on in the corridors of this House.  Because of the time and effort spent by senior members of the Government in the very legitimate political pursuit of canvassing, we have had a virtual political vacuum in the country.  As a result, we had a certain degree of uncertainty.  One would have thought that that uncertainty, which reached national proportions, would have been eliminated by last Friday.  Instead, that uncertainty has been replaced by some form of fear, an intangible one, a fear of the unknown brought about by long years of silence by the man who ought to have spoken to clear the decks and tell the people where he stood on issues of national and indeed international importance.  That man has not spoken and hence we have had a deepening of the uncertainty which has pervaded the country in the past number of months.  Hence we have had a deepening of the sense of fear about the future instead of a diminution of that sense of uncertainty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ability of Deputy Haughey is not in question.  On many fronts Deputy Haughey has shown himself to be a man <Col N="1367" /> of capacity for hard work.  He has been well known for his ability to initiate certain things.  He has been responsible for innovative ideas.  But his greatest ability seems to lie in the fact that he can see a political opportunity and grasp it.  That would be all right in the best political sense, but the degree of motivation with which he tackled the long road back to where he finds himself today is something which to the average person is frightening.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kelly said, all of us here have certain ambitions, and indeed anybody worth his salt must carry within him ambitions to reach certain goals and objectives.  But the opportunist trait, if overplayed, in trying to reach that goal negatives that good characteristic which is ambition.  To my mind, Deputy Haughey has done just that.  In the last few years he has carefully built up a public image in a very professional way.  He has done so very deliberately with, no doubt, a very definite goal in mind.  He has surrounded himself with a veneer of many characteristics but I do not think any human being in the country has the characteristics with which Deputy Haughey has surrounded himself in a slick public relations exercise. When one peels or chips off that veneer then are laid bare qualities which include all-pervading ambition to reach where he is today.  There is nothing wrong with ambition.  We all know that moderate ambition is a fine thing.  I regard Deputy Haughey's approach to this as excessive ambition and anything in excess is in itself not a good thing.  Excesses lead to abuse and at this level of politics the charge of the taint of abuse should not be levelled at anybody, or if it is that person should be declared unfit to hold the office Deputy Haughey now proposes to hold.  If we chip further under that veneer a philosophy comes forward which again is based on ambition, that is, a capacity to accumulate wealth, a trait which is a very fine thing in many ways and which is looked up to by many people in this country.  I have nothing against anybody who succeeds in doing that.  Down the years, Deputy Haughey's predecessors <Col N="1368" /> were men who have been looked up to for different reasons by different people. Young people in particular have in the past looked at political leaders in this country as people whom they could regard as an example.  The problem that I see with Deputy Haughey is that there is a danger that they might look at Deputy Haughey in the same way and try to model themselves on him.  For example, in the accumulation of wealth many of them will fail and in their failure they will become frustrated and doubts will enter into their minds.  The end result of that is that the political consequences of such frustration may be very damaging to this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey has through his silent years surrounded himself with an aura of mystery.  An amazing fact&mdash;this must be unique in the election of a Taoiseach&mdash;is that many thousands of people in this country just do not know where Deputy Haughey stands on many issues.  All they know about him is what he has himself published carefully through a very deliberate public relations exercise over the past couple of years in his build-up to this day.  His utterance after his election last Friday on the peaceful unity of this country was something which I welcomed but over which must be a large question mark. Until Deputy Haughey, as leader, proves that he means what he says, that doubt will remain in my mind and in the minds of many other people.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh ceist ar an Teachta Haughey an Aoine seo caite maidir le toghcháin Udarás na Gaeltachta.  On méid a dúirt sé agus ó bheith ag breathnú air, ceapaim nach raibh fhios aige go raibh a leithéid ar siúl, agus tá sé ar siúl amárach, dar ndóigh.  Cuireann sé sin ceist eile im'aigne.  Cá seasann an tUasal Ó hEochaidh maidir le teanga na Gaeilge?  Ba é sin ceann de na bunchlocha ar a raibh páirtí Fhianna Fáil bunaithe ó thús: aontacht na tíre agus dul chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Sin ceist maidir leis an nGaeilge go mba mhaith le muintir na Gaeltachta freagra a fháil air, agus sar i bhfad.</P>
    <P>Finally, in this country there is a <Col N="1369" /> problems that face us and people in many ways are generous and understand the problems of politicians.  In normal circumstances that generosity would be forthcoming to any new Taoiseach or to any new Government.  However, because of the ambiguity which people see in the man now proposed, because of the uncertainty due to his long period of silence, that degree of generosity from the public at large might not be forthcoming as readily in this case.  Were it there I do not think that I would be here now asking that the nomination of Deputy Haughey be rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to oppose the nomination of Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach and I will give a few reasons for doing so.  Naturally, I regret having to do this because it is a great honour to be elected.  One would like to think that the next step logically for him would be to be appointed Taoiseach but for reasons which I shall try to explain that is not my wish.</P>
      <P>First, I join with Deputy Kelly in repudiating the suggestion in one newspaper this morning that we should not discuss freely and frankly the question of this nomination.  The suggestion that we as Deputies do not have a sense of responsibility equal to that of whoever penned that editorial is, to put it at its mildest, presumptuous and, in some ways, particularly insolent.  I agree with Deputy Kelly when he points out that we have not yet reached the point of being members of a conformist Reichstag which must do what it is told by anybody.  We are responsible only to our constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the uniqueness of this strange event the idea that we should not discuss freely this historic happening and discuss it within our own knowledge in an effort to put it into perspective is particularly absurd.  The man who has been proposed by Deputy Lynch for this office has been voted into power within his own party but with one or two exceptions, without the support of any of his colleagues.  The majority of these men <Col N="1370" /> who have known Deputy Haughey during all of his political life have taken the extraordinary decision not to support the majority of backbenchers who voted for him.  Anybody who overlooks this reality without dwelling on its implications for all of us and for the country is either totally ignorant of the dynamics of power in politics, in the working of parliamentary democracy, or else has some ulterior motive in furthering the career of the individual concerned.  The fact is that all of these people who might collectively be regarded as the flower of Fianna Fáil, intellectually and politically, those people who down through the years, rightly or wrongly, have reached the top in that party, who have held power time and again and who, above everything else, have held the highest offices within the State, have decided that they cannot trust Deputy Haughey with the office for which he has been nominated.  This situation is of such extraordinary significance as to deserve the most thorough examination.</P>
    <P>It is not as if in the Cabinet there were two outstanding Ministers whose records of achievement were such as to render it very difficult to choose between them.  The alternative to whom the members of the Cabinet gave their support&mdash;the Minister for Finance&mdash;is a person for whom all of us have a personal regard but for whom obviously we could have very little political respect in regard to his achievements.  Undoubtedly, his financial policies are in tatters, The state of the nation gives eloquent evidence of that.  He has held office on a number of occasions but there is nothing in his record to suggest that he is the kind of person who should be proposed and voted for as Leader of the party and, subsequently, as Taoiseach by these men who know both Deputy Colley and Deputy Haughey very well.  Consequently, we must look for some reason other than merit alone for that decision on their part and we must look for that reason in the personality of Deputy Haughey and also in his record.</P>
    <P>What was it that frightened virtually all of Fianna Fáil, including the outgoing <Col N="1371" /> Taoiseach, from a decision to recommend Deputy Haughey as Leader of the party, and subsequently, as Taoiseach? We know that they were voted down by the peripheral members of the party.  As both Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Cluskey have suggested, there are factors which helped to determine that decision. As most of us know, in politics the simplistic answer is very rarely the answer.  Broadly, the debate was about a misconception held in this House and held to a great extent throughout the country among people who wield power, those people who helped put our leaders into power.  I refer to those engaged in radio, television and the newspaper world as well as rank-and-file politicians and the ordinary people and the misconception to which I refer relates to the republican idea.  Obviously, it is one of the realities of politics that once again the division of our country has led to Deputy Lynch's dilemma and to his resignation, but that is another matter.</P>
    <P>To me the people who have put back Deputy Haughey are not republicans; they are crypto-provos.  They are crypto-provos in this House, in our newspapers and magazines and on radio and television. They are as far from being republicans as is Deputy Haughey.  I can prove that with Deputy Haughey on the three tests of a republican.  They are: the test in the belief in a secular society, the belief in a pluralist society and the belief in a radical approach to politics.  Of all those people who supported Deputy Haughey I do not know of one of them who would claim to believe in those three tenets of serious republicanism, and that is true about Deputy Haughey also.  I can prove that on his record in office.  It is about time we stopped calling these people republicans.</P>

      <P>In the Family Planning Bill debates I went to some trouble to demonstrate that this was a measure that should have been used to show that here in the Republic we believe in pluralism, in a secular society and in radical liberal policies.  But, instead of that, what we got from Deputy Haughey, to use his own words, was &ldquo;an Irish solution to an Irish problem&rdquo;.  I said then that there were one million Irish Protestants in the North and I asked if it solved the problem for them.  Deputy Haughey smiled at me because he was talking to the back benches.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Boland and I thought we had saved the family planning clinics, the following day Deputy Haughey brought in an amendment to ensure that we could not do that.  I remember Deputy Vivion de Valera leant down to him, clapped him on the shoulder and said &ldquo;That is the amendment I want&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the kind of person we have before us proposed for nomination to the most powerful and important post in the land.  Deputy Desmond was right to say that his record of competence is probably not in question now. However, on his record in the Department of Justice, there was a situation then that was as near to mutiny among the Garda Síochána as anything I remember.  I am not sure they did not go on strike; certainly they threatened to do so.  When the Deputy was Minister for Agriculture we had the biggest march of farmers in Dublin and I heard Deputy Blaney on the radio at one time say that it took him two years to clear up the mess created there.  Deputy Cluskey was quite right this morning when he spoke of the total cynicism of his behaviour with regard to health, the total cynicism of that completely farcical Family Planning Bill.  That was an opportunity that a serious republican would have seized to have shown that we are independent here and that, while we have our Catholic, Protestant, Presbyterian and freethinking views, in this House we legislate <Col N="1374" /> for a secular united Ireland.  Instead of that the Minister brought in a shamelessly sectarian Bill because he was attempting to buy votes.</P>
      <P>At the time I tried to show that the proposals should have been based on the needs of half the population, the women. Instead of that, as a measure of his cynicism and his hypocrisy, he subordinated what he knew to be the best interests of women and children in order to buy votes.  There are very few serious political analysts in journalism here but one of them, Bruce Arnold, accused this man of a lack of integrity.  Members of this House may accuse each other of being frivolous, lazy, irrelevant, incompetent or many other things, but the only thing the Chair will decline to allow us to do is to question the integrity or the honesty of one another.  That charge was made and it was never repudiated as I suspect it could be by a politician who cared about these things or who could do it safely in the courts.  This is the man who is now being proposed as Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>When things go wrong please do not blame us&mdash;the politicians.  In spite of the obvious succession of failures of this man, the eulogies written by the journalists have helped to put him there.  A recent interesting development is to talk about the media; it saves them talking about the journalists.  Somebody wields that pen; somebody puts the words on paper.  It used to be Ciano in Mussolini's Italy or Streicher in Hitler's Germany.  It was the journalists who helped to make these dictators.  The journalists have a great responsibility and it is my belief that they have betrayed that responsibility on this occasion in respect of this man.  Most of them failed to tell us of the total failure of this man in their continuous eulogies of him on the run-up to this day.  The mind-forming process, which is their privilege, helps to put us where we are and to put us out.  They helped to put out the man who has gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid of Deputy Haughey. Curiously enough he is one of the two politicians that I have been afraid of all my life.  I am afraid of his potential with <Col N="1375" /> real power.  I have to use the word.  The Chair may tell be to withdraw it and I will do so if he says so.  I believe that Deputy Haughey has used his position unscrupulously in order to achieve his ambitions as a politician.  I believe that he has betrayed all these people and the wonderful ministries that he has held.  He has failed to achieve the objectives; he has failed to discharge his functions, not because of incompetence&mdash;we all agree on his administrative qualities&mdash;but because of his cynical decision to withhold the use of power, particularly, as Deputy Cluskey said, in Social Welfare.  Oddly enough, I do not believe that he can be trusted in any of the ordinary things.  Most of all, even the crypto-provos will not get their pound of flesh.  This is the man who introduced the internment of republicans.  Does anybody think that he will not do it again if it suits him?  As far as they are concerned, they can be afraid of him for that reason but I have other reasons.  He has done everything to get power and I think he will do anything to hold power. Does anybody think that there are any limits to what he will do?  Why should they think there are any limits to what this man will do?  Is this tomorrow's Salazar?  Remember, world capitalism is facing irresolvable problems.  Deputy Haughey has never told us how he is going to solve our desperately serious economic problems.  We know what he did before when he was in trouble.  At least we know that Deputy Lynch thought he did something outside the democratic practice which he should not have done.  If we give him power now he will use that power.  He controls the Special Branch, the prisons and the internment camps.  What is to stop him using them?  Deputy Lynch fired Deputies Haughey, Blaney and a couple of others. Once Deputy Haughey becomes Taoiseach he cannot be fired.  This is the kind of power the crypto-provos and the journalists have given him with their snide innuendoes, their subterfuge.</P>
    <P>He made no secret of the fact that the trade unions are first on his list.  My awful nightmare is that this man is a dreadful <Col N="1376" /> cross between Richard Milhous Nixon and Dr. Salazar.  Many years ago when I first came in here I remember clearly that, after the vote, when the Government were defeated, the Ceann Comhairle said, &ldquo;We will go away for an hour and then come back.  At the end of that hour the Government will move to the right and the Opposition will move to the left&rdquo;.  I found that very impressive because that is the way the power moves from one side to the other.  When this man is in real trouble and he has all that power and he finds himself faced with defeat in this House, I wonder whether he will obey the word of the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> We are engaged in a very important democratic exercise, that of electing in a democratic way a new Taoiseach, a man who will preside over Cabinet meetings and wield an extraordinary power for the remainder of this Dáil.  I am sure strangers will admire the manner in which that duty is being discharged by the Opposition.  The democratic process works here if Opposition parties, or Opposition Members, take their responsibility seriously.</P>
      <P>The media also play an important part in the running of our democratic system.  They act as watchdogs on Parliament as a whole.  On occasions it happens that the media and the Opposition do not agree.  The media feel obliged on occasions to tell Parliament, the Government or the Opposition how they should carry out their functions.  This morning one section of the press expressed the view, in good faith, that this should be a low-key debate, that it should not be controversial, that we should forget the past in so far as the only nomination before the House is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember clearly the period between 1969 and 1970 when a number of Government Ministers were subjected to honest criticism by the Opposition for one reason or another.  At that time the press and political commentators did not look kindly on the type of criticism that was being offered or the type of matter that was being unearthed.  Those commentators <Col N="1377" /> made their views public in their writing and built up the Ministers we were criticising.  I clearly remember May 1970 when politics and the institutions of State here were reduced to a shambles.  In that month the Ministers who were under criticism from 1969 to 1970 by the Opposition, the Ministers who were defended and admired by the media disappeared from the Government overnight.  Nobody is infallible, the Opposition or the media, but we must discharge our duties here in the way we consider best.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I consider that the most efficient way for me to discharge my parliamentary and constitutional function is to intervene in this debate to give my views on the suitability or otherwise of Deputy Charles J. Haughey for the position of Taoiseach for which he has been nominated.  I have no doubt that Deputy Haughey is not suitable and I believe that a great number of Members of the House and Irish people share my views.  In my opinion, he possesses characteristics which disqualify him for the exalted position for which he has been nominated.  I am speaking of the characteristics of Deputy Haughey being, at best, a highly controversial and highly divisive individual and, being, at worst, a dangerous man. There can be no doubt that for practically all Deputy Haughey's political career he has been very controversial and in the last ten years at best he has been controversial on all major national issues.  He has been highly controversial on the most important national issue, that of national unity and how it should be brought about.  I do not think that assertion can be denied.  At best there is a huge question mark and great controversy hanging over his stance on national unity, the North of Ireland and the manner and means by which that should be brought about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey has also the capacity to be highly divisive.  In the last few days the Fianna Fáil Party have been split, practically down the middle, and I am satisfied that it was Deputy <Col N="1378" /> Haughey's intervention and anxiety to reach power that caused that.  Deputy Dr. Browne made an excellent point when he stated that normally one might expect massive support within the party for Deputy Haughey having regard to the Opposition, but yet the party is split 50-50.  If we accept what we hear we find that the entire Cabinet practically were against Deputy Haughey.  I do not wish to go into names and details.  I do not want to spell out the various reasons that various people supported Deputy Haughey.  But I will put this on record: I believe that a variety of Deputies supported Deputy Haughey for a variety of reasons and that while some of them supported him for the highest of reasons, many supported him for ones less worthy.  So much for his divisiveness.</P>
    <P>I believe that, in certain circumstances, Deputy Haughey has the capacity for being politically and nationally a dangerous man.  We can throw our minds back to the Four Courts when he was acquitted by a jury. Outside the Four Courts he screeched to the mob&mdash;and I can describe it in no other way&mdash;for the removal of the man who was then Taoiseach and whom he has now succeeded in removing.  The attack on and the battle to remove Deputy Jack Lynch began on the steps of the Four Courts at the end of the arms trial with the acquittal of Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <P>When Deputies come to assess a man, they can do so only to the best of their ability.  If there is any doubt about his ability he should not be given the power which Deputy Haughey seeks.  Watching him on television that night outside the Four Courts I immediately said, &ldquo;There is a man who is dangerous.  There is a man who should not control the seat of power&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have at present a sick economy. About that there is no doubt.  Even if I had the capacity to do so, it is not necessary for me to go into it in depth, or indeed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;or, even if I were in order in going into it in depth, it is not necessary for me to do so because it is accepted by all economists, by all politicians and by the country at large that we have a sick economy.  In the atmosphere of the present condition of our economy what sort of a man, what sort of a Taoiseach do we want to elect today? Various things can be blamed for the condition of our economy but one of the things that must take a big share of the blame is the fact that we have had, for the last 12 months at least, a distracted and divided Cabinet, a Cabinet which, instead of paying attention to the various ills besetting our country, were engaging their attentions on other matters.  I believe that Deputy Charles J. Haughey must take a lot of the blame for that divided Cabinet, for that distracted Cabinet, because each man there was looking over his shoulder at the other, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, was looking behind him at all of them. That is the way this country was run for the last 12 months.  That is the way the economy was nursed.  That is the way the economy was attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What sort of a Taoiseach do we want to run this country and to get our economy back into a healthy condition? In my opinion we want a Taoiseach who, as head of the governing party, who are Fianna Fáil at present, will unite that governing party, get them in behind the Government so that they will not be sniping at the Government, so that they will let the Government get on with their business.  We want a man who will unite the Cabinet, who will get behind him a Cabinet who will not be divided or distracted in their work.  I am satisfied that the member of the present Government least qualified to do those two things is the man whose name is today before Dáil Éireann for election to the position of Taoiseach.  In view of the present state of our economy there is needed a sense of national security; the people, businessmen, indeed the workforce of the country need to feel a sense of security and of confidence.  I believe that Deputy Haughey is not qualified nor has <Col N="1380" /> he the characteristics to do either of those things.  Therefore, I believe he is the wrong man to put in this position at present.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to Deputy Haughey's former ministries.  He was Minister for Justice.  I think I am right in saying that, as Minister for Justice, he introduced the Succession Act, a Bill, which as introduced, showed a complete lack of knowledge of rural Ireland, of family life in rural Ireland.  Had it been enacted as introduced it would have meant war within families because under that Bill as introduced each member of a family was entitled to share equally in the parents' estate without any right to the parents to choose one against the other, without any right to the parents to make sure that the family farm or business would be preserved.  That Bill was debated in this House to Second Stage, with such Members as the then Deputy Seán Flanagan, rising up in arms against it.  A by-election was fought in Galway on that Succession Act amongst other things.  After that by-election there was a change of Ministers, when Deputy Haughey was succeeded by Deputy B. Lenihan, when the section of that Succession Act about which I am speaking was scrapped and a sensible measure put through this House.  So much for that.</P>
    <P>We know that in agriculture Deputy Haughey created chaos.  He went to war with the farmers.  He refused to talk to the farmers.  He walked over them on his way into his office.  I think&mdash;and he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;he sent them to jail.  That is the type of man who has been nominated for Taoiseach in this mixed community.  His performance in the Departments of Health and Social Welfare has been dealt with in many ways.  His performance in social welfare has been one of neglect.  Social welfare payments are now delayed and most Deputies are occupied practically full time endeavouring to get humble people their rights from the Department of Social Welfare.  His performance in the Department of Health has been smart and slick.  The Deputy is certainly smart and slick.  But he has not done anything <Col N="1381" /> of substance in relation to health.  He has administered aspirins and kept the headaches at bay.  I do not know who will succeed him in that Department, but whoever does will certainly have some headaches to deal with.</P>
    <P>Impartial observers will have to admire the manner in which this debate has been conducted from the Opposition benches; otherwise it has been an extraordinary debate.  I am in the Oireachtas since 1961.  I sat here this morning throughout the debate and I have never heard a more devastating attack on the suitability of any man for a position he sought.  Those attacks have come from the Leader of this party, the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Kelly, Deputy Barry Desmond, who put some very telling material on the record of the House, and Deputy Browne.  What do we find?  We find that Deputy Haughey was proposed by a very brief speech by the outgoing Taoiseach, which only lasted about a minute, and he was formally seconded by the Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Then we had the well documented attack about the suitability of the man proposed put on the record of the House by speaker after speaker.  We have not heard a word of defence from the Government benches. No speaker has been offered in this debate from the Government benches to advance the cause of Deputy Haughey or to deny the accusations which have been made from this side of the House. Surely one heavyweight who served in office with Deputy Haughey for a number of years could be found to speak in this debate and deny the charges of unsuitability which have been made by this side of the House?</P>
    <P>I am convinced the country is not being treated properly by the Government. The change of leadership in the Government party during the term of the Dáil is a serious matter at any time.  It requires a lot of consideration by the House.  When the only nominee is a man who is divisive, controversial and potentially dangerous, it is a serious matter.  The Irish people on 16 June 1977 gave the Government the biggest majority ever <Col N="1382" /> on a manifesto&mdash;I am not going into it in any way which is not entirely relevant to the debate&mdash;which begins with the words:</P>
    <P>The vision of this manifesto is an Ireland in which a successful strategy for national re-organisation offers real security for all.  It has been carefully put together and costed for implementation in Government by a new team under Jack Lynch as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>They secured 84 seats on that manifesto. How many seats would Fianna Fáil have got in the last election if they had added to the introduction to the manifesto I have read out: &ldquo;Under Jack Lynch as Taoiseach for two-and-a-half years and Deputy Charles J. Haughey for the remainder of the term of office.&rdquo;  I suggest they would not be sitting on that side of the House now.  I do not believe that anybody in the House has jurisdiction to vote Yes to the motion which we are now debating.  It is only the Irish people in a general election who have the right to say yes to that composition.  I regret that Deputy Jack Lynch, instead of handing in his resignation as Taoiseach to the President, did not go to him to dissolve Dáil Éireann and let the electorate decide whether or not they wanted Deputy Charles J. Haughey as Taoiseach and if they wanted to place in his hands, having regard to his record and to the characteristics which he obviously possesses, the office of Taoiseach during this Dáil.  If Deputy Haughey won the general election he would then come back to the Dáil as Taoiseach and he would speak with authority.  If the Fianna Fáil Party, at the behest of the different types of people in the party, for a variety of reasons, vote yes to this motion then I believe they will be double crossing the Irish people and will be reneging on the very introduction to the manifesto.  I believe, if constitutional machinery makes it possible, there should be a general election at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by paying a personal tribute to the retiring <Col N="1383" /> Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch.  He was elected in 1966, served the country fairly and honestly and has commanded the respect of all three parties in this House. He has taken very hard decisions in his time, but my party were satisfied that he was a leader whom we could fight on political grounds, rather than on any other grounds.  He was a very successful Taoiseach, electorally, in bringing Fianna Fáil to power in 1977 with 84 seats&mdash;an unheard of number in the history of the State.  I wish himself and his good wife, Mrs. Maureen Lynch, a long and happy retirement and that he will continue to enjoy the respect and admiration of all the citizens of this State.</P>
      <P>I am fairly young to politics, having been in the House for only ten years.  I do not aspire to having anyone related to me in the GPO in 1916 but, from a family point of view, I have a deep respect for parliamentary politics and for the supremacy of parliament.  I have read, as have most politicians, the modern history of Ireland and have tremendous admiration for the former Taoiseachs of this country.  They were all sincere and true to their own ideals. Some I did not agree with, others I did and admired to a high level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no wish to indulge, nor have I ever indulged since coming into this House, in the historical politics of Ireland and the civil war politics.  I have steered clear of them on all occasions when I have tried to make my contribution to this House on the basis of Ireland of today and of the future.  My experience as a member of the Public Accounts Committee brought me into the inner councils of parliament.  It was that experience which has led me to speak here today on the nomination of Deputy Charles Haughey as Taoiseach.  I disagree profoundly with the choice of nominee of the Fianna Fáil Party.  About our Taoiseachs there must not be a hint of suspicion.  Regarding the nomination of a member of Government, on 6 May 1970&mdash;and I quote very briefly from Volume 246 of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann, the Taoiseach said, in relation <Col N="1384" /> to Deputy Haughey and Deputy Blaney:</P>
    <P>...I decided to approach the two Ministers again and to repeat my request that they tender to me their resignation as members of the Government.  I did so on the basis that I was convinced</P>
    <P>&mdash;and that is a word which this House should note&mdash;</P>
    <P>that not even the slightest suspicion should attach to any member of the Government in a matter of this nature.</P>
    <P>As history knows, both Ministers refused to resign and were subsequently dismissed.  We have before us here, in the words of the retiring Taoiseach, that the man before the House for the position of Taoiseach is a man about whom there is a slightest hint of suspicion.  We are well aware that Deputy Haughey has an intense dislike, even hatred, of the Taoiseach who is about to resign and an unbridled ambition which is about to be fulfilled.  On his acquittal at the arms trial in October&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Deputy Haughey is reported to have said, in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 24 October 1970, speaking in general, but we all know to whom he was referring:</P>
      <P>I think that those who are responsible for this debacle have no alternative but to take the honourable course that is open to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was obviously referring to the general call, from among his followers, for the resignation of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch.  Deputy Haughey was, of course, dismissed from the Cabinet, primarily on the grounds of the allegations in relation to arms importation, or attempted importation.  In a statement the then Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, gave another important reason, which must be distinguished from the question of arms importation, <Col N="1385" /> being quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 6 May 1970, as saying in relation to the grounds of dismissal of Deputies Haughey and Blaney:</P>
    <P>.. I am satisfied that they do not subscribe fully to Government policy in relation to the present situation in the Six Counties as stated by me... .</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the different stances in relation to Northern Ireland policy still remain.  This was highlighted recently in a speech made by the present Taoiseach designate to a branch on the anniversary of Pádraig Pearse.  The then Taoiseach received from the people of Ireland in 1977 a tremendous mandate to be Taoiseach of a strong Government. I doubt very much&mdash;and put it to the people opposite to me in this House&mdash;that that same mandate would have been forthcoming if Deputy Haughey had been leader of that party in 1977 and I doubt very much if that would be the position if there were a general election now, or in the near future.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee in the matter of what has become known as the Committee of Inquiry into £100,000, which was the committee established by the order of the Dáil on 1 December 1970.  All the members are, doubtless, aware that the order asked the committee to inquire into the expenditure of £100,000 voted for the relief of distress in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It was a very difficult time for many politicians.  The position in Northern Ireland was very delicate and the position in Southern Ireland was very emotional, especially in view of the fact that we felt that the minority population in Northern Ireland was open to attack. Nonetheless, this House voted to spend £100,000 on the relief of distress in Northern Ireland.  There were allegations at the time that the money was misspent and in order to clarify the position properly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Fianna Fáil side the members of that committee were Deputy Sylvester Barrett, Deputy Ben Briscoe, Deputy Hugh Gibbons, Deputy Tom Nolan and most important and significant of all.  Deputy MacSharry who proposed Deputy Haughey for his present position in the Party.  On the Fine Gael side the members of that committee were Deputy Richard Burke, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, and myself. Deputy Paddy Hogan was in the chair, and Deputy Justin Keating and Deputy James Tully served on behalf of the Labour Party on that committee.  The conclusion of the deliberations of that committee are worth noting.  I quote from the Interim and Final Reports of the Committee of Public Accounts of the Dáil on 1 December 1970, part 10, Summary of Conclusions re Expenditure it was agreed that:</P>
      <P>£29,166 12s 0d was spent on relief of distress, £34,850 was possibly spent in Belfast, but on undetermined purposes, £250 was spent on purposes possibly related to the relief of distress, and £41,499 13s 9d was not spent on the relief of distress.</P>
      <P>That was the conclusion of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Another conclusion which I must relate to the House is in paragraph 79 of that report under the heading of Failure of Colonel Hefferon and Ministers to take Action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be added that had Colonel Hefferon taken appropriate action when he learned from Captain Kelly about the proposed arms importation and his drawings from the account, much of the money might not have been misappropriated.  Had the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Neil T. Blaney, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, and the then Minister for Defence, Deputy James Gibbons, <Col N="1387" /> passed on to the Taoiseach their suspicion or knowledge of the proposed arms importation the misappropriation of part of the money which is now known to have been spent on arms might have been avoided.</P>
    <P>That was the conclusion the committee of this House, composed equitably of all parties, came to.  It is a damning report in retrospect and it is a highly significant report from the point of view of the motion now before the House.  It is well known from the evidence of Chief Superintendent Fleming that Deputy Haughey had a meeting with one of the leading members of the IRA and promised him £50,000.</P>

      <P>A senior member of the Garda force has stated the clear position in relation to Deputy Haughey's part in the attempted importation of arms and the possible establishment of the provisional IRA.  That Chief Superintendent still served in a senior capacity as a member of the Garda force and was not dismissed.  I am aware, and must say in fairness to Deputy Haughey, that he completely refuted in his evidence at that committee the evidence of Chief Superintendent Fleming.  I accept from the <Col N="1388" /> Deputy's evidence at the committee that that was a very delicate period, a period of turbulence and intense emotion.  It is not for me to make a judgment on that period.  That was done adequately by the Taoiseach in his decision to dismiss Deputy Haughey and in the report of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
      <P>There could be no doubt that the conclusion reached by that committee in inquiring into the £100,000 is a damning indictment of Deputy Charles J. Haughey and must raise the question of his credibility and of his integrity in relation to the security of this State.  It is not a pleasure for me to say so.  In politics I have always tried to remove my personal feelings from any debate.  We are here discussing the important question of the security of the State and of its institutions which I try to serve.  The action of the last Taoiseach in dismissing Deputy Haughey was apparently justified at least on the basis of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts at that time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey's unbridled action in getting rid of Deputy Lynch, his unbridled hatred of that man is something that will not go down well with people.  It was obvious from recent events, recent speeches by Deputy de Valera, Deputy McEllistrim, and Deputy Bill Loughnane that there was a concerted effort on the part of Deputy Haughey to move Deputy Jack Lynch aside and out of the office of the Taoiseach.  That has now succeeded, primarily because many Fianna Fáil backbenchers are afraid for their seats; they fear that their presence in this House is in jeopardy and they are prepared to gamble on Deputy Charles J. Haughey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also evident from the vote last week that the establishment side of the Fianna Fáil Party were in favour of Deputy George Colley, a person seen not so much to be a dashing Minister but to be a down to earth, honest Minister, a Minister we could support as a person to be Taoiseach.  That view did not prevail because there were members of the Fianna Fáil Party who wanted once again to wave the green flag, to play the <Col N="1389" /> green card, to come out with this hawkish republicanism which is not a part of my make up.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on Deputy Haughey at a very early date to state in this House whether he agrees with the concept of the majority community in Northern Ireland having a right to decide their own future.  He has a clear responsibility and duty to this House to say that he accepts the concept that if the Protestant majority in the North wish to remain outside the Republic he will respect that decision.  If he does not hold that view, he has a clear responsibility to say that that is not the position, that, taking Ireland as a whole, the majority have a right to decide the future of Northern Ireland.  That must be a prime responsibility lying on the shoulders of Deputy Charles Haughey.  He has a responsibility to declare, without ambiguity, his position in respect of the majority and the minority communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>As my Leader said this morning, he kept his head well down and kept very silent about his support or otherwise for the IRA activities in the North.  For nine years he refrained from condemning the IRA.  For nine years he was pushing the image that they had his passive support. As was said this morning, it was only when he was safely in the seat as Taoiseach designate that he came out and condemned the IRA.  That was an acceptable thing to do, but I have my doubts about his sincerity in that regard.</P>
    <P>Having condemned the IRA he has another responsibility&mdash;to state clearly where he stands in relation to the Protestant community and their rights within Northern Ireland.  I challenge him to do that if not this evening&mdash;I understand that under existing procedure he is precluded from speaking&mdash;then at a very early stage.  If the spirit of reconciliation is not clearly spelled out in this House, the future of this country as a democracy may be in doubt.  There is no doubt in my mind that it is the intention of the IRA not only to wreak havoc in Northern Ireland but to bring down the <Col N="1390" /> Dublin Government as well.  The responsibility is clearly on the shoulders of the Taoiseach designate in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is not easy for me to stand up and say what I did.  I have tremendous respect for the institutions of this State and for democracy.  I have great admiration for the unselfish way generation after generation served the ideals and aspirations of the Irish people.  Many Taoisigh, Ministers and Members of this House have given up very good careers to serve their country.</P>
    <P>There is, unfortunately, a hint of suspicion about the Taoiseach designate which may do this country a great deal of damage.  That hint of suspicion, quite clearly established by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch and by the Committee of Public Accounts Special Inquiry, will linger.  I have no wish to refer to Deputy Haughey's private life, but there is a hint of suspicion in relation to his motives as a politician in getting to the top, to the position of Taoiseach.  His motive was an unbridled hatred of Deputy Jack Lynch. His motive was not as one to serve but as one to dominate and to own this country.  That is wrong and it is very serious.</P>
    <P>When debating legislation, and especially Estimates, we will have to be very careful.  We will have to ensure that nothing is amiss, that there is nothing we need have suspicions about.  I regret having to say that.  I also regret that I have to stand here and oppose a man whose ability and reputation as a Minister is accepted. He has done well as a Minister, but in 1970, by the implications of his involvement with the IRA and with importation of arms, he broke the concept of collective responsibility.  As a member of this House, I consider that concept of collective responsibility is very important. I cannot say that, when he is Taoiseach, that will not happen again.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Kelly, said this morning he understood the tremendous emotional atmosphere that prevailed in 1969 and 1970 and understood the pressures on the Government at that time&mdash;the same pressures would be on <Col N="1391" /> any Government.  I understand that fully.  But there was then, and there remains now, a clear concept of collective responsibility.  It is obvious from the report of the Committee of Public Accounts Special Inquiry that Deputy Haughey, if not others, breached the concept of collective responsibility.  I do not have confidence that, if something similar happens again in relation to Northern Ireland, collective responsibility will not again be breached.  That is a very serious matter.  Therefore, I cannot vote for Deputy Haughey, I cannot have confidence in him and I am fearful for the future of my country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an atmosphere about this debate which, although I am a relatively short time in this House, I suspect is probably unprecedented.  It would be folly for Members on the opposite side or people outside this House to attribute such an atmosphere merely to the wiles of the Opposition.  However much many of us find participating in a debate of this level distasteful, the fact is that it is a symptom of a wider unease. That is a reality, regardless of the issues tossed up in this particular Pandora's Box of a discussion, the Pandora's Box which this Government, if they get off the ground, are likely to become.</P>
      <P>There is probably no one in the House who would not like, on the eve of what may be a new Government, with all their heart to try to contribute constructively towards a new reign and regime.  Unfortunately, that desire to contribute and be constructive and to participate in that type of good wish has to be extremely qualified.  The tasks which face this Government are major and there is no reason for confidence that the Deputy proposed for the job of Taoiseach is likely to be the man who will handle the job successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to express a personal word of gratitude to Deputy Haughey for his courtesies to me, and I am sure my colleagues, while Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  I know that the standards that he applied to dealing with <Col N="1392" /> public representatives are widely appreciated. There will be two types of challenges facing him as Taoiseach. There will be the challenge normally facing any new leader and Taoiseach on the social and economic fronts.  These are very real and should not be ignored or downplayed in the context of this discussion. For Deputy Haughey there will be challenges arising out of the fact that he is proposed to be the new Taoiseach and out of what he is likely to contribute and the degree to which he is perceived to be the man that he is.  There is the challenge of the economic situation of a country living beyond its means; the challenge of motivating people once again into self-respect; of the creation of an atmosphere where people will not put material welfare above all else; which they were undoubtedly encouraged to do; of the inspiring, dedicated, patriotic&mdash;in the full sense of the word&mdash;leadership which is now necessary if the trend which was adopted in recent years is to be reversed. It is difficult to see how the philosophy expounded by the proposed Taoiseach and the example by which he has carried out his office is likely to be successful.  It may be a different type of person, leader and example that is needed.</P>
    <P>As regards the social challenge of the mal-distribution of the wealth and resources of the country, which lie close to the kernel of our problem, I do not believe Deputy Haughey is the man who will commit himself really and genuinely to the kind of reform essential in these areas.  Despite the glitter, glamour, attraction and magic of some aspects of his political career thus far, we are not talking about a veneer or outward image but a basic, deep philosophical commitment to the ideal of a new Ireland in which all children have a place in the sun and where justice is obtainable and is not closed off from access of any individual&mdash;radical change.  I see nothing radical about the policies which on the basis of past performance we are likely to see from the man whom the opposite side of the House want as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Another major challenge is the task of uniting the country not merely in terms of the whole island and cultures but in <Col N="1393" /> terms of uniting the various divided sectors of the community who now openly vie against each other, where might is right and concern for the weaker people, the community without a voice, the relatively inarticulate and those not represented by strong lobbies who have to take the back place in the queue and whose turn will never be reached.  That is the example I have witnessed since I came into the House and I have heard or seen nothing to believe that that will change under the leadership which it is now proposed to give us.</P>
    <P>The unity of a country at peace with itself in the belief that each individual and family is getting justice and a fair return for its input, is not forgotten about because it has not got a loud voice in a strong lobby.  That type of peace and unity is a dream perhaps but an aspiration to which any Government concerned with social justice has to commit itself. We have a long way to go before that is achieved.  There are elements in the political performance thus far of the proposed Taoiseach which are likely to be seen to be provocative in that respect and which will hardly be the kind of binding force which we need&mdash;a healer rather than a divider.  There is a time when men who are sharp in wit and wisdom, whose style is courageous and aggressive, are necessary.  This is not the time.  We need a different kind of person to bring us back from the extremes of avarice, greed and self-interest towards which we have been pushed in recent years by a preoccupation with the outer man as opposed to the inner man which is ultimately what political life and the purpose of human kind is all about.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a just society in which I am pleased to say this party has a good record is vital.  If there is justice, and by that I mean the belief in the heart and the soul of each individual that they are not being excluded or alienated from the wealth and resources and place in the sun which are rightly theirs, we can enjoy true peace which begins inside each individual and works outwards and is not super-imposed by the creation of <Col N="1394" /> structures from outside.  Is there any reason to believe that the proposed Taoiseach will give us a different understanding and appreciation of how far we have to go before that just society is created?  If there is, I do not see it.  If there are people who are here longer than I am and have greater wisdom and better powers of recollection, they should speak up if what we are saying is wrong.  Would the proposed Taoiseach rise to the challenge to which I have referred?  He has much of the capacity to do so and would want to do so. However, the price might be too high. Regrettable as it might be to say, there is already the feeling that even in the act of achieving the status of would-be Taoiseach there might have been a price paid, not in monetary terms, but in terms of commitment and compromise which may be an antithesis to what he would like to achieve in relation to the objectives of the Government he would want to head.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong for us to say that it is beyond the bounds of anybody to change elements of their approach or that it would be impossible for one, having recognised that such change is necessary, to bring about the changes which may be needed.  Unfortunately the likely response would be that what we are saying is for the sake of intransigent opposition, perhaps even sour grapes. That is not the case.  What is being articulated on this side of the House with varying degrees of intensity and direction is little more than lies in the heart of many Irish people with concern for national welfare and well-being.  While allowing that change might come about and that any individual may have the capacity to respond to not just the prompting but direct and forthright expression of concern expressed here today, the facts are that to date in view of the reticence and lack of willingness to commit himself on issues, Deputy Haughey has not made clear that the kind of change which will be necessary&mdash;a basic change in attitudes, emphasis and commitment to the kernel of things as opposed to the veneer&mdash;will come about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> The major issue before the House is the suitability of Deputy Haughey for the job of Taoiseach and the likelihood of his successor otherwise.  Already, there are some results of events to date. First, there can be no question but that the authority of Deputy Haughey, if he becomes Taoiseach, would be weak by being deprived of the strength which a leader has when he is chosen by an openly democratic system.  Fianna Fáil may say that all that happened is that a leader was changed.  It is not as simple as that.  There is so much difference in the style, philosophy and thinking of the proposed Taoiseach and that of his former leader&mdash;and he had made this clear by a variety of gestures and other expressions some of a silent kind&mdash;there is so much difference in approach that we are not getting a continuation of the same Government, the same policy, the same philosophy or even the same manifesto on which this Government came into power.  We are getting a radical change of a kind that should be dictated by a people.  I believe that the appropriate thing, in view of the likely major change in direction, would have been to have a general election in order to give the new Taoiseach, whoever he might be, the authority, the status, the dignity and self respect which he could syphon from the operation of the democratic system at its best.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil manifesto in its opening lines which I presume is to date the policy of the Government&mdash;to what extent it has been carried out in the letter and the spirit is a matter for another day&mdash;refers to a Fianna Fáil Government under the leadership of Jack Lynch, not anybody else.</P>
    <P>A second consequence of what has happened to date is that there are new divisions already opened on this island. Perhaps it is hard to blame somebody for divisions which occur apparently outside the scope of his doing.  It gives us no pleasure to see a party acting as they have done in the last few days in the election of their leader.  We are unhappy that people who want to express discontent&mdash;not just the healthy divided opinions <Col N="1396" /> of a democratic party in choosing a new leader but something deeper which only a fool could pretend does not exist&mdash;seem unable to do so.  We are unhappy that that is the case.  We believe there might yet be an opportunity for such people to find their voice.  These divisions are there and God knows, as Deputy Kelly said, this island has been divided deeply enough for long enough already; it is a healer we need now. Despite the enormous potential in many directions which Deputy Haughey undoubtedly has, it would need a major change for him to become the kind of healer I think is necessary at this time.</P>
    <P>Another result already evident is a new, strange, compelling unity and even fire in the Opposition.  I am not sure why this should be.  I take no pleasure in climbing a mountain of antipathy, of distaste for any individual.  That is not why I joined this Assembly.  If the aura and environment of which we are part today were to be the working environment of the House, Deputies on both sides of the House would find it a much less pleasant place in which to work.  The primary and principal sin of any of us is not to make mistakes but not to learn from them.  If the likely inevitability occurs and Deputy Haughey becomes Taoiseach I think he will get&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;as full support as is humanly possible and very strong support if he gives the kind of commitments which have been implicitly and explicitly demanded of him today.  Young people are at an interesting turning point in their lives. Many of them are totally cynical about politicians and political structures.  The Taoiseach who is likely to lead us for the next two and a half years has a major task.  I am not sure if he can motivate young people, show them by unselfish example, by dedication and commitment, by putting the country before individual preoccupation with career or self-advancement, the kind of example they need at present, the kind of example which would lead them to say, &ldquo;We have here, not just an efficient man but a truly good man&rdquo;.  That is what they need.</P>
    <P>My final reason for finding it not possible to vote for Deputy Haughey as <Col N="1397" /> Taoiseach is that I believe we have a better leader, a better would-be Taoiseach a man who has already given the kind of selfless dedication which is necessary and given it in a measure so great that it almost makes many of us ashamed of our own puny efforts.  I hope that whatever happens this evening all of us will realise that our country and its future are greater than the interests of any one of us.  Further, I hope that allowing for the parliamentary structures which surround us we can work more closely together and try to get away from the sterile, futile, barren arguments of the past and that we can work so as to create the kind of society and country of which we can be all proud to be part.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Haughey can do this, if he can inspire such a revolution in public attitudes and perhaps even in his own attitude, there will be an enormous debt of gratitude due to him.  I hope he can. Whatever the outcome this evening is, in the interests of the country many of us would want to wish the Taoiseach designate well but find ourselves unable at this stage to do so.  I am sorry in my heart that this is the case.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Haughey's election as Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party was announced last week, Deputy Cluskey, Leader of my party, made a statement in which he indicated without ambiguity that the normal courtesies of allowing any settling in period to a new Taoiseach or Taoiseach designate could not be observed in the case of Deputy Haughey and gave briefly at that point his reasons for making that statement as the political and social philosophies of the person who had been chosen as Leader of Fianna Fáil and as Taoiseach designate.  He also made clear his intention to explain at more length in this House today, as he has done, his reasons for the stand he took.  I might add that it was the only statement made on that occasion by the Leader of any major party in this House. For this, he has been chided&mdash;and, indeed, in its editorial this morning <i>The Irish Times</i> not only chides Deputy <Col N="1398" /> Cluskey but seems, by implication and by extension, to chide us all for spending any time at all on this matter.  The quotation to which I refer is:</P>
      <P>Not all Mr. Cluskey's followers gave him full marks for graciousness and he is likely to have followers inside and outside the House who would be happier if he spared them further embarrassment.</P>
      <P>The only embarrassment that would be experienced on these benches today would be if we did not honour our commitment given last week to oppose this appointment for profound political reasons.  I find it all the more surprising that such criticism should come from a newspaper which has not been slow to criticise in the past and which will, no doubt, not be slow to criticise in the future.  Indeed, one of the objects of its criticism over the years has been the very person whom we are now asked to vote confidence in as Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair would bear with me I think he might revise his opinion on that.  We are here discussing the suitability of Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach.  It is entirely in order to quote here what successive editorials in that newspaper have said about him from time to time.  In passing, the House might like to know that when Deputy de Valera was once asked during an election campaign what he thought of the editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> of that morning he is reputed to have remarked that all editorials were written by small men sitting behind desks that were too big for them.  But, no doubt, all political leaders will say things like that when the occasion suits them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Haughey specifically, there are two key quotations that have a bearing on the decision that we are asked to take in this House and also&mdash;and this is by way of parenthesis&mdash;on the continuity or lack <Col N="1399" /> of continuity in the editorial attitudes concerned.  On 6 May 1970, which was the day after the eruption of the affair that was known as the arms crisis, <i>The Irish Times</i> said:</P>
    <P>One of the strangest aspects of the recurring crisis has indeed been the continued silence of Mr. Haughey. One can search the public prints in vain for any expression of his feelings.</P>
    <P>On 24 October of the same year, after the conclusion of the arms trial, the editorial writer returned to his theme and said:</P>
    <P>If Mr. Haughey had deep and committed views about the North&mdash;and many know that he had&mdash;he kept them to himself and, on the face of it, is not in a strong position to assail Mr. Lynch openly on that score.</P>
    <P>We have not only the duty but the responsibility to ask what, if anything, has been said by Deputy Haughey since those words were penned on 24 October, more than nine years ago, not just to allay the editorial suspicions of <i>The Irish Times</i> but, indeed, to allay the deeper suspicions of Members of this House and of the wider public outside it.</P>
    <P>It is frequently said that the Taoiseach or Taoiseach designate must have a substantial measure of support not only in the country at large but certainly within his own party.  Other Deputies have gone through the arithmetic of the vote that took place in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and I do not propose to repeat what they have said.  It is certainly true that the bird with the one wing never flew, much less, one would imagine, that ornithological curiosity, the bird with two wings of different shades of green. This is a matter ultimately for the Taoiseach designate himself to sort out, if he can, and for the country, I hope, to sort out if he cannot.  But we are at liberty to speculate on how far that zoological curiosity which is now Fianna Fáil will proceed.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes assumed that in making these speeches on this kind of occasion we are somehow guilty of bad manners. <Col N="1400" /> I have heard, and I am sure other Members of this House have heard, a kind of refrain in various areas saying that perhaps Charlie is good for the country&mdash;I hesitate to refer to Deputy Haughey in such colloquial terms; I know it is not normally in order but this is the framework in which this comment is usually made.  Any judgment of this kind is based on a total misreading both of the person concerned and his policies and, indeed, of what is good for the country.  Fianna Fáil needs Deputy Haughey's leadership like it needs a hole in the head, the country even more so.  I am not talking here about any personal characteristics of the Taoiseach designate; I am sure he is kind to children and to small animals.  Many national and international leaders have had such character traits before.  It has not prevented them on occasion from making fundamentally disastrous political errors.  I am opposed to the Taoiseach designate simply by virtue of the fact that I believe that he now represents, in its most full-blooded form, an approach to the welfare of the country and of its people that I find, at the very best, distasteful and, at the worst, deeply damaging and distressing.</P>
    <P>Like many other people in this House and outside it, I watched on television the press conference given by the Taoiseach designate not long after his election.  He said a couple of things that I have been mulling over ever since.  The more I mull over them the more extraordinary they seem to be.</P>
    <P>The first of these was the open implication in one of his statements that because he came of Northern stock and the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, came from Cork, he was in a better position to understand the North and the people of the North.  Deputy Haughey was born and bred in Dublin, but that is beside the point.  Many people will have heard that statement on that programme, and even people like myself who have disagreed with Deputy Lynch's approach on the North from time to time, have had a sickening feeling in the stomach at the curtness, glossed over by a smile, of that <Col N="1401" /> dismissal of almost a decade of tribulation and political effort by the former leader of Fianna Fáil on behalf of all the people of the country.</P>
    <P>I was struck also by the carefully, jocose nature of the references by the Taoiseach-designate that he always did what the Party Whip had told him to do. That prompted me to think back on two things, on the very close connection in time between the occasion on which he called on those responsible for this debacle, as he called the arms trial, and the time when he himself, when some of his colleagues had aided it voluntarily and others had done so involuntarily, walked through the lobbies of this House to vote confidence in the man who had dismissed him.</P>
    <P>I ask the House which of these two men did the honourable thing?  As I said earlier, there has been some comment on the attitude or lack of attitude of the Taoiseach-designate on the whole question of Northern Ireland and of Irish unity. We search the records in vain for any direct statement of the Taoiseach-designate's attitude not just to the North but to the kind of Republic he would like to create in Ireland.  We are all republicans after one fashion or another, but more and more it becomes clear that what is important is not whether we are republicans but which kind of republicans we are; and in relation to the Taoiseach-designate's attitude to the vision of the Republic&mdash;he has a reputation for having a vision of the Republic&mdash;all we can do is to grasp at the few straws that his implicit behaviour offers us for examination.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Browne spoke eloquently of the vision of the Republic that is implicit in the Family Planning Act, and I do not propose to repeat any of his criticisms.  The only other implicit action I can think of in the short term relating to the Taoiseach-designate's vision of the Republic is his action in authorising the expenditure of public money for the purchase at auction in London of an archaeological treasure which was being bid for by the Ulster Museum in Belfast <Col N="1402" /> and which should have gone to Belfast, the Tullymoon Hoard.</P>
    <P>These are all straws in the wind and we are left to grasp at these straws because of his virtually unbroken silence in the last ten years.  A famous Irish poet once agonised as to whether words of his had sent out certain men to be shot by the English.  I would argue that silence can be ten times more voluble than words and that the worst kind of silences are those that come from the armchair republicans in our society, from the armchair generals who do not have to put even their political future much less their lives on the line but who are happy enough to let young and misguided people do so.  It is fashionable to condemn the IRA and it is ironic, to put it mildly, that the Taoiseach-designate, who is above all a fashionable man, should have been so tardy in the adoption of this fashion.  We cannot forget that the IRA do not exist in a vacuum; they exist in a social context, in a human context, a political and indeed an economic context. If we accept that, we must not only maintain that silence is dangerous but that condemnation is not enough and that this problem will not be solved ultimately except by the creation of the kind of society in this State and in all of Ireland that will make the IRA an irrelevance.  As Deputy Cluskey said this morning, it is our belief on these benches that only a socialist society will offer us ultimately that hope.</P>
    <P>We must beware of anybody who advances or allows to be advanced the cloak of republicanism as justification for his candidate for this and any other office, because it is now an open secret that there are deep differences among all people who call themselves republicans about the kind of society, the kind of republic, they would like to create.  There are differences within the party that have elected Deputy Haughey; there are indeed differences within the party led by Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  This party, at least, are united in relation to the kind of Republic we would like to see established here.</P>
    <P>In so far as the differences within the <Col N="1403" /> governing party are concerned, it is plain that just as there are people on those beaches&mdash;Deputy Leyden, for instance, Deputy Lenihan on occasions&mdash;who describe themselves as latter day socialists, there are also people who make no bones about where their ideological chips are placed, and Deputy Haughey falls very readily and easily into the latter camp.  He has put his ideological chips firmly down on the right of the ideological spectrum.  If we want proof of this we do not have to look further than the budgets which he introduced as Minister for Finance in those heady years of expansion in the late sixties.</P>
    <P>If we examine these budgets&mdash;for instance, those of 1967, 1968 or 1969, and even if by a small stretch of the imagination we include the 1970 budget, which he was to have introduced but did not&mdash;we will see an approach to financial and economic policy that is mysteriously even-handed.  On the one hand, there was more money for social purposes and on the other hand there was more money for industrial development. But when we look at the small print we will discover how mysterious this even-handedness has been.  For every £ that went in the direction of the under-privileged and socially deprived at least as much again went into the pockets of those who own and control the industrial sectors of our economy.  In the 1967 budget £1.5 million extra was given to the Department of Social Welfare.  In the very same budget was a 25 per cent increase in capital allowances to industry at a cost of £1 million alone.  There was substantial earned income relief for surtax payers, and, last but not least, there was an extension of the tax holiday for mining profits by another decade.</P>
    <P>When you consider the tens or hundreds of thousands of people over whom this £1.5 million in social welfare was to be distributed and the dozens or hundreds of people who were to be the direct beneficiaries of the handout on the other side, you can see plainly how the ideological game was being played.  In <Col N="1404" /> 1969 the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, noted in his budget speech that 1968 was the best year in our economic history.  How did he celebrate the best year in our economic history?  By increasing the amount allocated to social welfare by only half the amount by which it had been increased in the previous budget.  This has been typical of his social and economic vision during the period he has held office under this Government.</P>
    <P>I have some difficulty in referring to the budget of 1970 for the simple reason that I did not know whether it would have been the same had Deputy Haughey delivered it as it was when Deputy Lynch delivered it.  Given that the accident which occurred to Deputy Haughey occurred literally within hours of the time that he was supposed to speak, I think that I am within my rights in assuming that this budget speech too bears the hallmark of his responsibility.  I will draw attention to two sentences in that budget speech.  The first was a statement that in relation to the social sector and the industrial sector a balance of equity had now to some extent been restored.  Again, the budget speech on that occasion went on to say that extreme poverty was, fortunately, no longer a general problem in this country.</P>
    <P>It is almost ten years since those words were contained in a budget statement as drafted for delivery by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey. Can I or any of us in this House look into our hearts today almost a decade later and repeat that statement with any degree of confidence?  Although it would help, we do not need the evidence of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty to tell us.  All we have to do is to walk through the streets of our principal city and down any of our boreens in the country to know that it is not true.  The schemes which were adumbrated by Deputy Haughey as Minister for Finance were continued by him in Opposition.  He spoke on occasion on all sorts of things but in finance particularly the thrust of his contribution was most plain.  We&mdash;that is the last <Col N="1405" /> Coalition&mdash;were destroying incentive. The way to restore incentive was by cuts in personal taxation.  We are all in favour of a fair and just taxation system but it is difficult, to put it mildly, to accept that there is a total lack of altruism in statements such as these made by the present Taoiseach designate, then Deputy Haughey, Opposition spokesman for Health and Social Welfare.  In Volume 299 of the Official Report he is even on record as wringing his hands in despair for the future of the bloodstock industry. At column 929 of that volume he said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>...the effect of the introduction of the wealth tax has been to completely sabotage that great industry...</P>
    <P>It certainly did not sabotage Deputy Haughey's end of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not proposing to push this.  I am simply making an obvious statement of fact.  Since his period in Opposition ended Deputy Haughey has been in charge of the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  His contribution or lack of contribution in the Department of Health has been itemised not just in these benches but also in the columns of <i>The Irish Times,</i> which I was chastising only a moment ago.  It is in relation particularly to his stewardship of Social Welfare that we must put the major question-mark against his suitability for the office for which he is now proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When in Opposition Deputy Haughey is on record as saying that apart from a few isolated cases he did not really believe that there was much in the way of social welfare fraud, for example.  Suddenly, 18 months or so after assuming office as Minister for Social Welfare, we find him being charged by his colleague, <Col N="1406" /> Deputy Colley, and accepting the charge, of slashing £2 million of assumed fraud from the budget of his Department.  The facts as supplied to me by the Minister's Department are that fraud on that basis simply does not exist. Some time ago at Question Time I asked the Minister for the percentage of fraudulent claims in relation to any of the benefits administered by his Department and to state the amount paid out in relation to fraudulent claims as a percentage of the total amount paid out in relation to any one of these claims.</P>
    <P>I take my hat off to these statisticians in the Department who in some cases had to go to three decimal places to find any meaningful relationship between social welfare frauds and the total amount paid out as benefit.  The relevant figures were: disability benefit, .09 per cent; maternity allowance, .007 per cent; retirement pension, .002 per cent and so on.  What is interesting is that when one calculates the total amount claimed fraudulently from the Department, the sum is no more than one-tenth of what is supposed to be saved in the current year as a result of attacking fraud.  We on these benches have our own suspicions as to how that saving was to be made. These suspicions are bolstered and fuelled by the queues of would be social welfare beneficiaries who come to our offices at weekends seeking our help so that they might claim their entitlements. These queues are long but they are not as long as those queues that have been experienced for so long outside the offices of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In both health and social welfare there has been a certain image projected but the people who are entitled to the various benefits are well aware of the difference between the image and the reality.  As the Irish proverb goes, Ní breathaíonn na briathra na bráithre or, fair words will not butter parsnips.  The Taoiseach designate has buttered very few parsnips since he went into office as Minister for Health and Social Welfare, apart from the gigantic specimen he has harvested recently.</P>
    <P>In each of these Departments since 1977 the expenditure on health and <Col N="1407" /> social welfare has decreased as a percentage of our GNP.  This means that the poor and those entitled to income support and to health care have been receiving a smaller slice of the national cake than they had been receiving when the Minister assumed office.  The percentage of GNP alone that has been spent on social welfare has declined since 1977 by about 10 per cent.  In addition, the number of people who are entitled to free medical treatment has declined also.  The fact that these indices are not more widely known cannot be put entirely at the door of the assiduous handling by the Taoiseach designate of the media. Perhaps, we in the Opposition are to blame to some extent for that situation. However, it is a situation that cannot be ignored and it has a real and valid relationship to the Minister's suitability for the office of Taoiseach.  If he has done this in the greenwood, one might ask what would he not do in the dry. Overall, the most fundamental point is that the process of election which has taken place in Fianna Fáil and which we are asked either to reject or to endorse today is not simply a point relating to shades of nationalism.  More importantly, it relates to shades of economic policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey stated clearly that he was not simply attacking the person of Deputy Haughey but that it was unmistakable that a majority of Fianna Fáil support now not only this man's republican views, whatever they are or are supposed to be, but his economic policies.  If one is a capitalist and is faced with the choice of choosing between the somewhat benign, perhaps a little watery, capitalism of Deputy Colley and the red-in-tooth-and-claw capitalism as exemplified by Deputy Haughey, one is compelled remorselessly in the direction of the latter.  In his contribution Deputy FitzGerald said he had hoped that the result of the vote here would release us from the shackles of the civil war and from the shadows which that civil war cast over this House and over Irish politics generally.  As I see it, the action of Fianna Fáil in electing Deputy <Col N="1408" /> Haughey as their Leader and in having his name put before us here either for endorsement or rejection, has paradoxically done more to remove the shackles of the civil war from this House and from Irish politics than anything else could have done.  This will not be easy in the short term.  It will be difficult at any stage but the task we have in opposing not only this appointment but the appointment of the Government subsequently and the policies which are to emerge from that Government will be to turn Irish politics on its axis.  That is what I believe we will be able to do eventually.</P>

      <P>This debate is one of the most important that I have participated in during my ten years in the House.  We have a constitutional duty to discharge in deciding whether the man whose name has been put before us today is suitable to hold the most powerful office in the land.  In essence, the debate is about personal suitability and there is no point in saying that we should not bring personalities into it.  We are being asked today to confer on one man a position of immense power, a power which can be exercised secretly.  Many of the most important decisions of a Taoiseach do not emerge publicly until long after they have been taken and implemented, if indeed they ever emerge at all in a manner that can be attributable to that person. The decisions and the standards of the new Taoiseach will influence not only those Ministers over whom he will preside and over whom he will have the immense power of being in a position to sack them, but over the entire public service which constitutes almost half of our total economy and activity.  His decisions and his standards will influence that immensely important aspect of the lives of all of us.</P>

    <P>I would point out to those people who are claiming that Deputy Haughey is now leader of the Irish people that he is not Taoiseach and will not be Taoiseach until this Dáil has voted to make him Taoiseach.  Anything that happens behind the closed doors of any party <Col N="1409" /> room cannot pre-empt the open, public and conclusive decision of this House. The Dáil is being asked to give Deputy Haughey the power to act as trustee for the Irish people, to make decisions on their behalf on matters that could affect not only economic prosperity but life and death.  The test of trustworthiness and conscientiousness for the holder of such a post, for the person who exercises such powers, is immeasurably higher than the test of trustworthiness and conscientiousness for a holder of any lesser post.  That it is right at this stage before the decision is made to question the trustworthiness and conscientiousness of anyone put forward for that office should be so obvious that it should not require to be stated in this House but some people outside the House apparently have questioned the need for this debate and the need for these questions to be answered.  I believe it necessary to have this debate.</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Haughey meet the requirements of a holder of the office of Taoiseach?  Unfortunately, there is only one place to which one can look for evidence and that is to his past record. No other evidence is available.  No one knows for sure what he will do in the future.  No one knows his inner thoughts. The only source of knowledge as to his suitability for the office is his past record.</P>
    <P>This is not dragging up the past.  It is looking in the only place where one can look for evidence of the present and future wisdom of appointing this man as Taoiseach.  To say that Deputy Haughey's past record is irrelevant is as wrong as it would be to say that the past record of Teddy Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, John Connolly or Richard Nixon would be irrelevant to their candidacy to hold the Presidency of the United States of America.  Would the electorate and Congress of the United States say that the past should be forgotten and that sleeping dogs should be let lie?  I do not believe they would.  I do not believe that Members of Dáil Éireann have any less of a duty to scrutinise our leaders and their suitability than do the congress and legislatures of other states.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1410" /> I believe there is one area where it can be proved on the basis of the public record that in the exercise of his power as Minister for Finance Deputy Haughey acted without the qualities, and with clear evidence of lack of the qualities, of judgment, conscientiousness and trust required not only of the holder of the office of Minister for Finance but most certainly of the holder of the office of Taoiseach.  In order to demonstrate this assertion I intend to refer to the public record.  Those who read the report of this debate can judge what I have to say and the assertions I am making not on my word but on the sources I am quoting.</P>
    <P>On 16 August 1969 the Government decided &ldquo;That a sum of money, the amount and channel of disbursement of which would be determined by the Minister for Finance should be made available from the Exchequer to provide aid for the victims of the current unrest in the Six Counties&rdquo;.  Let us note the words &ldquo;The amount and channel of disbursement of which would be determined by the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  The Minister for Finance on that occasion was Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <P>What happened to the money?  I am quoting from page 49 of the report dealing with the conclusions of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It stated that £105,766 5s 9d was spent.  Of this money which was voted for the relief of distress £29,166 12s was actually spent on the relief of distress, £34,850 was possibly spent in Belfast and of the money voted into the charge of Deputy Haughey as Minister for Finance to provide aid for the victims of unrest in the Six Counties £41,499 13s 9d, in the words of the Committee of Public Accounts, was not spent on the relief of distress.</P>
    <P>Where did that £41,000 go?  The Committee found that of this money of which Deputy Haughey was in charge a sum of £500 went to Captain Kelly, £35,149 13s 9d was paid into the account of George Dixon and two sums, £4,500 and £1,350, were paid into the account of Ann O'Brien, the first sum <Col N="1411" /> for use in relation to a publication known as <i>The Voice of the North</i> and the rest was not for any specific purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Who was George Dixon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the question.  Page 37 of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts stated &ldquo;It has not been possible to identify George Dixon&rdquo;.  Captain Kelly stated in evidence that he knew who George Dixon was but he refused to identify him.  The inquiries of the Committee of Public Accounts were not able to discover who was George Dixon but I presume if anybody knows his identity it is the man who had charge of the payment of the money into his account and that man is Deputy Charles Haughey whom it is proposed that we elect as Taoiseach.  Page 45 of the report of the Committee stated that &ldquo;Captain Kelly in his evidence stated that moneys drawn from the George Dixon account were used mainly in connection with the purchase of arms&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In conclusion that is the Minister who was responsible for £105,000, of which two-thirds was never accounted for properly and of which there is at least a very strong suspicion that a substantial part of it was paid for the purchase of arms, a man who was less than careful in the exercise of his responsibilities.  It is worth reminding the House that the person who accepts the seal of office as Minister accepts a very high responsibility. He accepts not only responsibility for his own personal activities but also responsibility to this House for the acts of his subordinates.  In terms of ministerial responsibility, Deputy Charles Haughey as Minister for Finance was responsible to this House for the expenditure of the £100,000 that was given into his care as a trustee of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one were a Minister and were given £100,000 to spend on the relief of distress in Northern Ireland in relation to a matter which was politically sensitive, would one allow the money to be paid into the account of a man who has never <Col N="1412" /> been identified?  If the money were paid into the account of such a man, would one not inquire who he was and what he was doing with it?  If one did not inquire who he was and what he was doing with the money, would one not feel that one was not doing one's duty?  I wonder why Deputy Haughey did not inquire.  If he did inquire, I wonder what he found out. He never told us if he did inquire or what he found out and I hope that he will do so in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to ask this House to give the responsibility for the expenditure of £3,000 million, which is the amount of money spent by the Government each year, to a man who failed to look after the expenditure of £100,000. Anyone who feels that what Deputy Haughey did was understandable; that he at all times behaved in good faith; that the facts will never come to light and that he should be given the benefit of the doubt, might do well to refer to the words of the man who proposed him as Taoiseach.  I am quoting from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 26 October 1970.  When he was in New York, Deputy Lynch, who is still Taoiseach, was reported as follows:</P>
    <P>The Ministers had been sacked because he... could not fully rely on them.</P>
    <P>One of the Ministers referred to is now being proposed as Taoiseach.  Deputy Lynch is further reported as follows:</P>
    <P>While he was not questioning the judicial acquittal, there had been an attempt to import arms illegally. There was a legal method of importing arms, as was well known.  His former colleagues had not kept him informed, and there was therefore lack of mutual trust and confidence.</P>
    <P>We have Deputy Lynch's word that Deputy Haughey, into whose charge the £100,000 was given, did not keep his Taoiseach informed of what was being done with the money.  If Deputy Haughey did not keep Deputy Lynch informed of what he was doing with the money, what standards will he set for the Ministers he proposes to appoint within the next few hours.  Will they feel bound <Col N="1413" /> to keep him informed in the manner in which he kept his Taoiseach informed?</P>
    <P>On the basis of the documentary evidence which I have quoted there is sufficient evidence not to accept Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach.  There are 147 other Members in this House, any one of whom could be put forward for office. Few, if any, Members of this House have a record which could be documented in the same way.  There are few people against whom documented evidence of carelessness can be found.  As we have the choice of other men, I believe that we should not accept Deputy Haughey. These issues have been raised by me because I believe that this is the time and place to raise them.  It will be too late to raise these matters when Deputy Haughey becomes Taoiseach.  I would not raise them at that stage unless some further developments make them relevant again.  The time to raise such matters is now.  We would not be doing our duty if we failed to raise these matters.</P>
    <P>If the questions which I have raised are not answered to the people's satisfaction, we would be morally wrong to allow a man over whom such a question-mark hangs to become Taoiseach.  In this debate or in the one that follows, Deputy Haughey can either clear the doubts once and for all by answering the questions raised or he can admit openly and humbly that he acted carelessly and in a manner unfitting a Minister and will never do so again.  When he has done this the past will be past.  Until such an admission is made, the past will always be with Deputy Haughey because he will be the trustee of the Irish people.  It is not sufficient that a man should act as a trustee unless questions of this nature, so germane to the central functions of the office, have been conclusively answered.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  We have had a reasonably lengthy debate and I hope that the debate on the members of the Cabinet later will permit us to take up perhaps the most serious aspect of today's proceedings, namely, the policies needed to restore confidence in the country.  The most serious critique of <Col N="1414" /> this administration will not be provided by anything said here today&mdash;the result of what we are being asked to decide is a foregone conclusion&mdash;but will be provided in the months ahead.  It will be provided by the actions and the calibre of the men and women in the new Cabinet and, above all, it will be provided by the policies to be pursued by that administation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We will discuss that on the next item, when we reach it.  There is but one item before the House now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but consequences follow from the decision reached on that item.  My basic reason for opposing the appointment of the new Leader of Fianna Fáil as Taoiseach is that nothing in his past career suggests that he has anything radically different to offer from the economic policies which have been pursued by the administration presided over by the outgoing Taoiseach.  There is nothing in Deputy Haughey's past career to suggest that in economics he differs radically from the policies pursued by the last administration.  Suggestions have been made that the Taoiseach designate disagrees with the outgoing Minister for Economic Planning and Development. There has been much talk of disagreement between the Taoiseach designate and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development but one does not know whether this is based on differing approaches to our economic policies or whether it is simply part of the rivalry of the recent succession race within the Government party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said of the new Leader of Fianna Fáil by his defenders that he has been less than happy with the economic policies pursued since 1977.  One does not know and no certain answer can be given to statements made on his behalf. The new Leader of Fianna Fáil was as happy as any other member of the outgoing Cabinet in 1977 to take office on the strength of the market-researched policies calculatedly chosen to make the maximum appeal to the significant sectors <Col N="1415" /> of the electorate that brought that administration to office.  Whether his defenders say he was in disagreement or not, he was happy to take the benefit at that time of those policies.  The same criticism that can be levelled at the outgoing administration, the primary criticism that they squandered golden economic opportunities in the summer of 1977, can be levelled at the Taoiseach designate because he was a member of that administration.  The Fianna Fáil administration in 1977 inherited an economy returned to growth.  In a profound misread of the economic situation that administration turned on public spending, forgetting that the economic indicators were already set fair, that foreign goods by way of increased imports would be the more likely sequel to their policies of that summer.  The Taoiseach designate participated in those policies without demur.</P>
    <P>The result of those policies was not that new jobs would be provided at home but that foreign factories would benefit from the increased public spending.  The major economic error of the new Government of 1977 was that they got the recovery rhythm of our economy wrong and resulted in increased public spending rather than keeping costs down so that our manufacturing base could expand.  They forgot that the only new jobs that could be sustained were those securely based on a competitive manufacturing industry selling goods at keen rates at home and abroad. As part of the manifesto philosophy that brought them to office they juggled with the taxation code, lightening the burden of the most prosperous category and heightening the sense of grievance of the PAYE majority to an unprecedented degree.  In 1977 they spent with a fanatical abandon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am basing my case on economic policies pursued to date and coming events will test those serious matters.  Now, with world recession spreading all about us, the outgoing administration, or any new one, cannot support by way of public spending our construction industry at a time when it needs support.  When a respectable case can be made for sustaining economic activity at home, we are deprived of that policy option by the election-inspired profligacy of the manifesto.  We await a budget in less than eight weeks having been told by the outgoing Minister for Finance&mdash;whether his policies will be supported or not by the new administration&mdash;that the PAYE majority cannot expect any relief.  The only alternative is increased public borrowing if increased indirect taxation is not to be the result.  If that happens it will have further adverse consequences on the cost of living and, therefore, on wage expectation.</P>
      <P>That is the immediate prospect and the foreseeable result of activities of the new administration.  Limited options are available to them.  Inflation is in double figures with the portents even more threatening for 1980.  Unemployment is alarmingly high&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The reason we are not voting confidence in the Taoiseach designate is that he was a member of the outgoing administration that pursued the policies I have outlined.  We are awaiting the publication of a White Paper on the economy and, presumably, that will record the failure to achieve the <Col N="1417" /> published targets suggested for employment this year.  We have a situation where industrial relations were never worse.  Buses did not run today and, as far as I know, nobody has sought, on behalf of the Government, to get the parties involved in that dispute to meet.</P>

I am making the very valid point, in relation to that likely policy of his to be pursued, that well he might express concern&mdash;it is a prime issue&mdash;but that I can have little confidence that the solution lies in the direction indicated by the Taoiseach designate as desirable, namely, that we should adopt legislative changes and that a solution would lie on that road.  I would earnestly counsel him that I can have no confidence that proposed action along those lines would be successful.  I have long maintained in relation to that subject mentioned by the new Leader of the Government party&mdash;industrial relations, and how they may be mended&mdash;that their worsening state cannot be attributable to reasons confined to the four walls of industry.  I believe that a major element fuelling the discontent in industry and in the public service, and which has flowed over into strikes, has been the sharply felt sense of injustice on the part of the majority of PAYE wage and salary earners at what they feel to be their over-taxed state.</P>

      <P>At any rate, the nominee for Taoiseach, as a member of the outgoing administration, has contributed to the budgetary policy of that Cabinet, to the budgetary policy that has led to what can be described today, without exaggeration, as a revolt of taxpayers, leading to unprecedented public demonstrations this year and to more in prospect in coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Tributes have been paid to the Taoiseach designate's competence in administration. Certainly, he has vast experience of management in several Government Departments.  But a competence in administration, valuable though that quality may be, is not the quality chiefly to be sought in the Taoiseach leading the country at this difficult time.  What the country needs now is not a Taoiseach chosen from the ranks of this outgoing administration whose policies have so singularly failed.  What the country needs now is a Taoiseach with a fresh mandate direct from the people, rather than the 82 Deputies opposite.</P>

      <P>It is an exaggeration, <Col N="1420" /> however, to say that the mandate comes even from the 82 Deputies opposite. Beyond a suggestion of personal difference with the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, to my knowledge the Taoiseach designate has not been in any marked disagreement with the economic policies which have failed so singularly.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach designate had last contact with the management of economic policy in this State in the late sixties when growth was the order of the day, the era of cheap energy and unlimited energy sources.  Now the whole world is in recession.  Energy will never be cheap again.  I would submit that his expertise in the economic area belonged to a different era and different qualities are required in the next decade.  To confront successfully the complex of economic problems facing us as a country, to confront them with any hope of success, something more than a change in the leadership of Fianna Fáil is needed.  Settling the parliamentary problems of Fianna Fáil is an easier task than fulfilling the awesome responsibility of steering our economy in a crisis-filled world, in a world of recession.  There is no evidence to suggest that the Taoiseach designate appreciates either the magnitude of that task, or that he accepts that a change of economic policies of a radical kind is required.</P>

      <P>On 5 July 1977 the Dáil met and Deputy Vivion de Valera proposed that Deputy Jack Lynch be made Taoiseach, and he said:</P>
      <P>Molaim duit, a Cheann Comhairle, Seán Ó Loinsigh agus molaim go n-ainmneoidh an Dáil é le dul ós comhair an Uachtaráin le bheith againn mar Thaoiseach agus ceann an Rialtais óir tá sé ceapaithe cheana féin mar Thaoiseach ag muintir na hÉireann.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In seconding this motion that Jack Lynch be our Taoiseach I am only endorsing, <Col N="1421" /> as Deputy de Valera said, the verdict of the Irish people, the verdict of the risen people.</P>
    <P>What we are doing here today is not the verdict of the Irish people.  The Irish people elected Fianna Fáil with 84 seats to this Dáil, with Deputy Jack Lynch as Leader of that party.  I do not think anybody inside&mdash;certainly I do not believe anybody on those benches&mdash;or outside this House believes that if Deputy Jack Lynch had said, in May 1977, that after two and a half years he would be handing over the leadership of Fianna Fáil and the leadership of the Government of this country to Deputy Haughey, this affair would have ended last Friday because it would have been concerned only with the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party and the leadership of the Opposition.  I believe that this is not the verdict of the Irish people.  I do not believe that the Irish people, and I challenge Deputy Haughey&mdash;and in an hour's time he will be Taoiseach&mdash;to seek the verdict of the Irish people in this regard.  I do not believe that the Irish people would endorse him as Taoiseach of this country.</P>
    <P>I am the final speaker today on behalf of my party.  All the reasons have been set out, starting with Deputy FitzGerald, the Leader of Fine Gael, followed by other speakers on behalf of our party, as to why we find it unacceptable for the retiring Taoiseach, as he did this morning, to recommend coldly, in one sentence, the only words spoken on that side of the House today, to Dáil Eireann the name of Deputy Charles J. Haughey as Taoiseach, or words to that effect. Those were the only words spoken on that side of the House today.  There are many reasons that we do not find it acceptable that Deputy Haughey be Taoiseach.  I am convinced my opinion is shared not just by this side of the House but by the people in general.</P>
    <P>The events of May 1970 have been referred to a number of times today.  At that time we know that Deputy Haughey with Deputy Blaney, was sacked from that Government, that they were subsequently <Col N="1422" /> charged before the courts and acquitted.  After that acquittal, in an emotional address to the people gathered outside the courthouse&mdash;as Deputy FitzGerald said this morning&mdash;the present candidate for Taoiseach addressed people as fellow patriots and said that those who had been responsible for bringing him before the courts of the land had only one honourable course open to them.  The then Taoiseach, the Taoiseach who is retiring today and who was in America at the time, was asked about this.</P>
    <P>His reply was: &ldquo;There has been a decision of the court, one of acquittal on a charge of conspiracy but nevertheless there was an attempt to import arms and all the people who were charged were concerned in that attempt.&rdquo;  Now, nine years later, we are asked in this House in relation to this same man, who, according to the Leader of the Government at that time, was concerned in this attempt to import arms, to vote confidence in him as Taoiseach of the country.  It cannot be done by me.  I believe there are others across the floor from me who do not wish to do it either but party loyalty is a very strong thing in this country. There is scant history of people breaking ranks.</P>
    <P>I understand that loyalty and I understand the feeling of people who think that they can prevent more harm being done by staying in and diluting the mix. That is not for us.  This agitation against Deputy Jack Lynch has been going on for some time.  We have the word in the last few days of one of the outgoing Ministers, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, when he said in an interview on the radio: &ldquo;It is true that we have fringe elements who were constantly inclined to knife at our former Leader.&rdquo;  I do not believe that anybody is in any doubt who was directing those fringe elements who were constantly trying to knife at our former Leader, which Deputy D. Gallagher referred to.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that most of the people in the House, commentators outside it or the general public have any doubt that for ten years now there has been constant sniping, conspiracy and a helping <Col N="1423" /> hand to anybody, inside or outside the Fianna Fáil Party, who would help to bring down the outgoing Taoiseach.  A lot of this, understandably, found a response in some Deputies who were under threat&mdash;because there were so many Fianna Fáil Deputies over there&mdash;about their seats.  It is understandable that some of them would not fully tease out the implications of what they were doing and would join in because they hoped it would have the bonus of saving their seats.</P>
    <P>The comment of some Fianna Fáil Deputies coming out of the party meeting last Friday was: &ldquo;We voted to save our seats.&rdquo;  This is their idealism and patriotism.  Is this what the history of Ireland was about?  The party of idealism, republicanism and patriotism said: &ldquo;We voted to save our seats.&rdquo; Many of the Deputies on the other side must be very proud of themselves.  They were led in this revolt by the Sancho Panza Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who three times in a broadcast on Sunday repeated that he had voted for the man he thought had the best chance of leading the party into the next general election.</P>

      <P>Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, three times said that he voted for <Col N="1424" /> the man he thought was best for the party and who would bring them through the next general election.  One of the papers this morning said that we must remember when we are voting here today that the eyes of the world are on us, that the man we elect will have to go out and represent the country.  I did not hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who should be more conscious of the image of the country than most Deputies in the House, make any reference last Sunday to the image of Ireland abroad and the necessity for electing a man who would be able to represent this country abroad.  Surely the criterion which should be applied is that the man who is elected here today is capable of representing the country abroad, of leading the House and the people of Ireland.  This is not the case according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who said his only qualities need be that he should be capable of leading Fianna Fáil into the next general election.</P>
      <P>Has politics in Ireland descended to that?  Is that what 1798 and Davis, so often quoted by Deputies in this House, is all about, leading Fianna Fáil into the next general election?  This is a sorry day for Dáil Éireann.  It puts the nail in the coffin of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed seeing all day today men for whom I had a lot of respect, slithering along the seats opposite currying favour with the Taoiseach-designate.  I was disappointed in many of the people for whom I had a lot of respect up to this.  This was the sordid pay-off.  In 1977 this party did not contest the election of Deputy Jack Lynch as Taoiseach because we accepted that it was the verdict of the Irish people, that Fianna Fáil, given 84 seats, would form the Government under the leadership of Deputy Jack Lynch.  I do not accept the nomination of Deputy Charles Haughey as Taoiseach.  That is the reason we are voting against the <Col N="1425" /> proposition of Deputy Jack Lynch, when he said he recommended to Dáil Éireann that Deputy Charles Haughey be made Taoiseach.  We are concerned only with the Taoiseach designate now.  When he comes back from the Phoenix Park and announces his Government, I can assure him, and whoever are nominated to that Government, that they will have two-and-a-half years of a very difficult passage through this House from the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I conclude, as I started, by saying that this is not the verdict of the Irish people voting in a General Election in 1977.  It has happened twice before that there was a change of Taoiseach in the middle of a Dáil run&mdash;it happened with Deputy Seán Lemass in 1959 and with the present <Col N="1426" /> Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, in 1966.  On each occasion it could be accepted that there was continuity there, and that he had been voted for in the previous election; that is not so in this case.  As has been said, this would be the seventh Taoiseach, the seventh Head of Government of this country, and the present nominee for this post is not of the same calibre, or in the same tradition nor does he command the same respect from the members of his own party as all the other Taoiseachs.  The continuity of which I spoke would have been there with other members of the outgoing administration, whom I shall not name, but is not there now.  For that reason, we oppose the nomination of Deputy Charles Haughey as Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is now the Taoiseach and the criticisms of his suitability put before the House by speakers on this side earlier this evening have been clearly stated.  It is not my intention to go through them.  This Government could be an imaginative Government.  It has shortcomings, which I will deal with in the course of my contribution, but it is not a doomsday situation. There are many avenues open to it whereby a completely new society can develop in this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What concerns me most about the situation at this stage is that it is really a new captain of the same team bringing on the travelling reserves for the second half.  That is just about the sum total of <Col N="1432" /> it.  I do not have that much confidence in the present administration nor do I see that administration holding the confidence which the previous administration lost in such a short time.  That is not without reason.  Eighty-four Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party were elected to this House on the pretence of creating a society which, as the seconder of the motion to appoint Deputy Jack Lynch as Taoiseach two and a half years ago said, was the voice of a risen people.  The voice of the risen people has spoken and has stated clearly and without ambiguity that what they promised in 1977 they have not fulfilled.  They are there by dishonest promises.  I do not believe, with all the respect I have for the former Taoiseach, that he had the right to resign as Taoiseach and not go the full distance, dissolve the Dáil and seek a new mandate.  That is what democracy is about.  This is not a democratic decision that Dáil Éireann has been asked to endorse. It is a decision based on a political system whereby a Government in office holding the majority of seats can ignore the wishes of the electorate and the wishes of the Opposition and do what they think best, as one Deputy said coming out of the Fianna Fáil meeting, and vote for the retention of their seats.  That is a sham democracy.  If democracy is what I believe it is, this Government do not have a mandate from the people.  I question its being in office at this very moment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will run away from the manifesto as if he was never part of it. He can criticise it, as most of us have done.  Many people who believed, when they voted for the 84 Fianna Fáil Deputies and the other candidates for the Fianna Fáil Party in the 1977 General Election, that every aspect of the document placed before them for endorsement in the ballot boxes in June 1977 would be implemented and that we were beginning a new era of politics were sadly disillusioned.</P>
    <P>The first indication of the loss of confidence by the Government was in the fundamental area of the present Taoiseach's own responsibility as Minister for Health when 3,000 skirts, <Col N="1433" /> because that is what they were&mdash;petticoats&mdash;walked down O'Connell Street. Deputy Haughey did not know how to deal with them.  He can handle the minority of Deputies on the Opposition benches because he treats them with contempt.  This Parliament ceased to be a Parliament because he ignored our advice and treated us with the utmost contempt and ignored everything we said until 3,000 nurses walked on the streets of Dublin.  That very day I said to some of my colleagues that these girls, in their innocence, did not know what they were starting in this part of Ireland, because other people would be following.  Within a few weeks PAYE workers came on the streets of Dublin in unprecedented numbers to protest against a Government that came into office by dishonest practice. That is how they are there.  That will be seen in the general election and they will be judged by that.</P>
    <P>I am not terribly interested in who won the election for leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party or who is elected Taoiseach this evening.  A certain amount of attention must be paid to it. As far as I am concerned, I believe they had the privilege of electing the next leader of the Opposition.  The quicker they face that reality the sooner the Irish people, North and South of the Border, will realise that we want a Government that will tell us the truth.  We want honest leadership, no matter how difficult it is, and we must get it.  I am not sure that the Taoiseach will be criticising the manifesto for the reasons which I and other members of my party will be.</P>

      <P>To every Deputy sitting on the Government benches, every newly-appointed Minister, and Ministers who <Col N="1434" /> have been dropped, we must extend a certain amount of sympathy&mdash;sympathy to those who believe in their political convictions and then did not get an opportunity to see them through to their fulfilment. The document which brought the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, into Government in 1977 and which now has given us a new Government is a dishonest one.  It promised things which they knew they could not fulfil.  I have described it as a corrupt document, because corruption is promising to give someone something so that one can benefit oneself.  The only people who benefited by the 1977 manifesto are the Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators, the Cabinet and junior Ministers.</P>
      <P>I turn now to Northern Ireland, which will loom largely on the horizon and which has inspired much public comment in our newspapers since the events of last weekend.  I believe that, with all the talk by Fianna Fáil about initiative, a British declaration of intention to withdraw and a British declaration encouraging Irish unity, the first initiative the Taoiseach should take is to teach some of his Deputies the real meaning of republicanism and to understand that Ireland comprises the Irish and not the mythological ideal concept that they have: we are the real republicans.  I often heard that from members of Fianna Fáil, from Government Ministers and back bench Deputies in the two by-elections which have helped to bring about a grave situation in this House.  I heard Fianna Fáil Deputies saying from platforms that they were the real republicans or, just to change that a little, &ldquo;We are the super Irish,&rdquo; this group of people whose only claim to power is that some of them were born into Fianna Fáil families and happened to be elected on a Fianna Fáil ticket.  That is about their only commitment to the unity of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that when the Taoiseach seriously gets down to talking about the unity of the Irish people he will teach some of the back bench members of his party some manners.  Deputy Lynch, I believe, will be best remembered for that; <Col N="1435" /> he tried to change the direction of that party and with a great deal of success.  It is no secret that although many who are Loyalist in the extreme in Northern Ireland did not like him, to put it mildly, many were saying, &ldquo;He has a difficult team to handle and he is doing his best.&rdquo; I hope the present Taoiseach will not ignore the direction in which Deputy Lynch was going because from the point of view of concensus politics he was speaking the language of Northern Ireland when he got a chance to speak that language, certainly not very far from the position I hold.  There are Members opposite who will vouch for the fact that privately in conversation over the past three or four weeks or months I was saying to them that I agreed with the statements of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misunderstood on this issue.  I do not want to pay empty tributes to a fallen leader.  I have more respect for the man who has just stepped down than to indulge in such an idle exercise. It is more serious than that.  As Deputy Cluskey said today, there are 2,000 Irish people dead and over 20,000 maimed and, according to the latest figures I heard, over £200 million worth of damage done in Northern Ireland. There is hate between neighbourhoods which are divided only by a thin line of corrugated iron sheets and in such circumstances I do not believe I would be fulfilling my duty as a public representative by trying to placate or pander to the feelings of some members of the Fianna Fáil Party by paying idle tribute to a fallen leader.  That is not my intention.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to a man of whom history will record that we were glad to have him as Taoiseach in this part of Ireland in a very difficult period. I mean that because he had difficulties that this party or the Labour Party did not have.  He tried to hold his party together.  I hope that when the present Taoiseach sits down with the Minister for Foreign Affairs to work out their attitudes on Northern Ireland they will take off the demand republican spectacles some of them are wearing&mdash;&ldquo;We <Col N="1436" /> are the real republicans&rdquo;&mdash;because as I see it Unionism will never unite the Northern Ireland people.  In the North there are 500,000 who are called Catholics or nationalists or some other name who will never be Unionists and Unionism will never unite them no matter what benefits the British Government may hand to them, no matter what economic advantages there are in living in Northern Ireland, whether it is living in a better house or having more security in a job or better health services; they will never become Unionists.  There is a lesson in that for us to indicate that there are one million people north of the Border who will never become republicans. That is a bitter pill for some members of the party opposite to swallow.</P>
    <P>I want to share with other people in Ireland the common name of being Irish and Fianna Fáil had better ask themselves if they really believe in the unity of the Irish people.  If they ask themselves that question they had better follow it through and say, &ldquo;If you call yourself Irish&rdquo; then there are one million people north of the Border who will share that common name with you.  If they call themselves &ldquo;the real republican party&rdquo;, there are one million people in Northern Ireland who will never identify with that.</P>
    <P>Whether that is a palatable thing for me to say and for them to hear, whether it is politically advisable to say it, that is as I see it.  If we believe in peaceful co-operation, in the reconciliation of Irish people and in taking death off the streets in another part of this island that is not our responsibility, there is an obligation on us to change our attitude.  Responsibility for that change in attitude at present rests completely on the desk of the new Taoiseach.  While I do not have the authority to say this I think it will follow that if the new Taoiseach were to follow policies conducive to Irish unity, policies that would bring the two traditions of this island together in peaceful co-operation and harmony he would receive the co-operation of this party.  I would advocate and strongly recommend that. The history of Irish Ireland did not begin in 1926 in the Rotunda when Fianna <Col N="1437" /> Fáil members came together to start a Fianna Fáil Party: nor did it start in 1931 when the Fine Gael Party, the former Cumann na nGaedheal Party, broke with the then Sinn Féin element.  Neither did it start in 1916 and we had better cut out the nonsense about patriotic leaders and about having divine rights and divine guidance and inspiration&mdash;&ldquo;We have the message from the Almighty that we and we alone have the answers.&rdquo;. They do not; neither do we, because there are one million people north of the Border who are not listening to that kind of nonsense and it is they alone who hold the key to Irish unity, a staggering thought for those people who thump their chests in graveyards in southern Ireland and make glowing speeches to tombstones.  In dealing with this human tragedy in Ireland and in trying to gain consent from his own party&mdash;because that is the first thing he must do&mdash;the Taoiseach would have won the respect not only of this side of the House but of all the people.  May I say something to him directly?</P>

      <P>Through the Chair may I say that there is nothing personal in this because in 1961 when I was first elected as a Deputy, Deputy Haughey was the first Minister I met.  If he cannot remember that visit to his office I remember it very well and we have always been friends since.  We never shared the same politics.  I have always admired him for certain things, but there is one thing for which I never admired him and that was remaining silent for the past nine years.</P>

      <P>It seems a great joke to him but it is very sad that, just one fortnight before Christmas when I talk about the misfortunes of people in County Donegal, the only response I can get from Deputy Power, a newly <Col N="1439" /> promoted Minister, is the question &ldquo;Are there foxes in them?&rdquo; There may not be foxes but it is a fact that there are people in County Donegal and all over Ireland who are on the housing lists of the local authorities who will never get a local authority house.  What happened in County Donegal?  Donegal County Council projected 1,000 houses to be built in the next four years and, knowing it would take four years to build 1,000 houses, they applied for one quarter of the money, £2,300,000.  What did Deputy Barrett give them?  He gave them £250,000.  In other words, it will be 40 years before these houses are built. That is the kind of team that Deputy Haughey has brought in to continue the implementation of this mandate given by the people in 1977 saying that a new team led by Jack Lynch would implement this document.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins is still in charge of Justice.  I know that Deputy Collins has his heart in the right place.

      <P>The Minister has a job to do.  He needs all the good luck, probably a first class miracle, and all the suave beautiful English that he displays in the House.  But there are thousands of young children in secondary schools complaining about the lack of facilities; there are thousands of young students in regional technical colleges protesting about the lack of facilities; there are thousands of students in our universities clamouring for better grant assistance.  It puzzles me how the Minister for Education, who failed to tackle these things in the last two and a half years, has been allowed to stay in that office.  I attended a funeral in Donegal yesterday.  I had to leave it sooner than I had intended.  One of the people at the funeral was a teacher.  He asked me who would be Taoiseach.  I told him Deputy Haughey, and he said: &ldquo;I would put up with him if he would take John Wilson out of Education&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a rather unusual day in the history of Leinster House.  Hard things were said, possibly things that needed to be said.  Deputy Haughey is now Taoiseach and I wish him well.  I wish him all the luck he will <Col N="1442" /> need to bring the country back to the position it was in when Fianna Fáil took over two and a half years ago.  Deputies referred to the fact that the Government have reached half time, and all the rest of it.  We have Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach, as captain with his 14 men, making it a 15-man Gaelic football team. At half time, almost two and a half years after being elected, with two and a half years to go, they were being slaughtered, and for that reason among others, Fianna Fáil decided that the captain, Deputy Jack Lynch, must go to be replaced by Deputy Haughey.</P>
      <P>What I find most remarkable is that over the last few days the man who had got the biggest majority ever got by a Taoiseach, the man who got votes from people who would never have voted for Fianna Fáil if it were not for Jack Lynch, was being spoken of like this by Deputies and Senators: &ldquo;It was not Fianna Fáil that landed us in the terrible trouble we are in, economically and otherwise, it was Jack Lynch&rdquo;.  Already he is being sold down the river by the same people who knelt as he passed until two or three days ago.</P>
      <P>This is the sort of loyalty the Taoiseach can expect from the men behind him, and I would give him a little more advice than did Deputy Harte.  I would advise him to keep his eyes on them and to wear some kind of protection on his back.</P>
      <P>The captain of the team was changed and by a rather unusual arrangement the new captain introduced a new team, consisting of nine of the failures in the old team, nine members who had been doing very badly&mdash;that may be unfair, but several of them had been doing badly. He brought two of the juniors on and took the others from the back benches. He paraded them in front of this House and said: &ldquo;Now, look what I have got. This is the team who will run the country for the next two and a half years and they will win the next election&rdquo;.  That is what we were told on the radio this evening by some of the back benchers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have before us tonight a group most of whom are decent people.  From <Col N="1443" /> my experience of 25 years in this House I can say that most Deputies have been decent men and women.  Having said that, it is fair to point out that the activities of the members of this Government have not been up to what one would expect from any Minister of any Government.  We have had the Taoiseach juggling around, taking a square peg out of an oblong hole in which it did not fit and putting it into a round hole.</P>
    <P>That will not improve the situation. We have too many of those in this Government.  We have members who have been abject failures.  The Taoiseach is a very intelligent man who knows what is happening and he must have heard the talk, he must have seen for himself that some of those in the previous Cabinet were a complete disaster. I do not know how on earth the Taoiseach expects to be able to run the country as it should be run with this array of talent he has got.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be personal.  I do not want to get into an argument with anybody across the floor of the House, because that sort of thing does not help. However, it is only right to point out that there are Departments of State which have not been doing their jobs.  During my period as Minister I found out two things pretty quickly.  The two things a Minister requires is, first of all, to know his Department.  He must be able to control his Department.  He must not stay at home playing golf or riding a horse or dashing around the country doing something else.  If he is a Minister, he must be in his Department seeing that the job is done.  He should not claim the kudos any civil servants get and blame the civil servants if they fail.  It is his job and not that of anybody else.  I should like to tell the Taoiseach that there are a few of his team who need a few lessons in that regard.</P>
    <P>A Minister also needs to know the kind of cash the Department will require and he or she must be able to get that money if at all possible.  One of the biggest problems the present Taoiseach will have is extreme difficulty to get the <Col N="1444" /> Minister for Finance&mdash;the new Minister takes over a Department which is new to him and a budget in the main prepared by the outgoing Minister with the help of his colleagues&mdash;to say whether the type of money required will be available.  This is not a happy augury for the future of the country.</P>
    <P>I have said that I do not want to be personal, but I wish to point out that there are a number of Departments in that position.  I was in the Department of Local Government.  Its name was changed to the Department of the Environment, but its drive was also changed.  I have the greatest respect personally for the present Minister, but when I go around the country and find that local authorities who were building 100 to 150 houses two-and-a-half years ago are in 1979 getting enough money to build only 50 houses, I know something is wrong with the Department.  I am telling the present holder of the office that it is his job to ensure that that position will be improved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte was right a few moments ago when he said that thousands of people, thousands of families throughout the country, have not a hope of ever having homes of their own unless the stewards give a lead.  In the past two-and-a-half years that lead has not been given.  Dublin Corporation need 6,000 houses, and we know why.  The money is not being made available and everybody will have to put the screws on the Minister for Finance to find that money. What has that Minister been doing?  The Government have been borrowing so much that it is almost impossible for them to borrow any more without putting on taxation to pay for it.  We are all adults and we know we cannot buy something unless we have the money to pay for it.  Services cannot be provided without the money being available.</P>
    <P>We can go back to the Fianna Fáil manifesto, which, in my opinion, created all this trouble.  The manifesto contained a large number of lavish promises, things that were to be done, to use the former Taoiseach's word, &ldquo;immediately&rdquo;.  On television the night before the last <Col N="1445" /> general election he was to remove the unemployment queues immediately. Everything was to be done immediately. What have we got?  We have one Minister looking at another anxious to get his job because it cannot be any worse than the one he is in, and it might be a little better.</P>
    <P>All this creates a difficult problem.  We have labour troubles.  I was a trade union official for 30 years and therefore I know from the Government side and the trade union official side what makes that section tick.  It is not good enough for Ministers to keep their heads down when there are widespread strikes and stoppages of work in the country in the hope that something will happen which will help to clear them up.  At present thousands of people are trudging backwards and forwards to and from work because there is no means of public transport.  I would be the first to say that the situation where people go on unofficial strike is wrong.  Employers as well as trade unionists will have to be a lot more careful and intent on reaching agreement in order to prevent this rash of unofficial strikes in which, after all, fellow-workers of the strikers are the first people to suffer. The Minister responsible for the Department in which the strike occurs and the Minister for Labour each has the onus on him to do everything that he can possibly do to clear up a strike and bring about a resumption of work.  Deputy Fitzgerald will forgive me if I say to him that whilst he commented here tonight on Paddy Harte's suggestion that he has not the solution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I never heard Deputy <Col N="1446" /> Fitzgerald make a constructive comment in this House during the years that he was in Opposition.  He was the little terrier who came in in order to cause as much annoyance as he could and he talked about peddling gloom.  He was the one person who could be depended upon to peddle gloom here.  No matter how good things were he was the person to pour cold water on them.  I do not want to develop into the type of Opposition Deputy that Deputy Fitzgerald was because I am not peddling gloom tonight for the purpose of doing so.  I am telling the Taoiseach that he has a tough job before him and he has not improved his position by messing around with some of the people who did not do well in the previous team, instead of attempting to start with a completely new team. Therefore, it is nobody's fault but his own if it blows back in his face.</P>
      <P>I would be less than human if I did not say that I am glad to see at least one of the previous team disappearing.  I compliment the Deputy who is taking over as Minister for Defence.  Deputy Faulkner is a decent man, whilst he has been a disaster in the Ministries he has held up to now.  At the same time he will be an improvement&mdash;he must be an improvement&mdash;in the Department of Defence.  The mere fact that he was not doing a good job does not mean that he is not a decent man.  He is, and it is grand to see him in there and I wish him well now.  At least the post will not be several weeks late and we will not be looking to see if Deputy Faulkner is around and may be going to Dublin and will bring the letters with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has taken on a few new Ministers and I am sure there will be some changes and surprises in his appointments of Ministers of State.  He must know that one of the toughest jobs is Health and Social Welfare.  I have met the new Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, only since I came into this House.  I have had one or two contacts with him and I have found him extremely courteous.  It does not one bit of harm to a Minister to be courteous. Incidentally, I pay that tribute <Col N="1447" /> also to the Tánaiste because, although I disagree with him on many things, he has been courteous to me and to everybody else who to my knowledge has approached him.  Such things are appreciated. After all, if you are being refused something, at least it is pleasant to be told so in a nice way rather than in the way in which some of the former Ministers were inclined to pass the information along.</P>
    <P>I tell the new Minister for Health and Social Welfare that it might be a good idea to re-issue some instructions to the Departments.  I do not know whether Deputy Haughey as Minister knew of this or was responsible for doing it, but one thing I dislike is making representations for somebody who needs something badly, and I do not really care if I get a reply from the Department saying that the thing had been done but what I resent is finding that some of my colleagues have got a reply telling them that the thing was done, and then a month or six weeks afterwards a letter comes to me saying that this is something which it is thought should not be done by any Government Department. During my period in the Custom House I insisted that everybody who wrote a letter to that Department, whether it be a crackpot or otherwise, should get initially an acknowledgement and eventually exactly the same reply as if they were members of the Government or the Opposition.  Everybody should receive a proper reply.  I understand that a list has been drawn up of who should and should not get a reply.  This is wrong for any Government.  This is the sort of thing which does no good to any of us. When we are in Opposition we can feel the effects of this and when we are in Government at least we should be big enough to ensure that it does not happen to those who are then in Opposition.  The wheels move round and now they are moving and not as slowly as some people may think.</P>
    <P>The new Government should decide on things that need to be done and they must get their priorities right.  I was a little surprised to find that one thing which <Col N="1448" /> seemed to have high priority under the previous Taoiseach&mdash;although he admitted afterwards that he himself never expected to avail of it&mdash;was a Taoiseach's residence which would cost something around £6 million.  That is not a priority for any Government in the present situation of this country.  With the thousands of people looking for council houses and for loans and grants, nobody should spend £6 million on a residence for the Taoiseach, the President or anybody else.  This matter should be looked at. Also when we took office a few years ago we found that an executive jet was being bought which would cost £1 million.  We decided that we would not buy it.  The present Government decided that they would change the situation and that they would buy it.  But there were no gold taps in the £1 million model so they bought a £2 million model, or at least they ordered it.  I say to the Taoiseach that there is plenty of transport between here and Europe without spending £2 million at present on something like that. If somebody has to go from here with a group of officials to any place in Europe where normal jet transport will be going, surely it would be possible for the same cost if not less&mdash;ultimately over a 12-month period most certainly at less cost&mdash;to transport them by that means. These are the sort of things which the people are talking about.  There are those who do not like to say in this House that it is wrong to do this or right to do that.  I say to the new Government with all the sincerity that I can muster that it is their job to try to ensure that the priorities which the Government have are the right priorities and that while we have the number of people who are unemployed at present, the number of people who are sick and the number of old age pensioners many of whom have not got even their arrears of pension for many months, it is wrong for any Government to decide to spend £6 million on what I can only call a luxury.  Maybe I am old-fashioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte referred to Northern Ireland.  We have a new Minister for Foreign Affairs whose responsibility will be to negotiate.  Deputy Lenihan and I <Col N="1449" /> have been friends for many years, but perhaps he should remember that this is not a fruitless thing where one can say something today, something different tomorrow and something different again the next day and get away with it.  During the fisheries negotiations we had the most amazing jumping around with words by Deputy Lenihan.  It was impossible to know from day to day whether he was being misquoted.</P>
    <P>It was incredible that any responsible Minister would have been saying what he was quoted as saying then.  However, Deputy Lenihan may have got away with that but the country cannot afford a Minister who would continue to act in that way.  Therefore, Deputy Lenihan must pay much more attention to facts.  At present there are three different schools of thought in the country in regard to the Six Counties.  There are the people who believe that something will happen eventually which will bring the troubles to an end while there are those who believe that those engaged in the troubles should be forced to stop their activities but attempts in this regard are creating more trouble than would be the case if the situation were ignored.</P>
    <P>There are the third group&mdash;the group into which I would hope the Government and the House would fit&mdash;the people who would attempt to assist on the road towards solving the Six Counties' problem.  There are times when I am annoyed to hear people who live far enough from the Six Counties not to know what is happening there, talk as if they were referring to something that is happening thousands of miles away.  The Border is less than 30 miles from where I live.  I have seen enough of it.  Since my childhood I have been going across that Border and I know the misery that is being caused by certain people down there but the situation is not being helped by statements made sometimes by some Members of this House.  I heard the Taoiseach say that he condemned the Provisional IRA and everything they stood for but he must prove that that is what he means.  However, we must condemn <Col N="1450" /> also those on the other side of the fence&mdash;the people who claim to be supporting the union with Britain and who are every bit as damaging and as dangerous as are the Provisional IRA. We must condemn, too, the certain amount of abuse there is on the part of the British Army in the Six Counties and also on the part of the police and prison officers there who, I suppose being human, tend to react in a way which does not help in regard to the unity of the country.</P>
    <P>We must all realise that what is required here and elsewhere is respect for the right of people to live and enjoy their lives wherever they are.  As I have said before publicly, all the troubles in the Six Counties are not worth the spilling of one drop of human blood because in years to come there will not be anybody to thank those who are responsible for what is happening now.  There will not be anybody to thank the Taoiseach or his Government for becoming involved with people who may be of the opinion now that they have an ally in Government Buildings and that all they need do is to continue to carry on in a way which most of us, including, I am sure, the present Government, will not stand for.</P>
    <P>We have a new Government.  This morning during a debate that was acrimonious there were some statements made which were hurtful but since then the House has voted and decided on who is to be the Taoiseach.  We are a democracy and, consequently, we abide by that decision.  However, I am not satisfied that many of the people whom the Taoiseach has chosen to form the Cabinet are people who will be successful in their respective offices.  But that is not my responsibility, it is a matter for the Taoiseach.  I shall be very interested in hearing the names that are pulled out of the hat for the second string because in time it is likely that they, too, will be looking forward to stepping into the positions in which their seniors are now. Regardless of what may be said here in the heat of the debate or of what may be said outside the House, it is the responsibility of all Irishmen and particularly <Col N="1451" /> those who are Members of the Oireachtas to try to ensure that this country is taken out of the disgraceful position in which it is now and that, going into the eighties, there is a prospect of improvement.  Undoubtedly, 1979 has been a bad year for everyone except, perhaps, Charles Haughey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was the new Taoiseach who referred to the fact that he would be forming a reformed Government but in the list of names he has put before us this evening I find included in that team ten of the same tired old faces that we have been facing across the floor for the past two-and-a-half years.  There are included also three of the former junior Ministers and two new Ministers, Deputies Power and Reynolds.  I am not in a position to comment on the abilities of the last mention two because I have not had the privilege of hearing them in the House since Fianna Fáil's return to power.  Consequently, I must reserve judgment on them.  Since so many of the same faces are being retained, it is worth putting on record that all of these have a responsibility for the infamous manifesto which was the means of Fianna Fáil winning the election in 1977 but what is even worse, they have responsibility for the chaotic condition of the country today.</P>
      <P>I know that the manifesto is old hat, that people are fed up hearing about it. Indeed, there are many in Fianna Fáil who are totally sick of any mention of that document and who would like to forget it.  However, we must bear in mind that it is only on the basis of that manifesto that we can get an idea of the policies which the Government may be implementing in the future.  Clearly, most of the promises of the manifesto have not been implemented and it is on that basis rather than on the personalities of the proposed members of the Government that I shall speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a clear commitment in the manifesto to concentrate on getting the wheels of the economy moving again and on keeping it that way.  There was a commitment to create new jobs and opportunities, <Col N="1452" /> to develop existing employment and to provide security and stability for those who have suffered most from inflation&mdash;the housewife, the elderly and those on fixed incomes.  If we examine the economic record of the Government to date, the record of the people we are asked to endorse as members of the Cabinet, we find that in this year we have borrowed £1,000 million, half of it from abroad, and most disturbing of all is the fact that it is not for capital purposes.  Our external payments deficit has increased from £165 million to £650 million while our external reserves have fallen by 40 per cent from £1,250 million to £750 million.  Largely as a result of the policies of the Coalition Government the inflation rate was brought down to 6 per cent in 1977.  I want to be fair about this matter and I admit that there were some contributory factors in the early days of 1977 when Fianna Fáil came back to power.  According to the latest estimates from the Central Bank and the ESRI, the inflation rate will be 15 or 16 per cent in the current year.  The growth rate has dropped from 6½ per cent to 2½ per cent, again according to the forecasts I mentioned.</P>
    <P>That is the chaotic economic situation existing today.  What must be clearly on the record so far as the reformed Government are concerned is that essentially they are the same men who have created this record today.  It is on that basis we must judge whether they are worthy and merit the support of this House to continue in government at all.</P>
    <P>Again, there was a commitment in the manifesto that there would be a programme of specific policies on which the legislation and reform of the next Government would be based.  Even then we had the word &ldquo;reform&rdquo;&mdash; a word we are now hearing once again.  It would be fair to ask, is this the policy of the reformed Fianna Fáil Government because clearly the commitment to provide specific policies, legislation and reforms to implement the various aspects of the manifesto have not been provided in the past two-and-a-half years?  Let us have it <Col N="1453" /> put on the table if there is now to be an admission that this cannot be done, that there is to be a new direction in the affairs of the nation.  Pending that, I have no option but to judge this new collection of names on their record to date, a record for which they have been responsible.</P>
    <P>It is on that basis one must raise the questions about the commitments made in regard to the multitudinous aspects of the manifesto.  There was the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign that was going to switch 3p in the £ to Irish goods.  There were promises on prices but it is clear from the inflation rate that not only were these promises not kept but they were reversed.  There was the infamous scheme which was supposed to lead to the aboliton of ground rents; there were the promises in regard to family law tribunals; there were various promises in the law reform area; there were promises in regard to the 50-mile limit and many more.  These promises were the basis on which Fianna Fáil came to power and are the basis on which they remain in power.  They have not been kept and it is on that record and on those non-achievements that we have to judge the collection of names put before us for our approval and confidence.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with the Fianna Fáil manifesto I should like to refer to one other promise and to draw this to the attention of the new Taoiseach.  I should like him to make a note of this because I think the House is entitled now to a specific reply.  There was a promise in the manifesto to set up an independent electoral commission to deal with constituency boundaries and put an end to all charges of gerrymandering.  I do not know if the Taoiseach will speak in this debate.  If he does I should like him to deal with that specific point in his contribution or, if not then, at the earliest possible date.  Will he confirm the specific and clear commitment given in the Fianna Fáil document of 1977 that there would be an independent electoral commission to deal with constituency boundaries to end all charges of gerrymandering? <Col N="1454" /> I shall await the reply of the Taoiseach to my question.</P>
    <P>We have to judge these people whose names have been put before this House on the basis of their participation in the preparation of that manifesto and on the state of the nation today.  In recounting their record, are we now to believe that from some untapped source, from some deep spring sunk in the depths of the Fianna Fáil Party, there is to be a new inspiration for these people?  I look on all of them as human beings.  The sins of the past weigh heavily on them.  I am prepared to give them a chance to mend their ways but I can only judge them on the basis of their past record.</P>
    <P>This country has enormous problems, very many of them created by the Fianna Fáil Government who were elected in 1977.  Unfortunately, it is clear that many of the options that would otherwise be open have been narrowed by the profligate, and in many cases not very sensible, manner in which Ministers have exercised their powers.  It is in the interests of the country that these problems be resolutely tackled and resolved.  For that purpose we need a united Government and this is another factor which, even if there were nothing else, would give rise to very considerable hesitation on my part in voting confidence in this regime.  It is clear that despite the needs of this country now for a united Government they are divided in a most fundamental way.  In fact, they are divided in far more respects than would be the case with a normal Government and Opposition.  This goes to the manner of selection of the new Cabinet.  Can we fairly say that this Government were chosen on the basis of merit only?  Was that the criterion which motivated the selection of this new Government?  It is clear to me this was not so.  I may be paying an unexpected tribute to some of the disappointed backbenchers but it is clear to me that this was not the criterion on which this Government were selected.  It was stitched and patched together and can now be compared to a patchwork quilt.</P>
    <P>In the selection of this Government <Col N="1455" /> the record of the retained Ministers does not appear to have been considered.  The overall talent that lies within the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;one has to be honest about this matter and say that there is a lot of talent in that party&mdash;was not considered when putting down this list of names before the House.  When one looks at it it is clear that there were two overriding factors.  The first was the promotion of known supporters within the Fianna Fáil Party.  The second was an attempt to win over the internal opposition in Fianna Fáil.  Those factors concern me because the Opposition want to see the best done for this country.  Therefore, it seriously concerns me that we should have before us tonight a list of names selected on that basis.  It appears that the needs of Fianna Fáil were uppermost in the preparation of this list of names.  I do not say that the needs of the country were entirely neglected but I do say that it is clear from the composition of the new Cabinet that the needs of Fianna Fáil were uppermost.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we end up with a divided Cabinet that is facing the enormous problems of the eighties and I fear for this country facing that prospect.  I believe that the problems which I mentioned can be resolved with resolution, with a degree of initiative on the part of the new Cabinet provided they work together, provided they work individually and provided they produce the results which have been so sadly lacking over the last two-and-a-half years.</P>
    <P>We have difficulties in regard to industrial relations which have been a disaster since 1977.  I see that the outgoing Minister who presided over that disaster is expected to reverse that serious problem.  His record to date does not give me any confidence that he will be able to reverse the frightful trend that has developed over the last few years, resulting in the loss of more man hours in 1979 than for a combination of previous years.  It is clear that there must be action in this area, not insensitive heavy-handed action but action that is going to be based on a proper industrial relations policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> Action is needed in regard to prices.  It is very easy for people to throw up their hands and say, &ldquo;Nothing can be done; everything is going to go up day by day&rdquo;.  However, after the calamity of the oil crisis the previous Government were able to reduce inflation so that in 1977 it was down to 6 per cent.  It has climbed again into double figures and is now up to 15 per cent or 16 per cent.  The point I want to make is that it can be done.  I am putting it to the new Government that it must be done.</P>
    <P>There are problems in many other areas.  In regard to taxes there is a feeling of injustice on the part of the PAYE sector and there is a feeling of injustice on the part of the farmers.  I hope that the new Taoiseach, being a city man, will not forget that there is a deep-seated feeling of injustice.  When he is dealing with the 187,000 farmers, I hope he will not have them sitting down in the street in front of his office.  I hope he remembers that the majority of those farmers are small farmers and that the policy of loading levies on to their creamery cheques, irrespective of whether they come near the taxable bracket, is not justice.</P>
    <P>There are other problems but my basic message is that all these problems can be resolved by an imaginative approach. The first priority of this Government must be to get down to tackling the problems.  There are problems in regard to the frightful traffic chaos in our towns and cities.  There are problems in regard to social welfare.  A breakdown in the system resulted in long delays in the issuing of social welfare cheques to certain categories.  This was a serious matter to the recipients who were awaiting their cheques.  Inside an office in a Government block it does not matter whether cheques are delayed for a week or a month, but if one is sitting in a cold room with little food, one is waiting for the postman's knock.  That problem can be tackled.  It must be a priority of the new Government.  It can be dealt with by the simple process of reducing the bureaucratic steps in that area and getting more efficiency into the Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> The new Government are well aware of the problem in regard to housing.  It is of concern that this area has not received any funds of any consequence in recent years if one takes into account the extra cost of housing and the rate of inflation. One must look at the number of houses built, particularly those for the weaker sections of our community.  There has been a significant reduction in local authority housing.</P>
    <P>All these problems can be resolved. This is a good country, a strong country and it can, with resolution, be brought back from the edge of the precipice to which it has been driven by the present Government since 1977.  It can be rescued from the depths of the virtual depression into which it has sunk. Nothing very radical is needed to do it except a bit of vision, a bit of initiative and a bit of hard work.  It may be too much to hope that the new administration will undertake this task with great resolution when one bears in mind that those who created this mess are not suited to the task of cleaning it up.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the original team which ran the country was not competent.  The public, as far as they had a chance, made a decision on that team in the Cork by-elections. That decision amounted to a yellow card for the entire team; they were put on a warning that their performance was not good enough.  While I can point out to the reformed team what can be done, I cannot expect with any great confidence that they will be able to tackle those problems.  The reformed team is going into action without any popular mandate.  The team which was rejected in the Cork by-elections has been reshuffled but is, essentially, the same.  We do not know whether the manifesto has been jettisoned or rejigged, but we have a new leader and a reformed team.  I do not know whether we have a reformed leader, but his reformed team does not have a popular mandate. We must remember that the 1977 election was fought on the basis of a manifesto which referred to a vision and a strategy for national reconstruction. The manifesto stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> It has been carefully put together and costed for implementation in government by a new team under Jack Lynch as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The reformed team is not under Deputy Jack Lynch.  It is under a new leader and the decent thing for him to do is to go to the country and get a popular mandate.  I am making that suggestion in a serious manner.  The electorate should be given an opportunity to decide what they feel the country needs by way of leadership.  It is my belief that if the people were given that opportunity they would go for a reformed Government, an open Government and one that would be totally reformed in the true sense of the word.  They would go for a Government of new ideas and idealism, a Government of vision led by Deputy Garret FitzGerald.</P>

They are all decent people. However, basically this is the team that has led the country to the state it is in. The team has a new Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has gone from the 50-mile limit which the Government firmly believed in, and it has a new Minister for Defence, who moves from Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;I hope he does not cause a strike in the Army.  In general we have the same faces with a few additions.  In the interest of the country they have my good wishes.  I hope they do a good job but I fear, on the basis of their record to date, that they will not do so.  In the unlikely event that they will do a good job, they have my best wishes.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that this is a one-side debate because two important motions are before the House, the nomination of the Taoiseach and the appointment of members of his Government. <Col N="1459" /> It is usual in this Chamber to get two points of view, that put forward by a Government and that from the Opposition parties.  It must seem surprising to those watching the proceedings from the Public Gallery that this has turned out to be a one-sided debate.  The responsibility for that rests with the Government.  We have not heard any speakers offering to defend the Taoiseach or his appointments. That is a peculiar situation.  A total of 66 Deputies were not nominated as Ministers and one would expect that during the course of the debate on the appointment of the new Government some of them would indicate the alleged advantages of the Government we have had to date.</P>
      <P>I am pleased, to use racing jargon, that Charlie is in the winning enclosure and I wish him well.  We must accept that he has been democratically appointed by the votes of Members of his party. I wish Deputy Lynch and his wife many years to enjoy their retirement.  The decision of the Fianna Fáil Party also means that we have a new Taoiseach who will remain in office until the next general election.  I do not think the sky will fall from the heavens by virtue of Deputy Haughey's appointment.  He has qualities of leadership and I hope he will make a good leader of the Government and the Irish nation.</P>
      <P>Whatever we may say about our personal political affiliations, the nation is above us all and we like to see in control of Government a man who has the qualifications for that high office. Deputy Haughey has a great deal of qualifications and, in my view, he is possibly more suited to the office than any other Member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is not a conclusion I reached in the past few days or years but is one formed since Deputy Haughey first entered this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was anticipating taking a look at what happened at the Fianna Fáil Party Selection conference, that we would have a different type of Government nominated by Deputy Haughey here today. This was a great exercise in democracy.  As I see it, here is what happened: <Col N="1460" /> it appears from what information we could assimilate and from newspapers reports that the other contestant, Deputy Colley, had almost the entire Government and Cabinet supporting him.  That was indeed a big start.</P>

      <P>We had the peculiar situation that the Government which was elected in 1977, supposedly to advance and promote the interests of our nation and its people, two-and-a-half years afterwards could not satisfy their own Members in this House.  It is quite clear to us on this side of the House, as I am sure it is also to those on the other side, that this change was brought about mainly by nonmembers of the Government or by those usually known as backbenchers Therefore, it is clear to me that the Government in office did not satisfy their own back-benchers because, had they done so, it would not be Deputy Haughey who would be appointed Taoiseach here today but Deputy Colley.  I think that is quite relevant to this discussion.</P>

      <P>I have said that the outgoing Government did not satisfy Fianna Fáil Deputies in this House.  If they did not satisfy Fianna Fáil Deputies, surely it is difficult to expect that they satisfied the nation as a whole. That is a fair observation to make.</P>
      <P>Having been appointed Taoiseach, having assumed the task of nominating members of the Government, I thought that the axe would have come down much harder than it did, that, as mentioned by previous speakers, we would have had many new members on the team.  It was quite evident that many people within Fianna Fáil, particularly Members of this House, were not satisfied with the old team.  What has happened?  It is quite clear that most members of the Government have been reappointed by Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach.  He has not effected the big change many of us anticipated.  I do not know the reason.  Possibly the Taoiseach will tell us when he is making his first announcement as head of the Government.</P>
      <P>The first item missing from this new Government is the cornerstone of the previous one, or what we used to know as the cornerstone.  I refer to Deputy Martin O'Donoghue.  When we were in office, the former Taoiseach and his Ministers, who were then front bench members of the Opposition, had established what is known as the &ldquo;think tank&rdquo;.  The manager of that &ldquo;think tank&rdquo; was known to us then as Professor Martin O'Donoghue.  He was the man who had the cure for all our economic ills.  He was the man who produced the manifesto that did so well in returning 84 Deputies to this House at the last general election.  He was the man who formulated policies in the economic and development fields that would provide additional employment for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We accepted that Deputy O'Donoghue was the cornerstone.  He was the man on whom Deputy Lynch built the former Government.  It was his thinking and planning and the coordination of effort he was supposed to bring about among all members of the Government that would make this country <Col N="1463" /> an exceptionally prosperous one.  The clear evidence that that policy has failed is before us in this House today by the absence of the nomination of Deputy O'Donoghue, the former Minister for Economic Planning and Development, as a member of the Cabinet.  There is evidence also that the Taoiseach now accepts that the policy propounded in the 1977 General Election was not a sound one.  He has abolished that policy by the removal of Deputy O'Donoghue from membership of the Government.  We are all aware of the gimmickry&mdash;here I would include the Taoiseach and senior Ministers then in opposition&mdash;during the term of office of the National Coalition, when every available opportunity was seized to create, as far as they possibly could, an atmosphere of gloom and despair throughout this country, when they told us they had cures for all our ills.</P>
    <P>We were told in the manifesto that when they got back into power people would not have to pay rates on their houses and would not have to pay tax on their cars.  It was implied that farmers would have it much easier so far as taxation was concerned and that the PAYE contributors would have a much lighter burden to bear.  What has happened two-and-a-half years later?  We have had squabbling within Fianna Fáil since the wind started to blow in January, the wind which turned into gale force around them and continued until now when the former Taoiseach could bear the burden no longer and retired.</P>
    <P>We know that the former Taoiseach retired within his own party.  It was not because the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party made life more difficult for him, something every Taoiseach has to bear from an Opposition.  The greatest opposition to the former Taoiseach in regard to his policies came from members of Fianna Fáil who were anxious to get rid of him.</P>
    <P>Did we expect that in 1977, when the Government came along with their rosy speeches about how they could reduce unemployment?  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Barrett, for whom I <Col N="1464" /> have great respect, has failed in his job because sufficient money was not provided for him by the former Minister for Finance.  Any Minister for the Environment has a great problem with regard to house building.  The cost of building a house has now gone beyond the reach of the ordinary worker, whether he is self-employed or otherwise. The average cost of house building is continuously escalating and now it has gone beyond the reach of the ordinary man in the street.  This means that there is a very heavy demand on local authorities to provide houses for people who cannot provide their own.  People are now getting married at a much younger age and it is impossible for local authorities throughout the country to meet the demands on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment received a deputation from Cork County Council (West) quite recently and he gave us a very courteous hearing.  We went to see him because the total sum allocated by the Government for Cork County Council (West) in 1979 was £190,000 or enough to build only ten or 11 houses.  Those are the kind of problems which have arisen after two-and-a-half years of Fianna Fáil Government, but there are many more.</P>
    <P>I am a believer in private enterprise.  I like to see people who start a business making progress.  We know the burden that public enterprise is on the State.  We know what CIE and all the other State bodies have to get.  The large injections of State money which they have to get year after year are a great burden on taxpayers.  It does not matter whether the industry expands in those State enterprises because all the people involved are sure of their wages and salaries because John Citizen must make up any shortfall there is in such an industry.  I always have great respect for people who try to promote employment for people in their areas.  This year, particularly during the past five or six months, has been a very difficult year for such people. Government policies over that period are responsible for this.  We had a credit squeeze during that time.  Some of <Col N="1465" /> those people are almost crushed out of existence because of the attitude of our banks.  I was a defender of the banking system.  There were views expressed, particularly by my party, that banking should be nationalised.  I was not a believer in that.  However, I am not a believer in the way our banks are treating honest creditworthy people at the moment.  The handy excuse they give is that the Government, through the Central Bank, prevent them from increasing people's overdrafts.  They tell such people that they are precluded from making more money available for the continuance of the work of those people even though the banks agree that such people are creditworthy.</P>
    <P>I have confidence in the new Taoiseach, who understands the financial world reasonably well.  He has moved up the ladder.  I believe that what a man can do for himself he can also do for the nation.  I believe in ambitious people having control of things.  I believe that the Taoiseach has confidence, that he can do a good job as head of the Government.  I applaud that kind of confidence. I believe that if a person does not feel equal to a job he should not look for it.  The Taoiseach has aspired to this job.  He had enough fight and he is now, to use a term well known to him, in the winner's enclosure.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his statement today changed the Finance Ministry.  I appeal to him as Taoiseach and to the new Minister for Finance to take some steps to modify the credit squeeze which is creating so much hardship for so many small industries and making it so difficult for farmers and others who borrowed money from the banks in the hope that they would get a reasonable time to repay it.  That kind of policy by a group who have a monopoly is wrong.  The Taoiseach should address himself to that matter, which must be dealt with without delay.  We have been told that the banks made more money available in loans this year and last year and that it was mandatory on the Government to instruct the Central Bank to instruct the commercial <Col N="1466" /> banks to push people to repay loans which they had and on which they were paying large sums in interest.  Many of these people are paying interest at more than 20 per cent to commerical banks.  It is common knowledge that a number of our banks own subsidiary firms, all of which charge high rates of more than 20 per cent, as, indeed, do the banks in many cases.  I ask the Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance to address themselves at the earliest possible date, to this question.  I do not like to see people going out of business, or banks treating them as they are treating them at present, ignoring appeals for leniency or appeals to stay their hand.  Any group with a monopoly of banking business has no right to treat the Irish public in such a manner.</P>
    <P>The most important industry so far as Ireland is concerned is agriculture.  I am very dissatisfied with the attitude and actions of the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Gibbons.  I raised in the Dáil with Deputy Gibbons, a number of items affecting the farming community, without getting much sympathy from him.  I hope that Deputy MacSharry, the new Minister for Agriculture, will not take a leaf out of Deputy Gibbons's book but, to use the term applied to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy O'Malley, will be his own man.</P>
    <P>Ministers become stale and adamant and know too much for the ordinary man in the street.  They are inclined to become dictatorial; that is possibly why you have the backbenchers of old within the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;because of the dictatorial nature of some of the Ministers.  Farming is not doing well this year and the small farmers are finding great difficulty in making ends meet, with increasing costs of input and reducing rates of output.  Farming is our most important industry and I hope the head of the Government and the new Minister for Agriculture will address themselves to this question.  I do not want to be too specific on the agricultural position in a debate on the appointment of Ministers but I would ask the Taoiseach, who was <Col N="1467" /> formerly a Minister for Agriculture, to take a personal interest in this very important industry.  Before I leave that point, some of the help this Government got in the last election was due to the implied statements at many of their churchgate performances that, once Fianna Fáil were back in office, the taxation of farmers would disappear.  That was said in west Cork and, I am sure, in other centres.  Many unsuspecting farmers believed those statements, swallowed the Fianna Fáil bait and, as a result, helped to boost the Fianna Fáil majority in the election.  We all know what has happened since, so far as that particular bait is concerned.</P>
    <P>Fisheries used to be tied in with Agriculture, before we had an independent ministry.  Has the Taoiseach addressed himself to the question of Fisheries in the appointment?  He has appointed a new man, Deputy Power.  I do not wish to reflect in any way on Deputy Power in his capacity as a Minister of the Government, but it is peculiar that, at a time when so much depends on the development of our fishing industry, a Deputy from an inland constituency and, as far as we know, with no experience in that field, is appointed Minister for Fisheries.  When the Taoiseach was in opposition he addressed himself in a big way to the fisheries question.  We all know his statements and those of many of the Government about what would happen so far as fisheries were concerned if and when Fianna Fáil came to power.  The present Taoiseach made a positive statement, with no ambiguity about it&mdash;no ifs, ands or buts&mdash;if Fianna Fáil got into power they would get the 50-mile exclusive limit for our Irish fisheries.  He was backed up by the senior counsel, Deputy O'Kennedy, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and now Minister for Finance.  Is that so, or is it not?  The answer is that it is so.  This was one of the gimmicks in relation to what was then a very emotive and very important subject.  It is quite true that the present Taoiseach played his own part in propounding that&mdash;you will bear with <Col N="1468" /> me if I call it a confounded lie or an untruth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Substitute a word for it and I shall accept it.  This is part and parcel of how the present Government got into office.  In the National Coalition Government we had, in my view, a most capable Minister in charge of labour affairs, a man who understood labour affairs and who intervened very frequently, when necessary, in any disputes that arose.  This man was the subject of criticism in this House, particularly by the Deputy who has replaced him, the former Minister for Labour who is now, to the surprise of the country the present Minister of Labour.</P>

      <P>What has happened so far as labour affairs are concerned? Every group is complaining.  This morning in Dublin there were no buses. People had to make their way on foot, or get alternative transport.  A few weeks ago, it was the banks.  A few weeks before that it was the electricity board. Next week it will be somebody else. There is a continuous run of industrial unrest all over this country and it is crippling the country; there is no doubt about that.  A strong, competent, efficient man is needed to deal with such unrest and, without reflecting on Deputy Fitzgerald&mdash;a fellow Corkman&mdash;to my mind, he has not measured up to the requirements of that office.  In the Taoiseach's opinion he has lived up to it, otherwise he would not have been reappointed. What does the Taoiseach expect the Minister for Labour to do in the future that he was incapable of or unable to do in the past?  What will the Minister do to put buses back on the road, to ensure that electricity supplies are not cut off and to ensure that the many other upheavals will cease?  The Minister will not do that job.  No matter what the causes, industrial unrest is crippling the country. A large number of man days are lost in <Col N="1469" /> employment at a time when we can ill afford such losses.  This morning I had some hope, when Deputy Haughey was nominated as Taoiseach that we would have a change in the Department of Labour.  The people are crying out for a change and I thought we would have a new incumbent who would be fresh on the job, and if he could not do better it would be very difficult for him to do worse.</P>
      <P>The next thing that the Government were going to redress, according to the manifesto and according to the 1977 election promises, was inflation and rising prices.  Leaflets were handed out at polling stations and on street corners prior to the election telling us how the price of bread, sugar and so on had increased. Coming up to the 1977 election people were worried about increased prices and the Fianna Fáil Party cashed in on that worry and said to the people &ldquo;Give us a chance, remove those fellows from office, let us in and we will arrest this inflation and will ensure that prices will be kept at a level that your pockets can afford&rdquo;.  There is no need for me to say what happened in regard to prices. Ordinary household goods have increased in price beyond measure. Clothing and footwear and all the essentials have increased in price by 60 or 70 per cent since this Government came to office.  So far as that Department are concerned, we have had no change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We must relate the nominations by the Taoiseach to the nominations made in 1977.  I and previous speakers were surprised that the Taoiseach did not wield his axe much more harshly and that instead of getting new blood into the Cabinet, which I am sure most of the people who voted for him had anticipated, he made only four changes in the Cabinet.  It is worth repeating that when the nominations came forward for discussion in 1977 we were told that the cornerstone of that Cabinet was Deputy O'Donoghue, the former Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  During the last election campaign Fianna Fáil said to the people &ldquo;Keep your rates; we do not want them&rdquo;.  They told people with large houses in Dublin with more than £100 valuations that if they voted for Fianna Fáil there would be no need to pay the Dublin Corporation or the Dublin County Council £1,200 or £1,300 a year for the houses.  The people in the country were told that if they voted for Fianna Fáil they would not have to pay car tax <Col N="1472" /> and could use the money in whatever way they liked and that they would get on without it.  Have you got on without it?  Did we hear rumblings from Deputy O'Malley during the past three or four weeks?  He retained his portfolio.  The axe did not fall on him and for that he should be grateful.  Now he may have to put back the car tax.  What is the Taoiseach's view on that?</P>
      <P>I wanted to mention car tax because it was offered as a &ldquo;goody&rdquo;.  During my time in this House, since 1951, at no time up to 1977 did any Deputy ask that car tax be abolished.  This &ldquo;goody&rdquo; took the Irish people by surprise, especially the young people who had cars.  This &ldquo;goody&rdquo; was offered to catch votes.  I am afraid that when the next budget is framed this Government will find hidden ways to extract money from car owners. At present the tax on cars assembled in Ireland is, on average, 29 per cent, and it is possibly more on imported cars.  This is a formidable tax.  Motorists should realise that not only do they pay the Government a heavy premium on petrol, but on a car costing £4,000 they pay a tax of £1,000.</P>
      <P>We are a democratic country nominating a Government.  We know from the Government figures that the Taoiseach's proposal will be approved.  I am very disappointed that, with two exceptions, the same people are in the Government.  I wish the two new members well in their Departments.  It is not to anybody's advantage if this country goes down.  That is one thing I despised about Fianna Fáil.  When the Coalition were in office some of them took particular pleasure in any problems that confronted the Government.  That is not a patriotic outlook.  We all want to see our country improving.  We want to see our people satisfied, whether they be old or young, the self-employed or those on the PAYE system, employers or employees. We want to see the national loaf shared as equitably as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reaffirm my belief that the present Taoiseach could be capable of handling the affairs of the country well, leaving aside the gimmickry he took part <Col N="1473" /> in when the Coalition were in power and which helped him get where he is today. He is the man democratically elected.  He was elected by the votes of Deputies. Whoever gets the most votes gets the job but in this case there was the added bonus that it carried with it nomination as Taoiseach.  I wish the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, well.  However long this Government lasts I hope he will have a successful term of office.  In the early days of his reign I hope he gets the co-operation of the people and that those engaged in industrial disputes, and the self-employed who seem to be dissatisfied, will give him a few months to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>I accept it is exceptionally difficult for a Taoiseach, at a time when there is so much unrest, to take the strong stand he should.  As a Member of the Opposition I appeal to everybody inside and outside this House, to give the Taoiseach and his Government a chance to try to get this country off the ground and to rectify the ills and problems which exist, some of which were possibly of our own making.</P>
    <P>I wish the Taoiseach well and want to add my congratulations to Deputy Power on being made a Minister, and to the other Ministers and hope their term will be successful and fruitful for the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Taoiseach, the new Ministers and those who have been reappointed.  I should like especially to congratulate Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn on her appointment as a full Cabinet Minister, the first woman since Countess Markievicz and <Col N="1474" /> only the second in the history of the State.  It would be true to say that she is effectively the first woman Cabinet Minister we have had.  I express my condolences and sympathy to those who have lost their positions in the Government. At least some of them did not deserve it.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Taoiseach's press conference and have read avidly everything he has said since he was elected leader of Fianna Fáil last Friday.  He has dwelt on many subjects and issues but it would seem that the second great aim of Fianna Fáil, the revival of the Irish language, has been forgotten.  I hope the Taoiseach has not forgotten that.  I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Gene Fitzgerald on his reappointment as Minister for Labour.  As his shadow in the House I have to say that he has been much less effective than he might be but industrial relations is not the sole responsibility of the Minister for Labour.  The last Government as a whole would have to take a major share of the blame for the postal strike and that goes for the new Taoiseach as well.  It is not only the Government that are to blame although they contributed in no small way.</P>
    <P>It is very sad and very wrong that there are no Government contributors to this debate as it was very wrong that there were no Government contributors to the earlier debate on the nomination of the Taoiseach.  The impression was reported in this evening's <i>Evening Press</i> that there was a filibuster by the Opposition because they sought to comment for six short hours on the nomination of the Taoiseach.  This hand over was the most traumatic since the hand over by W.T. Cosgrave to Eamon de Valera.  Six short hours were described by the <i>Evening Press</i> as a filibuster mainly because there were no Government contributors.  I do not want it reported in tomorrow's papers that this was a filibuster.  The Opposition have a duty to say what they think ought to be said as have the Government and backbenchers.</P>
    <P>A lot of hard things were said today which unfortunately had to be said.  I am glad that I was not one of the Deputies <Col N="1475" /> called on to say them.  Now that they have been said I hope that the Taoiseach lives up fully to the expectation which I and many people have that he will solve the other problems and prove all the fears that abound in the country wrong. He is capable of doing so.  There are many fears and we hope he proves them unfounded.  There are many people in the House, and I am one of them, who believe that the Taoiseach is a man of great skill, competence and civility.  I hope he can bring all his skills&mdash;I am sure he will&mdash;to meet the great challenges that face this great country of ours.  The Taoiseach and the Government have no mandate.  I say that conscious of the fact&mdash;is that in order?</P>

We have, as leader of the Government, as we have as leader of the Opposition men capable of tackling and overcoming these problems. However, the Government have no mandate to do anything.  This is a central point.  Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach and the Government will have a honeymoon of a few months.  They are entitled to that.  There are 84 Deputies most of whom are highly nervous.  It is the same nervousness which has overthrown Deputy Lynch as Taoiseach.  They will continue to be highly nervous until there is a general election.  The Taoiseach and the Government have no right, as Deputy Lynch had, to expect the loyalty of the backbenchers because the nomination and the appointment of the Government and the circumstances which brought it about have been a lesson in disloyalty. The new Taoiseach will operate under a bigger disability than the previous Taoiseach because, unlike the previous Government, they have not been given a mandate from the people.  They are not entitled to expect the loyalty of the backbenchers as Deputy Lynch was and did not get.  Moreover, when the Ministers of State are appointed tomorrow more people on those benches will be disappointed than there were last week.  Disappointment at lack of promotion is one of the main factors which contributed to the downfall of Deputy Lynch.  Half the party will be in rebellion and who is to say to them &ldquo;stop&rdquo;?  The Taoiseach and the Government cannot expect them to stop when the Government was brought about by disloyalty and rebellion.</P>
      <P>I say these things to indicate by belief that the momentum for a general election has begun.  As the present Taoiseach's father-in-law said, once the momentum of a general election has begun it is irreversible.  We might as well face up to that fact.  I predict that we will have a general election within a few months.</P>

      <P>I am entitled to speculate about how long the proposed Government will last.  I am putting forward the argument that it will not last long.  That is one good reason to question whether or not this House should agree to the nomination of these Ministers.  I am putting forward the argument that the Government (a) lack the mandate and (b) do not deserve the loyalty not only of this House but of their own back benchers because of the way they came into office.  I now predict that there will be a general election in the first part of next year; this Government will not last.  Also, that will be a convenient way for the new Taoiseach to evade and avoid whatever promises were made to those serried ranks behind him. However, we must look forward <Col N="1478" /> tonight, for Ireland more than most is a country of the future.  A bigger percentage of our population, than in any other western country, is youth.  We have a burgeoning youth population.  We must plan the future for them, create the opportunities they deserve and face the challenge that the need for those opportunities creates.  We often crib about this or that and I think most of our people think we are a poor country.  We are not a poor country; we are one of the 20 richest countries in the world and I would hazard a guess that we are probably one of the five most materialistic countries in the world.  If ever values were counted in money terms in any country they are so counted in this country at this time.</P>
      <P>Rightly or wrongly I must say that the Fianna Fáil Party perceived that at the last election and articulated that materialism in a very enticing manifesto which created euphoric expectations which could not be fulfilled.  Frustration of those expectations is the immediate cause of many of our problems that this Government will have to face.  But the root cause is a materialist one, counting everything in money terms.  I was very glad to hear the Taoiseach at his press conference emphasise culture so much. If the Taoiseach and the Government lead us away from the materialism of recent years it will be a great service to the country.  But it is not really a strong card of the Taoiseach or the Government.  To begin with, they were all members of the party that produced that manifesto even though some of my colleagues have said that manifesto is burned, destroyed and abandoned just as Deputy O'Donoghue is, just as we predicted that he would be two-and a-half years ago.  The manifesto is dead.  The Government are not in a strong position to ask the people not to be materialist or to ask for restraint.  The Taoiseach more than most is not in a good position to ask anybody for restraint.  This very materialism is at the base of our dreadful industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I asked the number of mandays lost through industrial disputes for the ten worst years previous to this.  The Minister very courteously gave me the <Col N="1479" /> man-days lost since records began in 1923.  In the first nine months of this year we had already exceeded in mandays lost every one of those years except 1937.  If you extrapolate the nine months figures to annual figures you find that we are heading for the worst ever year in industrial relations, one of the conspicious failures of the Government of which the Taoiseach was a member, one of the most conspicuous failures in an area to which we now find the same Minister nominated.</P>
    <P>I think that is reasonable.  I expressed the hope here last week that he would be reappointed because it would be unfair that Deputy Gene Fitzgerald should be burdened with all the blame for industrial relations policy.  He has a certain responsibility; he has not been to date an effective Minister but he must not be made a scapegoat for a situation for which he alone was not responsible. First, much of the industrial relations area was taken from him.  The negotiations regarding the national understanding went to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  I hope that in the rearranged functions that function will go back to the Department of Labour.  The Minister for Labour was denuded of that role which I think is vital to the preservation of industrial peace.  He was not a leading Government figure dealing with the national understanding.  Breaches of the national understanding and of previous national agreements are one of the principal causes of our industrial relations turmoil.  So, the reappointment or nomination of Deputy Fitzgerald as Minister for Labour with added responsibility for the public service is not something that I would complain about overmuch.  But I should like the Taoiseach, as a member of the previous Government to accept some of the blame himself.  I hope he is as good as his word at the press conference that he is going to do something about industrial relations.</P>
    <P>As spokesman for the main Opposition, on a number of occasions in this House and again last week&mdash;and indeed <Col N="1480" /> also outside the House&mdash;I invited the Minister for Labour to seek the political consensus which I believe exists to deal with unofficial disputes and some other industrial relations problems.  I repeat that invitation tonight to the new Taoiseach because I believe that a political consensus does exist on a certain course of action.  I cannot see why the Minister has not up to now taken up my invitation.  I think it is a generous invitation because if the Government can solve the industrial relations problem, the kudos will be all theirs, not mine or the Labour Party's.</P>
    <P>We do that on this side of the House because we believe that the national interest comes first and not party interests. We believe that the national interest would be better served if a climate and framework were created in which the solution of industrial disputes was more likely and the occurrence of industrial disputes less likely.  We make this offer because we believe it is only in a prolonged period of industrial peace that we can meet the challenge and avail of the opportunities that are there to provide fully for our massive youth population.  Having got that political consensus which I believe exists the Minister should then seek the consensus outside this House which I believe also exists.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of the Commission on Industrial Relations. Since July congress members have been absent from the commission table.  The commission has gone ahead without them.  I cannot envisage any worse scenario for a report of the Commission on Industrial Relations.  It seems that any report emanating from a one-sided commission is destined to be rejected. The Government can do only one of two things and they must do it now, this week and that is get congress back to the commission or abandon the commission.</P>
    <P>For two and a half years we have been fobbed off in this House with the answer that the Commission on Industrial Relations is examining the matter.  This same commission was first announced in this House in October 1977.  It took seven <Col N="1481" /> months, from May 1978, to appoint that commission after the most unbelievable mishandling of the appointment of a chairman: Senator Brian Hillery was nominated, without prior consultation, to be chairman of the commission and his appointment had to be withdrawn because at least one of the partners objected. One of the basic rules of industrial relations, as anyone with an elementary knowledge of the subject knows, is that there has to be prior consultation. But here, a chairman of this Commission on Industrial Relations is nominated without consultation and has to be withdrawn to the great embarrassment of Professor Hillery which he did not deserve because he is a competent and a good man.  That was a bad start.</P>
    <P>That was seven months after the Minister told me in this House that there would be a commission.  It hardly met until October 1978.  We had been promised an interim report by Christmas 1978.  Now it is Christmas 1979 and there is no interim report and there is not going to be an interim report.  But we are told there will be a final report next July. It will be a final report without the consent or the contribution of the trade union movement.  Is it not obvious that the commission's report was doomed to failure from last July onwards?  I say again, abandon the commission if congress cannot be got back to it immediately.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach promised at his press conference last week that one of the major tasks of the Government would be to solve the industrial relations problem. There is no doubt that it is one of the <Col N="1482" /> great problems facing our country. There is a popular misconception that the trade unions have too much power, that they are too strong.  Many people believe that, not only in the country but in the cities as well.  That is one of the great misconceptions.  The problem here is that the trade union movement is too weak to enforce discipline, to give the level of service its members expect and require.  Any action the Government takes should not be anti-trade union, anti-worker, and it should not be perceived to be so.  This House needs to aid and abet the official trade union movement, to strengthen it.  I believe it would be one of the best ways of reducing the level of unofficial disputes.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat again that we on this side of the House unreservedly condemn unofficial disputes.  We fully support the right of trade unions and workers to strike in a democratic way but we are totally and unreservedly opposed to unofficial strikes.  In 1906 the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster enacted the Trade Disputes Act which was very necessary at that time.  In 1921 this part of our country became independent. That Act has remained unamended although it is amended in Britain.  At the time that Act was described as a pickets charter, not an altogether inaccurate description.  If it was a case, as it was in Britain, of simply amending that Act to remove legal protection from unofficial disputes we could proceed to do it.</P>
