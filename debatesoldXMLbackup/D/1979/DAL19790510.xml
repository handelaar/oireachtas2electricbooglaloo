      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,233,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1979, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> I propose to refer to the subject matter of the Estimate under three broad headings: first, to indicate the main features of the financial allocation proposed for this year; secondly to summarise the activities of the Department; and thirdly to make some brief references to possible future developments in the work of the Department and some other related matters bearing on that work.</P>
    <P>The sum of £5,233,000 being sought is roughly £1.6 million more than that approved by the Dáil for 1978.  The biggest single factor in the increase over last year's allocation is the grant-in-aid of the National Board for Science and Technology&mdash;subhead 1.  The reason for this is that 1979 will be the first full year of the board's existence and their activities are expected to expand as they build up their organisation.  This factor alone accounts for almost £1.4 million of the increase in the total allocation sought for this year.</P>
    <P>The provision for salaries, wages and allowances&mdash;subhead A.1&mdash;accounts for almost the balance of the increased allocation, almost £200,000.  This is due to the additional staff now engaged in the Department and, of course, to the increase in pay costs.  The contribution to international organisations&mdash;subhead H&mdash;is a sizeable element&mdash;£477,000 in the requested allocation.  The bulk of this is the contribution to the European Space Agency; as a consequence of this participation we will benefit through the placing by the agency of contracts with Irish industry, universities and research institutions, and through having access to the agency's scientific and technical information services.</P>
    <P>The fall from £250,000 in the provision&mdash;subhead F.1&mdash;for the Special Regional Development Fund reflects the level of commitments expected to mature for payment in 1979. There is a substantial increase in the commitments being incurred this year, but many of these will not mature for payment until 1980.</P>
    <P>A noteworthy feature of the Estimate is that the expenses of the National Economic and Social Council this year will be met by way of a grant-in-aid instead of a direct grant.  As a result, services <Col N="361" /> such as printing, accommodation and rates&mdash;hitherto met from other suheads of the Department's Vote and from other Votes&mdash;will all now be included in the one grant-in-aid.  The advantages of this change are accounting convenience, clarity and a greater degree of financial autonomy for the NESC.</P>
    <P>Those are the main features of the actual financial allocations as compared with the previous year.  I should now like to summarise briefly the manner in which the Department have been discharging their responsibilities, statutory and otherwise, in the formulation of policies for economic and social development.  The more obvious and more immediate way in which the Department have been at work is in the preparation of planning documents, that is, Green Papers, discussion papers and White Papers.  So far three such papers have been produced and further papers will appear in the course of 1979.</P>
    <P>The fundamental <i>rationale</i> behind this sequence of Green Paper-White Paper derives from the need to set out national policies for economic and social development, and the Government's approach to that development programme in the perspective of a number of years, rather than having a single annual statement as was frequently the case in the past.  Secondly, it is to review regularly the progress towards these agreed objectives and, where appropriate, to adjust plans in the light of any changing circumstances so as to allow a sufficiently long time span within which to adjust and to identify appropriate alternative policies for dealing with changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>Part of that approach to planning requires an emphasis on what are usually referred to as macro-economic policies, that is, policies dealing with broad aggregates of national output, trends and investments as against consumption spending, the behaviour of savings, the movement of domestic as against external trade, and so forth.  The Department have strengthened their staffing and capability in this area, including linking in to information networks with the EEC.</P>
    <P>The second area where work is <Col N="362" /> progressing, but where it will be some time before there are substantial visible results, is in the development of comprehensive social policies.  The Government have set themselves as their primary task in the area of social policy the creation of employment.  Whatever the merits and demerits, whatever the problems and difficulties arising in other sectors, there can be no satisfactory resolution of the many social problems in our society if we are not in a position to offer adequate work with sufficient continuity at reasonable income levels to all the people who seek it.</P>
    <P>We know unemployment gives rise to many of the other problems in our society.  It has a significant bearing on the incidence of crime and vandalism. We also know that, in many instances, it leads to difficulties in home life and in marriage, associated with some drinking problems, and so forth.  The provision of sufficient employment would, of itself, represent a major step forward in easing the many other social problems in our society.  Naturally we cannot expect to solve all the social problems overnight but, as a first step along this way, a programme of work is being carried out in other Departments and in the Department of Economic Planning and Development who are tackling the question of getting adequate information on the effects of many existing Government policies and programmes.  At present work is being done on the area of income distribution, including the redistributive effects of public expenditure and taxation policies.  This is one area in which we do not have adequate information.  As a result, we tend to get many statements from groups, all of which are based on reactions to partial information, whether it is the impact of a particular taxation change or the impact of a particular spending programme.  We do not have sufficient information on the over-all impact on taxation and spending which Government programmes have in improving the position of the less advantaged groups in our community.</P>
    <P>In addition to this specific work on income distribution, work is also being done in seeking to develop an adequate set of what I might describe as social indicators, that is, an agreed set of <Col N="363" /> measures which might be used as convenient reference points for marking the extent of progress in the area of social development.</P>
    <P>In addition to the work on social policy, the Department are also engaged in moving ahead with the development of sectoral policies, that is, a more detailed examination of policies which are appropriate to individual areas of the economy, whether it is segments of industry, the services sector and so on.  In particular they are paying attention to those areas which span the responsibilities of more than one Government Department or agency, acting as a co-ordinating body in this area.</P>
    <P>Another area in which the Department are pressing ahead is with the development of material relevant to regional planning and development.  As we know, there has been no updating of official policy in this area since 1972.  At that time guidelines were laid down for regional development based on the then information, trends and development. Naturally, much has taken place since that time.  In order to update the situation and have an adequate base from which to launch a policy appropriate to 1979 and the eighties, a great deal of basic statistical and analytical work needs to be carried out.  Proposals which would underpin the direction of regional policy have been set out in the Green Paper which was published last year. These proposals were based on three principles, namely, that equity demands a fair distribution of development throughout the regions; that national development can be maximised only if the special development potential of each region is realised; that legitimate regional interests should be given an effective voice in regional development.</P>
    <P>While it will take some time before a comprehensive statement on regional policy can be put before the House, I should like to make it clear that the Government attach the greatest importance and urgency to a vigorous programme of regional development.  As a specific indication of their intentions in that area and of their desire to have this whole question of regional development revitalised, the White Paper published in <Col N="364" /> January this year contained a Government decision that 2,000 civil servants would be located in at least eight centres outside Dublin as part of a contribution to the decentralisation of Government administration.</P>
    <P>In addition to these more general questions of regional development policies, specific issues can arise within any one regional area.  The most clearcut example of that is in the Dublin area where much attention has been focused in recent times on the problems of the inner city area.  Last autumn an interdepartmental committee were set up, chaired by an official from my Department. The report of that committee has recently become available to the Government.  Members of the House will have seen the statement issued yesterday in which the Government welcomed the work of the committee and have set up an action group to further the work of the committee to press ahead with developing a vigorous programme for implementing many of the detailed proposals which were set out in the report of the committee.  Additional funds are being allocated to underpin the importance which the Government attach to making an early and determined impact on inner city problems.</P>
    <P>Work of that kind illustrates the way in which the Department can play an important co-ordinating role in bringing together the various Departments and agencies involved in any one issue, in this case in dealing with the special problems of the inner city area of Dublin.</P>
    <P>In addition to these specific areas of work on developmental policies, whether they be for the economy as a whole or for specific regions or sectors of the economy, a vital area of work in the development of a healthy planning process is the development of adequate consultation procedures.  It is important that relevant bodies&mdash;employers, farmers, trade unions and other interested groups in our community&mdash;should have an adequate say in the formulation of policy so that the programmes for development which materialise and which will form the basis of Government decisions will have been developed as a result of adequate discussion <Col N="365" /> and awareness of the various aspirations and wishes of the many groups within our community.</P>
    <P>The Department have a role to play in the process of developing consultation through co-ordinating functions with other Departments and through the valuable work carried out by one of the bodies which reports to me.  This is the work of NESC.  As you know, the council are representative of all the major areas in Irish life and they are the successors to the earlier National Industrial and Economic Council which did valuable work in the sixties.  That earlier body needed to be broadened so as to bring in other groups, particularly the farmers, who had not been represented on the earlier body.  This council are equipped with the resources to enable them to study the many issues of economic and social development which they deem appropriate.  They function as an autonomous body and, therefore, have the freedom to decide their own areas of work and the manner in which they will tackle those issues.  They have produced many valuable reports to date, very often of a specific technical or information-gathering nature, in addition to preparing their own views and proposals on the many policy issues which arise.</P>
    <P>It would be fair to note that in the work of the National, Economic and Social Council there is, perhaps, a discernible trend towards the second phase of its work.  In the early years there were many information gaps which called for work of a factual nature, bringing together the nation and the dimensions of this particular issue, rather than the council being able directly to tackle and discuss the nature of the policies appropriate to the issues involved.  That early phase of information gathering, fact finding, is largely at an end and, increasingly, the council's work will be able to take the form of choosing specific areas for policy making and putting forward their views and suggestions as to the appropriateness of action.</P>
    <P>The council report to the Government through me and I have met the council on one or two occasions, to familiarise myself with their work and also to make <Col N="366" /> clear to them the value which the Government place on their activities and to emphasise the necessity for this type of discussion by the major interest groups concerned, on the issues which confront us.</P>
    <P>Of the other bodies which receive financial support via my Department, I have already referred, at the outset, to the National Board of Science and Technology, which is the newest body established only last year and therefore still building up their staffing and their range of activities.  Already we can say that this body has done much valuable work and is encouraging an increasing flow of research activity in a number of areas which are important for the future development of the country.</P>
    <P>The developing of a comprehensive approach to funding, to supporting research and development activities and to harnessing that effort into an effective vehicle for social and economic progress is one area where much further development is needed and where we can expect substantial progress as the activities of the board build up.</P>
    <P>The remaining bodies under my Department are, first of all, the Economic and Social Research Institute. That does not require any very deep comment from me at this juncture.  It has been established now for almost 20 years; it is an independent body with freedom to choose its research activities and, by and large, the aim is to give the research institute freedom to get on with its programmed work and to ensure that there is sufficient dialogue between the Department and the institute to ensure that there is no undue overlap in activities as between different research bodies.</P>
    <P>A newer body which recently assumed the reporting responsibility, is Muintir na Tíre, which, hitherto, had received financial support via the Department of Education.  Since the primary thrust or purpose of Muintir na Tíre is to promote community development, it is more appropriate that it should link in through my Department, so that it can make its contribution to the development of programmes in the community area.</P>
    <P>I have said sufficient, as to the financial <Col N="367" /> allocations sought and the way in which the programmed work of the Department is developing, to give a reasonable indication of the lines which are being followed.</P>
    <P>I should like to touch briefly on one or two other aspects which may be of interest to the House.  First, as the House will appreciate, the Department, being a new one, is still in its formative years; it still has not, therefore, achieved a state in which we can say that it has settled down into an identifiable, stable pattern of activity, which would then continue into the future.  There are still a number of directions in which further evolution would be appropriate.  One of those concerns the time-frame within which planning or documents are developed.  The initial ones have tended to take what would usually be referred to as a medium-term time span&mdash;that is, periods of three to four years.  For many purposes it is, of course, necessary to take a much longer time span.  In some sense, it is necessary to think ahead for decades, rather than for simple years. Naturally, the longer the time-frame selected, the more general must be the approach adopted.  It is not realistic to attempt detailed specifications or blueprints for the future of society 20 or 30 years hence; it is important to try to pinpoint some of the key elements which might have a decisive bearing or influence on our future position.  It is this attempt at what is sometimes referred to as preparing &ldquo;scenarios&rdquo; for the future which does need to be looked at and where some useful work can be developed.  It is an approach which has been widely used in other areas, mostly in the United States, and in the EEC context there was an interesting study published a few years ago called &ldquo;Europe Plus 30&rdquo;, implying, from that title, that there was an attempt to look ahead to some of the more important factors affecting the position of the EEC in the early years of the 21st century. When dealing with these longer term studies, the normal approach is to seek to concentrate on a small number of key factors, probably things like population trends, trends in food and raw material supplies, availability of energy and the <Col N="368" /> possible impact of technological and scientific developments.</P>
    <P>For small countries, such as Ireland, one may wonder what is the point in engaging in this type of study, because we do not have the same capacity to influence or to affect the trends in any one of these key items in the same way as a large entity such as the United States or the EEC.  However, it is this very absence of power, the very smallness of our size, which means that we are not going to influence these worldwide trends, that makes it all the more imperative that we seek to identify them at the earliest possible date, so that we can have the maximum time in which to assess the likely course of events and to identify the most appropriate response, given our particular circumstances.  This is one area of future work where we might usefully spend a little of our resources.</P>
    <P>The second area, one which I touched on in describing the work of the Department to date, one which requires, I think, further broadening, is the area of specific sectoral or detailed area studies.  To date the Department have only had the resources to participate in a small number of such studies.  I mentioned the one on the inner city as an example. There are a number of other areas where there would be fruitful scope for a more co-ordinated, broadly-based approach. As the planning framework develops, as experience improves and as other Departments participate more fully in the planning process we see this as one obvious direction in which more work will emerge in future years.</P>
    <P>In making these suggestions as to the possible direction of future work I should not like to imply that there should be a rigid or predetermined approach to settling the framework of activity. It is always wrong to cast the work of any Government Department or agency into a rigid framework.  There is need to retain the ability to adapt and respond to a changing environment and to quickly incorporate the benefits of creativity and fresh research.  This is true in all areas of public organisation. Indeed it is true in all areas of life.  If we are thinking in economic terms for the <Col N="369" /> private sector of the economy that stimulus or spur to adaptation is always present through the operation of market forces, through competition of rival firms or through the impact of new products and technological developments. It is the governmental sector which is more capable in the short term, and I emphasise short term, of insulating itself from this process.  If it fails to have sufficient flexibility and speed of response, then it runs the real danger of degenerating into a routine, pedantic, bureaucratic systematised process which inevitably operates as a deadening influence or brake on the progress of the community rather than as an engine stimulating it.</P>
    <P>These are matters for the future and I draw attention to them in order to suggest to the House that in discussing this process of planning developmental policy-making we should not focus our attention only on the work that has taken place to date but should think in terms of how it ought to evolve in the future.  Coming back to the present, our immediate need is to build up support for, and participation in, the planning process by the people at large.  In the final analysis planning is not about the development of sophisticated models or the refinement of interesting theories.  It is about people and their future.  If we are engaging in planning, that is, in the systematic and orderly use of the resources available to us in a way designed to produce the best results for our people, then the people themselves, who are the final arbiters on the success of these planning efforts, must also be involved in the process.  Past sequences of green papers preceding white papers were an attempt to develop this awareness and participation in the planning process.  The recent proposals for a national understanding are a further step along this road.  They represent an attempt to outline a comprehensive set of policies for action designed to achieve the objective of full employment set out in last year's green paper.</P>
    <P>The first step in bringing about this understanding is to win greater recognition and acceptance of full employment as a practical realistic goal.  It would be <Col N="370" /> reasonable to say that when our proposal for full employment was published last year it was met with polite acceptance rather than ardent commitment and support.  The reason for this was many people felt it was a rather foolish type of objective to adopt, conventional wisdom being that it is not practical to think in terms of achieving full employment in a democratic society. For that reason, therefore, people might be forgiven for taking the view that, much as they might regret and deplore unemployment in the same way that they would regret and deplore the presence of sin, they would feel that both would continue to be with us into the future.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to debate this morning the feasibility or otherwise of full employment as an objective.  It is feasible. The fact that it has not happened in the past is a non-argument because if one always falls back on the argument of history no progress would ever have taken place.  The first people who tried to fly aeroplanes, transplant hearts or get people to the moon and so on were all, by definition, doing things which had not been done before.  The argument based on past experience, while relevant in helping to identify the starting point, is not adequate as a basis for deciding whether or not any particular objective is feasible and any particular programme for attaining that objective is sensible and appropriate.</P>
    <P>The objective has been stated.  It is our view that it is feasible and attainable within the time frame put forward, which is very ambitious.  Rather than spend five years debating whether full employment can or cannot be reached, the more sensible approach is to say, if we were going to move along that road, what would be the first steps?  How could we mark out the signposts and milestones along the road?  If we can agree on those let us see whether we can hammer out agreement on the programme of action to mark the first signposts.  That is the way we have been tackling this area in recent months. Having stated the objective to be full employment before the mid-1980s, one works back from that and seeks to spell out the more precise targets which would be appropriate in the immediate <Col N="371" /> months and years ahead and then seeks to build support for achieving the more immediate targets.</P>
    <P>One of the encouraging features of recent months has been the positive manner in which the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have come forward and given their support to a programme for achieving full employment.  They have indicated their willingness to participate in a positive way in any co-ordinated community effort to tackle this problem.  Following on that policy commitment, there have been a series of extensive discussions both with trade unions and with employer bodies to see if a sufficient degree of understanding could be hammered out embracing the relevant areas of employment creation, taxation measures, income increases, industrial relations and also how other groups, especially those in receipt of social welfare benefits, would be affected by a programme for economic and social development which had as its primary aim the task of generating the maximum increase in employment.</P>
    <P>Those discussions, arising from the trade union and employer response to our Green Paper target of full employment, led to the proposals for the national understanding that are now being examined and voted upon by trade union members.  As Members are aware, the proposals fall into two parts.  First, there are the statements of policy objectives and general directions of action that will be appropriate over a five-year period in pursuit of full employment and, secondly, a statement of the specific steps to be taken in the coming months in the areas of pay, taxation and other areas.  It is the earnest wish of the Government that these proposals will be accepted and put into practice.  They are important in their own right because they offer a basis on which all sections of the community can benefit from the economic progress which appears attainable this year.  They are important also because, if agreed, they should put an end to many industrial disputes which have damaged our progress in recent months.  Not only do they provide a basis for faster progress and an immediate improvement in our social and <Col N="372" /> economic climate they also represent the first major advance along the road to active participation by the community in the whole process of planning our future.</P>
    <P>During the next week, workers and employers will be asked to give their verdict on the national understanding.  In doing this I would ask each person to give careful consideration to the terms and ask themselves seriously whether they think the understanding is in the national interest and whether they can reasonably expect to achieve a better outcome by any alternative approach.  I believe and earnestly hope that in the overwhelming majority of cases the answer to those questions would point in the direction of supporting the national understanding.  Here I have to say that I was disappointed to notice advertisements in the daily papers this morning inviting or encouraging members of one union, a very large one, to vote against the understanding and giving a number of reasons in support of that view.  While it might be a matter for individual judgment as to whether to support or reject the proposals my disappointment stems primarily from the fact that a number of the reasons put forward for rejecting the understanding are not in my view an accurate reflection of the facts.</P>
    <P>It is claimed, for instance, that the proposed understanding discriminates against the lower paid workers but that is not so because the terms of the understanding would provide larger increases for lower paid workers than for higher paid ones.  This is so even allowing for the impact of taxation&mdash;indeed more so when one takes account of the impact on taxation.  I took the case of a married worker earning £60 a week at the end of 1978; allowing for his tax position then and applying the pay increases and the tax changes that are proposed during the coming year I found that when he would have received the increases proposed and would have paid the appropriate taxation on them the increase in his take home pay would be approximately 17½ per cent, which is an above average increase. It may well be that advocates of improvement in the relative provision of the lower paid workers would feel this is an insufficient relative improvement and clearly that must be a matter of opinion. <Col N="373" /> But the basic fact is that there will be a greater improvement in the position of the lower paid workers than in the position of the higher paid workers.  So it is simply not accurate to say that the national understanding discriminates against the lower paid workers; it discriminates in favour of the lower paid workers.  The only point that could be made is whether there is a sufficient discriminates in favour of the lower paid workers.</P>
    <P>Another point that is made is that the proposals in the national understanding do not meet the demands of PAYE workers on tax reform.  It is not quite clear what those demands are.  The only clear statement I have seen is the statement contained in the proposals of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that all tax allowances and tax bands should be indexed for inflation, that is, if one's tax free allowance is £1,000 this year and if inflation is 10 per cent then there should be an automatic improvement in one's tax free allowance next year from £1,000 this year to £1,100 next year to automatically adjust for inflation.  Again taking the position of a married worker earning about £70 a week I hope all would agree that this is not a very high paid and not a very low paid worker.  We could take one earning £50 a week and perhaps I should give the positions of both of them.  A married man earning £50 a week would, if we had applied the trade union formula which is simply to index for inflation, save about £46 this year whereas his tax savings available both as a result of the February budget and allowing for the additional reduction that would come at the end of this year would be approximately £144.  That is more than three times the improvement he would have under a simple formula of indexation.  In the case of the married man earning £70 a week, simple indexation would have brought a tax reduction of about £72 this year whereas the proposals for February and December would bring a tax saving of £170&mdash;about two and half times the saving under the indexation formula.  As one moves up the increment scale discrepancy narrows and indeed as one moves to higher levels of income the situation is reversed.  It is true that the <Col N="374" /> proposals in the national understanding are not as beneficial to very highly paid people as straight indexation would be and it may well be that people on high incomes may feel that they have some case to make for indexation.  But whoever has the case to make it cannot be the lower paid workers because the tax proposals here are more generous to lower paid workers than the adoption of the index formula which has been put forward.</P>
    <P>I could go on to deal with other points that are put forward but I have said enough to illustrate that whatever the reasons for voting for and against the national understanding might be I have to emphasise that the reasons given in this advertisement this morning are not an accurate reflection of the facts. Indeed, they give strength to the view that what is needed is some clarification of those proposals but I would have thought the best way to get that clarification would be for people to go ahead and support it to indicate that they want this type of approach to succeed and that they want to have a framework established within which trade unions and employers can meet with Government and other interests so that there can be the working out of a great programme for tackling questions of pay, taxation or anything else and reminding ourselves that of course the important contribution in this national understanding is that it also provides a basis for the first time in our history for tackling our employment needs in a very positive way and indeed carries a unique approach in that for the first time we have Government and employers agreeing to underwrite their employment targets.  There is a firm commitment if this understanding goes ahead that any shortfall in the employment targets would be met by an automatic programme financed jointly by employers and Government to make good the shortfall through creating additional posts in both private and public sectors. That is a unique attempt to give a very positive impetus to the employment programme.  It gives very real meaning to the notion that the contributions of the various groups can be translated into more jobs for our unemployed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> I know that in the past one of the difficulties has always been that trade unions in being asked to accept pay restraint, for example, felt that pay restraint would not lead to more jobs but would simply lead to more profits on the part of the firms who employed them. Here for the first time we are deliberately setting out to create a mechanism to ensure that if each group plays its part, the employers, the trade unions, the Government, the appropriate behaviour on pay or industrial relations or any other item would ensure that money would be channelled into providing jobs up to whatever level is agreed.  So it does represent a very valuable major step forward in tackling what I hope all our people would agree is the most urgent need of our community, namely, to find work for our young people in particular. It is for that reason that I would ask all those who are going to vote on this proposed national understanding to weigh very carefully the arguments for and against acceptance and rejection and to make sure that they appreciate fully the nature of the case that is being made to them.</P>
    <P>If we can succeed in taking these first steps in launching this national understanding then it is my view that we can very quickly move ahead to build on that initial advance to work out a more detailed programme of action to follow in later years.  If, on the other hand, the national understanding or the approach enshrined in it is rejected it will represent a major setback to the development of democratic planning in our community. It will mean that many of the wishes and aspirations of our people as expressed through their trade unions and other organisations, for a greater voice in the running of our affairs will remain frustrated.  It will mean also that the Government will of course press ahead with whatever action appears necessary to safeguard the interest of the people and to ensure that the rapid economic and social advance of recent years is not halted by unnecessary obstacles of our own making.</P>
    <P>In this whole area of seeking to bring about greater awareness and greater <Col N="376" /> participation by people in the ordering of their own affairs we face the greatest question mark of all about our future. To some of a pessimistic nature this question mark is seen as perhaps the greatest threat to future progress.  There is the feeling that it is the enemy within the gates, the attitudes and tensions which lie within ourselves and which lead to confrontation, disruption and damage to our social fabric, that ultimately pose greater threats to our future progress than all the external challenges which modern societies must face.  To those of a more optimistic disposition this question mark remains one more challenge to be successfully met and overcome.  While no one can foretell the course of events in this area of human behaviour, we can, at least, say that this is one dimension in which the future is of our own making.  We have it within ourselves to resolve these tensions and conflicts, and to develop peaceful procedures for the resolution of disputed issues.</P>
    <P>The need for reliance on the peaceful resolution of social conflicts grows more evident daily.  Progress has brought untold improvements in our living standards; but it has also produced a way of life increasingly vulnerable and dependent on the actions of others.  Each day we witness examples of how our way of life can be disrupted by the actions of those groups whose numbers may be few and whose motivation obscure.  It is the nature of modern society that many people find themselves with this power to damage the community at little cost to themselves.  We cannot hope to sustain our progress as a nation unless we can put an end to the excessive and misplaced use of power.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the development of an effective planning system can play a key role in this process.  By identifying the problems which confront us, by spelling out the choices for action open to us, and by giving our people an effective voice in deciding on the course of action, planning can play a powerful role in producing that better tomorrow to which we all aspire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for the courtesy extended to <Col N="377" /> me in sending me his notes last night and the great bulk of his speech this morning. I believe that in cases like this the Government and the Opposition could be a lot more courteous to one another and that there is no loss to the reputation of the Minister concerned if he shows normal courtesy.  The toughest job of an Opposition spokesman&mdash;this is the first time I have done this&mdash;is in speaking on the Estimate after the Minister.  This is also the first time for the Minister.  I am not taking from the Minister's courtesy but this is a rather narrower Department than the Department of Transport and Power or the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy where the wide range to be covered makes it extremely difficult for an Opposition spokesman.  I appreciate the courtesy which the Minister showed to me and also, I believe, to Deputy Pattison.  Go raibh maith agat.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary in the length of time the Minister was speaking in regard to the Department he is so concerned about and with planning the economy that, except in relation to the rather distant future when he spoke of &ldquo;Europe Plus 30&rdquo;, he did not refer to two things which have tremendous bearing on our economy at the moment, the EMS and the oil crisis, to which I will come back later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to start off by taking up the point on which the Minister finished, that is in relation to the national understanding. I welcome this understanding. I gather from what the Minister said this morning that there are points in it which can at least be discussed after it has been accepted, if it is accepted.  I hope that that will be the case.  It is essential in these almost precarious times that we should have stability and industrial peace if we are to achieve the growth in the economy which is so necessary for our future happiness and the future wellbeing of ourselves and our children.  We want growth in jobs, growth in our living standards, but perhaps most important of all we want a growth in confidence in ourselves and in our future.  I am not talking about the type of confidence that was spoken about by Fianna Fáil Ministers when members of the Opposition <Col N="378" /> before the last election in which they so tiresomely talked about business confidence and the confidence necessary for investment.  They have done a lot to erode that confidence since then.</P>
    <P>That confidence was very well established by the time the Government came to office.  It stemmed from the fact that there was the other confidence, which I will speak about, in one another when they assumed office.  I would like to quote the words of the Taoiseach, when he spoke in the Adjournment Debate of 14 December 1977, just six months after the Government came to office.  The Taoiseach listed the achievements of the economy over the previous two years and said:</P>
    <P>For the second year running the rise in the volume of our industrial exports will be well above that of world trade in manufactures.... A most encouraging feature of the 1977 returns is the continued increase in the importance of the continental EEC countries as a market for Irish exports. In January-October 1977, which is the latest period for which detailed statistics are available, our exports to the seven continental members of the EEC advanced by more than 47 per cent&mdash;the highest rate of increase recorded for any of our principal markets.... Industry, generally, has also fared well.  In the first half of this year, output was more than 8 per cent higher than a year earlier.  The year-on-year increases in July and August, though not as high as in the first six months, are also encouraging.</P>
    <P>This is the scenario he was painting in the Adjournment Debate.  He finished up by saying:</P>
    <P>This is the sort of foundation on which we can build if we manage our affairs properly.</P>
    <P>I leave to the House and the general public the thought as to whether we have in fact managed our affairs properly in the interim.  The type of confidence which the business community felt and which we felt in one another at the time we left office may seem a strange thing to say in view of the trouncing we got in <Col N="379" /> the last election.  At that time I believe there was a realisation that everybody was concerned in everyone else's welfare and if there were sacrifices to be made they were sacrifices to be made by everybody and if there were gains then those gains should be available, as far as possible, to everybody.</P>
    <P>One of the things I find disturbing in the very recent past and at this moment is the lack of trust in one another, the lack of confidence and the belief that other people are scoring points off us and to right our position we must do the same to them.</P>
    <P>I noticed this morning a man who obviously having got petrol at one station pulled out of that station and joined the queue at the next station.  He probably got enough petrol in the first station to keep him going for a few days but immediately to join another queue and grab the petrol which should have gone to another motorist is morally, if not legally, wrong.  This is too common a phenomenon in Irish society today. There is a lack of confidence between employer and employees, between neighbours and between parents and children but we want particularly to have confidence in our Government. That is as important to us in Opposition as it is to the Government party.  The people must have confidence that the Government know what they are doing, are in command of the situation and can handle the problems which inevitably must arrive on the Ministers' desks almost daily.  Proof that this confidence does not exist can be seen from the threatened bank strike, the continuing Post Office strike and so on.</P>
    <P>I heard on the news today and read in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning what the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy said here last night:</P>
    <P>He could, he agreed, use the price mechanism, flooding the country with petrol and diesel oil, if he were to forget the consequences and allow prices to reach German levels. However, he had different responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Ireland could not afford the sort of policy employed in Germany: the cost <Col N="380" /> would be an extra £100 million per annum on our balance of payments deficit.  There had to be another way.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister or any member of the Government realise the cost to the economy of the Post Office strike?  My guess is that it is very much in excess of £100 million.  There have been great losses to the tourist industry and to the business community, many payments cannot be made inside or outside the country and the ESB and many other semi-State bodies have many bills outstanding. If the national understanding can help to change that situation, it is a good thing.  Industrial peace should be our first priority.</P>
    <P>I am glad to add my voice to that of the Minister's in asking the unions, who will vote on this at the delegate conference at the end of the month, to think about their future and about what some people might argue are the overgenerous wage improvements which are being offered under this agreement, to vote in favour of it.  With the biggest union in the country having set its face against it, this will be difficult.  The Minister and the Government could do two things to facilitate its acceptance. The first deals with the tax rebate.  At the last paragraph dealing with taxation in the national understanding it says:</P>
    <P>As a contribution to promoting the present National Understanding, the Government will provide a special allowance for PAYE taxpayers at a cost of approximately £39 million in 1979.  This allowance will operate in December, provided (1) that the budgetary position is reasonably in line with expectations, and (2) that any funds needed for employment creation, which is a first priority, have been made available.</P>
    <P>The second condition attaching to the payment of the £39 million rebate at the end of the year probably refers to what the Minister mentioned here today.  Subparagraph (1) of the section dealing with employment in the national understanding reads:</P>
    <P>... The Employer and Industry organisations will contribute 50 per cent of the necessary finance for this <Col N="381" /> programme, to yield up to £10 million, collected by means of a ½ per cent surcharge on the employer social security contribution.</P>
    <P>It says that the Government will underwrite such a shortfall up to a ceiling of 5,000 jobs.  This will be achieved by the special public and private sector employment programme and for this purpose the employers and industry will contribute up to £10 million.  I asked the Minister for Finance during the debate on the Finance Bill, and he did not refer to it in his closing speech but maybe this Minister could tell us if there is a connection between the £39 million rebate and the money made available for job creation. The Minister should remove both conditions from the repayment of the £39 million and he should rethink the ½ per cent surcharge on the employers' social welfare contribution.  By nature it is a punishment on employers if the Government job targets are not met.  The national understanding was drawn up by three different groups.  No doubt the employers wish to see those targets achieved&mdash;&mdash;25,000 extra jobs in 1979&mdash;&mdash; but the employers who make their contribution towards achieving their proportion of the increase in jobs will have to pay a ½ per cent increase in their social security contributions as well as those employers who make no effort and do not increase their employment.  In other words, employers will be taxed to the tune of a ½ per cent on their social security contributions to help achieve targets which were set by the Government. They will be equally responsible for paying this, but to those employers who make no effort the .5 per cent surcharge may seem very small.</P>
    <P>This needs to be clarified.  It is not .5 per cent on the employer's social security contribution.  In other words, if an employer is now deducting £1,000 a week from wages as a social security contribution I presume he is not being asked to pay £1,050.  It is an extra .5 per cent.  It would be 10.1 of what the employer would be asked to pay, which is quite sizeable because the firms in which we have the greater chance of increasing employment are those who have the higher wage structures.  Those <Col N="382" /> firms established here within the last ten years who have come in from outside are responsible principally for the large growth in our exports over the last few years.  They have been expanding more rapidly than have the indigenous Irish firms who have been for many reasons under threat and attack in all parts of the world, not just in Ireland.  These newer, certainly more growth-conscious and possibly more profitable firms are charged equally with firms who do not make an effort to expand their employment. If that were to be removed&mdash;and consequential on that would be the removal of paragraph (i) because it appears logical to assume that there is a connection between them even though there is nothing to indicate that there is&mdash;then the budgetary position would be reasonably in line with expectations. Workers should not be made responsible for something which may be totally outside their control.</P>
    <P>The Government may argue that they cannot at this stage say what will be happening at the end of the year or whether the money will be available because there are so many external factors. In many spheres the Government make promises dating not just to the end of the present year but right down into the future.  The IDA take on an obligation to a new firm coming into this country and the first payment may not be available until the year after next.  Yet the Government commit themselves now to paying it.  In that regard the Government should and can also commit themselves to refunding this tax without conditions at the end of the year to help get this national understanding which all Members of this House would wish to see agreed on at the delegates' conference at the end of May.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Estimate for this Department, I do not know whether there is a misprint here.  They have estimated that the Post Office services for 1979 would cost only a little over 50 per cent of what they cost in 1978.  I suspect that in a number of Estimates produced in 1978 the Post Office figures were written into the Estimate by the Minister on the basis that he would face the consequences of their being wrong at the end of the year but this would help him <Col N="383" /> to keep within his allocation and to spend money in other directions during the year.  It is impossible to say whether that is right or wrong because of the disruption in the postal services and the lack of balancing of any set of books in various Departments for 1978.  I hope the Minister will be able to show me that I am wrong in this and that what is in the Estimate for 1978, £25,000, proved completely wrong.</P>

      <P>I withdraw any bad thoughts I may have had about the Minister.  It is nearly irresistible for a Minister to appear to be a good boy, to be the spender of money.  Of course, for Governments as well as for householders and industry, there is not an unlimited amount of money.  As a country we can, just as easily as an individual can, live outside our means.  If we do not ensure that the way we operate in this country provides growth in the future, if we continue to make demands on Government for various services and at the same time make demands for reduction in taxation, then there is only one way that a Government can remain temporarily afloat and that is by borrowing.  This, no responsible Government, no matter what party they belong to, would want to continue for long.  The Minister for Finance was thumping the desk here last Tuesday night at the conclusion of the winding-up speech on Second Stage of the Finance Bill.  He said that they were concerned about growth.  This was the great truth that had been handed down to him on a tablet.  One would think that other Governments were not concerned with growth or were disputing that growth was important for this country.  I have said frequently and continue to say that one of the sure roads that we can take to achieve the very desirable and worthwhile goal of full employment that the Minister enunciated here this morning is steady, sustained economic growth which must be based on exports, and our exports must be based on productivity and the competitiveness of the goods we export.  If we do not keep those three <Col N="384" /> things in flashing bulbs over all our desks we will not achieve this.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's very desirable aim of full employment for all our people.  When this Department was set up in October 1977 I said, as stated in the Official Report of 19 October 1977, columns 717 and 718, Volume 300:</P>
      <P>.... So the essential task of Government is to seek the consent of the population for an orderly growth in incomes compatible with the desired growth in employment and the ability of the economy to grow.</P>
      <P>It is no easy task especially when the existing pattern of distribution and structure of taxation gave rise to a great deal of unrest and disillusionment. We found on taking office that the ordinary worker, the ordinary wage or salary earner, was convinced that the well off, the very wealthy, were not paying their fair share of taxes.  The income tax system was considered a scandal which had remained virtually unchanged since 1960 when PAYE was introduced. Death duties were paid.... We realised that there was no hope of a workable plan unless the Government were able to obtain the consent of the population for the moderation of income growth in order to create more jobs.  This meant that workers must feel that they got a fair deal from the tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that 18 months ago, in October 1977, when speaking about our aims in government which were evidently exactly the same as those of this Government&mdash;the creation of jobs, even though this Government appear to think they are the only people who ever thought that the creation of jobs or an orderly growth in incomes was important. There is no doubt that since I said that about the ordinary people feeling they are not getting a fair deal under the present taxation system, nothing has happened to make them feel&mdash;after two budgets of this Government&mdash;that they are now getting any fairer deal.  The Minister quoted figures this morning to show that the less well-off, both as a result of the budget and the national understanding, <Col N="385" /> would be better off.  The Minister present and the Minister for Finance can argue as much as they like about the 1977 and 1978 budgets and how fair they were.  But when the 1979 budget was introduced I said, immediately after the Minister had finished, that when the small print was read outside the House people would realise there was nothing in it for them.  That was absolutely correct.  It is one of the factors accounting for the march a few months ago, that people believe they are not being treated fairly in this regard.</P>
    <P>I had a piece of paper with figures prepared for me by an accountant which I seem to have mislaid.  If I may cite the example of a single person earning £6,000 a year&mdash;which may seem a big salary but there are many people working in many factories, in the civil service, guards with overtime, people in all sorts of jobs around the country earning that amount&mdash;after that budget, with the removal of the 20 per cent band, and the consequent pushing of taxpayers' incomes into the higher bands, that person is less well-off than he was prior to 6 April last, fractionally, but he is less well-off.  Let us take a married man on the same salary, with three children.  We all know people in that category, who are very heavily mortgaged and are trying to educate their children.  I know that schooling can be free now but nonetheless there are costs in education. Running a car becomes more expensive daily.  Electricity has become more expensive. At present that man and his family are not leading a very glamorous life.  Again, from my memory of the figures prepared for me, that man, under the last budget, will be better off to the tune of approximately £26 per annum, or 50p a week.  That is what the last budget meant to him.</P>
    <P>Minister say that there have been very generous increases given in the allowances, When that becomes headlines in the following morning's papers: &ldquo;Huge Increase in Allowances&rdquo;, and they are good increases in allowances, but when the tax demand arrives the first week after these come into operation, the person who thought he would benefit discovers (a), that he is fractionally <Col N="386" /> worse off or, (b), as in the case of the married man I quoted, marginally better off, there is a feeling of frustration, annoyance and lack of confidence in a Government they feel are pulling the wool over their eyes.  Then there will be the tax protesters' marches, industrial unrest, the lack of confidence which seems to run throughout the economy in many ways, with everybody suspicious of everybody else, all trying to better ourselves at one another's expense.  Then there will be that type of uneasiness throughout the economy.</P>
    <P>It was this to which I was referring when I spoke in the debate setting up this Department 18 months ago, that this was the situation we had to set about rectifying in our four years of office in exceedingly difficult times.  The Minister for Finance in particular and other Ministers seem to like to refer all of the problems in the economy back to the Coalition days, that it was the Coalition who were responsible.  That kind of pettiness wears very thin.  I suggest that that kind of talk hardly serves well the party in government because people may well make comparisons.  They may well feel that the times in which we were governing were considerably more difficult than at present.  They could very reasonably come to the conclusion that the handling of the economy at that time was very much surer than at present.  If any Member of this House goes anywhere people congregate, be it to a pub, a match, a queue in a shopping centre, the cry from everybody is that the Government are not governing.  That is no clearer in any field that that of energy and the present oil situation. When the Minister said that he could flood this country with petrol and diesel oil if we were willing to pay the price, I wonder if that is true.  Is the present situation about energy supplies all over the world related purely to price?  Is there no shortage factor, a particular shortfall in the case of Iran?  Has not the scarcity of energy been signalled for the past 40 years and, along with other western countries, have we not ignored the many warnings given us?  We have continued to go our profligate way in the use of energy.  Have we made any effort to conserve what has been said for 20 <Col N="387" /> years is a finite resource which will run out?  Indeed, was it a wise time to move energy into the Department of Industry and Commerce?  Would it not have been wiser to have moved the elements of energy in that Department back into Transport and Power, to have moved the tourism element in Transport and Power into Industry and Commerce where it might have been more at home within industry, a badly suffering industry on two accounts now because of the postal dispute and energy shortage? Is the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy the most suitable person to be dealing with this very delicate set of negotiations?</P>

      <P>At the outset I expressed the view that it was extraordinary that the Minister in reviewing the work of his Department in presenting the Estimate for the current year did not refer to two things which most affect our economy, the oil shortage and how it is being handled and the European Monetary System.  I have had some experience of handling an oil crisis.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy last night told the House that it was intended to set up a limited company to buy oil.  Presumably, that was a Government decision and one which comes into the broad field of planning. The Minister told us that the setting up <Col N="388" /> of that company will benefit the economy but I do not understand the thinking behind it.  Maybe I am stupid but I should like to know from whom the Government intend buying the oil?  Will they buy from the oil companies in a Government deal?  Will it be any cheaper and if so why would the Mexican Government, who were mentioned, sell oil cheaper to Ireland than to the United States, Chile or Great Britain?  Have we some special relationship with other governments that allows us to buy oil cheaper?  If we are to buy oil from the oil companies who still control much of the distribution throughout the world why will they sell it to a State company cheaper than they would sell to one of their own subsidiaries in Ireland?  What will the new limited company do that the oil companies are not doing at present or that some other State agency could not do? Will this new company be wedged in between existing State companies that buy oil directly?  Will it take a profit between the ESB and whatever the ESB's source of energy is or is it, as I suspect, purely a face-saving exercise on behalf of the Minister concerned because he got himself involved in a verbal battle after being unconcerned about the energy situation for three months.  The Minister got himself into a confrontation with the oil companies prior to Easter which was unjustified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The actions of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in relation to oil make the job of the Minister before the House exceedingly difficult, if not impossible.  No thought was given, apparently, to future oil supplies for the country.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development said this morning that his Department has a relevance to all other Departments and that all other Departments have a relevance to his Department.  I should like to pay tribute to him.  It has been <Col N="389" /> mentioned to me by people who were involved in the recent negotiations that they found him to be courteous, informed, willing to take points and appreciative of the difficulties of both sides. Those tributes were paid by a representative from the employer side and one from the trade unions.  That description of the Minister is correct.  However, while I agree that it is necessary to plan well into the future&mdash;I was glad that he was concerned to take up the huge issues exposed by the &ldquo;Europe Plus 30&rdquo;&mdash;the problem here is what is happening now. Who is planning the end of the postal dispute?  Who is planning to see that the oil supplies that are available are fairly distributed and that everybody gets a fair share?  Who is planning for what will happen to our currency <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling if the new British Government decide not to enter the EMS?  Who is planning those things for now?  I congratulate the Minister on his forward planning in other regards but our problems relate to today.  There will not be any future for any of us unless somebody sits down to do the ordinary things that must be done if our economy is to be kept moving forward.  We left a strong and thriving economy behind us and we have no better authority for that statement than the Taoiseach.  However, the Government seemed to get everything out of focus.  I beg the Minister to continue his work for the future but, for God's sake, to get some of his colleagues to do something about the dreadful condition of our economy now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the previous speaker in thanking the Minister for his courtesy in letting us have the outline of this morning's contribution. It was very helpful.  I should like to know whether it was coincidental or deliberate that the debate on the Minister's Estimate was arranged at a time when we are between the conclusion of the negotiations which brought about the national understanding and the consideration of those proposals by the various unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be unfortunate if at this stage there are to be a number of contributions to the debate, some for and some against acceptance of the national understanding, <Col N="390" /> from the point of view merely of narrow political considerations.  There should be a debate on the subject but at a time when the proposals are being considered it is not appropriate to have such discussion.  The Government, the employers and the trade unions have spent a considerable amount of time negotiating the terms of the national understanding and we are now at an extremely delicate point when we should be appealing to all concerned to study very carefully the terms of the proposals and to vote according to their judgment. The phraseology used by the Minister in this regard was unfortunate because he seemed to imply that rejection would represent a major setback to the development of democratic planning. But the proposals can be rejected only by reason of the wishes of a majority in the unions.  Therefore, I fail to understand how a democratic decision could upset democratic planning.</P>
    <P>At this stage I wish to make it clear that anything I say should not be taken as encouraging either acceptance or rejection of the proposals.  Rather, I would wish my words to be directed towards encouraging people to study the proposals very carefully, to have regard to the advice given to them and then to use their judgment when voting.  The position of this party in regard to the national understanding is that we will await the decision of the unions.  When that decision has been reached we shall consider it appropriate to comment.  In the meantime we have the utmost confidence in the trade union movement and in its leadership to treat this matter with the serious consideration and deliberation it deserves.  That is why we consider it wrong for the Minister to appear to imply that a rejection of the proposals represents a rejection of democratic planning.  If the national understanding is rejected I am sure that the rejection will be for good and valid reasons but in that event I would be confident of finding a willingness on the part of all concerned to reach a solution as quickly as possible.  It is not right to approach the idea of a consensus on the basis that if the other point of view agrees with one's own point of view there is consensus while if the proposals are rejected <Col N="391" /> by the majority, there is not consensus. That sort of approach would undermine seriously not only the present but future negotiations.</P>
    <P>In the continuing debate on the proposals I trust that nothing will be said to prejudice the work that must be done by the various unions during the coming weeks in communicating to their members the terms of the agreement and, more than anything else, in giving them the leadership which the unions considered it appropriate to give.  It is the duty of union leadership to give advice and any advice that has been given so far in this instance, whether in terms of acceptance or of rejection of the proposals, has been based on good reasoning and after careful consideration of the terms of the proposals.  If, as the Minister suggested this morning, some of the reasons being put forward by the unions for rejection are based on misunderstandings, there is not a major problem involved.  If the Minister is correct it should be very easy between now and the time of the beginning of the ballot to have any such misunderstandings cleared up.</P>
    <P>However, this House is not the place for such clarification at this stage. Instead, it is a question of the Minister, the unions and the employers going back to the original negotiating table immediately. I am in favour of the principle of such an agreement.  I do not think I should go any further than that at this stage, and it would not be wise for any other Deputy to go any further either. During a debate last year, unfortunately certain allegations were made by members of the Fianna Fáil Party about the internal voting procedures of unions. If those accusations were to be repeated, they would not help in this situation.  I wish the Minister well in his endeavours. If the need arises I hope he will be willing to go back to the negotiating table to iron out any difficulties which may arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to industrial relations.  This is a very important matter. Deputy Barry said the debate on the Minister's Estimate is rather limited in the sense that the Minister's responsibility is limited.  I have the opposite problem because I feel the Minister's <Col N="392" /> responsibilities are very broad in a very vague way.  He is responsible for energy, finance and taxation.  In the Green Paper and the White Paper he has a responsibility for housing, health services, social welfare services, and every aspect of Government policy.  We will find out by trial and error to what extent the Chair will permit us to go into any of those matters.</P>
    <P>There are a few areas I want to dwell on, particularly the area of social policy. I put down amendments to the Bill setting up this Department to ensure that there would be full recognition of the social aspect of planning in the framework of the Department.  The experience of the working of the Department since then has shown that there is very little concern for social planning.  It might be argued that the greatest social need is the creation of employment.  That may be so, but that is not to say other aspects of social development must stand still or slip backwards while we are awaiting the achievement of the social aim of full employment.  I join with the Minister in the hope that we will see full employment in our time.  I wish him well in that aim.</P>
    <P>Where I differ from him is that I believe other social areas must not continue to be neglected pending the outcome of that desirable aim.  Unfortunately, the Department and the Minister had to carry most of the criticisms about the removal of the food subsidies which was a very anti-social action.  It gave the clear impression that the social considerations of the Government were at a very low ebb.  At the time, no compensatory benefits were given.  The food subsidies were part and parcel of a previous national understanding, or national agreement.  There was no consensus. There was no consultation or agreement.  They were just withdrawn in a very callous way.  All forms of social action must go hand in hand, and some social aims must not be sacrificed pending the achievement of full employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a passing reference to sins.  I should like to draw this analogy.  The Minister's main difficulties in planning arise from the original sin of the manifesto.  To carry <Col N="393" /> the comparison further, we can put Fianna Fáil in the role of Eve, the manifesto in the role of the apple, and the people who accepted it in the role of Adam.  That is a very good comparison because, since the manifesto, the country has been labouring under the shadow of that original sin.  I do not know what will have to be done to rid us of the evils which have emanated from the manifesto.  The history of our industrial relations since then has been due to that original sin.  Our problems have been due to the expectations created by the manifesto and the promises of a better life to come&mdash;like the promise in the Garden of Eden&mdash;but, of course, quite the opposite has happened.</P>
    <P>The Minister was right to emphasise the importance of having good industrial relations.  I appeal to him to have a word in the ear of his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Faulkner, and urge him to take an initiative, even at this late stage, to bring about a solution of the postal dispute. That is central to the development of our economy and to the creation of employment. The dispute has gone on for too long.  I urge the Minister to use whatever influence he has to ensure that his colleague takes immediate action to solve it.</P>
    <P>After two years' experience of the Department, I should like the Minister's opinion on a few matters.  At the time the Department were established I was one of those who held that they were not being given sufficient power.  I should like the Minister to comment on the division of responsibility between his Department and the Department of Finance.  In other words, I should like him to comment on the extent to which the work of his Department is limited by the Department of Finance.  By now I imagine the Department of Finance are only bookkeeping and that all social and economic planning is within the ambit of the Minister's responsibility.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to comment on the desirability of his Department controlling the State agencies, particularly the IDA.  I believe that the Minister's Department have greater responsibility for the creation of employment than have the Department of Industry, <Col N="394" /> Commerce and Energy.  It seems anomalous for the IDA, with their almost total obligation to create employment, not to have direct responsibility to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  As the Minister spoke of scenarios, I should like him to comment on that scenario.</P>
    <P>In regard to the National Enterprise Agency, which is not the Labour Party's National Development Corporation, there is no evidence of political will and there appears to be no funding, no staffing and no targets.  It is not clear whether the Minister for Economic Planning and Development or the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy will be responsible for this agency.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in getting the public to accept the Government's sincerity in relation to full employment is that so little has been accomplished since they came into power.  We have evidence of a substantial increase in emigration.  I should also like to know the extent to which the Minister sees emigration as part of the achievement of full employment, as emigration is certainly a factor in the unemployment figures.  Within the past 18 months there have been substantial job losses and an unusual number of redundancies.  The Minister seems to be preoccupied with cost control in relation to wages.  We are all aware of the many price increases which have taken place and for which the Minister cannot be blamed but for which he must bear some responsibility.</P>

      <P>When we joined the EMS the impression was given that the punt would appreciate.  We now know that the punt has depreciated.  However, I am not blaming the Minister for the depreciation in the punt although I am sure that some members of his party would claim credit if it had appreciated. The Minister should outline any plans that he has made in relation to a continuing depreciation of the punt and the possibility that the British may not join the EMS for some time.  It may have advantages; it certainly has disadvantages. It is one of the current economic problems on which I should like the Minister's comments.  Another problem is the energy crisis and the question of transport policy, which is a very important part of the Minister's responsibility. Transport policy is a major part of economic planning and will naturally be tied up with energy policy.  For example, there will have to be a major appraisal of the necessity to give greater financial assistance and investment to public transport. This affects Dublin in particular; the Minister referred to the inner-city area, but whatever transport policy is evolved in the light of the energy policy evolved will affect the country at large. We must have some guidelines pretty quickly on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> Still on the energy situation, there is the question of the development of our own coal resources.  In my constituency, knowledgeable people on these matters hold the Castlecomer area to have viable amounts of coal.  At present, groups of people who are prepared to work physically at this are not getting the encouragement or help from Government agencies that they should get.  It is vitally important at present that any individual or group of individuals prepared to put expertise and knowledge at the disposal of the country, in the sense of providing this very important source of energy, should get every possible financial assistance and encouragement from the Government.  I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that people who approach Government Departments and agencies should be encouraged and, in fact, that these agencies go out to people to encourage this type of enterprise.  It is enterprise on the part of people involved in this work and the agencies will get full co-operation from people with experience in this field and with a lot of knowledge in the area of coal mining.</P>
    <P>In the 1960s, oil was more economic than coal and our coal mining industry was run down and almost allowed to go out of existence.  There is now a very strong case for a complete reversal of that situation and for the offering of the best possible incentives and aids to people who will go into the coal mining business.</P>
    <P>I conclude on one of the matters of the discussion, which is social policy, and on the necessity to keep it in the forefront.  In the Green Paper, on page 86, there is a table, 7.3 entitled &ldquo;Volume and Composition of Public Expenditure&rdquo; which shows that in 1978, 1979 and 1980 the amounts under the social heading are static at 45 in 1978; 44 in 1979 and 44 in 1980.  This will, in real terms, represent a decline in social spending.  One of the Minister's answers to that is that he hopes unemployment will decline, which will account for a lessening amount, in real terms, of social expenditure.  We must be prepared for an increase in social expenditure.  When social expenditure is predominantly devoted to unemployment payments, other areas of social necessity often go <Col N="397" /> short.  When the demands on social expenditure for unemployment purposes diminish, it should be possible to build up social expenditure in the very many other necessary areas.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will deal with some of the matters to which I have referred and that nothing will be said in this debate to interfere, or seem to interfere, with the democratic process now under way and the examination now under way, in coming to a decision on national expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Estimate for the Department of Economic Planning and Development and congratulate the Minister and his staff on the work they have been doing since this Department was formed.  We must give credit to the Minister and his Department for what they have undertaken.  They are dealing with most complex scientific, economic and other problems.  To establish such a Department and make it function in a practical and workmanlike way is a major challenge and one for which sufficient credit has not been given.  The Department is working and has tackled some of the economic and scientific problems facing us.</P>
      <P>We all know the part the Department played in the European Monetary System.  Deputy Barry was critical of the Minister for not dwelling on his contribution in that respect.  In fairness to the Minister we have had a substantial and detailed debate on the EMS and have had detailed reviews by the Minister of the work which was done by his Department in that area.  I appreciate that the Minister has not given us a rehash of that debate.</P>
      <P>This Department is a new one.  There was great discussion and trepidation about it at the outset and about whether it could make a practical contribution.  It has made a practical contribution that is in every way due to the Minister and his own competence and capability in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimate before us is for an increase of the order of £1.582 million which is naturally a reasonably substantial percentage increase at this early stage of the development of the Department. <Col N="398" /> One could say that one would be concerned that money would be well spent in the early stages of development and that there would be no instance of empire building in Departments.  If one looks through the Estimate one finds that the Minister has been careful in that respect.  The bulk of the increase in expenditure, almost £1.4 million, goes to the National Board for Science and Technology as a grant-in-aid.  That leads us to look at the board itself.  It was set up on 5 April 1978 and is still engaged in building up its staff and defining and developing its work programme.  The Minister has pointed out that, through the National Board for Science and Technology, energy research and development are being studied and investigated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry was critical of the Minister for not presenting any report in relation to energy or for not mentioning it.  Energy is mentioned within the context of the National Board for Science and Technology.  The board has a key function in our economy and in the development of our society.  It is important that the board would have the highest level of scientists and technologists available to it both on a permanent and on a consulting basis.  It is important that in its task of co-ordinating and stimulating the activities of other scientific and technological institutes it would encourage mobility and avoid silting up in these organisations where people can become settled within particular spheres and areas of research when their contributions could be far greater in other areas.  This is a problem which develops in research organisations.</P>
    <P>The board should do all in its power to avoid duplication in this area and in research generally.  There has to be a certain amount of duplication but it should be avoided on any substantial scale.  The principal function of the board should be to act as a catalyst and prime mover in the development of research programmes in that it would stimulate the various research bodies and other Departments to undertake or participate in projects which would be of value to the country and then fall back from these at the appropriate time and <Col N="399" /> leave the various agencies to carry on the work.  In some of the principal British research organisations the concept of a prime mover has been used to a great extent over the past 15 or 20 years with considerable success.  The board, rather than just building itself up, should concentrate on developing programmes where they are not available at present and stimulating other organisations to develop programmes in areas where they have responsibility.  It is important that the board relates science and technology to the practical needs of industry.  Too often in the past we have seen the ivory tower approach where research&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Could I ask permission, on a point of order, of the Ceann Comhairle to raise on the adjournment a matter I raised previously, the non-cooperation of the interests involved in implementing the 2 per cent levy with a consequent danger of an increase in meat prices and what measures the Government are taking to avoid such a consequence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of integrated programmes is very important. I have found that, once one understands the research area one is dealing with, it is possible to meet people from other sectors both within the country and outside and integrate the results and achievements of various research institutes into a practical programme directed towards practical and immediate needs.  It is not possible to do this unless one has technological and scientific strength as an individual.  That is why we must have people of the highest scientific calibre. They can perform a valuable function in integrating the results of various research institutes into workable programmes which are related to industry needs or new industry possibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through this board the Government have the means to look at science and technology in a co-ordinated way.  This has been lacking for some time.  With the <Col N="400" /> development of this body I hope the co-ordinated approach on behalf of the Government will be advanced.  Hitherto Departments have been operating separately, each attempting to make its own contribution and, very often, without the appropriate technological or scientific staffs.  On behalf of the Government the National Board for Science and Technology have this opportunity to co-ordinate the work of the various Departments and it is important that this be used properly and that the management approach is well thought out.  Our Minister for Economic Planning and Development is, therefore, in effect also our Minister for science and technology and science and technology have a very major contribution to make to our economic and social development. The formulation of our policies must be directed towards our national economic and social objectives and here we need to prepare and develop a national programme for science and technology. If in the past we have under-estimated an area we have certainly underestimated the potential of job creation through innovation and scientific and technological development.  Through the board I would hope that this shortcoming in our organisation structures would be overcome and I look forward to the increase in job creation through the work of the National Board for Science and Technology.</P>
    <P>One of the areas mentioned is that of energy policy research.  Recently we have heard many contributions and views on the shortages of energy, on the possible uses of energy and on the system which might be designed for the optimum use of energy.  This is something which the National Board for Science and Technology could well undertake and give us very considerable information on the whole question of energy systems and balance in the use of energy.  It is currently a matter of high priority so far as the country is concerned and I trust that in the allocation of the extra resources to this body it will receive a high priority.</P>
    <P>The national board have already made considerable headway in the area of biomass study.  It is quite well known <Col N="401" /> that we have a fairly optimal environment for biomass and for the conversion of biomass products into energy. Through the agency of the National Board for Science and Technology we have already seen a co-ordination between the ESB, Bord na Móna and An Foras Talúntais in the plans for the development of biomass and in the studies which are currently going on.  I would urge the utmost support for the National Board for Science and Technology in this area.</P>
    <P>Coal has been mentioned as one of the world resources which has further potential and of course as the price of oil and other energy resources increases the position of coal will become more realistic and more economically viable within the international energy situation. It is said that the resources of coal will last for 500 to 1,000 years.  Today of course coal is trans-shipped mainly in its bulkiest form and consequently there would be considerable difficulty in the ports alone in handling the volume of coal which will be involved if we go into a much greater usage of coal.  As an energy source it must in the future become an international product which is moved about, shipped, transported and stored with greater facility.  Here the developments which are being studied with great intensity at this stage, the gasification of coal and the liquefaction of coal, are extremely important for the future.  Their implementation may be 15 years away but it is very important for us that we know what way this technology is developing.  If we can have gasified or liquefied coal or a mix in the future it will have very great implications for all economic planning and conservation and energy plans generally.</P>
    <P>Although we may realise that these are possibilities and we may consider their potential, we need people like the kind of people who are being taken on by the National Board for Science and Technology to get down to the basic technological issues and give us reasonable and realistic assessments of the future potential so that in the overall economic planning and development the options can be fully understood when <Col N="402" /> coal is compared with any of the other options we have.  The whole area of coal is quite an exciting one internationally. Of course the factor which has militated very much against the development of coal in the matter of higher technology has been the relatively low price of oil but with that situation changing almost daily at this stage the future position of coal is one which needs very close study. I hope that this is something that the National Board for Science and Technology will bear in mind and will give high priority to.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the question of marine policy as one of the areas which was being considered.  I know that the OECD have been critical of us for our lack of development in this area.  I welcome the fact that the board are taking this area seriously and I look forward to the potential developments which can come from it.</P>
    <P>The question of telecommunications was mentioned briefly by the Minister as an area in which the board are interested. There could not be a more appropriate time to have this board established and to have it working on this problem.  At a time when we can communicate with the moon and with people in the United States and in various other parts of the world, our internal telecommunications system is well known to be outdated and in need of a major injection of capital and technological development.  The Government have set aside the capital in the budget for this sort of development.  At present we have 15 telephones per 100 people; in the EEC generally there are 30 telephones per 100 people and the EEC figure is growing at a fairly fast rate and is expected to be 50 per cent up on that in the near future.  So the need to communicate is particularly important and the need to install new equipment internally is important.</P>
    <P>There are major technological changes taking place in the whole area of telecommunications.  There are tremendous advances taking place here. I am very glad to see that the National Board for Science and Technology have taken this area of telecommunications as one of their priority research and <Col N="403" /> development areas.  I hope that this can be linked with the other developments which are taking place here.  We know that the Post Office Review Committee are due to report in the near future.  Once that report is available decisions must be taken quickly and technology must move quickly with these decisions because we will be making investments which will last for many years ahead and major capital investments in a very crucial area.  I would certainly not like to see delay in reaching these decisions.  I am very glad to see that as one of their early priorities the National Board for Science and Technology have taken this telecommunications area to heart.  I would hope that consequently they will have some indication available for the Government at an early stage so that the decisions can be taken quickly following the report of the Post Office Review Committee.  These will have a major impact on our whole telecommunications system and it is important in the interests of the country, of the economy and of the people in general that these technological aspects of this development would be fully and comprehensively considered by people of a high level of technical ability.  I would assume from the Minister's statement that people of this capability have been employed in this area.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the design and selection of this equipment.  I see the National Board for Science and Technology as having a major contribution to make here.  I look forward in the future to detailed reports from them.  I know the board are only at the end of their first year of operation and I understand they are making very considerable headway.  I welcome seeing their first report in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I also trust that in future we will have more detailed reports on those matters from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development because I believe they are of fundamental importance to many of the issues we discuss here on a day to day basis.  Those people have the opportunity to sit back and look at them in a much broader context which can be of great value to us in our day to day considerations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> The NESC have given us many valuable and far-reaching reports.  The Minister pointed out in his speech that they are a well-established and well-recognised body, and I support that.  He said that consequently it is not really necessary to go into their background at this stage because we are all well aware of the work they do.  There are many criticisms of such boards and bodies but the work which they do in an objective way is very valuable to the discussions which take place in the House.</P>
    <P>The third point in the Minister's speech I would like to refer to is regional planning and development.  In considering the question of physical planning and regional development I think particularly of the Dublin area where there are enormous planning problems.  They have been inherited by this Department because they now have a broad responsibility for overall planning and development. There have been numerous reports presented over the last 20 years on possible developments within the various regions throughout the country in relation to growth centres and other possibilities. Now we have a Department which can co-ordinate those reports and fit them into the national system.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have failed to provide a road system to meet the city's expanding needs.  I listened with great interest to Deputy Blaney saying in the House that while he was Minister for Local Government the money was available but Dublin Corporation could not make the necessary decisions to undertake the developments which the then Government considered necessary.  I was very interested in that statement because it was made in the context of development generally in Dublin. Deputy Blaney said he had no particular reason to support the Minister for the Environment but he said he felt it was only right to put on record the fact that this was the case.  This is probably because there is such a divided situation in regard to the planning of road structures. The corporation are responsible for the provision and the maintenance of the road system in Dublin, although finance for road development must come from central Government funds.  Public <Col N="405" /> transport is the responsibility of CIE, land use in Dublin is the responsibility of the city planning department, while traffic management is the responsibility of the city engineer and the Garda.  The responsibility is divided and the problems are not tackled in a co-ordinated way.</P>
    <P>The solution here, which I hope the Department for Economic Planning and Development will pursue, is the establishment of a transport authority for Dublin, directly under the Department of Transport and Power, and responsible for roads, parking, traffic regulations, public transport and investment priorities for the Dublin area.  This is one of the most urgent aspects of physical design, planning and regional development which faces us now.  I should like to see the Minister put forward to the Government plans to bring about an early development of such a transport authority for Dublin.</P>
    <P>This must be a very comprehensive plan and it must look fully at activity within the city.  There is no point in telling people that they should use buses if we do not provide bus shelters.  It can be very cold, windy and wet even at the best times of the year and standing in the cold and rain at a bus stop without anything behind one other than a wall or a hedge is today a little antediluvian. Surely we can do better in relation to bus shelters.  The wind and rain are a great problem.  I have had numerous representations from associations about improving bus shelters or providing them in many areas.  The cost of provision arises, so this is a question of investment.  I believe that more of the available resources would be allocated for bus shelters if we were serious about a comprehensive transport policy.  A number of bus shelters are erected by advertisers, but these are one-sided shelters so that motorists can see the advertisements. I know there are larger bus shelters which are two-sided.  We must look comprehensively at planning.  There is no point in saying that we will have faster buses or that we will encourage people to go by bus if we do not go the whole way and ensure that resources are <Col N="406" /> allocated to such simple matters which are so crucial for many people.</P>
    <P>There are various other matters which must be considered.  There is the question of permanent on-street parking, which should not be allowed in many areas.  There is the breach of regulations which results in choking traffic within the city.  There is the question of commercial vehicles making deliveries during any time of the day.  We find in other cities throughout Europe that there are strict hours within which deliveries can be made or they are made entirely outside working hours.  We also find CIE buses parked in large numbers at strategic points blocking the free flow of traffic.  This is to create a pool of buses ready for use.  If we are to provide resources and facilities surely we should be prepared to provide land for parking and pool areas for those buses and for commercial vehicles.</P>
    <P>The port is fundamental to our physical system.  We find that the roll-on roll-off service is growing at a tremendous rate.  I understand there will be further major developments in this area within the next year or two as a result of which traffic to and from the port will almost double in terms of juggernauts and large vehicles.  Where are these juggernauts to go?  We must have ring and feeder roads, otherwise traffic will come to a standstill.  The eastern by-pass is essential to relieve the traffic in the centre city and will cater for the port.  A western circular ring road is also essential.</P>
    <P>If we are to have good physical planning we must have these roads to relieve this traffic congestion.  We must also build an appropriate rail system.  It is clearly urgent that we upgrade our rolling stock on the Howth to Bray line which is very heavily used and extend the hours during which the service is provided.  To facilitate those using railways, we need low fare single deck buses to bring commuters from the railway stations to offices and shops.  I mention these matters because they are an integral part of any planning in a region.  I am talking now about the Dublin region in particular.  There is no point telling people to use trains, ease <Col N="407" /> traffic flow and save energy unless buses are provided to bring them on short runs when they arrive in the city.  Perhaps we could have a system similar to that which operates at London Airport and other places where smaller buses do a circuit of the city.  This would provide a very welcome service and should be considered very seriously.</P>
    <P>The same applies to provincial areas. We should encourage the use of mainline trains.  The Cork train is very well used but when one arrives in Cork one may have a problem reaching one's final destination, if one has to make even a short journey.  We should encourage people to use trains.  If more people used them there would be a considerable saving in energy.  I would only accept such an approach if we had a comprehensive train service which provided for the needs of the people during and at the end of their rail journey.  This is where we fell down in the past.  We said people should be using the trains and buses more but we did not face up to the reality that nobody wants to stand at a bus stop and be drenched while waiting for a bus.</P>
    <P>This is part of the total planning I believe is necessary and I hope the Department will bring that kind of concept into operation so that we will overcome some of our greatest problems. Dublin is by far the greatest problem area in this respect and that is why I am dwelling on it.</P>
    <P>Recognising that regional planning and development are major aspects of the work of this Department, I find it hard to understand how the Department can cope with as much work as they do. They have an enormous task ahead of them.  For such a new Department they are making great headway.  Regional planning and development have become more urgent in view of the energy problems which have been with us for some time.  Many people wanted to bury their heads in the sand and pretend these problems did not exist, or blamed the Minister.  I am amazed when I hear people say that the Minister is admitting that there is a problem.  We all know there has been a problem since 1974. Energy is and will continue to be a major problem and we must address <Col N="408" /> ourselves very seriously to it.  I hope the Department will have that as a first priority.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the national understanding and gave a good deal of attention to it.  I do not intend to deal with it at any great length.  Deputy Barry said what we really wanted was industrial peace which is essential for growth.  I agree with him wholeheartedly. I trust that not only he but members of the Labour Party also share his desire and will work for it instead of inciting people to picket, as one representative has been doing in recent times.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry mentioned the tax rebate of £175.  He asked the Minister to remove these two conditions because he regarded them as a punishment on employers and said that the targets were the Government's targets, not the employers.  The Deputy has totally misunderstood and misread the national understanding. He has forgotten that the employers and the unions were sitting around the table with the Minister.  This was not the Minister's package.  It was a package agreed between the responsible representatives and was in the interest of the industrial peace and growth Deputy Barry would like to see.</P>
    <P>He also said that achievement of the targets was completely outside the workers' control.  Again I disagree with them.  The Minister represents all workers at these meetings.  The achievement of the targets is very much a question of involvement and of the contribution which all of us, as workers, are prepared to make.  If we ignore that fact we are burying our heads in the sand.  If we do that we are making a very grave mistake because our future depends on ourselves, and never more than at present, because of our involvement in the EMS.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison referred to this question but took a different line.  He said that, since the Estimate comes between the proposal in the national understanding and the final vote, this is a delicate stage and not the time when one should be saying too much about it.  He was concerned about the Minister's suggestion that rejection was something that should be avoided.  He asked Deputies to <Col N="409" /> refrain from commenting on the national understanding until voting takes place. Responsible comment in Dáil Éireann is something which we want to hear at any time and I will agree with him if he refers to irresponsible comment, but it is the duty of the representatives in Dáil Éireann to outline what has been achieved in the national understanding and then to await the decision which will be made by the parties involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison said that if there is rejection it will be on a democratic decision. One point to bear in mind is the fact that ultimately the Dáil is the democratic forum for our people of all persuasions and all pressure and interest groups.  This is where the ultimate democratic decision is.  I appreciate that within employers' groups and trade union groups there are democratic decisions but the Dáil, and through it the Government, must be the ultimate democratic decider in anything which affects our country or our development in any way.  I add that rider to what Deputy Pattison had to say.</P>
    <P>In relation to the national understanding Deputy Pattison raised the question of the social planning and he pointed particularly to the subsidies being withdrawn in what he regarded as a callous way with no allowances being made.  It is only right to point out that there were a green paper, a white paper and extensive discussions on these matters and also there was compensation particularly in the social contributions and the social section to meet this.  I am not taking up the matter of the subsidies in detail but in relation to the criticism made of the Minister, he put his cards very clearly on the table and in that respect that criticism is not valid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry went back to the budget and to the demand for £6,000 a year.  He said that the handling of the economy was surer under the Coalition. I can say that the progress in and the rate of inflation during that period are things which we are all glad to get away from, and in that sense the handling of the economy was not sure.  In relation to the national understanding I join with the Minister in asking all sides to recognise that this is a very comprehensive <Col N="410" /> understanding which has been made possible through the working of the Department of Economic Planning and Development and it is an indication of the kind of understanding which can take place as a result of the work of this Department.  It is a very comprehensive understanding in which the wealth and the growth of our wealth will be shared between the people because the Department will take the pains and the trouble to ensure that there is a fair distribution of the balance of benefits which have arisen from our work as a nation.</P>
    <P>In relation to what Deputy Barry said, the granting of a rebate of £175 tax-free allowance at the end of the year on a very minimal performance requirement is a good, sound and responsible way for the economic Ministers to have approached this question.  If the workers of Ireland recognise this fact they will be very glad to co-operate with the Ministers and with those who participated in preparing this national understanding who are the responsible representatives of all sides.  In that connection I would like to see the farming organisations involved in a responsible way in future in these negotiations and discussions.  Now that they will be contributing their fair share in terms of tax they can come to the table as equal partners with all others and help to work out reasonable, workable and useful understandings for the future and for distribution of the wealth of the country between the sectors.  The Minister can co-ordinate and co-operate with the various sectors and ultimately there will be the decisions within the Cabinet; nevertheless, the participation of the social partners within this grouping is the key element which we must all respect and welcome.  I re-echo what I have said earlier, that I have every respect for the ICTU and their leaders for the responsible way in which they have approached this national understanding. I trust that with the further development of such understandings and the continuation of such a responsible attitude the benefits for the members will be even more closely identified and that the work in that respect will be well rewarded.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the question <Col N="411" /> of long-term planning.  Nobody ever wants to hear about long-term planning or to discuss it.  It is in the long term anyway and therefore is not going to affect us for some time.  However, it is very important that we have a Department who will look at the long-term implications of international developments because they can have a major effect on our short-term objectives and on the direction in which we develop.  We can learn a great deal by looking at the way things are happening internationally, and this Department could very well co-operate with the Department of Foreign Affairs in their contacts, information and knowledge of the developments in various countries throughout what is becoming a smaller and multi-polar world in which many interesting developments are taking place.</P>
    <P>The question of social needs in the longer term was raised by both Opposition Deputies.  Bearing in mind that the Department of Economic Planning and Development have had the enormous task of dealing in a very short time with social needs, the distribution of incomes, the imposition of the tax burden and the fair distribution of wealth and benefits need to be looked at in a comprehensive way so that integrated facts are considered and the total benefits which apply in particular cases with groups, sectors or individuals can reasonably well be seen.  The middle income group would be very interested in such developments or studies which they believe would show that they contribute something more than their fair share in many respects and do not benefit as much as other sectors do.  There are very considerable arguments about this and one way to face these arguments honestly and objectively is to undertake the integrated studies which will show the various pluses and minuses and the facts which the social partners can consider as the future national understandings, and we here in Dáil Éireann can consider them in relation to economics and budgetary policy.  I look forward to some exciting information and developments there.  I would like to see increased work in this area of the social needs and social studies.  This would be a natural <Col N="412" /> follow-through which would help where the real issues are often clouded.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister.  At times I have dealt with very complex technical subjects in research and technology and also in economic affairs, and I appreciate very much the burden of work which has been placed on this Department. It is a very heavy burden of work this Department carries.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the way he has carried that burden to date, on the progress he has made and await with interest the further developments arising from the work of this Department in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had of speaking on an Estimate for the Department of Economic Planning and Development. In his absence I should like to wish the Minister every success in this important ministry.  We are all agreed in the House that there is need for such a Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to that Department is something on which I should like to touch briefly.  First of all it would appear to me to be a Department in which discussions would take place in regard to matters affecting the country.  After such discussions had taken place I would visualise a considerable amount of planning in regard to future developments and progress.  Following on that, I would visualise the Department advising and generally explaining what they had in mind.  Finally that Department would make recommendations to the Government and to each of the other Departments. I would visualise also that the Minister would be involved in economic discussions, in the formulation of plans, policies and incomes with all of the social partners and Government Ministers.  Following on those discussions, plans, advice, recommendations and so on we must ask ourselves: where do we go from here; where do this Department and its Minister stand?  It would be a serious matter if this Department was generally regarded as a talking shop only, which could huff and puff but which had not the strength, teeth or power to carry out its advice and recommendations. That would constitute a <Col N="413" /> serious situation, and one with which none of us would be happy.</P>
    <P>Of course it is necessary to have plans prepared and to ensure that such plans as are submitted are followed through.  It is necessary also that the plans submitted would be in an overall context, with power to affect all Government Departments. It is necessary also to have a nucleus in the Cabinet responsible for general, overall strategy and development as they affect the country.  People might well ask why.  My reason for making that case is that at present there appears to me to be far too much division of responsibility.  I accept that the Cabinet, as a body, are responsible for plans and what occurs, and that the Taoiseach has overall responsibility. Nevertheless in the breakdown of the different Departments and their division of responsibilities it appears to me that there is far too much division.</P>
    <P>It appears also that whilst there is a certain amount of goodwill, praise and items of general good news to the public, there is no scarcity of people happy to claim responsibility for all that is happening when the going is good but that, when there is a certain amount of public unease, disquiet or anxiety about certain matters, then there are an awful lot of people who shift feet and try to say: well, the responsibility for this matter and this policy belongs to somebody else.  In matters of this nature it is important that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development would have power to designate particular and definite responsibilities to particular people.  Of course, I can foresee difficulties inherent in that. For example, one might well ask: who would be the person to undertake this task, who would be sufficiently strong to carry it out?  And the first person who springs to mind is the Taoiseach but he, as Leader of the Cabinet, has sufficient responsibilities already.  Nevertheless in this respect somebody bearing the stamp of authority is needed.  My view is that the person admirably suited for this position would be the Tánaiste provided he had power to ensure that decisions were implemented.  In the present Government the Tánaiste is also Minister for Finance <Col N="414" /> and the Public Service.  Therefore, it would be physically impossible for him to have over-all power in regard to everything, in that he would have all of those duties in addition to those I have recommended.  Nevertheless, in this regard, it is necessary for the good of the country to have somebody with responsibility in this Department with overriding power.  Indeed I would go further and suggest that, within each Government Department, there would be a nucleus of people responsible for the enforcement of the plans and strategies outlined by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  To some extent they would be working with the Department of Economic Planning and Development, within the particular Government Department, working in conjunction with the civil servants in their Department, so that over all this team would operate in such a way that they would be answerable to a particular Government Minister who, in my view, should be the Tánaiste.  I shall not develop this to any greater length.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods spoke some minutes ago about planning problems in Dublin in regard to roadways, water supplies and so on.  There are so many people responsible, so much planning: on one occasion it may be the Department of the Environment that is involved but they cannot proceed without the help of the Department of Finance.  Then one cuts across the path of the Department of Tourism and Transport who also have responsibility.  One then comes into contact with a lot of other Government Departments, with nobody having sufficient power to ensure that plans and policies are implemented.</P>
    <P>I can foresee additional difficulties, in that different Governments will have different plans and policies.  They have a limited period within which to carry out such plans which take years to prepare, but in most cases on the change of Government such plans are scrapped. For many years the old Board of Works operated a list of priorities in regard to drainage schemes and, in spite of the change of Ministers down the years, that list of priorities remains.  The pressure put on Ministers to change that list has <Col N="415" /> not been successful.  If there was a little common sense in Departments in relation to policy we would have a similarly favourable situation.  It is necessary that we have common sense, determination and strength to ensure that priorities that are set out are pursued, irrespective of the Minister in charge.  The goodwill of all parties should be obtained to draw up a list of priorities.  It is because of the importance of this that I suggest that this matter be referred to an all-party committee of the House.  When we were in Government many good policies were put forward by us but, political life being what it is, they were not followed on the change of Government.  Rarely do we hear praise being lavished on people on the opposite side of the House but we hear a lot of criticism and too much sniping.  The attitude is that if a plan is introduced by another political party it should not be followed.</P>
    <P>The committee I suggested could get agreement between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Independents on our future economic strategy.  It could be agreed that we should stick to certain priorities.  If we were successful in that we would have achieved a lot for the long-term benefit of the country.  There is no guarantee that the priorities set by Fianna Fáil will be followed after the next general election if they are defeated. We must try to reach agreement on our future economic planning and development and not be pursuing stop-go policies.  We must have an overall agreement that will be binding on all parties in 1984.  If we achieved that the different parties would be committed to being involved in the formulation and implementation of such a list of priorities.  The Minister, and the Government, should be big enough to consider such a suggestion.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the country is divided into a number of regions all of which are catered for by development organisations whose function it is to co-ordinate the work of the different county and urban councils.  They co-ordinate the different development plans and statistics.  In my area we carry out a certain amount of research and assemble statistics but that is not sufficient.  In the <Col N="416" /> long term, because of our involvement in the EEC, it will not be sufficient to plan on a county basis.  We must expand our areas for the purpose of planning and the channelling of funds from EEC sources.  For that reason there is a need to give more power to the different development organisations, the staff of which have been working with them since 1972 and 1973 and were seconded from local authorities.</P>
    <P>With the granting of these additional powers in regard to the collection and spending of moneys there may arise some difficulties by way of political problems, local loyalties and so on but in the overall this policy should be of benefit to the regions and to the country as a whole.  However, while giving additional powers to the regional development associations we must ensure that the local authorities retain their existing powers.  The involvement of the community at local democratic level is very important.  We must ensure that the powers of the regional development organisations do not cut across the powers of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme for national development from 1978 to 1981 as set out in their White Paper is of the utmost importance and should be considered at this time when we are considering the national understanding and the progress of the Government and having regard also to the speech delivered by the Minister this morning. A programme for national development must deal with the question of incomes and of expenditures but we have a situation in which the taxation policies being pursued by the Government are not conducive to the general overall national development.  First, we had the approach of the Government to taxation as set out in the budget and which was followed by some changes.  Those of us who attend various meetings will have noticed the conflict that has arisen between the various sectors and generally the urban-<i>versus</i>-rural situation.  Much of this difficulty has stemmed from the proposals in the budget and also from the changes that were made immediately afterwards. For instance, the 2 per cent levy situation <Col N="417" /> in relation to farmers triggered off a serious situation.  Perhaps the Government realise they made a mistake but such a mistake should not be allowed happen again.  At a meeting in Laois&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Because of the nature of this debate the Chair is allowing a tremendous amount of latitude but I will not allow Deputies to go into detail on taxation.  It is in order to deal with taxation as it affects the economy but it is not in order to go into the subject in detail or to talk about what happened in Laois.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of taxation is very important.  The reaction from the PAYE group as a result of what happened in regard to the 2 per cent levy on farmers has resulted in a reaction of a very serious kind from the Government against the farmers.  The levy has been reimposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their White Paper the Government raise the question of further taxation and indicate that they are contemplating steps in this direction.  We must take a White Paper as reflecting Government policy.  In a reference to the agricultural sector we read in the White Paper that the Government are in favour in principle of a resource tax.  The Minister might let us know the position in this regard because it appears as if the Government intend going ahead with the introduction of a resource tax.  It is obvious that the present system of rates will be continued. Therefore this would mean that there would be one form of taxation on land on an adjusted acreage basis and another form of taxation&mdash;rates&mdash;by <Col N="418" /> way of the valuation system.  In addition, since the Government are proceeding with a system of income tax for farmers there will be, in all, three different forms of taxes for the farmer to cope with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, Deputy, as I have said, it is perfectly in order to deal with taxation as it affects the economy but all these taxation matters that the Deputy is debating at the moment are matters for the Minister for Finance on another Estimate which is not before the House yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>If I tried to discuss this under Finance I would be told that it was a matter for Agriculture and when I discuss it under Agriculture it is a matter for Finance.  However, we are discussing taxation of farmers.  Farmers will now be faced with a resource tax, rates, and with income tax.  It also appears that they will have to pay for disease eradication.  This is important in a number of respects. There was a recent change of Government in England and the new British Government will try to curtail the common agricultural policy as much as they can.  This will have serious effects on our programme for national development as it affects the farming community.</P>
      <P>The vast improvements carried out in agriculture were carried out because there was a decided air of confidence within the farming community which led to an absolute change in the face of rural Ireland as we knew it.  There were improvements in regard to land reclamation, the building of new houses, new silage plants, milking parlours and so on which led to a widespread increase in employment.  The Minister would want to take it easy in regard to killing the goose that lays the golden egg.  If the Minister is not careful the confidence that permeated the farming community since Deputy Mark Clinton was Minister will evaporate.  It is important to generate that air of confidence for the development of agriculture.  I will return to this matter when the Department of Finance is being discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, it is important in dealing with overall planning and development to deal with planning and development in agriculture.  I have been in order in relation to this matter.  The Minister dealt with the tourism section of this &ldquo;Programme for National Development, 1978-1981&rdquo;.  As Deputies will be aware, I have been appointed spokesman on tourism for this party. Tourism is very important in regard to national development.  The income from tourism in 1977 was £328 million, for 1978 it was £396.4 million and the estimated income from tourism for 1979 is £432.9 million.  This booklet deals with the amount of job creation and overall investment in tourism.  It also deals with the significant economic and social benefits that flow from the labour intensive tourist industry.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that Bord Fáilte are now considering revising their 1979 targets.  They are revising their targets because they believe they will fall far short of what they estimated at the beginning of this year.  The fuel crisis is one reason for this proposed revision and another reason is the long postal dispute. It was a mistake to let this strike drag on for so long.  While the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is not responsible for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs being in a key Cabinet position he should have ensured that efforts were made earlier to resolve the dispute.  The income from overseas tourism would have been £317 million and home holidays would have accounted for £115 million.  Our image at international level has been seriously tarnished by this dispute.  All our plans will be set at naught if we allow disputes to continue for this length.  This dispute will be settled, but to have allowed it to drag on for so long was a grave blunder which gives rise for serious concern. Bord Fáilte are seriously concerned about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism has shown an upward trend over the years.  The Bord Fáilte report for 1977 contains a graph indicating the upward trend.  However, if this graph levels off or starts to go down it will be very hard to make it go up again.  For this <Col N="420" /> reason I am concerned that the graph is in serious danger of changing.  I believe Bord Fáilte will revise their estimates and when they come before the public in the next few weeks there will be concern in the Department of Economic Planning and Development and in other Departments.  Tourism and its spin-off industries have an important part to play in the programme for national development. The graph I described showed earnings and numbers.  The rise shown in that graph was not just a paper rise.  It showed that earnings were rising and that the numbers of tourists were increasing.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of concern that some promotional activities&mdash;in west Clare in particular&mdash;are being suspended.  It is also a matter of concern that the Irish Hotels Federation say that there is a drop in tourists in the region of 25 per cent to 50 per cent.  I am worried that when Bord Fáilte publish the new statistics and their revised estimates there will be a serious danger in the long term for the development of tourism. Bord Fáilte have been progressive and have done much for tourism development. Everyone in this House must congratulate them on that.  They have been conservative in their estimates up to now but they have been correct and that is important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Deputy should get away from tourism.  It is all right to mention it in connection with economic planning and development but the Deputy will have an opportunity on another Estimate to talk about the subject at length.</P>

The Minister with overall responsibility for tourism, transport and posts and telegraphs should ensure that the serious postal dispute does not escalate.  He should take action today and meet these people to bring about a settlement of the problem.</P>

I accept the ruling of the Chair and shall not pursue the matter further.  If the programme for national development is to succeed there must be goodwill.  With regard to industrial and agricultural programmes, the Government should hasten slowly because agriculture and the spin-off industries are closely connected and are important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The work of the Department of Economic Planning and Development is in the formative stage.  It is essential that the work of the Department be flexible and that the Minister acts promptly when the need arises.  It is too much to expect in a few years that the impact of the Department would be felt generally but if the guidelines are right, if action is taken when the economic circumstances change, as is happening at the moment, and if a review of plans is undertaken rapidly, this Department could be one of our more important Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a series of Green and White Papers dealing with economic and social progress to inform public opinion and to have public discussions.  I cannot see the work of the Department being successful unless there is in future a realistic understanding by all sections of the importance of working as a team in one giant co-operative effort to bring about full employment.  All sections must be involved in this.  If there are groups who think they are the only people contributing to our economic welfare we must bring about a change of heart. Unions, employers and State agencies must work out a proper understanding. They must anticipate difficulties that can arise in industry and agriculture to forestall unofficial strikes which are a major worry at the moment.  If an effort is not made to solve the problem before harm is done we will not achieve progress.  We are only too well aware of the effects of the poor labour relations <Col N="422" /> we have at the moment and the failure of all sides to achieve a better understanding.</P>
    <P>The planning envisaged in the Department of Economic Planning and Development seems to be quite flexible and is not tied to a rigid programme. This is an essential factor.  The pending fuel shortage obviously will affect industry, agriculture and tourism&mdash;in fact the whole economy will be affected.  This must bring about a significant change in thinking in the Department.  The people in the peripheral areas seems to bear the brunt of any economic recession and they seem to be the last to get the benefits to which all are entitled.  For instance, the road structure through the centre of County Clare does not encourage tourism or the location of industry and is an impediment to progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the letter referred to by Deputy Harte.  The Government share fully the desire of local representatives in the area to ensure progress on the study and are proceeding with its implementation as rapidly as the various practical and financial constraints will allow.  It is precisely because of the Government's commitment to cross-Border economic co-operation that we have embarked upon speedy implementation of the recommendations contained in the study referred to by the Deputy.  The progress to date is indicated in detail in a progress report dated April 1979 on the implementation of the study recommendations which I sent to the secretary of Donegal County Council on 19 April.</P>
      <P>I should add that on cross-Border projects generally I am very pleased that from the time my colleagues at the Council of Ministers were first made aware of the importance of these projects by me in October 1977 I and my colleagues in Government have been able to rely on their consistent support, and that of the Commission, in this area.</P>
      <P>Again, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate a detailed statement setting out progress on the implementation of the study to date.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <i>Progress Report on Implementation of Cross-Border Communications Study for the Derry and Donegal Area.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  In 1976 the Irish and British Governments appointed consultants to carry out a study on cross-Border communications <Col N="424" /> with the following terms of reference:</P>
    <P>To examine communications, including transportation (e.g. roads, railways, ports, airports, telecommunications) in the Derry and Donegal area in the light of existing projects and plans in order to determine their adequacy and to make recommendations for future development, having regard to financial constraints.</P>
    <P>2.  The consultants' report, half the cost of which was financed from the EEC Regional Fund, was published in December 1977.  Subsequently the main recommendations of the report were endorsed in a separate study carried out by the EEC Economic and Social Committee which was published in June 1978.</P>
    <P>3.  The implementation of the recommendations in the consultants' report is being monitored at official level by representatives from the respective Government Departments.  Meetings on both sides of the border at ministerial and official level have also taken place with local interests, including local councillors. A deputation from the three councils in the area met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Michael O'Kennedy, TD, on 23 February.  The Minister emphasised to the deputation his appreciation of the work done by the councils in relation to the report and his desire to keep the councils briefed fully and regularly on the measures of implementation proposed.  He undertook to communicate to the councils a progress report on the implementation of the report.</P>
    <P>4.  Immediately following publication the Government put in hand an intensive examination of the consultants' findings by all the relevant Departments and official agencies concerned.  The first stage of this examination was completed in June 1978 and at that time the Government reached agreement in principle on a programme of implementation covering the main areas of the consultants' recommendations.  The following is the present position in regard to the principal measures envisaged by the consultants for implementation in Donegal:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> (a) <i>Roads</i></P>
    <P>The programme of implementation approved by the Government in June 1978 provided for the full implementation of the first stage of the road programme for North Donegal recommended by the consultants.</P>
    <P>In line with this commitment work is already proceeding on a number of roads in Donegal singled out by the consultants for priority action in their road programme for north Donegal up to 1985.  Early implementation of many of the other recommended road improvement schemes for which planning is at an advanced stage can be expected.</P>
    <P>Road grants allocated for work in the Donegal section of the study area in 1979 include £165,000 for schemes on the Letterkenny/Derry road (National Primary N. 13); £50,000 for the completion of the Lifford By-Pass; £30,000 for the Letterkenny By-Pass and £40,000 for the Stranorlar/Letterkenny route.  In addition to the above grants, totalling £285,000, a general block grant of £781,000 has been allocated to Donegal County Council for 1979 for work on roads other than national roads at the discretion of the council.</P>
    <P>The detailed position regarding the programme of road improvements in Donegal is as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Co. Donegal: Inter-Urban Roads</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Letterkenny-Pluck Cross, N. 13</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>National Primary</i>
    </P>
    <P>Outline design has been completed, and a detailed ground survey has been carried out to enable the detailed road design to proceed.</P>
    <P>At the present rate of progress it is expected that it will be possible for work to begin on the scheme towards the end of 1980.  The design involved a detour from the existing route at Pluck Cross, connecting back at Manorcunningham on the Derry side.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Bridgend-Pluck Cross, N. 13 National</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Primary</i>
    </P>
    <P>Two remaining sections of this route are included in current improvement programmes:</P>
    <P>(i) 2 miles at Manorcunningham adjoining <Col N="426" /> the Letterkenny-Pluck Cross route;</P>
    <P>(ii) Newtowncunningham By-Pass.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Scheme (I)</i>
    </P>
    <P>Construction on the scheme has commenced; prospects are that it will take a further two years to complete.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Scheme (II)</i>
    </P>
    <P>Outline design stage for this scheme has been completed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Letterkenny-Kilmacrennan, N. 56</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>National Secondary</i>
    </P>
    <P>Detailed design for a 1½ mile section of this route adjoining Letterkenny has been completed.  A scheme of improvement works on the route, south of Kilmacrennan, is in progress, and will be completed during the current year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Strabane-Lifford, N. 14 National</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Primary</i>
    </P>
    <P>The proposed through-pass at Lifford has two elements:</P>
    <P>(i)  Strabane-Letterkenny link.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Strabane-Ballybofey link.</P>
    <P>Scheme (I) is at an advanced stage and is well on the way to completion.</P>
    <P>Scheme (II) was not included in the programme drawn up by the consultants but is scheduled in the county programme for the second half of the 1980s. Detailed design has been completed and land asquisition by CPO confirmed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Urban Through Routes</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Letterkenny</i>
    </P>
    <P>A scheme linking the Letterkenny-Pluck Cross and Letterkenny-Kilmacrennan Roads has been in progress since 1977 and it is expected that part of the overall scheme will be opened to traffic during 1979.</P>
    <P>(b) <i>Freight Transport</i></P>
    <P>The passing by the Oireachtas of the Road Transport Act, 1978 has considerably amended the legislation governing the operation of freight transport services and has had the effect of generally liberalising it in the direction recommended by the consultants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> (c)  <i>Public Passenger Transport</i></P>
    <P>The two Governments have been jointly considering the problems relating to the operation in the area of the Lough Swilly Bus Company and to this end have commissioned a report by industrial consultants covering all aspects of the company's operations which will be completed in the near future.  It is hoped that the report's findings will provide a basis for action by the two Governments to safeguard the level of service in the area.</P>
    <P>(d)  <i>Ports</i></P>
    <P>Approval has been given for the carrying out of the second stage of the development programme at Greencastle harbour at an estimated cost of £1.12 million.  The scheme will include the extension of the existing pier and the construction of a new pier to provide additional berthage accommodation, deepening of the existing berthage area, reclamation of an area of 8,250 square yards and the provision of an auction hall and other ancillary facilities.  It is estimated that the works which are now expected to begin in 1980 will take about four years to complete.</P>
    <P>(e)  <i>Air Transport</i></P>
    <P>A joint study of the aviation and other technical and operational aspects of the proposed Derry-Dublin air-link is currently being carried out by the Department of Tourism and Transport and the British Civil Aviation Authority.  This study, which is due to be completed in the near future, is examining the feasibility of such an air-link, alternative possibilities for the operation of the link, the cost of the operation and how this cost might be met.  It is understood from the Northern Ireland authorities that additional equipment is being installed and terminal facilities improved at Eglinton Airport by Derry City Council.</P>
    <P>(f)  <i>Telecommunications and Postal Services</i></P>
    <P>(i)  The conversion to automatic working of the telephone exchanges in north Donegal is going ahead as part of a £6.5 million development programme for the improvement of telecommunications in the area.  Installation of the <Col N="428" /> automatic equipment is proceeding according to plan at the main Letterkenny exchange.  Equipment installation is also in progress at the secondary exchange at Bridgend.  It is expected that automatic working will be introduced at Letterkenny in the second half of 1979 and at Bridgend shortly afterwards.  Conversion of the balance of the 22 exchanges already contracted for will then follow and should be completed in 1980.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Contracts for the conversion of a further four exchanges were placed towards the end of last year and tenders for a further eight will be sought in the current year.</P>
    <P>(iii)  A contract has also been placed for a Dublin-Sligo-Letterkenny radio link which when in operation will significantly improve the level of service between those centres and the study area.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Derry-Letterkenny-Belfast route &mdash;Work on the installation of the underground cable between Derry and Bridgend has commenced and it is expected that it will be ready for testing in June 1979.  Provision of this cable will permit the opening of the Letterkenny to Belfast route and subsequent direct dialling from Letterkenny to the Belfast charge group.  It will also provide the capacity required for the new direct dialling route between Letterkenny and Derry.</P>
    <P>(v)  Discussions are also taking place between the two authorities on the possibilities for extending cross-Border direct dialling facilities to a greater number of centres on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>(vi)  Discussions between the respective postal authorities are continuing on the transportation of mail for the northwest through Northern Ireland.  Firm proposals designed to reinstate the main link through Northern Ireland are now at the costing stage.</P>
    <P>(g)  <i>Tourism</i></P>
    <P>The existing excellent informal liaison between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board continues.</P>
    <P>In regard to tourism co-operation at <Col N="429" /> the local level it has been agreed that the most effective way to achieve the integrated approach recommended in the consultants' report would be to set up a tourism body designated as the North West Tourism Co-operation Group.  The group will consist of two officers from each of the tourist boards and will have the task of identifying the tourism development and promotional needs of the area and of making recommendations to the appropriate central and local authorities.</P>
    <P>Some preliminary work has already been undertaken by Bord Fáilte, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and by local organisations on both sides of the border in connection with joint marketing.</P>
    <P>
      <i>EEC Financial Aid</i>
    </P>
    <P>5.  A number of the infrastructure projects in north Donegal envisaged in the consultants' report have already been accepted for assistance under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).  The position in relation to the individual sectors is as follows:</P>
    <P>A grant of £1.5 million has been received from the ERDF towards the cost of converting Letterkenny and other smaller exchanges in north Donegal to automatic working.</P>
    <P>As regards roads, schemes costing £423,000 have already been accepted in 1978 for assistance from the ERDF and will be in receipt of approximately £127,000.  The routes involved include Bridgend-Pluck Cross (N 13), Letterkenny-Kilmacrennan (N 56), Strabane-Lifford (N 14) and the Letterkenny Through Route.  There is every reason to believe that future applications in respect of road works in the area will also be favourably considered within the resources of the fund and that the area as a whole will continue to benefit from EEC assistance.  Prospects in this regard have been improved by the decision of the Council of Ministers to establish a non-quota section of the Regional Fund and while the detailed regulations for its operation have yet to be decided by the Communities the two administrations <Col N="430" /> are currently examining on a joint basis suitable projects in border areas which might benefit under this arrangement.</P>
    <P>6.  The consultants in their report emphasised the need for cross-Border co-operation in relation to the study area as a whole and many of the recommendations require joint action by the two Governments for their implementation. At the meeting which the Minister had with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 5 May 1978 it was agreed that a joint committee of officials from North and South should be set up to ensure a co-ordinated approach and monitor implementation of the study. From the work of that committee the Minister is aware of a number of measures which the various Northern Ireland departments are taking to implement recommendations of the report, in particular in relation to the new Foyle bridge, improvements at Derry port and improvements in roads and telecommunications. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State reviewed progress in all of these areas at their meeting in London on 14 February.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister is not implying that it was only in October 1977 that his colleagues in the Council of Ministers were made aware of the importance of cross-Border co-operation projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to say whether his words are intended to mean that it is only since he came into office as Minister that this matter has been brought to the attention of the Council of Ministers.  If so, that is absolutely false.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them may have changed in the interim.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that I persistently questioned, but I am still saying that my colleagues did not seem to be aware of this as an element of policy and I am glad I have had their support ever since.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>At its meeting on 3 <Col N="432" /> April the Council agreed on a package which would enable the Commission to conclude negotiations in the multilateral trade negotiations.  The results of the negotiations were duly initialled by most of the industrialised countries on 12 April.  Some outstanding negotiations remain to be completed including those between the Community and Australia.</P>
      <P>While the package submitted to the Council included concessions for Australian beef and cheese, the actual granting of these concessions will depend on overall agreement being reached with Australia.  In these circumstances the Deputy will no doubt appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to indicate the quantities of each product involved and to do so could even be detrimental to the negotiating position of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate what position he has taken on behalf of Ireland towards this proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I and my colleagues in Government have very strongly and consistently resisted any undue concessions to Australia, particularly in relation to beef and cheese.  As a consequence of that, I and my colleagues have received certain assurances at this preliminary stage in relation to strengthening in particular the cheese production area in this country.  This is not as yet the final position because negotiations are still being conducted. We have not as yet had to adopt a final position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister is aware that the total quantity of cheese imports from third countries, presumably including Australia, is, according to the Minister for Agriculture, set at a figure of 340,000 tonnes.  Can we take it that this figure will not be greater as a result of these negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot at this stage give any indication in relation to figures such as the Deputy has mentioned or any other figure.  The multilateral trade negotiations in the GATT are matters in which the Irish Government have a real and positive interest.  The liberalisation <Col N="433" /> of trade can only be to our benefit overall.  We have always taken that position. If there are one or two areas on which we have been holding out in the overall package, I can assure the Deputy we will look firmly to the Irish interest in these as in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Particularly in regard to cheese and other dairy products, does it not appear to the Minister to be the utmost insanity to continue to import from third countries a commodity of which we are capable of producing far too much and a great deal of which we practically give away for nothing at the end of the day?  Surely there is some madness in adding to the 340,000 tonnes or even containing imports within that figure?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

In its budgets for 1977, 1978 and 1979, however, the European Parliament set aside appropriations for an information campaign on direct elections.  A proportion of the sum set aside for this purpose has been allocated to the political groups <Col N="435" /> in the European Parliament in each of the years mentioned above.  It is understood that a sum of approximately £.83 million was made available in 1977 while sums of approximately £3.1 million and £3.8 million were made available in 1978 and 1979 respectively.  The actual distribution of these funds to the political parties which make up the groups is, of course, a matter entirely for the groups themselves and my Department have no information on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this is gobbledegook. I have heard those three figures, £3.8 million, £3.1 million and £.83 million.  Are we to take it that we can add them together and say that this is the amount of money coming from Community funds towards the election?</P>

      <P>I cannot see how the Deputy can say that there is any gobbledegook in what I said.  I shall repeat it, and it seems to me to be very clear: &ldquo;It is understood that a sum of approximately £.83 million was made available in 1977, while sums of approximately £3.1 million and £3.8 million were made available in 1978 and 1979 respectively.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the gobbledegook. It is almost £8 million.  How is it that figure can be allocated from EEC funds when, if we are not directly contributing as individuals towards that amount, we are in fact losing what we might be getting as part of it in some other direction and therefore it is costing us money here individually and collectively? As regards the gobbledegook&mdash;it is not the figures I am talking about; it is the Minister's assertion&mdash;surely the Minister cannot assert that how this money has been distributed is not a matter in which he and his Government have a say.  In other words, candidates are being assisted out of this money and in a way which precludes other&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I put down this question <Col N="436" /> to the Minister for the Environment.  I would normally expect him to be handling matters dealing with elections within this country.  It has been passed on to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and that is not my choice.  Can the Minister or anybody else honestly say that part of EEC moneys, to the tune of £8 million, is going to the aid of candidates of the larger political parties through their groupings in Europe and those who do not belong to such are entitled to nothing?  Is this not total discrimination as regards the distribution?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of funds from the European Parliament is a matter entirely for the Parliament or the groupings of that Parliament and the Government have no responsibility for it whatever.  Neither has the Minister for the Environment nor myself.  Simply because as Minister for Foreign Affairs I was able to get this information more readily perhaps I was prepared to put on record for the Deputy's information here what I have already said.  But it is not a matter of governmental responsibility, as I presume the Deputy knows or should know.  It is no function of mine to indicate other than what the arrangements are.  The Deputy should know that the present procedures in the Parliament are a matter entirely for the Parliament itself and for the groupings through which these moneys are allocated to the constituent parties in the groupings.  It is very self-evident that neither the Government here nor elsewhere can have responsibility for the allocation of funds to parties, their own or other parties that may not be in government with them.  The Deputy may be unhappy but it is no responsibility of the Government and there is no point in his trying to pin it on that basis.</P>

I cannot.  Neither can I get the figures nor am I or anybody like me entitled to one penny while we fight EEC funds and party funds in this election.  I say it is discrimination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the responsibility of sanitary authorities to make such provision as they consider necessary to ensure that a sufficient supply of water is available for fire fighting purposes in their areas.  However, I made inquiries of Donegal County Council, the sanitary authority concerned in this case, and their report indicates that they are satisfied that the public water supply is sufficient for ordinary fire fighting in Castlefin having regard to its proximity to the River Finn. The report also indicates that six fire engines attended the fire in question, that two nearby hydrants were used by the first two fire engines attending and that when the third and following fire engines arrived the fire flow was boosted by using water from the River Finn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister further inquire into this matter on the basis of whether the mains to which the hydrants are attached are capable of producing sufficient water for any such eventuality?  Perhaps the Minister has that information already.  Perhaps the Minister would inquire why, when there are such stringent fire regulations in the granting of planning permissions in Donegal, this situation should have happened so recently.  It seems a contradiction of the situation as I know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of extra <Col N="446" /> stringency in Donegal in regard to fire regulations.  With regard to the water supply, on which the Deputy has asked for further information, it is true to say that the water is at times turned off at night to conserve supplies.  However, the reservoir at Castlefin was full at the time of the fire.  Furthermore, there are immediate proposals to connect with a Northern Ireland supply at the northern end of the regional scheme at Carrigans which is approximately 12 miles from Castlefin.  This connection should supplement the supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Castlefin, which is well below the level of the lough, would be nearer to Carrigans.  What has happened to the scheme and why were the hydrants not capable of delivering more water on the occasion of the fire?  Had it anything to do with the water being turned off?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The water should not have been turned off on that occasion because the reservoir was full.  As I said, the first two fire engines used the two available hydrants, so two hydrants were available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</b> (<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>) asked the Minister for the Environment the nature and implications for Ireland of the EEC proposed directive on the lead content of petrol and when it will take effect here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states concerning the lead content of petrol was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 29 June 1978 and provides that the maximum lead content of petrol placed on the Community internal market shall be 0.40 grammes per litre from 1 January 1981.  Article 7 of the directive provides that for a period of <Col N="447" /> five years after that date petrol may be placed on the market in Ireland even though its lead content is greater than 0.40 grammes per litre but without exceeding the current content of 0.64 grammes per litre.  The directive provides for a possible further derogation period of not more than five years, that is if the Council of Ministers, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, so decide.</P>
      <P>I gave particulars of concentrations of lead in the ambient air when I replied to previous questions on 15 June 1978. Since these levels show a favourable comparison with levels elsewhere in the EEC, there can be no implication that the derogation, which was required only for half the petrol consumption in this country, will worsen the position here. The Department of Health are responsible for the screening of the population for lead in accordance with a directive adopted on 9 December 1976 and I expect the results of this investigation to be communicated to me in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are our citizens apparently expected to accept standards of lead in their petrol, when they can get it, which are above EEC standards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not subjected to higher levels of lead than the citizens of other cities.  Air quality is consistently monitored in this city.  In comparison with a city like Brussels we are better off. We are not subjected to anything more excessive than exists in other cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that standards of pollution are relative and that because Dublin is less affected than Brussels is not a good reason for refusing to be interested in improving it so that the air is totally clean?  Is the lead content in petrol on sale here higher than the lead content in petrol on sale in Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The lead content is dependent on the place where the crude oil comes from.  Since we import 50 per cent of product we cannot control the lead content.  It is probable that some EEC countries have very modern refineries and are in a better position to control the <Col N="448" /> lead content.  It is also probable that their petrol is being purchased from countries where the crude oil has a lower lead content.</P>

Our axle weights are not as great as in some member countries.  With regard to preventing them from using certain roads, the local authority in conjunction with the commissioner would be involved here.  I have no immediate plans in my Department to do this but I will look at it because I can see the difficulties involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment, in view of the possible injustices arising from the use of the lottery system in choosing individuals eligible for new taxi licences, if the Minister would consider setting up a national system of choice based on technical, social and economic criteria of the proposed licensee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, 1978, provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that where the number of eligible applications for new taxi licences exceeds the number which may be granted as determined by the local authority, the applications to be granted will be determined by lot by the Garda Commissioner.  The commissioner must be satisfied that a person to whom a licence is granted is a fit and proper person to hold such a licence.  I made the regulations in agreement with the Taxi Services Council, which is representative of the interests concerned with the taxi business including taxi <Col N="454" /> operators, tourism and consumer interests and I have no proposals at present to amend these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in the allocation of taxi licences, preference should be given to people who are unemployed or are already co-drivers?  Ideally they should get preference in the allocation of taxis even under a lottery system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The lottery will be set up by the gardai in each area and will be supervised by an officer of the Garda.  I would like to emphasise that the Taxi Services Council, which I set up, recommended this and we agreed to give it a trial period of one year to see if it works. As it stands, there is no change intended on this occasion and we must hope that the lottery will not work against the people the Deputy is speaking about. Because the regulations were made last November and the lotteries are about to take place and different corporations have decided on the number of extra taxi plates that will be allocated, there will be no change this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In these very extensive regulations, 22 paragraphs, would it not have been possible for the Minister to take this point into consideration? I understand there are some 400 part-timers and some people with up to 11 plates. Surely provision could be included in the Minister's regulations to stop abuses of that kind in view of the Government's general policy that nobody should hold more than one job in order to promote full employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the difficulties involved here with regard to part-timers and those who have more than one plate.  This has been going on for some time.  It would by my intention to prevent as an on-going situation such abuses and the regulations can be amended in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>When is the Minister likely to consider the inclusion of such a provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The usual time for <Col N="455" /> renewal of tax licences was September but we had a long delay, first, due to the setting up of the taxi council and then because certain corporations were slow to decide on the number of extra licences.  The result was that this has dragged on for a long time.  I hope on the next occasion, based on the experience of this year, to be able to improve the terms of the regulations in order to eliminate the abuses the Deputy is concerned about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Regulation 17/64/EEC, grants were formally available to group water schemes from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.  These were generally known as FEOGA grants and such grants totalling £1.18 million have been allocated to 99 group water schemes to date.  FEOGA grant instalments totalling £170,003 have been paid in respect of 31 schemes and the balance of the outstanding grants will be paid by the EEC Commission on submission of additional claims on behalf of the groups involved.  Group water schemes are no longer eligible for FEOGA aid under Regulation 17/64/EEC except in the case of 101 group schemes for which applications were lodged with the EEC Commission on or before 31 December 1978.  The decision of the EEC Commission on these applications is awaited.</P>

    <P>The EEC have recently proposed a new regulation for a common measure for the improvement of public amenities, including rural water supplies, in 12 western countries, including Cavan and <Col N="467" /> Monaghan.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,233,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1979, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been referring to the areas most in need of development.  I was hoping that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development would take particular note of tourist areas; it is vital to have an adequate road structure.  I referred also to the necessity&mdash;and I hope he will impress this on the Minister for the Environment&mdash;to allocate an adequate sum of money from the £1,000 million which the Minister had indicated to the public will be available over the next number of years for road development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am bringing to the House the thoughts and expressions of local authorities in my County of Clare, the <Col N="483" /> Clare County Council, the Kilrush Urban District Council and the Kilkee Town Commissioners as well as chambers of commerce who have all complained of the rapid deterioration of the main artery from Limerick to the Kilkee/Loop Head area, particularly from Ennis to Kilrush to Kilkee.  The success of the people in the west in industry, tourism and agriculture depends on having a proper allocation of money. I would ask the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, in his plan, to see that there is an allocation of money for this road which has been described as dangerous at every meeting of Clare County Council over a long number of years.</P>
    <P>In the area of tourism we have received a lot of setbacks as a result of lack of bookings because of the postal strike.  There is a hopelessness there because industrialists who would site their industries there are now deprived of any line of communication.  The Government cannot expect the people to tolerate a situation like this indefinitely. The National, Economic and Social Council refer to advance development of all regions.  I claim that the areas of the west and the areas in west Clare have not shared in this development and to date the imbalance is noticeable.  I am not talking politically.  I am just bringing the facts to the attention of the Minister who knows the area well.  He has engendered some hope in the people there who believe that he will bring fresh thinking to bear in relation to the areas I have referred to.</P>
    <P>(<i>Interruptions.</i>)</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to make the point that we must have a balanced development and to date we have not had that.  Because of that imbalance tourism has suffered, industrial development has suffered.  It is a fact that we have the first advance factory which was built in Kilrush and it is there unoccupied for a number of years.  I do not know if the Minister's activity in the industrial area goes as far as influencing the siting of industry but I would ask him at this stage to look into the matter of seeing that an industrialist who has a <Col N="484" /> sound financial standing will locate at this advance factory and that, generally speaking, there will be some revival of the industrial growth which we enjoyed there over the centuries.  I would refer particularly to the timber industry.  We have a rather important port there and there has traditionally been a native timber industry there as well as an imported timber industry.  In this area the Minister should look into the reports which I had hoped he would have seen by now in relation to a properly balanced structure concerning the timber industry.  Where there is employment given in the timber industry there should be some allocation of money to native timber industrialists who in fact put in their own money and who give steady employment.  They should have some preference so far as getting contracts at a proper and reasonable price is concerned.  This is vital in Clare where we have some major industries like Scarriff Chipboard and Kilrush Timber Products and others.  If they are to continue in business such industries should get some preferential treatment where there are State sales of native timber.</P>
      <P>I understand that so far as the Minister's Department is concerned we will be getting advice from the National Economic and Social Council in relation to income distribution and tax policy. The tax policy which is at present in operation does not encourage people to return to live in the west; neither does it encourage the people who live there to develop.  I refer to the intensive dairying area where farmers will now pay a tax on milk over 5,000 gallons delivered to the local creameries; they will also pay a levy on cattle sold at their local mart. Often this tax is extracted from people who are already in debt to the banks and to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for the purchase of agricultural machinery and for the purchase of stock.  This is a very unfair system.  It is not a tax on an income, it is a tax on what could be a debt.  I hope that this year will see the last of that system particularly where there has to be intensive capital development in dairying.  This is quite general in Clare.  There has been very significant growth in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must understand that in <Col N="485" /> areas which have been described as growth areas they have been given a fair share of consideration.  Unfortunately, previous Governments shared willingly the views of consultants like Lichfield, Buchanan and others from whom we got reports.  They would be quite good in highly intensive areas of population in England but would not be able to think clearly about a rural area.  If they decided that a country could prosper by having particular growth areas throughout the country and that other areas would be deprived, they misled previous Governments who should not have accepted their advice.  They referred to &ldquo;preserving grand green belts for tourism&rdquo;.  What a lovely thing it is to have grand green belts of lush pasture and have the inhabitants of small holdings going to England and elsewhere to make a living.  I hope the Minister will bring fresh thinking into those areas and see that the people who want to live where their ancestors bought an acre of land will be given some assistance and that the towns and villages in those areas who depend on a thriving population will also be given a chance to survive in the eighties.</P>
    <P>I want to refer particularly to tourism in the west.  Guesthouse owners and hoteliers are facing a serious situation. Most of our tourists come here by the east coast, although we are lucky to have a major airport in my county.  If there is to be a restriction on petrol what provision will be made in the near future to see that tourists are given an adequate supply to take them to the traditional tourists areas?  In the west we cannot take bookings now but perhaps that situation will improve in the near future.  What provision will be made to see that tourists can travel to any part of the country they want to go to?  A lot depends on having an adequate supply of petrol available.</P>
    <P>People in many areas of the country depend on private cars to get them to work.  People in West Clare have to travel a fair distance to work in Shannon or Ennis.  If there are not supplies of petrol to take those people to work does industry grind to a halt?  It is important that thought be given to the provision of <Col N="486" /> petrol.  I do not think the Minister has been given a fair chance yet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  If there is to be a tourist development consideration should be given by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to development in the major tourist areas. It is important when disputes arise on any particular matter that every effort is made to settle them before a prolonged strike ensues, when the nation suffers. The Minister for Economic Planning and Development could have very good ideas about the development of particular areas but if there are disputes this development cannot take place.</P>
      <P>Many deprived areas in the country have suffered over the years.  The balance should now be restored and those areas should be looked after.  The Minister should keep a friendly eye on fishery development on the west coast and the provision of adequate landing facilities which is vital.  At the moment there are regional development organisations who have not got sufficient finance to make decisions which will be of benefit to the areas they serve.  I know they get contributions from county councils, and they highlight road structure, land acquisition and other things, but it is about time some decision was arrived at and they were given some proper functions, rather than have the present situation.  County development teams will play a major role in future and the central development committee has always played a major role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should establish a firm liaison between the county development towns and see that this is maintained regularly.  When there are different promoting agents like the Industrial Development Authority and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company <Col N="487" /> in our region and county development teams it is difficult to know exactly what degree of harmony exists or what possible plans, united in co-operation, they have for a region; this should be defined.  County development teams are able to pinpoint the necessary and vital development within any particular county.  I would like to see their functions and their capacity to guide being utilised fully by the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I hope the year ahead will bring for all of us a brighter future than seems possible at the moment and that the efforts made by the Minister and his officials will be noticeable.  If we were to review the targets for 1979 it would not be so encouraging. However, there is always a brighter side and I hope that the Minister will share in a brighter future for all of us.</P>

      <P>In opening my contribution to this debate, which I must remind the House is on an Estimate for £5 million to be spent by the Office for which the Minister is responsible, I should like to express my general concern about the way in which this House has to deal with Estimates.  It has to discuss a very detailed Estimate concerning about 12 different sub-heads&mdash;each of them worthy of a detailed discussion on its own&mdash;in a debate of a rambling character, where each Deputy makes one contribution of a maximum of one hour and there is no possibility of interrogating the Minister, or even making suggestions to him to which he could reply in a specific fashion.  The only way in which points are replied to, if at all, is at the very end of the debate, when everybody has forgotten much of what has been said&mdash;this debate may well not be concluded for a number of weeks; this is a very bad way for the House to be doing its business of controlling public expenditure.</P>

    <P>Given that the Minister has an over-all responsibility in the area of co-ordination of Government activities and procedures, he should have a look at the way this House is involved in the control of public expenditure.  If he examines this question, he will find that the format of <Col N="488" /> the procedure of voting Estimates is highly unsatisfactory.  There are not even the facilities available to us when discussing the Estimate, of putting down amendments.  We could, up to about 1976, have had the possibility of putting down an amendment to reduce the Vote in respect of a particular item.  This power was not used.  If it had been used it would have meant that we could have focussed in on a debate on an individual item of the Estimate and got the Minister to agree to a specific discussion on the role and function of the economic research.</P>

      <P>This is a point I would like to draw to the attention of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development because ultimately the decision will be taken by the Government and he is a man of some influence in the Government and I would like him to be aware of the thinking on this.  This is relevant to the debate itself and I would draw his attention to the fact that this is a very bad way to be doing our business with regard to controlling public expenditure.</P>
      <P>It is possible that there may be no reply to this debate.  The Minister is responsible for the debate on the White Paper in this House and we have not yet had a reply from him to a debate which took place two months ago on this subject and there is no prospect, that I know of, that it will ever be replied to.  It may be like the 1978 budget debate which was never replied to by the Minister responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much welcome&mdash;and this is not necessarily a view shared by all the members of my party&mdash;the setting up of a Department of Economic Planning and Development.  It is very important that there be a body, apart from the Department of Finance, responsible for looking at and co-ordinating the entire range of Government activities, in so far as they affect economic matters.  Indeed, I would say there is probably a need for <Col N="489" /> similar co-ordinating Departments in relation to other matters affecting Government activity which are not covered by the Minister, as they do not have a sufficient economic content.  I found, in Government over four years, that the biggest obstacle to getting things done is bureaucracy but that bureaucracy which is an obstacle is not the bureaucracy within one's own Department. It is not difficult to get what one wants done by civil servants responsible to one's self or to the Minister.  The big problem is when you have to send a circulating memorandum to Departments and you cannot get a reply from them. You have no control over the other civil servants because they are under other Ministers and there is nobody responsible for making sure that they reply.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's Department is overburdened with other work, particularly if there are difficulties in Northern Ireland or matters like that.  The Taoiseach has not the time to be checking up on whether a memo from the Department of Education to the Department of Health over two years ago has yet been replied to.  There must be somebody to oversee this whole question of bringing discussions to the Government's attention to get decisions taken.  In most cases, Governments can take decisions if the issue comes to them in a proper form but memoranda go from one Department to another and are never replied to and never come to the Minister for decision until far too late.  It is very important that there should be a body like the Minister's Department looking at the over-all situation and intervening to get needed decisions on issues and not allowing them to be sucked into the morass that I have described.</P>
    <P>In that sense I very much welcome the setting up of this Department.  The particular activities of the Department in relation to the production of what are in-accurately described as planning documents is something I shall deal with later.  I do not think that what the Department of Economic Planning and Development has produced so far can, in any sense, be described as a plan.  It has been a setting forth of options or, to use the word now being used rather <Col N="490" /> more fully in the present contribution by the Minister, the setting forth of &ldquo;scenarios&rdquo;.  Well, a scenario is not a plan and yet the Minister has told us, in his introductory document, that, in so far as the future is concerned, the emphasis would be, to a very great extent, on the production of scenarios for the economy.</P>
    <P>Scenarios seem to be much more like what one might describe as literary essays in futurology; they are certainly not plans.  If the Minister is going to water down even further the process of planning in the country's life by opting for scenarios and discussions he will become perhaps one of the best paid economic authors in the country.  He has a guaranteed income but he should be doing his job as a Minister for planning the country rather than pursuing a scenario of ideas and producing stimulating notions to push around.  That is not his job in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be very useful but it is not the job of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  We have not had economic planning by this Government because there has not been a single document committed to the idea of economic planning which comes within the bawl of an ass of economic development in this country.  The second programme pursued by another member of the Minister's party had specialised targets which were not achieved.  The last Government had the courage to say what they felt poultry production should be five years hence, what they expected cattle production would be five years hence, what output of cloth was expected five years hence.  For the people engaged in these sectors we had targets setting out what the Government expected was going to happen in their sector and they had something to work on in making their own investment plan. That has not happened with this Government.  They have documents described as plans but they are merely setting forth suggestions about things that might happen and things the <Col N="491" /> Government might do.  This Government have never had a plan in any sense if by plan is meant making up your mind what you are going to do and doing it over a time.  They have had fewer plans than any other Government in the history of our State.</P>
      <P>A tax policy is an essential element of economic management in any country. The tax policy of the Minister for Finance for 1979 may have been appropriate in Victorian times.  His present tax policy is not planning at all.  As far as tax policy is concerned this Government have been the most erratic of any Government in my relatively brief knowledge of politics in this country.  We had a white paper which produced one set of ideas as to the possible way in which the country, and particularly agriculture, might be taxed.  Then we had the budget less than six weeks later with another set of proposals which were the firm, definite proposals of the Government in so far as one understood a budget to be a firm statement of the Government's taxation policy.  Within two months of that the whole budget package had been overturned and we had a whole new set of proposals for farmer taxation and concessions to the PAYE sector.  Indeed, a bit earlier in the year we were told that £39 million was going to be given away to the PAYE sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had erratic planning within the area of the Government's own competence. It is hard for a Government to tell an industrialist &ldquo;You must plan what you are going to do over the years ahead.  You must tell us, if you are going to get a grant from us, what you will be doing with your output five years from now.&rdquo;  In the case of industry the Government and their agencies want industrialists to plan and to say what they will be doing five years from now.  With the evidence before us so far the indications are that this Government do not know as far as their major responsibilities for taxation are concerned what they will be doing even five weeks from now.  That is a very bad example of economic planning.  It indicates the total lack of any attempt at economic planning by this Government.  The Minister is <Col N="492" /> not wholly responsible for this but he is responsible for economic planning and he primarily must answer for failure on the part of the Government to plan their activity in a proper fashion.</P>
    <P>I have expressed concern in the past about the great emphasis being put, not only by this Government but also by others, on negotiations between what are described as the social partners in working out the economic policy of the Government.  The budget was presented in January.  Negotiations subsequently took place with the social partners outside this House and the budget was totally limited as a result of these discussions, negotiations or confrontations with the social partners.  The social partners have a steady mandate for their own members, the employers' organisations, the unions and the farmers' organisations but they do not speak for the Irish people as a whole.  The only body which does that is this House.  If the budget presented to this House and approved by this House&mdash;that is the important thing&mdash;is going to be negotiated totally outside this House by those described as the social partners, that is a diminution of the authority of this House and it is handing over part of the sovereignty of this House to other bodies.</P>
    <P>Large sections of the Irish community are not represented by the social partners and the Government in speaking to the social partners are not speaking to the representatives of large sections of the Irish community.  I will give examples of people who are not represented.  Housewives are not represented by the social partners. Young people who are not in employment are not represented by the social partners, neither are retired people, particularly retired people on fixed incomes who find their savings reduced in value as the result of inflationary policies pursued by the Government in negotiating with these social partners.  The self-employed are not represented except for the farmers, and the farmers are not fully involved in these negotiations.  I would not hesitate to say that a majority of our people are unrepresented by any of the social partners.  The Government are trying to confine their negotiations in <Col N="493" /> relation to their economic policy with the social partners inside and outside this House on policies different from those approved by this House.</P>
    <P>One group who have lost out very badly in this because they had not muscle to be involved are people&mdash;retired people, in particular&mdash;whose income is derived from national loans.  Consider a person who in 1950 had £2,500 and invested it then in the national loan.  They will get back £2,500, the amount originally invested in 1950.  Had the money been invested in a house in Ailesbury Road&mdash;which in 1950 could have been bought for £2,500&mdash;instead of getting back £2,500 from the national loan now the person could sell that house for £100,000.  People who did what they were told to do and invested in the national loan to help the efforts of the Government of the day&mdash;and who are now being urged to do the same under the present Government&mdash;have lost out radically.  Their money has depreciated very severely, whereas if they had invested in house property or something else they would have done far better.  That is a direct result of the inflation policy pursued by successive Governments in this country and this arises in large measure from the type of negotiations I have been describing taking place outside this House with the so-called social partners who do not include people on fixed incomes living on interest from national loans which they patriotically bought to help the country with its work.  They are not represented and they lose out as a result of the policy being pursued.  We must take another look at this.  We must reassert the sovereignty of this House in so far as economic management is concerned.  It is this House's own fault if we do not have an adequate say in economic matters in this country because we have not reformed our procedure to enable us to have a proper say.</P>
    <P>I have urged before&mdash;and I do not wish to come in conflict with the Chair again about mentioning something which is now with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges&mdash;that if we can reform our procedures, establish committees, get ourselves involved in a meaningful way in economic planning <Col N="494" /> and have the information to do so, we, as this House, will be able to reassert our position.  Ultimately I believe in the maxim that knowledge is power, and we in this House just do not have the knowledge of what is going on in the economy because so much of the things being decided are being decided behind closed doors between the Government and other people and the results of those discussions are not fully published.  For instance I believe that in the case of the National Economic and Social Council, a body representing all of the interests in this economy practically without exception, there is no representative of these Houses.  There is not a single Deputy or Senator appointed to that body representing these Houses.  There happens to be one Senator Noel Mulcahy, but he was appointed for another reason. There is not a single person on that body representing this House.  Yet this House is supposed to be the body that ultimately controls this country.  Yet we have a body amassing tremendously valuable information, engaging in discussions on the whole range of economic policy; on which there is not a single Deputy or Senator.  That body was set up by my Government.  I will make a gift of the point to the Minister, if he wants to say &ldquo;You were in office for four years; why did you not get Deputies on to that body&rdquo;.  He has a point and I am afraid I have no answer for him.  But the point still remains that Deputies who were elected by the people must be involved in this sort of economic management of the country if we are to make real progress in re-asserting democratic sovereignty, the voice of people speaking for the entire people in the economic management of the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to express some concern and ask the Minister for some information about the EEC Regional Development Fund and generally about regional policy.  I have heard some information to the effect that Ireland has not been using its entire allocation from the regional fund, that projects are slow in coming through and that money available for this country is not being spent in full here.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that we are getting every penny we can from the regional fund, small and <Col N="495" /> all as it is.  I should like an assurance also that the regional fund is being genuinely used for new projects in this country and is not being used merely to prop-up existing Government programmes, namely, saving money for the Exchequer without itself providing any new impetus for development here.  In fact it is my information that under this Government, and indeed under the last, the EEC Regional Fund has been used for no other purpose than to prop-up existing Government programmes and has not resulted in new initiatives at all in the area of economic policy over and above what probably would have happened anyway in a general sense.</P>
    <P>I believe that the regional fund must be separately accounted for and managed.  It is not sufficient to have a number of projects and then, when it comes to the end of the year with those projects already in being, to say: &ldquo;Ah well, we will call this one a regional fund project; we will put a regional fund tag on it, saying that this one was funded by the regional fund&rdquo;&mdash;a purely notional operation.  I believe there must be a separate plan for all projects being aided by the EEC Regional Fund so that it would be seen to be the case that this is a separate programme over and above the ordinary programmes of the Government and that the regional fund is not being used merely to prop up existing Government finance but is being used for development in a real sense.</P>
    <P>In the section of the Minister's speech dealing with the establishment of social policies the Minister says that there is work going on.  He continues to say:</P>
    <P>This work includes research on income distribution, including the redistributive effects of public expenditure and taxation policies, and the development of appropriate social indicators.</P>
    <P>It is very fortunate that this work is going on and I welcome it.  However, I should like an assurance from the Minister that this work will be carried out by the Central Statistics Office.  I do not want to see statistics for this country, which are supposed to be <Col N="496" /> perfectly unbiassed, being produced by the Minister's Department.  We have an agency for collecting statistics, that is, the Central Statistics Office.  It would be a very bad development if the Minister's Department were to get involved in the business of statistics collection.</P>

      <P>As far as the county development teams are concerned, it is insufficient that at present they are concerned largely with industrial development.  I believe there should be county agricultural development teams concerned with the development of agriculture.  I see the role of county development teams as one of co-ordinating the activities of all State agencies in so far as they affect a particular county.  There is a particular need for this in regard to agriculture, in that we have in each county, for instance, a county committee of agriculture operating, we have An Foras Talúntais concerned with research, the district veterinary offices concerned with veterinary matters, we have the farm development services concerned with giving out grants for farm buildings and probably there are a number of other bodies, such as, for example, the Agricultural Credit Corporation concerned with giving credit for agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no way in which the activities of all these bodies affecting agriculture, all ultimately having the same objectives, are being co-ordinated in any real sense so far as a particular county is concerned. I should like to see a situation in which a county agricultural development team was set up encompassing all of the bodies affecting agriculture in the county, and that that body would be given responsibility not merely for co-ordinating their activities but also for drawing up specific targets for output from agriculture in the county in question over a five year period.  That would have two effects: firstly, it would ensure that the ACC were pursuing credit <Col N="498" /> policies consistent with the policy on agricultural advice of the county committee of agriculture and the policy on farm building grants of the farm development services.  Under the present regime they could be pursuing quite contradictory policies.  We could have a situation in which the Department of Agriculture were trying to pursue policies in a given county to reduce the price of land in order that small farmers could buy it and, on the other hand, the Agricultural Credit Corporation were pursuing completely contradictory policies in giving loans to farmers to buy land, increasing the competition for land and its price.</P>
    <P>I believe there should be co-ordination of activity at county level with targets drawn up for output at county level by somebody, and I believe the body in question should be the county development team.  If they draw up targets and fail to achieve them, there will be an opportunity for asking why targets set for a particular county were not achieved. There would be somebody, namely the team in question and the bodies represented on it, on whom responsibility would rest for the failure to achieve those targets.  That would constitute a very valuable approach to economic planning at county level.  We must use the county as a unit of production because it is one with which people identify and where people can see returns for effort at county level where they may not necessarily see them at national or international level.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problems in the country at present is to be found in the area of manpower planning.  This is the point I made in the course of my contribution on the White Paper and is one of the reasons I am unhappy that the Minister has not yet replied to that debate.  Indeed, I do not know whether he would have replied to the point I shall make now, which I made on that occasion also, but I hope he does on this occasion. I believe we have big problems here in regard to manpower planning. To take an example, in the case of the skilled trades, although we have generally quite a high level of unemployment in the country, I elicited information from the Minister for Labour showing that <Col N="499" /> there are at least 2,000 jobs vacant in this country because there are not people with the skills to fill them.</P>
    <P>There are about 400 bricklayers, 300 industrial pipelayers and about 800 engineers of various kinds who cannot be found to fill jobs that are waiting to be filled.  Not only are they jobs for which people would be getting remuneration but they are also an obstacle to the creation of other jobs.  The result of pumping extra money into housing does not take the form of extra houses being built simply because in some cases bricklayers are not available to build them.  The existence of skill shortages resulting directly from deficiencies in manpower planning means that jobs are unfilled and prevents the creation of other jobs.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem in our educational system.  Our schools are producing people with the leaving certificate who cannot get a job, not because the jobs are not there but because they have been getting money from the State to acquire qualifications for jobs that do not exist.  That is a bad situation as far as State investment is concerned.  I am not disputing anyone's right to take any courses or qualifications they like regardless of whether it results in their getting a job.  If the State is investing money in post-intermediate education or in third level education, it must ensure that that money is going to create skills in our economy which match the jobs which exist in our economy.  That is a central responsibility of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
    <P>A number of Departments are involved. The Department of Education and the Department of Labour are involved. The universities, who guard their autonomy jealously, are involved.  The Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy are involved because they are responsible for the creation of jobs and consequently the type of skill needs which will arise in our economy five years hence.  The proper planning of manpower policy cannot be the responsibility of one Minister.  It must be the responsibility of the entire Government. The Government must set up institutions <Col N="500" /> to ensure that manpower planning takes place on a proper basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister should adopt the model of the National Board for Science and Technology in the area of manpower planning.  I do not wish to bore the House with a lengthy dissertation on how that board works, but it is responsible for co-ordinating science expenditure. It does not take away responsibility from individual Departments but ensures that all the science expenditures of individual Departments are centralised.  The Government are presented with a comprehensive picture of the science expenditure every year so its budget can be allocated rationally on the basis of scientific needs as seen by the Government in the global sense.  It prevents the Government from being buffetted hither and thither by interests in agricultural institutes as against the universities and so on.</P>
    <P>The same should be done in the area of manpower planning which, with all due respect to science, is a more important area in the immediate sense.  I am not deprecating science.  If the Minister introduces this and gets credit for it, I do not mind.  It would not cost him anything to introduce it and would provide a continuing institution for a review of this kind of activity long after the Minister has departed from his present portfolio to another responsibility. If the Minister does that he will be leaving behind him something far more valuable than the succession of papers which, no matter how one looks at them, are obsolete within a short time.</P>
    <P>I strongly criticise the economic plans being produced by the Government in that they take very little, if any, account of energy shortages in the world.  If we are to increase production by 10 per cent, say over two years, that automatically means we increase our energy consumption by about 7 per cent in the same two-year period.  There is that ratio between employment creation and energy consumption.  If we are investing in a form of economic development which is highly dependent on imported energy, we are building our economic prosperity in the form of a sand castle which could be easily washed away by a tide arising from a <Col N="501" /> world energy crisis, in that those jobs so expensively created could not be sustained if that energy was not there. Running through the Minister's documents on economic planning is a total absence of any recognition of the fact that these plans are only possible if the energy is there to sustain them. Economic growth can only be sustained over a long period if energy is there to provide for that level of growth.</P>
    <P>In his document on energy policy, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy has pointed out, rightly and perhaps even conservatively, that our consumption of energy is expected to double by 1990 over our consumption in 1977.  Where is that energy coming from?  Will it be there in 1990?  It is open to question whether it will.  There are grave doubts about the safety of nuclear energy in the long term.  These doubts are underlined by what has happened in Harrisburg.  If we are building our entire economy on nuclear energy being available, we are building on a weak support. People who are queuing for petrol today do not need to be reminded that oil is in uncertain to run out in the long term.  The more time goes on, the more expensive it is to extract.</P>
    <P>The other alternative available, we are told, is coal.  The Soviet Union control 60 per cent of the world's coal.  We know that the part of the world we are living in is in ideological conflict with the Soviet Union.  In the event of that conflict escalating there is no guarantee that the Soviet Union or its allies, like Poland who are now supplying&mdash;I do not have the actual figure&mdash;about 80 per cent of our coal, will be doing so in five years time.  There is every evidence that the world situation is worsening.  Why are the Russians establishing such a massive superiority in the area of tanks in Eastern Europe?  They have a three to one superiority as far as tanks are concerned. They could be at the Rhine within a week.  A tank is an offensive weapon, not a defensive one.  Perhaps it is because the Russian military establishment want to spend money on that sort of thing and they are very influential with the old men who are in power in the Kremlin.  If that is so, it is not something <Col N="502" /> to be worried about.  However, if it is what it appears to be&mdash;an indication of a slightly unfriendly disposition towards the people near whose borders they are stationing these tanks&mdash;it does not augur very well for the long term good relations between this part of the world and the part of the world on which we must depend for our coal.  That is where the plant on the Shannon Estuary is ultimately going to get its coal from.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the energy we need to sustain the optimistic plans he is making will be there in five years time?  If the Minister is not, he must make alternative plans.  I would point out to him that the energy is not really there in the long run if the Third World is to develop as we hope it does. We are consuming, for instance, about 150 times as much energy per head as the average person in Ethiopia is consuming. If, as a result of programmes being pursued in the world, the Ethiopian standard of living is to be increased to even half our standard of living, the Ethiopian will obviously be consuming 70 to 80 times more energy than he is consuming now.  Therefore, there will be even more demands from other parts of the world in which energy is not being consumed to any significant degree now. To use the Minister's words, that indicates a gloomy long-run scenario for our long-term prosperity.  It is important to realise that our economic prosperity depends not on technology but on energy.  We are consuming about 150 times as much energy as we were consuming 100 years ago and it is because we have been able to increase our consumption of an energy that is already limited in supply that we have been so prosperous but if that energy is not available to us in from ten to 15 years time our standard of living will be reduced again, perhaps not to the level at which it was in the 19th century but to the level experienced in the thirties when, I understand, this part of the world was not a pleasant place in which to live.</P>
    <P>Therefore, our economic planning must take account of energy needs.  I question, and I go no further than to use the word &ldquo;question&rdquo;, our reliance on heavy capital grants to industry as a means of fuelling economic growth.  I <Col N="503" /> say this because highly-capitalised industry, using automatic processes and low human inputs of energy is much more reliant on imported energy resources than is a labour-intensive industry. Yet, we are spending almost all our money in the area of industrial development in promoting energy-intensive and capital-intensive industry, a type of industry which, as I have indicated, may not be able to survive and which may become as irrelevant as the dinosaur in 15 years time if the present uncertain energy situation continues. Far from being more secure the jobs that will be created by this capital-intensive industry may well be less secure than jobs in labour-intensive industry such as the clothing and footwear industries which we are told will not survive in the long run.  We are highly inefficient users of energy.  The latest figures to which I have access&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is endeavouring to engage in a full-scale debate on energy, a subject that is much more appropriate to another Estimate and another Minister.  I have given the Deputy the opportunity of making his point but he made that point about ten minutes ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to engage in a full-scale debate on energy.  I would merely point out that in economic planning the question of energy must be considered.  The Government have ignored energy needs in the sense of their being the essential prerequisite for economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer also to another concept that is much beloved of the Minister, that is, the concept of work sharing.  I note that in the national understanding document there appears the statement that Government, industry and the ICTU will investigate immediately work sharing possibilities in so far as work sharing can be used as a job creating mechanism without affecting adversely our competitiveness.  I should like the Minister to tell us how it is possible to have work sharing without affecting competitiveness adversely, either <Col N="504" /> directly or indirectly.  If there are to be more people working but doing the same amount of work and, presumably, being paid the same level of remuneration, competitiveness must be affected immediately. Therefore, the Minister should spell out clearly what he means by work sharing and tell us how he thinks it will happen and in what sectors he thinks it will take place.</P>
    <P>Where the Japanese employ three people to do a job we employ five but if we introduce work sharing and employ seven people to do the same job and if our workers are demanding the same rate of remuneration as that paid to Japanese workers, it is inevitable that the cost of production here would be two and one third times the cost of production in Japan.  The Minister has said that work sharing would come about in the context of agreement in Europe.  Perhaps he will succeed in persuading our European colleagues to agree.  Perhaps the Germans will agree to be inefficient like us so that we will be no more efficient than they.  However, the Germans are not likely to continue being inefficient for very long if they find they are losing markets to the Japanese, whether in cars or in other market areas.</P>
    <P>We have been talking about work sharing now for the past two years.  It is referred to almost in every document published by the Government but if we are to continue talking about it it would be helpful to have a clear answer from the Minister, based on all the resources of economic theory available to him, as to how he proposes to achieve work sharing without our economic competitiveness being adversely affected and he should tell us also how many jobs he expects will be created in this way and where these jobs will be.  If the Minister tells us that work sharing is not contemplated in those industries that are directly exporting, that are competing directly with others, but that it is contemplated in the service sector, for instance, that that would mean employing more civil servants and would not affect our international competitiveness, we will not accept such argument because if we inflate the size of our civil service we will have to inflate our tax burden and such inflation would be levelled ultimately <Col N="505" /> on exports.  The taxes would be paid by those engaged in exports.  Therefore, in my opinion, though I should hope to be dissuaded on this, work sharing must affect competitiveness.  Consequently, the reliance in the national understanding on the concept of work sharing is not valid.</P>
    <P>The only way in which there can be work sharing in the long run is by the adoption of the Soviet model of government whereby there is job rationing and nobody is out of work but I know that this is not the sort of economy that either the Minister or anybody else in this House would be interested in having.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude my remarks by referring at some length to the position of agriculture in our national economy. Farmers and agriculture generally have been receiving very unfair treatment from everybody, including the Government, in so far as their contribution to the national economy is concerned.  But there are a number of points which should be made in order to put the scene into its proper prespective.  The agricultural tax packet which was announced recently by the Government was not justified on the basis of incomes of individual farmers but it was justified on the basis that all incomes of all farmers, regardless of whether the farmers were in the tax net, were grossed up in order to achieve one global figure for agriculture.  Then the Government said that they would take a share of the global figure for the entire sector, regardless of whether a large part of that figure was made up of the incomes of farmers who would not be in the tax net in any case.  The absurdity of the argument could be demonstrated better&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important to point out so far as Government expenditure and agriculture are concerned, that in 1972, 15 per cent of Government expenditure was on agriculture.  That has been reduced to a mere 5 per cent of total Government expenditure.  There has been a significant reduction in the relative contribution of the Government to agriculture.  Notwithstanding the very significant increases in incomes in farming which resulted from membership of the EEC, the average income per head in agriculture is still significantly below the average income per head in the rest of the economy.  It has been estimated that up to 20,000 extra jobs in downstream and upstream agricultural based industries could be created as a result of expansion in agriculture.  Any reduction in agricultural output, whether induced by external factors, or by taxation policies of the Government will not only hit farmers' incomes but the incomes of non-farming people.  An example of this is the meat factories.  We have a situation where about 500 lay-offs have taken place in a meat factory directly as a result of a reduction in the sale of cattle to a factory because of a variety of factors including the tax measures.  There is no more eloquent indication of the interdependence of agriculture and the rest of the economy.  All who criticise agriculture should bear this in mind.</P>
      <P>I agree that farmers must pay a fair share of tax by way of income tax on the accounts system but I will not labour the point.  The idea of having three or four taxes where we could have one tax is ridiculous and it is not fair.  Farmers should be put in the same position as everybody else by being put on full income tax on accounts with whatever modifications are necessary so that farmers will be treated like everybody else.  That would go a long way towards achieving equity in the tax code and towards achieving social harmony.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister and the present <Col N="507" /> Government have adopted a pessimistic attitude in relation to the contribution of agriculture to the economy in that, whereas in 1977 a 9.4 per cent growth in agricultural output took place and yet in 1979-1980 the Minister projects in the White Paper a target of merely a 4 per cent growth per annum.  That is less than half of what was achieved in 1977 in the agricultural sector.  That scaling down of the Minister's hopes in relation to agriculture needs to be justified by the Minister in a way he never had an opportunity to justify it, because he did not reply so far to the debate on this White Paper.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this wide-ranging debate.  This Government came in on statements that they would create jobs and economic stability.  The Minister is the author of these statements, so it is important that we can put our points to him.  I agree with economic planning even though some people on this side of the House disagree with it.  It is desirable and necessary to have positive policies to plan the future. However, we see both Green and White Papers from the far side of the House and little else.  In the area of economic planning one would have thought that the first thing to do would be to unite people.  We all have a stake in the country whether we are trade unionists, farmers, housewives, business or professional people and it is in our interests to work together.  Economic planning and development must mean that we harness the good will of all the sections in a common purpose to develop the economy for the betterment of everybody, particularly the weaker sections who have not a strong voice.  When one reflects and looks at what has happened in our society, one can say that we were never more disunited, fragmented, dis-organised and discontented.  If this is a result of the magic formula of economic planning, then I believe economic planning has failed miserably.  There is discontent, with one section accusing another section and one must lay the blame at the doorstep of the Government.  The man from the town is against the countryman and only yesterday we saw two uniformed sections in combat on the streets of Dublin.</P>

We have heard a lot from the present Minister; he must be given credit for putting his head on the block and saying what he has to say.  We hear so little from the others that I often get the impression that the Minister present has to take the decisions and it is not unfair of me to say that.  The present Minister has been basically responsible for the national understanding which is being discussed at the moment and what I am saying here is relevant to it.  I do not want to see turmoil and disputes but if we are to get a national understanding we must understand the problems.  In my view the Minister had conferred on himself the duty to take on this role.  It is part of economic development.  We cannot divorce the strife and the problems we have today from the Minister.  I am not blaming him for them; I am merely stating the facts.  The Chair has said that the matter is relevant to another Department but the present Minister has a part to play in all Departments.  He is the person who ties all the bits together and gets them into some kind of shape for a policy.  Therefore, I do not think I am out of order in referring to the problems we have today.</P>

We will not get a national understanding by conflict, by burying our heads in the sand or by ignoring people who have legitimate claims.  That is part of the national understanding.  I want to see it work because it is in the best interests of all but we will not get a national understanding with the conditions prevailing today.  I am not blaming the Minister for that but he is one of the authors of the national understanding and it comes within his ambit.  I am entitled to make reference to the reasons why I believe some action should be taken if we want to get the national understanding off the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for the nation that the national understanding gets approval because if it does not it can spell further gloom for the country.  We have seen nothing but gloom and problems in the past few months.  If the national understanding is to be accepted by the majority in the country it must be discussed. <Col N="511" /> The Minister present is anxious that the national understanding be accepted. He should use his good offices with his Cabinet colleagues to see what can be done to eliminate the strife and the problems that exist on the streets of Dublin today.  I have no doubt that he will do that.  If the Minister cannot influence the trade union movement to accept the national understanding he should try to get someone to direct that these matters be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  If we can get a situation where reason prevails quickly within the organisations the national understanding will be accepted.  The climate in the past few days will have a dramatic effect on the decision regarding the national understanding.</P>

      <P>Deputy Michael O'Leary was given permission to raise on the Adjournment the non-co-operation of the interests involved in implementing the 2 per cent levy, with the consequent danger of an increase in meat prices and the measures the Government are taking to avoid such a consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this week there was realisation amongst the public that the saga of the 2 per cent levy would not be ended without severe consequences for consumers.  There were reports that butchers' leaders and farmers' leaders were predicting that the 2 per cent levy would be reflected in increased prices for meat products and that consumers could expect price increases in the order of 10 per cent. Butchers have said that if they must collect the 2 per cent farm levy for the Government the consumer will have to pick up the bill.  They have also said that the levy idea is unworkable.  The concept of the levy is outside the scope of our discussion today, but a convincing answer is needed from the Minister to consumers who are reeling under price <Col N="512" /> increases consequent on the removal of food subsidies.  They must be told whether, as a result of the unworkability of the 2 per cent levy, there will be a dizzy ascent in meat prices.  The Minister must give convincing evidence that the housewife will not be forced to pick up the tab.</P>
      <P>There has been a rather strange denial from the Department.  A departmental spokesman said on Wednesday, 9 May that consumer resistance would ensure that beef prices would not increase dramatically because housewives would simply change to pork, mutton or chicken.  I do not know who this spokesman was or what his official status could be.  It appears he was saying that consumer resistance would mean a shift from the more expensive meat products to cheaper meat not affected by the levy, and it would seem that the butchers' representatives are on the right track in predicting a 10 per cent price increase.</P>
      <P>In one of the national daily newspapers on 1 May a reputable commentator said that the farmer who fed his heifer during the long winter will look for a price which will give him a profit and will not allow a 2 per cent deduction. Butchers purchasing these beasts at marts or elsewhere will find that the prices have gone up and, as we predicted, the 2 per cent levy will be exacted from the housewife.  The departmental spokesman spoke of consumer resistance as the only defence in this situation.  The Department say the scheme is workable, while butchers say that it is unworkable.  Reputable agricultural correspondents say that farmers will look for prices which will give a profit and that unless a law is brought in forcing the farmer to sell at a price he will hold on to his beast until it is worth more money.  Already we have heard of one factory closing down, presumably the closure being contributed to in no small measure by this reaction among farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a Government who can be so loquacious on many national issues we have a reticence about what is to be done in this situation.  We have had simply a reassurance by an anonymous departmental spokesman that consumer <Col N="513" /> resistance will look after the matter.  The immediate effect will be less beef and higher prices, as well as the disruption of the operations of the meat factories and consequent unemployment.  The commentator to whom I referred earlier said he would not be surprised if the marts mutinied in regard to the levy.  However long and protracted were the recent discussions between farmers' leaders and the Government, there still remains opposition among farmers to the imposition of the levy.  That matter lies outside the scope of this debate, but apparently there will be no defence erected between the consumer and the Government's inability to exact the 2 per cent levy.  It has been said that an army of taxmen would be necessary to collect the levy and no satisfactory explanation has been given by any Government Minister to disarm the well-founded suspicion that consumers will, as usual, be expected to pay the price.  It is not as if we were talking about consumers who have been untouched recently by price rises or as if this were a Government whose hands were clean in regard to price rises.  Prices have been rising steadily over recent months.  There have been increases in the cost of milk, butter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be hypothetical but during the past few days there have been many statements by spokesmen for different representative groups pointing out that the levy scheme is unworkable and why, in their opinion, the full impact of the price increase will be felt by the consumer.  I am not entering into the rights and wrongs of the levy scheme itself but it is not satisfactory that the only reassurance to the consumer has been the statement by the departmental spokesman that consumer resistance will deal with the matter. It is remarkable that this statement about pending price increases could be made without a fuller and more adequate official reaction.  All the statements <Col N="514" /> have been to the effect that the consumer will have to pay.  We have the opinion of experts that farmers will compensate themselves for the 2 per cent levy.  The law would appear to operate in that instance that only the consumers will have to take up the price tag.</P>
      <P>It has been argued that the original idea of the levy was not well founded, but that is outside the scope of the debate and I do not want to go into it. The Government appear to have rushed into an improvised scheme without full consideration of its impact on consumers. In recent months the consumer has been at the receiving end of many increases in prices inspired by Government policy, inspired by such actions as the removal of the food subsidies.  We have no guarantee that the farmer who fed his heifer over the long winter will seek a price giving him a profit but not allowing for the 2 per cent deduction.</P>
      <P>Information available at present, unless the Minister can reassure the House otherwise, is to the effect that the immediate effect of the levy will be less beef and higher prices.  We have had the disruption in one factory to which I have already referred with a number of people laid off, I think, today.  The former agriculture spokesman, Deputy Clinton, referred to that yesterday.  In the circumstances I do not know whether the Government could consider postponing the 2 per cent levy scheme.  I do not know if that is contemplated but certainly if they have no means of ensuring that the consumer will be protected, they must consider what steps they should take.  From the very beginning they have been careful to say that the levy was not directed at the consumer: that has been a consistent Government approach.  Yet this week and in the weeks ahead it seems that the consumer will be asked to pay the piper.  Probably the consumer will move to poultry and other substitutes. The spokesman at the Department conveniently made that point in his statement, that consumer resistance would ensure that meat prices would not increase dramatically because the housewife would simply move to pork, mutton or chicken and the levy does not apply to pigs, sheep or poultry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The departmental spokesman also <Col N="515" /> said last night that the butchers' organisations' claim that the levy would lead to price increases had been carefully considered.  He said that a number of market forces would ensure that the levy would operate as planned.  No information is available to me or to anybody who has examined the situation&mdash;I am relying on the statements of certain agricultural experts who have considered it&mdash;to suggest that normal market forces in this instance would lead to anything other than increased prices for the consumer. The effect of an across-the-board increase at the rate of 10 per cent, if that turns out to be the cumulative effect of this 2 per cent, being borne by the consumer can be imagined.  If butchers' organisations and those involved in the meat trade can say that it will be borne by the consumer, the House and the country need a good deal more reassurance from the Minister than we have had.  Consumers have had enough bad news in recent months.  Over the past 12 months there has been an increase of 17.9 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree but I think the Chair will agree that I have not dwelt very long on the over-all position regarding price increases.  I have concentrated on the disturbing implication of a breakdown in the operation of the levy and that it is the consumer who will have to pay the price.  There appears to be no adequate official refutation at this point other than a spokesman of the Department maintaining that normal market forces will prevent this happening. That is not satisfactory.  I ask the Minister to clarify the situation, to explain how the levy will work not to the detriment of the consumer and to explain the means by which it will be collected and the means of ensuring that it will not be passed on automatically to the consumer.  That is my concern in raising the matter this afternoon&mdash;the fact that it has been commented on at length during the week by various <Col N="516" /> national organisations and the danger that there would follow a further escalation of meat prices.  It is not satisfactory in these circumstances to have a departmental spokesman say that normal market forces would look after the matter.</P>
      <P>There is the other consequence of the effect on employment which could be very serious in the meat factories.  I should like to give Deputy Bruton an opportunity of contributing, with the permission of the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on another occasion that I think the levy is wholly wrong but it is doubly wrong that it should have to be paid by the consumer.  It was not introduced as a consumer tax and yet there is every reason to believe that in the case of meat that is what it will turn out to be.  There was a very apt quotation by Deputy O'Leary of the optimistic departmental statement to the effect that consumer resistance and reliance on market forces would ensure that the levy was not passed on&mdash;that was quite groundless.  The fact is that in a situation where there is diminished supply market forces operate to ensure that it is passed on.  If there is more demand than the supply can meet market forces operate to ensure that the levy or other tax will be paid by the purchasers rather than the sellers.  We are in such a situation as regards meat because of a serious rundown of cattle numbers and there is a static or increasing demand for meat.  It is quite clear in that situation that market forces will operate to ensure that whatever levy is imposed will be paid by consumers.  That could only be prevented by the introduction of a maximum prices order such as operates in the case of milk and milk products.  But it is not possible to have a maximum prices order for meat because of the variety of cuts and qualities.  One would have to have about 2,000 levels of price for different cuts and qualities of meat to enforce an adequate system of retail price control.  That is not on and market forces certainly will not work in the present demand and supply situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The levy is quite unenforceable because the premises by which it is to be collected are supposed to be licensed and <Col N="517" /> under the provisions of the order those premises are supposed to apply in writing for licences.  How can they apply in writing when there is no postal service?</P>

      <P>This order is completely unworkable and the control system which the Minister is endeavouring to institute to prevent the cost of the levy being passed on to the consumer is unworkable. Deputy O'Leary was perfectly correct in raising this matter.  Further, the EEC price will not control the matter in respect of meat for this country because meat for this country is supplied by heifer beef, essentially a different commodity from bullock beef used for exports.  The export price determined by the EEC is the price essentially for steers or bullocks and the EEC will not control the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic premise of Deputy O'Leary's question is invalid, as I hope to demonstrate in a moment.  So far as the levy is operating at the moment, it is operated satisfactorily in regard to milk and non-mart cattle transactions.  The mart representatives have indicated, in discussions with the Revenue Commissioners, that in the marts, meat factories and exporters who are liable for the levy and, indeed, purchase far more in the marts than butchers do, are operating the mart's terms of sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Leary said, I issued a statement on this matter and set out the position as I saw it.  It would appear that I have to explain to Deputy O'Leary what is basically the flaw in the argument he is putting forward, which is based on statements by people with a vested interest in this matter.  The suggestions by the butcher's representatives that the consumer will end up bearing the levy on cattle, or that in some way the 2 per cent levy will transform itself <Col N="518" /> into 10 per cent increase in meat prices, cannot be accepted.</P>
    <P>First, on what basis is it said that, even if the butchers had to pay another 2 per cent, this transforms itself into a 10 per cent increase in the price of meat? Nobody has attempted to explain that.  It has been accepted by Deputy O'Leary as a fact, which I have to refute.  An assertion of that kind has to be explained. Secondly, there are a number of factors which operate in this matter to protect the consumer.  The consumer price argument starts from, to put it mildly, the unlikely premise that, before the introduction of the levy, butchers and farmers between them were short selling themselves to the extent of at least 2 per cent rather than charging what the market would bear.  The argument goes on that they can now simply raise meat prices by 2 per cent&mdash;I am ignoring the nonsense about 10 per cent&mdash;on account of the levy without loss to their trade.</P>
    <P>Are we seriously expected to believe farmers and butchers, prior to the introduction of the levy were selling their beasts or their meat for at least 2 per cent less than they could get?  If Deputy O'Leary believes that, he would believe anything.  Of course he does not believe it.  He is simply trying to cash in on what he sees as a difficulty.  Before I conclude I will have a word or two to say on that, I hope.  Most consumers have far too much respect for the business acumen of farmers and butchers to accept the proposition that up to now they have been selling for at least 2 per cent below what they could have received.</P>
    <P>As regards the factors operating on the market, as I am sure Deputy O'Leary knows, the major factor operating in regard to market prices for meat is the price the animals will achieve on the export market&mdash;in other words, when they are bought for export.  Some three-quarters of all meat killed is exported. That is the major factor in determining the price of meat.  I do not think any butcher would have the nerve to deny that because frequently they raised the price of meat for that very reason. Because the export price went up the price they had to pay in competition went up.  I accept that proposition.  It is <Col N="519" /> true.  Since the major aspect of the market is subject to the levy, how can it be alleged now that some factor will operate on what butchers purchase&mdash;at most one-quarter of the meat involved&mdash;which will be a different factor from the factor operating on the three-quarters which determines the price of meat and which is subject to the levy?</P>
    <P>It is also clear that, if the price of meat were to rise for non-market reasons, butchers could reasonably be expected to look to the North of Ireland as a source of butcher heifers which, being imports, would be free of the levy.  It is known that at least some such imports have taken place in the past week.  I would suggest to any consumers who feel their butcher is trying to take advantage of this to increase the price of meat that they should ask him why does he not get his supplies free of the levy, as is open to him.  It would cure a lot of problems if that were done.  In their own interests most butchers will be competitive and, if they are competitive, they will be charging what the market will allow as they have always done.  If they are trying to exploit the situation there will be enough of them who will be keen enough businessmen to be able to sell at a lower price and get the business.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that the market forces argument holds true whichever method of collecting the levy is operated, either the one advocated by the marts, which I accept as being reasonable, or the one argued for by the butchers' organisation.  It is an established fact that prior to the levy consumer resistance was operating to contribute to a drop in slaughterings for the domestic market.  There are other factors, and Deputy Bruton referred to them.  There is an overall drop in the size of the national herd, which is a major national problem.  It would not be appropriate for me on this occasion to go into the reasons for it.  I can say that the catastrophic drop occurred while Deputy Bruton and Deputy O'Leary were in Government.  That is outside the scope of this discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that there are alternatives available which are not subject to the levy despite Deputy O'Leary's remarks is an important factor also as regards the protection of the consumer.  I repeat that if there is to be any basis at all for the arguments being put forward one has to accept that butchers and farmers heretofore have been operating as fairy godmothers to the consumer and selling below the price they could get.  I want to make it clear that because of the drop in the national herd and because of the extremely bad weather we have been having there has been a shortage of grass and a shortage of cattle coming on the market.  Everybody knows that.  It was true before the levy came in and will be true for at least some weeks to come.  Let nobody try to pretend that difficulties in the meat factories are due to the levy.  They are due to those factors and it is well known that they would occur without the operation of the levy and when it was not known whether the levy would operate.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I am a little concerned to hear Deputy O'Leary once more, as the Labour Party have done consistently, come out against this levy.  They have done it consistently and Deputy O'Leary is doing it again here today.  He is repeating the arguments of the farming organisations' leaders that the levy is unworkable when, in fact, it is working.  He is quoting from the farming organisations and the butchers' associations with approval.  He is quoting the statement about an army of inspectors being necessary to operate it and that the Government should have considered postponement of the levy.  All the arguments from the IFA and others are being repeated here with approval by Deputy O'Leary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject the central theme of Deputy O'Leary's remarks for the reason I mentioned. You would want to be a very redulous person to believe the basis on which we are asked to accept that this will pass on to the consumer, because we are asked to believe in the fairy godmother-like qualities of farmers and butchers.  I would urge all the trade interests involved to co-operate in the levy. I know they do not want to, for other reasons besides the levy itself.  They <Col N="521" /> want to make a point.  I am aware of this.  I do not think it is good enough that Deputy O'Leary or the Labour Party should give any encouragement whatever to the farming organisations or the butchers not to co-operate in the levy or try to pass on the price to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that anything I can do to prevent that happening will be done.  I do not think it will <Col N="522" /> be necessary for me to take any action.  I hope the people in the Euro-constituency of Dublin will note the consistent support by Deputy O'Leary for opposition to the levy, the declaration that it is unworkable, and the encouragement of people to apply it in such a way that, according to him, it will increase the price to the consumer.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in the first part of the question is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>The Value-Added Tax (Amendment) Act, 1978, came into operation on 1 March 1979.  As a result the position whereby local authorities were deemed to be accountable for VAT at the zero rate in respect of the construction, repair, maintenance and improvement of roads, harbours and sewerage works has been discontinued.  The change in VAT legislation is due to the requirements of the Sixth Directive of the EEC on VAT harmonisation in the member states.</P>
      <P>From 1 March last local authorities are not entitled to register for VAT.  As regards VAT borne on importation or paid to suppliers in respect of goods or services, the authorities are unable to obtain a credit or refund in respect of any such tax from that date.</P>
      <P>Grants allocated to Tipperary (South Riding) County Council for road works in 1979 represent an increase of 29 per cent over the 1978 amounts.  The allocation for sewerage works in 1979 represents an increase of 42 per cent over 1978.  While there is no firm estimate of the extra costs as a result of the new VAT arrangements, the total increase should not be in excess of 5 per cent. Consequently no fall off in employment is expected as a result of the revised VAT arrangements.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Commissioner of Valuations that his records of agricultural land valuations are compiled by reference not to agricultural holdings but to land lots which are pieces of land specifically identifiable for rateable valuation purposes but are not synonymous with agricultural holdings.  For example, two separate land lots may be farmed as one holding.  In South Tipperary there are an estimated 12,000 land lots and it would not be practicable to extract and tabulate details of each individual case.  If, however, the Deputy wishes to elicit simply the number of land lots in South Tipperary according to the valuation categories in his question, I will arrange with the Valuation Office to furnish him with that information.</P>

      <P>European Social Fund aid is received in respect of middle-level technician and middle-management and supervisory training programmes which are held in certain third level institutions.  Such aid is also received in respect of CERT and AnCO training programmes which involve the use of third level institutions in the vocational sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the current academic year, a total of approximately 5,032 trainees are involved. Of these, approximately 1,958 are in the middle-level technician programme which carries a special <Col N="480" /> weekly training grant of £13.88.  I have arranged that this level of support should be increased in line with the percentage increase in the higher education grant and the level will then stand at £16.66, as from the commencement of the school year 1979-80.</P>
    <P>The conditions governing the award of the training grant are set out in a document entitled Special Training Programme 1978 which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, will be circulated with the Official Report.  They were drawn up by the Department of Education and formed the basis of a successful application for European Social Fund aid for the training programme.</P>
    <P>Following is the document:</P>
    <P Just="Right">Document &lsquo;B&rsquo;</P>
    <P>Special Training Programme 1978.</P>
    <P>1.  Applicants must be at least 17½ years and not older than 25 years on the 1 October 1978.</P>
    <P>2.  Applicants may be required to take a suitability test and to attend an interview.</P>
    <P>Suitability tests will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday, the 5 and 6 September unless otherwise notified.  Applicants required to undertake this test will be notified during the week preceding the testing.  Those applicants who are successful in the test will be called to interview.  Interviews will be held Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, (12, 13, 14 September) Programme will, in most instances, commence Monday, 25 September.</P>
    <P>3.  Applicants may only apply to the institution concerned for the programmes proposed by that institution.  (Please refer to the appropriate newspaper advertisement).  While every effort will be made to run the programmes advertised, circumstances may arise which will not permit the running of some of the proposed programmes.</P>
    <P>4.  Applicants must complete:</P>
    <P>(a)  The National Manpower Service Job Seekers Card.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> (b)  The Application Form for the Special Training Programmes.</P>
    <P>(c)  Any documents or forms required by the individual college.</P>
    <P>(a) and (b) will be used for selection purposes only.</P>
    <P>5.  In the event of the Leaving Certificate 1978 results not being published in sufficient time to allow applicants to meet the closing date for applications, applicants awaiting those results should return the Job Seekers Card by the closing date and the application form immediately after the Leaving Certificate results have been obtained.</P>
    <P>6.  Trainees will not be required to pay tuition fees.  A flat rate grant of £13.88 per week will be paid only during attendance at the institution (including Christmas and Easter breaks).  For one year courses the grant will be for 36 weeks and for two year courses for 36 weeks in each of the two years.</P>
    <P>7.  Trainees will be responsible for arranging their own accommodation etc. The authorities of the institution running the programmes will, however, assist where possible.  There is no special or separate grant for board lodgings, travel etc.</P>
    <P>8.  Trainees will be subject to the normal disciplines of the institutions running the programmes and must provide themselves with such text books, equipment, etc. as required and to pay such deposits or bonds as may be required by the authorities of the institution.</P>
    <P>9.  Trainees who are unpunctual or irregular in their attendance will have their grants reduced.  A grant may be discontinued in the case of a trainee whose record in this regard is deemed unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>10.  Trainees will be required to undergo such tests as may be required from time to time.  Trainees who do not show sufficient progress in their training may be dismissed from the programme.</P>
    <P>11.  Trainees who successfully complete the programmes will be awarded appropriate certificates.</P>
