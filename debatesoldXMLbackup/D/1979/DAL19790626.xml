    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government propose to introduce legislation to give effect to any of the recommendations contained in the reports of the Law Reform Commission and, if so, the proposals that were accepted and their likely date of introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The First Report (1977) and the seven working papers published by the Law Reform Commission do not contain any final recommendations. The commission have invited comment and criticism on the proposals set out in the working papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the submissions contained in the reports been considered at all by the Government?  Might I ask the Taoiseach also if he considers their content to be of any significance and, if so, whether he expects there will be a legislative proposal at an early stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That will depend on the commission themselves.  Consideration of the report and of the working papers was not intended to be confined to the Government alone, but to other <Col N="864" /> interested parties also, and as soon as they got the comments, then they would submit final recommendations and possibly draft legislation as well.  At that time the Government would consider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I raise a question arising out of that reply.  I know that, in regard to one of the reports&mdash;the one relating to the age of majority&mdash;observations were requested to be made prior to 1 March 1978.  Is the Taoiseach telling the House that nothing has occurred since that date in regard to this proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how the Deputy could possibly interpret my reply to Deputy Keating in that way.  I said that requests for comment were not confined to the Government but to other parties as well and, having received them, they intended to publish final recommendations and, possibly, draft legislation.  I have not in any way indicated what the Deputy has asked me in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I read then into the Taoiseach's response that a comment was made by the Government on the Law Reform Commission working papers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think I could indicate to the Deputy what, if any, comment the Government made on these matters because ultimately these will be matters for the Government to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I gathered from the Taoiseach's reply that the implication was that requests for comments were made to parties other than the Government. Is the implication now that the Government have made comments on these to the Law Reform Commission, or have they not?  Would it be fair to ask for a simple answer on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in touch myself with the Law Reform Commission, through the Attorney General, on a number of occasions.  That is as far as I will go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>After Questions I intend, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to make a statement on the outcome of the recent meeting of the European Council in Strasbourg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in a difficult, if not to say impossible, position in this matter because we have no copy of the communiqué and, therefore, have not been in a position to prepare ourselves for such a discussion.  The Library has no copy.  I can find in no newspaper any text of the communiqué&mdash;anything other than very indirect references to it&mdash;and I do not see how we can debate a communiqué in these circumstances.  I would have thought that the courtesy would have been given the Opposition of being sent a copy of the communiqué immediately after it was issued because it makes serious debate impossible when we have not got it.  There are quite serious questions that arise from the wording of the communiqué, or from rumours of its wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not usual to have a debate on statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach if he will consider letting us have some communiqué and postponing a debate to give us time to read it and consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed Deputy L'Estrange said that that was an awful way to treat the House.  If that is the way the House is being treated now, it was the way I was treated as well when I was in opposition.  But there is, or if not now there will be, a copy of what they call the understanding in the Library for the convenience of Deputies.  On each occasion when my predecessor reported on a previous European Summit it was done in exactly the same way that I proposed to do it today, that is, to issue in advance to the Leaders of the Opposition, and indeed <Col N="866" /> to the House, a copy of the statement I propose to make.  That will be done and the procedure is not in any way changed from what it was when the Deputy was Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection&mdash;which is open to correction&mdash;is that the text of the communiqué was available to everybody on those occasions. I do not recall a previous occasion when no version of it appeared in public. The Taoiseach has said it is an understanding, not a communiqué.  It is referred to in the Press, for what it is worth, as a communiqué, but I do not even know if there is a communiqué.  We are in an impossible position here.  For the Taoiseach to tell us that there will be one in the Library within 54 minutes of the debate is totally unsatisfactory, as he himself will agree.  Therefore, could we have copies of it?  If this is a serious Parliament we are entitled to know what was announced after that summit, or European Council Meeting, we are entitled to a chance to consider it, and indeed prepare ourselves for debate, having studied the communiqué or understanding, whatever it is called.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the House exactly the same courtesy extended to me.  The Deputy can wax eloquent now when I am following precedents set by him and his then Taoiseach.  I am acting in the same manner and, therefore, hope I am not being discourteous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <P>The Civil Service General Council Staff Panel have recently lodged a claim for the following pay increases: (i) with effect from 1 June 1979, an increase of 16½ per cent with a minimum increase of £10 per week, and (ii) with effect from 1 January 1980, an increase of 1½ per cent for each 1 per cent increase in the consumer price index in excess of 10 per cent in the period November 1978 to November 1979.  The claim was made on behalf of all civil servants covered by the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the civil service.</P>

There is a down-turn caused by adverse publicity relating to the communications difficulties as has been mentioned here already, and in connection with petrol supplies.  These have affected advance bookings.  We cannot expect that the increase recorded in the early part of the year will be maintained. Nevertheless, we are doing our utmost in the circumstances to ensure that the information in relation to the petrol situation, which has improved very much, and in relation to the Post Office situation, will be relayed to other countries to ensure that people who would still wish to come here and who might be on two minds as to whether to come or not will come.  The petrol situation has improved very considerably, as everybody can see&mdash;you do not see any queues at present&mdash;and the postal strike is over.  In all these circumstances the opportunity is there to encourage more people to come to this country and I have no doubt that we will be successful in all the efforts we are making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the petrol voucher scheme which does not cover Northern Ireland or domestic tourists.  I have examined the possibility of extending the scheme but the Deputy will appreciate the enormous administrative and control difficulties which would make it impossible to implement.  I am very conscious of the problems faced by the tourist industry and, so far as it has been possible, I have taken steps to alleviate the situation. Bord Fáilte through the regional tourism organisations have numerous information offices throughout the country where every assistance will be given to motoring tourists having difficulty in getting petrol.  My information is that now the petrol situation generally has improved and Northern Ireland visitors should not have any problems.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no evidence to that effect, but, as I said a moment ago in reply to a supplementary question, there has been a general down-turn in advance bookings.  Presumably some of these are from Northern Ireland.  As I said, now with the postal strike ended and the improved petrol situation, we can look forward to an upsurge.</P>

If tourists from Northern Ireland find themselves in difficulty they will get every help possible from the various tourist offices throughout the country.  The Deputy is aware that the large majority of tourists from Northern Ireland go to north-west Donegal or to Dublin.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.

      <P>Does the Minister accept that in the formulation of a plan for the future energy needs of this country it would be most useful to have some understanding of the contribution which could be made by solar energy?

      <P>It should be made clear that even if the experimental work going on in regard to solar energy is successful this country is not well located to take advantage of it.  The most likely beneficial use in this country is through biomass.  Even if these experiments prove very successful during the next ten years, it is very unlikely at the end of that period that a source of energy such as this could contribute more than .5 of 1 per cent or, if we were lucky, 1 per cent of our energy needs.</P>

      <P>At present grants are not available for the installation of wind, water and solar power apparatus as a means of providing electricity but the use of such sources of energy is at present the subject of research by national and international agencies.  Until well established systems for the exploitation of these renewable sources of energy are available, it would not be practicable to introduce a grants scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of people who have done this is very small. Naturally I would seek to encourage them as much as possible but it is much more feasible and sensible that the development of this kind of technology should be brought at least to a reasonable level before any question of an across-the-board grant system would <Col N="891" /> be considered.  At the moment this type of technology is extremely expensive and not very economic.  A good deal of work is being done by both national and international agencies as a matter of urgency in the light of present circumstances into the development and perfection of this technology.  It has a long way to go.  The National Board for Science and Technology are prepared to grant-aid new projects which demonstrate technology new to this country.  They are really only prepared to do that in relation not to individual households obviously but in relation to efforts to develop these technologies in academic or equivalent circumstances where the benefit of the knowledge can be applied to the country as a whole.</P>

There are many people with bright ideas as to how they can generate electricity with wind, water or solar power.  I have seen examples of this.  Is the Minister telling me that, until the commission report, simple methods of generating electricity in households would not be a contribution toward saving <Col N="892" /> energy and imported oil?  These people should be encouraged.  Would the Minister re-examine what he has said, and go back to the idea of wind chargers and solar power?</P>

      <P>Until such time as the cost factors can be brought down and these new technological systems can be made economic and attractive, it would not be in the public interest to give people grants for the installation of things like this at this time.  The proper way to go about it is to have the proper institutes here trying to develop aspects of solar power and other forms of power <Col N="893" /> which are particularly suitable for us and which would be economic in ordinary use.  As I have said, the NBST who have responsibility for the development of this kind of technology are willing to give grants in suitable cases for such work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

I should imagine that if there is, it is more likely to relate to safety than to these other practices. I would have to look up the Act.  I could not say off-hand.  The main reason for the licensing of petrol stations is to ensure that they maintain safety standards, that the tanks are buried at particular depths in the ground and that they are covered by a particular layer of concrete and things of that kind.</P>

      <P>We on this side of the House will do nothing to obstruct business but it seems highly improbable that any normal debate we intend to have on the many items listed by the Taoiseach can be completed by tomorrow evening in time to allow the Adjournment Debate to take place.  If that happens what are the Taoiseach's proposals for meeting next week in view of the referenda?  Arising from that, in relation to the referenda, what steps does the Taoiseach propose to take to alert public opinion to the fact that it is happening and to ensure that the proposals put forward are given every consideration to ensure their adoption by the Irish people?</P>

      <P>If the business is not finished this week we will continue in the ordinary way next week and, and if necessary, the week after.  As far as the bringing of the importance of the referenda to the notice of the people is concerned, arrangements have been made with the RTE Authority to have a series of television and radio broadcasts. Arrangements are also being made for the insertion of advertisements in the national press over the weekend and in the early days of next week.  Furthermore, informative leaflets will be distributed over the weekend and during next week.  By and large the public will have the opportunity of knowing what the issues are.  As far as individual parties are concerned, I expect they will use their own organisations to encourage people to vote and to vote in whatever way they suggest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to make a statement on the European Council, which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I attended in Strasbourg on 21 and 22 June.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the Council was&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Elections to the European Assembly,</P>
      <P>(2)  European Monetary System,</P>
      <P>(3)  Energy,</P>
      <P>(4)  Convergence and Economic and Social Situation,</P>
      <P>(5) Relations with Japan.</P>
      <P>There were also discussions on a number of items in the political co-operation framework.  I have arranged for copies of the Conclusions of the Presidency to be laid before the House for reference by Deputies and intend to deal only with the major points of interest, as I saw them.</P>
      <P>An important consideration for the participants was the necessity to co-ordinate the position of the Community for the Summit of the seven leading industrial powers and the Community to be held in Tokyo later this week.  In fact, it was probably this theme and the necessity to co-ordinate positions in the face of the world energy situation which dominated the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> The meeting was held in Strasbourg, on the proposal of the French Presidency, to mark the occasion of the meeting of the first directly-elected Assembly of the European Community which is to take place in that city next month.  At the election more than 60 per cent of the electorate of approximately 180 million voted.  This is a higher turn-out than in, for example, the last Presidential elections in the United States.  The European Council took note of my intention to address the Assembly at their Inaugural Meeting on 18 July&mdash;as President in office of the European Council.  They asked me to express their joint conviction that the newly-elected Assembly will serve the hopes and ambitions of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Council were given an account of the working of the European Monetary System since the exchange rate mechanism came into operation last March.  The conclusion was that the initial stocktaking could be regarded as positive.  The major political significance of the system and of an area of monetary stability in Europe was stressed.</P>
    <P>The European Council noted the report submitted to them by the Economic and Finance Ministers Council on the convergence of member states' economic performance.  Deputies will recall that this report was asked for at the Paris Council, which discussed the subject in the context of the EMS debates.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Commission were asked to study the working of the budgetary system.  This study will be submitted to the Council which might adopt guidelines so that the Commission could put forward proposals for decisions to be taken by the next meeting of the European Council which is to take place in Dublin on 29-30 November.</P>
    <P>In the Government's Programme for National Development, 1978-1981, we set ourselves the targets of reducing the numbers out of work by 25,000 and attaining a growth rate of 6½ per cent in 1979.  Industrial disputes, the severity of the winter with its effect on food prices, the world energy problems now make it virtually certain that these targets cannot be attained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> This conclusion was supported by the papers and discussions of the Strasbourg Council.  Indeed, never have I attended a council at which there was such unanimity and such conviction as to the prospects before us.  The growth rate of the Community as a whole is expected to fall from 3.4 per cent in 1979 to 2.8 per cent in 1980.  For us the Commission projection is that instead of the 6½ per cent I have mentioned, we will attain 3.8 per cent in 1979 and 3.5 per cent in 1980.  We do not necessarily accept these projections but they are an indication of the direction and the magnitude of the change which has occurred in our economic circumstances.  The essential point is that we will be unable to attain the targets I have mentioned; they or any other reasonable estimate of our prospects now show that we will be, emphatically, far below the figures on which current expectations of increases in living standards are based.</P>
    <P>A strong word of warning was sounded at the meeting as to the dangers, indeed the impossibility, of trying to counteract the effect of what is happening by purely budgetary changes. There was strong emphasis on the need for intellectual honesty; for acceptance of the fact that, for example, there can be no compensation for the adverse effect of the rise in the price of oil.  Real growth will be lower, increases in living standards will be less; and to believe that budgetary actions can counteract these changes or that increases in wages or other incomes unrelated to our changed circumstances will attain the same effect is to indulge in dangerous illusions.</P>
    <P>In the medium term, the meeting was told that part of the problem is due to demographic change.  In Europe between 1980 and 1990 the population of working age will increase by 9 per cent&mdash; about a million people a year&mdash;up to 1985.  Thereafter it will decline, yielding a stabilisation of population of working age by about 1995.  Europe will thus be faced with a large increase in the number of people seeking work at a time when economic growth is unlikely to be high, when technological change will be affecting jobs and when higher payments for energy will be draining resources <Col N="972" /> away from the Community, on a considerable scale.</P>
    <P>For Ireland, the forecasts are that the increase in the total population will be at a rate about five times that for Europe as a whole, while the percentage increase in the population of working age will be just under half as much again as the corresponding figures for the Community as a whole.  The increase will continue for long after the figures have started to decline in continental Europe.  I mention these statistics in some detail to show one of the reasons for the Government attaching such priority to the creation of employment.  We will have a far greater increase proportionately in our working population than other countries and because of events like oil price increases we may well attain an increase in economic growth in the immediate future less than we have aimed for.  Of whatever increase is attained, 1 per cent to 2 per cent must go abroad to pay the increased cost of our energy imports: and a further 1 per cent to 2 per cent must go to increase employment.  The consequence of failure in any of these areas would be grave.</P>
    <P>It will be virtually impossible to use resources to increase living standards this year.  Attempts to do so will certainly ensure that there will be less employment and that inflation will be higher. The change in the pattern of world supply and demand for energy has changed the economic background fundamentally. Lest it be thought that our present difficulties are a temporary phenomenon which will pass away in a year or so I want to give some further projections which were before the Council in Strasbourg.  During the period to 1990, unless there is a far-reaching change in American policy, world demand for oil would be increasing at a rate so high that it could be covered fully only if the OPEC countries were to double their present production.  I need hardly point to the improbability of this or to the dangers even if it were possible.  Oil is a finite resource; and we must start to plan now specifically on that basis.  The world as a whole consumes about 53 million barrels of oil daily.  The United States, with about 5 per cent of the world's population, accounts for about 45 per cent <Col N="973" /> of this.  The European Community consumes approximately 20 million barrels daily, of which the Irish share is about 100,000 barrels a day.</P>
    <P>With the upset caused by recent events in Iran, demand for petroleum has outstripped supply by an estimated 5 per cent.  This has caused a rapid escalation of prices, which have risen on the spot market by more than 80 per cent since the end of last year.  The price of contract oil has risen far less steeply but is being pulled up by what is happening on the spot market.</P>
    <P>The first problem faced by the European Council was what to do in the short term to meet this situation.  Obviously, the first necessity is to try to moderate prices on the spot market.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy at the Energy Council meeting in May was among the first to call for measures with this objective in mind. The European Council noted and welcomed the measures adopted by the Energy Council to improve market surveillance and asked the council to take whatever additional steps might be necessary.  As to the recording of international transactions, it asked the Energy Council to take the steps for which they have laid down the principles, provided that the other industralised countries are prepared to take similar action.  This will be a major issue at the Tokyo Summit.</P>
    <P>Employment cannot be sustained unless there is economic growth.  Economic growth in turn is dependent on energy supplies.  In fact, in many countries, including our own, every 1 per cent by which the economy grows calls for an increase in energy consumption in excess of 1 per cent.  An essential point made by the Council was that this link between economic growth and energy consumption must be broken.</P>
    <P>I stressed the very high dependence of Ireland on imported energy.  We buy from abroad more than 80 per cent of what we need and oil meets more than 75 per cent of our needs.  Just seven years ago, in 1972, we spent £53 million or 2.8 per cent of G.N.P. in buying oil. In 1978 this had gone up to well over £300 million, or 5.3 per cent of G.N.P. I need hardly tell you that the bill for this <Col N="974" /> year will be considerably higher.  This is money which is going abroad and there is no way we can compensate ourselves for the loss.</P>
    <P>Our vulnerability to shortages or interruptions in energy supplies is accentuated by the very high rates of economic growth we have been attaining and are aiming for.  At the Strasbourg Council I stressed that a 5 per cent reduction in oil consumption for a country as heavily dependent as ours on oil supplies, which is growing so rapidly, could impose an altogether disproportionate burden.  The Council accepted this point and agreed that in applying energy constraints generally, regard should be had to the situation of individual states.</P>
    <P>There will be an effort to co-ordinate approaches with the producer countries to what is in fact a world crisis in energy. The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, acting for the Presidency, will be involved in these discussions. These short-term measures to bring supply and demand into balance and to co-operate with the producer countries will meet only part of the case.  They must be supported by measures whose effect will be felt in the medium and longer term. These measures include&mdash;(1) an effective conservation policy; and (2) the development of alternative sources of energy, including, in particular, coal and nuclear power.  I have stressed the need for the most stringent safety precautions and for the development of methods of disposal of nuclear waste; but there is little point in deluding ourselves into believing that countries which are themselves looking to nuclear energy to supply one-fifth or one quarter of their total needs will look with sympathy on the case of a country like ours if we deliberately, or by omission, continue to leave ourselves vulnerable to the vagaries of supply in the market for commodities of limited and declining availability.  Other alternative sources, such as solar or geothermal energy, are unlikely to produce energy on economic terms for another ten or 20 years.  Under this heading I stressed the importance of exploration, particularly in the Irish context; but again it is important to remember that even another find on the <Col N="975" /> scale of the North Sea would not change the medium term prospects.</P>
    <P>The stark reality in all this is that before the end of the century millions of people could suffer severe hardship unless energy resources are fully developed and utilised; and that unless we here face this reality and adjust our expectations to what is possible of realisation we will be creating for ourselves and our children a most disagreeable future.</P>
    <P>The Community, the United States and Japan are the three main pillars of trade and industry in the free world.  A difficulty, indeed a source of friction, between them has been the growth of the deficit which the Community continues to incur in its trade with Japan.  At $6.4 billion in 1978 it represents a major drain on Community resources.  I would like to stress the approach favoured by the Strasbourg Council, because it has particular relevance to Ireland.  There was general agreement that the solution did not lie in any attempt to convince the Japanese that they should reduce the efficiency or competitiveness of their research and industry&mdash;that indeed would be an easy way out for countries seeking the illusion of progress through higher payments for static output.  The success of Japan has been founded on hard work, frugality, discipline and corporate loyalties.  The general approach of the Strasbourg Council was to emphasise the need to strengthen co-operation with Japan in all fields, including trade, research and investment. There will be consultations between the Commission and Japan to this end.</P>
    <P>Among the items discussed under the heading of European Political Co-operation were the Middle East, the Rhodesian situation and the problems of refugees from Vietnam, in particular the necessity of finding a solution which is both efficacious and humane.</P>
    <P>This is the last European Council before Ireland takes over the Presidency on 1 July.  I took the opportunity of thanking President Giscard d'Estaing for his hospitality and expressing appreciation of the way in which France had discharged the duties of the Presidency.  I said that I hoped that Ireland would prove to be a worthy successor to <Col N="976" /> France in this high office and expressed a welcome for the Council when it meets in Dublin next November.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs will be reporting shortly to the European Assembly on the programme for the Irish Presidency.  I need only mention here that, apart from the follow-up to the Strasbourg Council on issues like energy and convergency and some questions relating to agriculture, important issues likely to arise during that time include the six-monthly review of the European Monetary System, the adoption of the 1980 Budget, the report of the Three Wise Men, maintaining the momentum of negotiations for the enlargement of the Community, making progress towards agreement on a Common Fisheries Policy, conclusion of the negotiations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, perhaps this month, and signature of Lomé II.  In all this it will be important to work for the avoidance of protectionism, improved access to existing markets, fair competition and safeguards for sensitive industries in trade negotiations.  The Community will endeavour to prevent a new inflationary process from developing and to maintain the Community's economic growth at the highest possible level.  It will obviously be our aim to do everything possible to improve the employment situation in the Community.</P>
    <P>Criticisms are possible of the concept and working of European Councils.  I do not necessarily subscribe to these, preferring to look on the positive side. Councils afford Heads of State or of Government an opportunity to come together and exchange views on the problems facing them individually and collectively.  Even if Councils attained nothing more than this, they would be of considerable benefit.  On this occasion, in particular, I found the degree of consensus, indeed of utter conviction, on the seriousness of the problems now facing Europe both impressive and intimidating, particularly in relation to energy.  I will quote one paragraph from the Presidency conclusions which conveys this sense of urgency and conviction. It says that if a strategy for the rational use of oil and the development <Col N="977" /> of new energy sources cannot be worked out, then &ldquo;the world will rapidly move towards large scale economic and social crisis&rdquo;.  That is a message we cannot ignore, either in our approach to general economic problems or to energy policies. The consequences of taking the soft option, of trying to avoid trouble, or to buy temporary popularity, are too grave.  We will not survive if we ignore these warnings, which are more serious and more persistent than I can ever recall, or if we seek solutions based more on ignorance or the desire to please than on an appreciation of the realities.  These are the facts now.  I am no prophet of doom; I would prefer to be regarded as a realist&mdash;we must all recognise that our future will be governed by the realities so forcefully expressed in the conclusions of the European Council.</P>

      <P>It is not easy to reply in these circumstances.  Frequently on these occasions, what happens the European Council does not affect the State directly and it is generally fairly well reported in the press.  On this occasion what has happened could have the most profound effect on this country and, perhaps because the European Council occurred immediately before the weekend, the press reports were remarkably inadequate in our papers, with due respect to them, and also as far as I can make out, in the British papers&mdash;I cannot speak for other countries as, for various reasons, their papers are not available.  The result is that I have not been clear until I saw the communique&mdash;and am now perhaps, in some ways, even less clear, having seen the Taoiseach's speech&mdash;on precisely what was decided and its possible impact on us.  It may be that because this speech only reached us in the last three-quarters of an hour&mdash;it only reached the Library at 2.50&mdash;I have missed something and my remarks may in some respects be wide of the mark.  I hope I have in the brief period available extracted the key points and that what I have to say will be relevant and accurate.  If not, the Taoiseach will correct me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, it is my duty to wish the Taoiseach and his Government good luck with the Presidency.  I am more <Col N="978" /> conscious than most of the onerous burden involved and the need for very careful preparation and the possibility that, even with the most careful preparation, if you do not have good luck during it, things may not turn out as you would wish.  In our case, we prepared carefully for the Presidency but we would not have had such success had we not had luck on our side as well.  So when I say good luck to the Taoiseach, I mean it because he will need it to ensure that he achieves the kind of success that is beneficial to this country.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Taoiseach is going personally to the Parliament on its first meeting in three weeks' time, to mark the importance of the inauguration of the directly elected Parliament.  I have some regret that he is going to represent this country with the message that Parliament should not have any additional powers <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Council of Ministers.  As he knows, though not all his spokesmen during the European campaign seem to have been willing to admit this, we have never proposed that powers be transferred from this Dáil or Seanad at any stage to the European Parliament.  We were concerned that it should have adequate control of the Council of Ministers and that, I think not merely on democratic and general grounds, but on grounds of the good of this country.  The Taoiseach would be in a stronger position facing the Parliament if he were to go there as an advocate of the Parliament fulfilling its role as a legislature more fully than somebody who had joined with other fairly nationalistic and narrow minded people to oppose that.</P>
    <P>There is one other issue on which he is on difficult ground in the Parliament, although perhaps at this rather formal inaugural session it may not be out of courtesy raised with him, that is, the Government's agreement with the European Council with the very narrow British view, which others then adopted, on the basis that the British and the Irish want to hang themselves, why stop them, that the salaries of the European Parliament should be determined and paid nationally at national levels.  I know how strongly this view was held by the <Col N="979" /> previous British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary.  While I do not feel that it would have been beneficial, for a variety of reasons, for German-level salaries to be paid to representatives from Ireland I certainly equally do not feel that the present Dáil salary level is the appropriate one for a member of the European Parliament, who will have to spend a large amount of his time in that Parliament with people paid very much higher rates.  I believe the European Council acted improperly in purporting to exercise power in this area, which is properly one for the parliament within its own budgetary competence.</P>
    <P>The Bill which is before us at present is one which should not be before us.  I have some doubts about its constitutionality because we are interfering in an area which under the Treaty of Rome is a matter of competency of the European Parliament and under our Constitution the Treaty of Rome takes precedence in matters of this kind.  I doubt very much whether we have any right in this House to be debating this legislation, quite apart from the wisdom of ensuring that our representatives will not be second-class or even ninth-class, citizens in the European Parliament.  I hope those matters will not be raised on 18 July but I suspect the Parliament may want to come back to them at a later stage and that the legislation we are now passing may turn out to be irrelevant as well as possibly unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I now want to come to other points raised by the Taoiseach.  He referred very briefly to the fact that the Council considered under the heading of political co-operation, matters relating to various parts of the world, the Vietnam refugees, about whom we are very concerned and which poses an almost insuperable problem because of the scale of the disaster involved and the immense cruelty of the Government in effectively sending into exile such large numbers of people.  I hope the Community can help in this.  I am glad we are helping in a small way.  It is inevitable that it should be in a small way given our own situation.  None of us can be happy in our consciences about this situation.  I hope that anything we can do internationally to ease it we will <Col N="980" /> do.  Perhaps during our Presidency and in the framework of political co-operation it may fall to us to take initiatives in this matter.  I trust that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will give priority to it.</P>
    <P>The other matters of international foreign policy mentioned by the Taoiseach, merely by reference, relate to the Middle East and Rhodesia.  I trust that at the meeting, when political co-operation was under discussion, he or the Minister for Foreign Affairs raised forcibly with our colleagues the situation which exists in the Lebanon where our forces have been under attack frequently by forces armed, assisted and encouraged by Israel and, have on occasion been shelled by shells which according to American experts, unlikely to be biased in their assessment, were fired directly from Israel.  It is intolerable that, when we send our forces on a peace-keeping mission, any country should connive at attacks on them in this way.  I do not think enough has been done to draw the attention of that country and world opinion generally to the impossible situation in which it puts our forces.  I hope the Taoiseach raised that at the meeting.</P>
    <P>On the question of Rhodesia&mdash;I am dealing with those matters first of all which are far from our shores before coming nearer home&mdash;I hope the Taoiseach and his Minister took the opportunity to maintain our position on this matter, that the internal settlement in its present form does not offer a solution and that he impressed on the British Prime Minister that view.  There is a grave danger that the whole of Southern Africa will eventually be brought into a cold war situation with major intervention by the Soviet Union because of weak, inept handling of the situation. The British Government need our support and our encouragement to maintain the position of its precedessor and not to walk into the trap set of supporting a settlement which could lead to indefinite escalation of the war at great human cost and at great danger to the balance of power in the world as a whole.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach and his Minister will continue to express what has been our view on this over the last three years <Col N="981" /> since this issue came up and that the Minister will encourage the British Foreign Secretary to maintain his predecessor's position and to persuade his Prime Minister of the opportuneness of that policy.</P>
    <P>I have, having referred briefly to those matters, to come to matters which more directly affect us.  I will take them roughly in the order in which the Taoiseach dealt with them.  The Taoiseach, having referred briefly to the question of the EMS and convergence, and the Commission being asked to study the working of the budgetary system, went on to deal with energy and the economic and social situation.  I note that, for the first time in two years, so far as I can recall, in a Government statement there was an admission that the target they set themselves was not to provide so many thousand new jobs but to reduce the number out of work by 25,000 a year.  For two years the Government have tried to wriggle out of that commitment in the manifesto by expressing it in terms of new jobs rather than a reduction of the numbers out of work.  The Taoiseach has at least the honesty to come back to the original commitment, just at the moment when he is abandoning it.</P>
    <P>The grounds he gives for failure to achieve this are ones which I do not think we can accept.  He gives three reasons why it is virtually certain that the targets set of 6½ per cent growth rate and a reduction of the numbers out of work by 25,000 per annum cannot be attained. The first is the question of industrial disputes.  Leaving aside the question of responsibility for those disputes, they are of their nature short term in character, although I accept that the failure to deal with the Post Office strike at the beginning and to achieve earlier on the settlement eventually achieved at the end, may have lasting effects not merely on tourism for the current year but on industrial investment here.  Great damage has been done by the handling of that strike.  Even allowing for that, I do not think the other industrial disputes are all that relevant to growth rates. Even the failure to remove rubbish from our streets, serious though it may be and objectionable, is not something which affects <Col N="982" /> our growth rate.  Leaving aside the Post Office strike, which is the one thing which could have some significant effect, the other matters raised by the Taoiseach, the severity of the winter with its effect on food prices and world energy problems, are not really relevant to the current year.  The energy crisis is likely to affect our growth in the future but as an excuse for failing to achieve targets set several years ago in the current year it simply does not stand up.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the energy shortage which will have a perceptible effect on economic growth in the current year. I believe the Taoiseach knows that.  The effect of the winter on food prices is marginal.  It certainly has some effect on inflation.  I would like the Taoiseach to compare the effect that had with the effect the Government have had by removing subsidies and increasing taxes. I do not believe that the severe winter did a quarter of the harm the Government did.  I do not think the reference to the winter is particularly convincing. The fact is that our economy was on the downturn before the winter started, as the Central Bank reports have shown.  It has nothing to do with the food prices and the winter and certainly not with the energy crisis whose effect lies in the future so far as economic growth is concerned, nor has it much to do with industrial disputes.  The fact is that the Government's management of the economy is such as to lead to a revival of inflation, to encourage and sharpen that inflationary movement and to leave us in the worst possible posture to face the economic crisis arising from the energy difficulties.</P>
    <P>When we were in office we faced an energy crisis, which was far more severe than this, because what was involved then was a quintupling of oil prices within two months and now we are talking about increases in oil prices which have been spoken of as of the order of between 20 and 30 per cent. One report&mdash;I trust it is not a very convincing one&mdash;talks about the possibility of 40 per cent.  These are miniscule increases by comparison with the increases we suffered in a two-month period.  Yet although this came at the beginning of our period in government <Col N="983" /> and affected the whole economic situation throughout our period in government, whenever we raised this point and referred to the impact it had on our economic situation the then Opposition brushed it to one side.  They said, &ldquo;Excuses, excuses&rdquo;; they told us it was the responsibility of the Government and said we should not be using what was happening outside as an excuse for not controlling the economy.  The fact is we faced a major crisis at that time, beside which what is happening now is minor in terms of the impact on prices.  The Taoiseach knows that.  The figures are there for all to see.  To start using it as an excuse for failures on the economic front before it has had any significant economic effect is a bit too obvious as an alibi for the failure that has been evident during the past year as the rate of our economic growth has declined.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that the Commission's projections for this country were for a growth rate of 3.8 per cent for this year and 3.5 per cent for 1980.  It is not clear to me to what extent the Taoiseach accepts this.  He said he does not necessarily accept the projections but they are an indication of the direction and the magnitude of the change that has occurred in our economic circumstances.  I note that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development has not been prepared to admit anything more than the possibility of a 5 per cent growth rate instead of 6½ per cent and the Taoiseach has recently echoed that figure of 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government faced the reality of the effects of their policies on giving us a short, sharp burst of growth creating inflationary pressures which have doubled the rate of inflation within 12 months and which have left us in a naked situation to face the real crisis that lies ahead.  The Government should face the fact that the result of their policies has been to halve our growth rate or reduce it by 40 per cent in comparison with the level at which it was when we left office and to go on talking about 5 per cent when the Taoiseach knows perfectly well that 5 per cent is unattainable is unhelpful.  The Government need to revise drastically their <Col N="984" /> economic strategy at this stage.  A constant dragging of feet and a refusal to face up to the situation&mdash;what we might call constant intellectual dishonesty, to echo the Taoiseach's speech&mdash;is of no help.  The situation is grave because we are facing this crisis from such a weak position.  It would be much better to face it fully.  Only by doing that can the nation be convinced that it is necessary to take drastic measures to deal with it.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Taoiseach promised to deal with the question of the allocation of increased resources in relation to the current year.  He said that whatever increase is attained in our national output 1 per cent to 2 per cent must go abroad to pay the increased cost of energy imports and a further 1 per cent to 2 per cent must go to increase employment. If we put those two figures together we get the whole of the growth we are likely to have this year.  By pretending that growth will be higher, by pretending that this year there is room for an increase in living standards, by attempting to fool the people, the Taoiseach is not helping the cause of achieving a reasonable increase in money incomes.  It would be much better if he came clean and said clearly that the growth rate will not be 5 per cent, that it will be of the order of 3 per cent plus.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told us the percentage figures that must go towards meeting the cost of energy imports and increased employment.  There is no room for an increase in living standards.  That is not a popular thing to say.  I am not saying it simply because I am in this House criticising the Taoiseach for some aspects of policy.  I made that point elsewhere last night.  On the whole an Opposition tend to leave it to the Government to bring bad news but the failure of the Government to face up to bad news imposes on us an obligation to tell the country the truth if the Government are not prepared to tell it.</P>
    <P>There is a certain contradiction in the Taoiseach's speech in saying that between 1 per cent to 2 per cent must go to increase employment&mdash;implying that this is going to happen, that the Government will ensure it&mdash;and going on to say that employment cannot be sustained unless there is economic growth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> Employment can be sustained even if economic growth is reduced if the Government can offer leadership to the people to convince them that that should be a priority over increased living standards. However, the Government are not offering that leadership.  They have not told the whole truth and it will probably be some months yet before they get round to admitting the reality of the situation we are facing.  This is unfortunate. I regret the Government have not taken this opportunity to be frank about the matter.  The opportunity is there and the seeking of alibis, as was done in the Taoiseach's speech, and the failure to face the reality of the situation is a serious defect.  It is not a good augury for the long Summer Recess if that is the way the Government are going to approach this opportunity to get down to tackling the serious problem of achieving increased employment.</P>
    <P>In the communiqué there was a brief reference to work-sharing.  I should like to hear more about this.  The brevity of the reference suggests more a &ldquo;touching of the cap&rdquo; to this concept than an actual commitment.  As things stand at present and with the technological changes taking place to which the Taoiseach referred, the prospect of achieving increased employment in the years ahead with our present structures&mdash;our hours of work, our present system of overtime&mdash;is limited.  We have to face realities which hitherto we have dodged. You do not face realities by saying that if the employment targets are not met you will invent another X thousand jobs in the public service to add to the deadweight burden of the cost of public administration which is significantly higher here than the average in industralised countries.  This is despite the fact that among the industrialised countries we are at the bottom of the league in terms of output <i>per capita</i>; we are at about the same level as Greece.</P>
    <P>I am not clear on what the Taoiseach said about energy.  There is a disturbing ambiguity here which I hope he will take an opportunity to clarify.  I recognise, as I have done before, that these debates are thoroughly unsatisfactory in that the Taoiseach has no right of reply.  I still urge on him to accept the offer of a right <Col N="986" /> of reply to make the statements of the three leaders meaningful.</P>
    <P>With regard to the availability of oil supplies, there is considerable confusion. In the communiqué it is stated that the Council expressed their resolve, among other things, to maintain Community imports between 1980 and 1985 at an annual level not higher than that for 1978.  There is a reference to taking account of the economic situation of each country.  In his speech the Taoiseach mentioned this and implied that there was some commitment to take account of our special situation.  I should like to hear more about that.  If the Community as a whole are to maintain imports at the 1978 level, how can they make provision for different growth rates, different capacities to grow, because we have a greater capacity to grow than have other member countries, and different needs to grow because of different employment projections?</P>
    <P>In his speech the Taoiseach referred to the demographic issue.  I am very glad he has come to terms with this and is now raising this matter, as I have been doing for a long time.  In this connection this country faces particular problems which are on a larger scale demographically than any country of the Nine and which are likely to last for at least 15 years longer than in other countries of the Nine.  If these problems are there, what provision can be made to ensure that out of this constant flow of oil to the Community as a whole we get a share that will enable us to achieve the kind of growth which we need to provide employment and which other countries do not need because they do not have the same scale of employment problems, as the Taoiseach said in his speech? What discussions took place on that matter?  What assurance has the Taoiseach that we will secure a differential allocation of imports of oil to allow for our growth?  The mere reference to taking account of the economic situation in each country is insufficient unless it is quantified in some way or unless some mechanism is set up to quantify it.  I ask the Taoiseach, perhaps in the Adjournment Debate, to clarify this matter which is of crucial importance.  If we were to be held to an absolutely constant <Col N="987" /> level of imports of oil at the same rate as other countries of the Nine, there is no way in which our much greater employment problems could be resolved no matter how we sought to share work or took other drastic measures of this kind. We are entitled to hear what the Taoiseach put to the European Council and what specifically they have agreed. Will there be proposals by the Commission as to the allocation of this constant volume of oil?  What criteria will be applied to determining these allocations to member countries?  These are matters of vital concern of which we need to hear more.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect of the Taoiseach's speech and of his statement to the papers immediately after the European Council meeting which worries me.  I refer to the nuclear issue.  I do not believe any party can at this stage exclude the possibility of our acquiring, at some point, in order to maintain our economy and provide employment, a nuclear reactor. I hope and pray this will never be necessary, but I do not think we can exclude that possibility.  I am concerned that we should not rush into this in any panic.  We should be prepared to draw up plans, as the previous Government did, in case it becomes necessary.  It is important that there should be a full and independent inquiry&mdash;and it should be seen to be independent&mdash;into the question of how nuclear energy might be provided here.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach unfortunately in his statement after the European Council meeting has prejudged this inquiry, as is evident from the newspaper reports.  <i>The Irish Times</i> says:</P>
    <P>The support of the Taoiseach for the nuclear option now virtually reduces the promised public inquiry on the siting of a first nuclear power station at Carnsore Point, Co. Wexford, to the virtual status of a committee which may be able to add some conditions about security and safeguards.</P>
    <P>In his statement to the press he spoke about the possibility of looking at things like nuclear waste disposal, although he hastily added that was looked after <Col N="988" /> anyway at present.  It is not clear what role he sees for this inquiry.  How it is to be independent after the type of statements made, I am not at all clear.</P>
    <P>Why did the Taoiseach rush in to make such a dramatic statement on this subject, even talking about the possibility of a second nuclear reactor, after that meeting?  He appears to have been overly impressed by the heads of the three major countries which pushed this issue.  Having had some experience of dealing with these countries, I know they have a very strong commitment in the nuclear area because they have nuclear industries which export.  I also know that they have been less than scrupulous in their export policies.  Some of them have been willing to export nuclear reactors of a type which make possible the building of nuclear weapons, without adequate safeguards, and have persisted in this because of the benefit to their own economies.  I know how tough they can be as salesmen and the kind of pressure they can put on.  I heard the leaders of some of these countries expressing themselves in very strong terms and with the utmost contempt for anybody who is concerned with the possible dangers of nuclear energy, sweeping them to one side, because of the importance to their economy of selling nuclear reactors.</P>
    <P>Given that that is the situation the Taoiseach finds himself in, I should have expected him to have taken a more cautious view, as it was suggested his Netherlands colleague did.  The <i>Financial Times</i> reports on this question:</P>
    <P>... the key alliance was between Britain, France and Germany, with some opposition from the Dutch.</P>
    <P>But not from the Irish.  On the contrary the Taoiseach came out full of enthusiasm for more reactors.  He appears to have been brainwashed by the countries which have a direct interest in selling them, in panicking us into buying them as soon as possible.  In my view that was a weak and wrong reaction.  We should have maintained the same kind of position as the Netherlands&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy goes too far.  I hope he will refer to speeches I made before I ever went to Strasbourg.  I <Col N="989" /> did not come home brainwashed nor was I looking for the soft options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The enthusiasm of the Taoiseach and his Ministers in using the arguments put to them does not say much for their concern for taking the right decision at the right time here.  The Netherlands have taken a different view. They have plans for three new reactors but they are going very slowly in implementing these plans.  They believe there should be guarantees on security and waste disposal before they proceed and on non-proliferation, which is now a serious issue.  It is not something which arises simply if one exports a reactor to Pakistan or Brazil.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach will be aware, a Pakistani employee in the Netherlands disappeared to Pakistan with a number of secrets derived from their research and which will possibly assist that country in building nuclear weapons. For that reason and because of concern about security which must be in all our minds after what happened at Harrisburg and because of the problems of waste disposal, the Netherlands Government are not rushing in to build more reactors at this stage but are taking a cautious view, as is reported in the <i>Financial Times.</i></P>
      <P>I would have thought it would be more consonant with the position taken up by the Taoiseach and his Government in setting up an independent inquiry for him to take the same cautious view, not to exclude the possibility that at some point we may have to build nuclear reactors, but not to rush into it with such enthusiasm, and not to accept the biased advice given to him&mdash;the word &ldquo;advice&rdquo; was used by him&mdash;by countries which have a very strong interest in selling these products, at least one of which is in grave difficulties at present because of the contract falling through with Iran in respect of the sale of reactors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Taoiseach says, but I wonder if he has misrepresented himself in this respect because his reference to advice did not suggest it was from one country.  In <i>The Irish Press</i> 23 June 1979 he is reported as saying:</P>
      <P>The Germans and French had formally set their programmes.  &ldquo;Ireland has no nuclear facility at all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but we were advised very strongly to proceed at the quickest possible pace. In so far as comment was made, it was that we needed to move faster towards nuclear development.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The implication of that to most people was that this was rather general advice, not that one disinterested country was taking the Taoiseach to one side and saying: &ldquo;We are not in the business ourselves but you ought to be thinking about it&rdquo;.  That was the impression the Irish people derived from the Taoiseach's statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the reference to that and remarked on the development of nuclear energy and the need to guarantee the safety of the population. The Taoiseach seems to be dismissing this rather lightly in rushing into the idea of a second nuclear reactor before there is an inquiry into having any nuclear reactor.</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach read the transcript of the telephone calls made by the agent of the Nuclear Energy Agency in the power station at Harrisburg to his headquarters and the governor's office, which were printed in the American press but not here, unfortunately.  It ran into more than five pages.  Anyone who read that transcript could not but be horrified at the mixture of ignorance of what was happening, incompetence, fear to tell the truth, and a cover up of what was happening at the time.  If that can happen in a country like the United States, we would want to think very carefully about what safeguards would be needed if we were to have a nuclear reactor.</P>
      <P>I urge the Taoiseach to have those transcripts placed in the Library of this House so that Deputies can read what actually happened in a country where something went wrong, where the situation was handled by fallible human beings, not knowing what to do, frightened to tell the truth and, as a result, leaving lives at considerable danger for a certain period.  It was good luck rather than good judgment which led to the result where no lives were immediately lost, although some people will die in due course as a result of what happened there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> Having said that, we come back to the fact that we may have to face this issue, but in my view we should face it in our own time, make our own judgment on it, not be advised or pressurised by anybody outside, and not use an occasion like this to panic our people into a decision which does not need to be taken yet.  Has the Taoiseach consulted recently the European Commission and asked their views on this?  I would ask the Taoiseach has he consulted recently with the European Commission as to their views on this.  It is my understanding that the Commission, certainly some time ago, expressed the view that we should not rush into getting a nuclear reactor, that we are too small a country for it to be necessary and that we should take our time about it.  I do not know if that is still their view but that view was expressed by them not so very long ago. They, perhaps, are in a more impartial position than some other people who might be expressing their views and whom I have heard expressing their views very strongly because of their own particular interests.</P>

      <P>It is hard for the Taoiseach but the answer lies in his own hands.

      <P>The Taoiseach would have been wise to say in his speech that he was quoted inaccurately or misrepresented because certainly &ldquo;Lynch hints at second N. station&rdquo; was the headline in <i>The Irish Press</i> and when one reads down&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach does seem to have difficulty in conveying to the press accurately what happens at these meetings, as we have seen before. Certainly nobody since last Saturday could have known that that was the case; nobody having heard the Taoiseach's speech could have known that was the case.  The Taoiseach had been misrepresented in the press.  He had every opportunity to put it right but did not do so and I am glad that my raising it has at last given him the opportunity to tell us what he did say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event this whole nuclear question is something which we should examine much more carefully and calmly. We should not be influenced by pressures of this kind.  We should take our time about a decision in a matter of such vital importance while planning well ahead in case it is necessary to take it. These are some of the points that I would like to make arising out of the Taoiseach's statement.  When the Taoiseach says that there is little point in <Col N="994" /> deluding ourselves into believing that countries which are themselves looking to nuclear energy to supply one fifth or one quarter of their total needs would look with sympathy on the case of a country like ours is we deliberately by omission continue to leave ourselves vulnerable to the vagaries of supply on the market for commodities of limited and declining availability, there is the hint of the threat from the big boys that we have to have regard to.  If the Netherlands do not feel that they have to jump to the whip being cracked then I do not think we should either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I know they have declining supplies of natural gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>But their supplies are relatively very much more substantial than ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Netherlands have supplies of natural gas which, by the time we would have a nuclear reactor in operation were we to start now would be phasing out, so it is not a very relevant argument to use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point I want to raise and that is on the question of the enlargement of the Community.  We will have the task of furthering negotiations towards the enlargement of the Community and also the task of preparing the budget for 1980.  I would urge on the Taoiseach that during our Presidency, while we should not of course pursue in any aggressive way particular national interests of our own during our Presidency, there is one matter which the Taoiseach and his Ministers can legitimately press and that is the argument entered into three or four years ago when the protocol was agreed in Brussels that with the enlargement of the Community the resources of the Community be enlarged <i>pro rata</i>.  It is important that that agreement be implemented and that in any negotiations for the further enlargement of the Community it would be wise for the Taoiseach to make it a precondition for those negotiations <Col N="995" /> that action be taken in respect of the increased resources required in relation to Greece so that we do not find ourselves in the position where we are trying to meet the needs of ten countries out of the resources for nine and then 11 and then 12&mdash;and I believe the agreement I achieved on that should safeguard us if we press to have it implemented.  We have the opportunity in relation to further negotiations to insist on the implementation in practice of what is agreed in principle and I would urge the Taoiseach to do that as and when the opportunity arises during our Presidency.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I repeat that I wish him and his Ministers every good luck during his period of Presidency and he will be assured of any support that the Opposition can give in the carrying out of this task and assured that our representatives in Parliament will do nothing to embarrass him during that period.</P>

      <P>Before formally responding to the Taoiseach's speech I would like to comment on the procedures.  I did not find the exchange at Question Time very beneficial.  What was being sought was I believe in the interests of parliamentary democracy and the Taoiseach's ungracious response to the request that a copy of the communiqué, or the understanding as he chose to call it, would be made available to the Opposition parties some considerable time in advance of the statement being made is not in the interests of parliamentary democracy.  It may, in the Taoiseach's view, be a question of gaining some slight party political advantage in so far as one cannot be adequately prepared to respond to a communiqué which one has not seen.  It is a very heavy price that the country is being asked to pay for whatever party political advantage may be involved for the Taoiseach to justify this by saying that this is the way he was treated when he was in Opposition and then to further say that he regarded the treatment he got as discourteous.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, on behalf of his party, wished the Taoiseach and the Government every success in taking over the Presidency of the Council in the coming month.  I also, on behalf of my party, wish to offer the Taoiseach and the Government every success for the duration of their Presidency.  He has a very high standard to maintain because it was universally accepted that when we had the Presidency on the last occasion it was held with distinction; it brought credit and prestige and enhanced the standing of this country within the Community <Col N="997" /> and we would be extremely anxious in this party that the interests of the country would be paramount.  We will afford the Government every assistance in helping them to achieve that desirable national end.  I asked the Taoiseach some weeks ago for a list of the business which he hoped to conclude before the Recess because I was anxious to try to establish whether it would be possible for us, even against what would normally be our desire as an Opposition, to facilitate the Government by adjourning this week in order to allow them the maximum time and opportunity to engage in the desirable and necessary preparation for the taking over of the Presidency.  We regard that as extremely important in Ireland's interest and we would have been prepared to forego whatever contribution we may have been anxious to make on pending legislation in order to give the Government that opportunity.  Unfortunately, the response of the Taoiseach to my request and to my supplementary questions was less than generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, the Taoiseach's response was somewhat petulant and totally out of character with the cultivated public image of the Taoiseach.  I suggest it might be more beneficial for all concerned, not least the country as a whole, if the Taoiseach was less petulant on occasions when we are trying to be constructive in our approach.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald mentioned the Irish forces serving in the Lebanon and the fact that fire had been directed over positions they held.  Naturally, this is a matter of concern to us all.  I will have an opportunity of visiting Israel next week in connection with another matter and I have requested a briefing from the Department of Foreign Affairs about the Government's position and representations the Government may have made in relation to this matter.  I did so in the hope that I may be able to assist those representations in any meetings I may have, formal or informal, with people of influence I may meet while in that country.  I have also sought permission from the Department of Foreign Affairs, in conjunction with the Department of Defence, to visit the Irish troops engaged in peace-keeping operations in the <Col N="998" /> Lebanon.  I hope the Government will extend that facility to me.</P>
    <P>With regard to the communiqué which the Taoiseach gave us an opportunity of viewing at 2.50 p.m. today and with regard to the Taoiseach's speech I shall confine myself to two issues, the main one being the question of energy and our position with regard to that topic.  We must all be deeply concerned at the potentially disastrous effects for the world economy of the rapidly worsening energy crisis.  The present crisis comes at a time when most economies had just recovered from the recession of the mid-1970s and, unless the matter is handled with extreme care and creativity by both producer and consumer countries alike, the economic consequences for all economies will be more serious than most of our young population have ever experienced.</P>
    <P>Even before the latest increases in oil prices there were clear signs of impending economic difficulties in most countries.  Inflation in the OECD countries this year will be higher than in 1978 by at least 1 per cent, leaving oil price increases out of account.  Similarly, growth rates in the OECD countries were already showing a marked down-turn before the oil price effect is taken into account.  In this connection, it is very worrying indeed for world prospects that the United States seems hardest hit with the consequent adverse effects on world trade which we are all aware of.</P>
    <P>In the European Community, growth rate forecasts have also been revised sharply downwards.  The European Commission is now predicting a growth rate of only 2.8 per cent for the Community as a whole in 1980.  At the same time, the Commission states that Europe: &ldquo;faces a decade of austerity&rdquo;. Indeed, present trends in Europe point to continuing high unemployment and falling living standards in the 1980s.  In addition, unless major changes are made to existing energy policy, balance of payments crises and rapidly rising inflation will be the order of the day in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Against this stark background, it is legitimate that I should point once again to the extraordinary sluggishness with <Col N="999" /> which the European Council has responded to the energy problem.  It was a specific point on the agenda at the last Council meeting but, as I said at the time, the Council took no positive initiatives to deal with what was, even then, clearly going to amount to a problem of major proportions.</P>
    <P>As a result six months have been wasted, during which common policies should have been pursued.  I repeat now what I said then.  The oil problem cannot be dealt with by individual countries acting alone for two basic reasons.  First, the pursuit of different policies by different countries will lead to different standards of economic performance which will not be politically sustainable for long.  Secondly, no individual country, no matter how economically strong it may be, can expect on its own to achieve a reasonable solution against multinational oil companies and the OPEC producer group.</P>
    <P>These facts are well known and accepted. Yet we had to wait until last week's Summit in Strasbourg before expression was given to them in the form of an attempt to achieve a common approach by the Community as a whole. That is not good enough by any standards and is to be deeply regretted, not least by the smaller countries such as Ireland.</P>
    <P>I note also that even the limited gains made at the Council in terms of securing a common European Community approach are conditional on securing agreement from the other major oil consumers at this week's Tokyo Summit. The signs are that the United States and Japan are unlikely to accept the exact formula worked out last week in Strasbourg.  Should this turn out to be the case, I earnestly hope that we, as one of the smaller countries of the European Community, will not find ourselves faced with an alternative agreement worked out by the major economies outside the framework of the European Community.  I have made the point before that I disapprove of the present system whereby the Community determines a common policy, only to have it altered or jettisoned at these Summits of the major powers where the Community <Col N="1000" /> as a whole is not represented on an equal footing.</P>
    <P>I would make this point also.  The depth and prolonged nature of the mid-1970s recession was due in no small measure to the inability of political leaders to act quickly and decisively, both in relation to domestic economic management and in relation to the oil producing countries.  Should this experience be repeated on this occasion, coming at is would on top of already serious economic problems in all our countries, not only the economic consequences will be serious but so too will the threat to world peace.</P>
    <P>The most substantial outcome of last week's Summit in Strasbourg was the agreement to freeze oil imports at the 1978 level during the years 1980-85. This would not be acceptable to us in this party if it means that each member country is expected individually to stick to its 1978 import level.  Given that oil plays such a crucial role in economic development, the effect of a decision in that form would be to, at best, freeze the present income gap between Ireland and the economically more powerful member countries.  Such an approach would fly in the face of existing policy, which is to narrow the gap in living standards between the poorer and richer areas of the Community.  Rather, what is needed is a policy which discriminates clearly in favour of the poorer regions in so far as oil imports are concerned.  It is to be hoped that the Taoiseach made that clear in no uncertain terms and will pursue such a policy actively during his period as President of the Council.</P>
    <P>Following the Council meeting, the Taoiseach stated that Ireland had been advised to pursue a nuclear energy programme as a matter of urgency. Subsequently, both he and two of his Ministers gave a very definite indication that it is Government policy to build one or more nuclear plants in Ireland, irrespective of the outcome of the commission of inquiry which is to be set up to examine this subject.</P>
    <P>There are two disquieting features in that approach.  First, it appears that the European Council is intent on going ahead with the European nuclear programme despite widespread opposition  <Col N="1001" /> in the member states, despite the failure to pursue effective energy conservation policies, despite the absence of an alternative energy research programme and despite the continued absence of a solution to the waste disposal problem. Indeed, the Council's advice to us to go nuclear and its willingness to provide finance to us to do so is in marked contrast to its continuing failure to provide funds to this country for oil exploration purposes.</P>
    <P>Secondly, everyone in this country must view with very serious concern the statements by the Taoiseach and his Ministers which seem to pre-empt completely the task which we all believed the independent commission was to be asked to undertake.  Every reasonable person believed that the commission would be asked to explore not only technical details in relation to a nuclear plant, but also its desirability or otherwise in principle.  From the Taoiseach's post-Summit remarks, it seems that the decision in principle has already been taken by the Government and that technical questions only are open to review.  That decision, if it be the case, constitutes yet another betrayal of trust on the part of the Government.  I hope that the Taoiseach will change his mind once again before the terms of reference of the commission are set down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the Protocol for the Fifth Extension of the Food Aid Convention 1971 which has been laid before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Food Aid Convention 1971, which is part of the International Wheat Agreement, was originally established for a period of three years which expired on 30 June 1974.  Under the terms of the Treaty of Accession to the European Communities, Ireland was obliged to accede to the Food Aid Convention because the original member states and the European Economic Community as such were parties to it.  We did so in June 1973.  In June 1974, June 1975, and June 1976, with the approval of Dáil <Col N="1006" /> Éireann, we deposited declarations of provisional application of protocols for extensions of the convention.  In 1976 the extension was for a two-year period. In 1978, again with Dáil approval, we deposited a declaration of provisional application of a protocol for a further extension of the convention until 30 June 1979.  The proposed extension this year is for a two-year period until 30 June 1981.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the establishment of a new International Wheat Agreement and Food Aid Convention have continued under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).  The most recent conference on the subject was held in Geneva from 22 January to 14 February 1979.  As no agreement seemed possible the conference was adjourned and it was decided to extend the existing Wheat Trade Convention and Food Aid Convention for a further two years, until 30 June 1981, to allow for sufficient time for negotiations on a new International Wheat Trade Agreement to take place.</P>
    <P>On 19 March 1979 the Council of Ministers of the European Community decided that the Community and its member states should participate in this two-year extension.  Arrangements are at present being made by the individual states to ratify, accede or provisionally apply the Food Aid Convention.  This will be followed later by the depositing in the case of Ireland of a formal instrument of accession.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Food Aid Convention is to carry out a food aid programme in cereals, mainly wheat, for the benefit of developing countries.  The countries party to the convention, apart from the Community, are Argentina, Australia, Canada, Finland, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and the USA. Under the convention and its protocols, the Community has undertaken to supply 1,287,000 tonnes of cereals as its minimum annual contribution in the form of wheat, coarse grains or derivative products suitable for human consumption.  This contribution is discharged partly by the Community from its own resources and partly by the member states in accordance with a fixed scale.  For 1979-80 Ireland's percentage  <Col N="1007" /> share is 0.54 per cent of that part discharged by the member states, which amounts to 3,100 tonnes.</P>
    <P>Ireland's national contribution under the Food Aid Convention is channelled through the World Food Programme and, in the current year, the Government have again allocated a sum of £500,000 in the Vote for the Department of Agriculture for the discharge of this obligation.</P>
    <P>In a world where so many people are hungry and where so many can never hope to secure for themselves an acceptable standard of living, the provision of a food aid programme in cereals can be of significant benefit.  The problem of food production in countries where food shortages exist are unfortunately all too familiar to us.  The combination of inefficient production methods, poor soil quality coupled perhaps with adverse climatic conditions and natural disasters create a vicious circle from which escape seems impossible.  Every effort must be made to encourage more efficient agriculture production in the developing countries.  The developed countries recognise that, in addition to actual food aid assistance, advice on animal husbandry, crop selection and cultivation, soil protection and improvement must also be offered if the developing countries are to become self-sufficient in food.  The International Fund for Agricultural Development, to which Ireland has pledged a sum of £570,000, is now operational and will be of immense benefit in dealing with the problems encountered by the Third World.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of our experiences of famine and want we have every reason to give a lead in food development aid.  Admittedly our resources are somewhat limited.  At the same time it is important to put the provision into perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the world today 25,000 persons will die from water-borne diseases alone.  That number is so huge and the problem is so tremendous that in many ways the enormity of the situation passes over our heads.  The matter could be put into context by relating it to the <Col N="1008" /> equivalent of the population of Tralee being wiped out today from water-borne diseases.  When we compare the figure of 25,000 deaths today with the expenditure of $400,000 million for military purposes we get an idea of the priorities of mankind in today's world.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that the Minister has our support for the motion to extend the Food Aid Convention.  The objective of the convention is to carry out a food aid programme with the help of contributions for the benefit of developing countries.  Under the convention certain countries have agreed to contribute as food aid wheat and grain suitable for human consumption or the cash equivalent, according to agreed quotas.  Presumably our contribution is by way of cash.</P>
    <P>Apart from the increase in the EEC contribution, presumably as a result of the extension from six to nine, there has been no increase in the figures since the original convention in 1971.  The EEC contribution is currently fixed at 1,287,000 metric tonnes.  Looking at the figure in the original convention and the figure in the current extension, there has been no increase in regard to any of the countries other than the increase on the accession of the other three countries in 1973.</P>
    <P>I understand that in 1976 the European Parliament suggested a minimum annual target for the EEC of 1.650 million tonnes.  I gather that this figure was to be achieved over a three-year period. The figure of 1,287,000 tonnes under the fifth extension is the same figure as under the fourth extension.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us why this figure has not been achieved.</P>
    <P>One is also entitled to question the non-participation of the USSR and other eastern bloc countries in the Food Aid Convention.  The convention is confined to Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EEC, Finland, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and the USA.  I wonder why other countries, many of them powerful, who preach the brotherhood of man are not contributing to the convention.  I notice that our efforts are small.  I would ask the Minister to be more specific in regard to the amount.  As I understand it, it is fixed at .54 per cent of the entire <Col N="1009" /> EEC contribution.  In his speech the Minister said that our contribution is channelled through the World Food Programme and that the Government have allocated a sum of £500,000 in the Vote for the Department of Agriculture for the discharge of this obligation.</P>
    <P>Is that the total amount, because my understanding of the arrangements made under the Food Aid Convention was that portion of the commitment was paid directly from central funds here but that there was some portion channelled through the EEC budget?  Therefore it is approximately half and half.  If that is the case we would make an indirect contribution through the EEC budget.  I am interested mainly in knowing whether the amount which we are paying, directly or indirectly through the Food Aid Convention, is £500,000 or £1 million. Be that as it may, and small as it may be, it entitles us to put pressure, moral and otherwise, on other stronger countries to join in the effort.  The Minister mentioned that there was a conference held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development which was, I believe, reconvened in September 1978, and which met again in January and February of this year for the purpose of establishing a new Food Aid Convention.</P>
    <P>We are now merely debating an extension of the 1971 Convention.  I would ask the Minister to indicate what progress has been made from the point of view of arrangements for a new Food Aid Convention.  Is the idea that such a convention would be broader in its ambit and more effective in its attempt to tackle the basic needs of the starving millions of the world?  I should be interested to know whether there are any other countries that would be willing to join in such new Food Aid Convention. That is relevant because this is the fifth extension of the 1971 Convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is very relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore I would be very interested to know what the Minister has to say in regard to the new convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other major aspect which needs <Col N="1010" /> to be referred to is the establishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development to which the Minister referred in his statement.  Obviously while we must help in feeding the hungry substantial priority must be given to increased and more efficient agricultural production in the developing countries, the fund to which we have committed a contribution of £570,000 over a three-year period and which is now operational.  I am strongly in favour of the provision of technological advice and specific assistance in helping the under-developed countries to develop their capacity to feed themselves.  If I might be permitted to paraphrase a quotation, I recall hearing one time that you give a family a fish and you feed them for a day; show them how to fish and you take them off the breadline.  Perhaps the Minister could outline what progress has been made by the International Fund for Agricultural Development, giving an idea of its range and scope, the number of countries contributing and what impact he expects it to make on this aspect of the problem.  Historically and otherwise we should be giving a lead in so far as we can, bearing in mind our resources and problems, bearing in mind also our standard of living relative to the enormous and indeed desperate problems in many parts of the world. Generally, therefore, there is every reason for us to participate in the food aid programme and, accordingly, I totally support the motion approving a further extension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the previous speaker in welcoming this motion approving the protocol for the fifth extension of the Food Aid Convention. Indeed I think all sides of the House welcome it.  If we have some critical comments to make that is simply because the aid is insufficient to solve the great problem obtaining in the poorer regions of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with this convention particularly as it pertains to Ireland as a Member of the EEC, which Community makes its arrangements with the convention in respect of all nine member countries.  In that respect I welcome the proposals the Commission have put <Col N="1011" /> forward for the three common food aid programmes dealing with cereals, skimmed milk and butter oil.  However, before dealing with those commodities, I should like to express my regret and that of my party at the fact that the Food Aid Convention, held in Geneva between 22 January and 14 February of this year, has collapsed.  I hope that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when he becomes Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the EEC in a few days time, will make every effort in that very important capacity to ensure that this Convention is revived as soon as possible, thereby enabling the work to be done through this organisation to be carried out as quickly as possible.  Because of the worldwide increase in demand for the products I have mentioned, the appropriations for their 720,000 tonnes of cereals some months ago, was totally inadequate. When the Minister mentions a figure considerably in excess of that in his brief, I assume that takes into account contributions from countries outside the EEC.  I would hope that the figure he gives is a revised one and is considerably higher than that available to us in the European Parliament a few months ago because in his introductory remarks the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Under the Convention and its Protocols, the Community has undertaken to supply 1,287,000 tonnes of cereals as its minimum annual contribution....</P>
    <P>which is considerably in excess of the figure which was available to us only a few months ago.  I would gladly welcome such increase, if that is what has happened, because it was the intention of some of us to ensure that a supplementary budget would be introduced to increase that amount radically, since it was totally inadequate for the reasons I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>In the area of the provision of skimmed milk powder the figure of 150,000 tonnes obtaining a couple of months ago&mdash;that being the supply by the Community&mdash;would be totally inadequate for present needs and, within the ambit of the budget, should be increased by at least one-third to make an even small <Col N="1012" /> impact on the needs in that area.  Of course, skimmed milk powder has a very high nutritive value which is needed in developing countries.  Therefore if the amount of this product was increased it would be all the more welcome.  Indeed, because of the over-supply of milk products within the Community, there should not be any great problem in supplying the extra amount needed.  Certainly where quantity is concerned, we are all aware that this product is available in warehouses throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>When talking about surpluses in the Community it has often been mentioned that we should reduce these surpluses by distributing them to the developing countries and to the Third World.  Where supply is not a problem this type of thing should be considerably extended.</P>
    <P>The proposals in relation to butter oil, 45,000 tonnes, is lower than it should be when we take into account the obvious need.  The budgetary contribution should be increased so that this figure can be increased by as much as 25 per cent.  The House will agree with the criteria drawn up by the commission for the distribution of this aid, in that 90 per cent of aid should be directed towards the poorest countries.  The criteria should be more flexible in other respects because we know that demand far exceeds supply. During the next six months, I hope the Minister will try to influence policy so that the criteria will be made more flexible in the future.</P>
    <P>In relation to the existing distribution structures, we are all aware of rumours that the food aid being supplied by the Community and convention countries, does not always reach the people it is intended for.  Although the aid may go to the country in question, it sometimes fails to reach the needy sections of the population.  Before a country gets food aid, prior guarantees should be given, that it will go to the people for whom it is intended.  The international organisations who generally distribute this aid should have satisfactory control over the use of Community food aid and the Community authorities should be allowed to make a comprehensive check on the implementation of agreements.</P>
    <P>Food aid should be determined without reference to Community <Col N="1013" /> agricultural policy.  We should not just supply a commodity because we have a surplus.  We should not base our food aid donation on such criteria.  We should be prepared to supply a commodity whether we have a surplus or not.  Certain conditions are being brought about to reduce surpluses within the Community and this should not mean that the under-developed countries are the first to suffer.  Our policy should be generous and not based on ridding ourselves of surpluses.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Keeffe said, food aid is really only a transitional solution to the problem of the needy.  We must also contribute to the agricultural development of the recipient countries.  It should be our long-term aim to develop these countries so that they can supply their own needs.  In this context I would draw the attention of the Minister to the World Conference on Agrarian Reform in Rural Areas, convened by the FOA for July 1979 which calls upon the institutions of the Community to draw up proposals for the development of agriculture in the Community countries. I hope the Minister will be actively involved here to raise the level of production of agricultural products in countries which at present receive food aid.  I also wish the Minister to pay particular attention to the small farming units in these countries.  I will welcome the proposal before us as do the rest of my party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this proposal I endorse what has already been said.  I have some reservations about the concept of food aid.  It is good that food should be given to help people faced with hunger to survive.  If that were the sole motivation of donations of food, one could not but applaud it. However, problems arise is relation to food aid.  The diet of a people is not easily changed.  It is hard to get people in underdeveloped countries used to consuming their own produce, to change their diet, to incorporate some of our grains, and it is equally difficult to get them to change again if their own produce becomes available in sufficient quantities. Food aid could make some of the people in the Third World dependent on a permanent basis on the type of food <Col N="1014" /> that can only be produced in the western world.  Food aid could become a form of colonialism in effect, because it makes people in Third World countries dependent on us, to a greater extent than they were prior to the introduction of food aid.  An example of this is to be found in the case of food aid given by the US in the form of soya beans.  In some underdeveloped countries they were used for animal feed, and when the price of soya beans went up six fold and were not made available in the form of aid, these countries, because their economies had been geared to using them for animal feed, had no option but to continue buying soya beans at the increased price. This is the great danger than can arise from food aid.</P>
      <P>We must not delude ourselves that food cannot be used as a means of achieving a political objective.  In 1964, Senator McGovern whom nobody will accuse of being an imperialist in American terms, because he is perhaps one of the most liberal and enlightened members of the US Senate, said that the great food markets of the future were the very areas where vast numbers of people were learning through the Food for Peace Programme to eat American produce, that the people they assisted today would become their customers tomorrow and that an enormous demand for American produce of all kinds would come into being if India could achieve even half the productivity of Canada, a very good US customer.</P>
      <P>On the same occasion, Senator Humphrey, another noted liberal in the US, said:</P>
      <P>I have heard that people may become dependent on us for food.  I know this is not supposed to be good news.  To me, that was good news because before people can do anything they have got to eat, and if you are looking for a way to get people to lean on you and to be dependent on you in terms of their co-operation with you, it seems to me that food dependence would be terrific.</P>
      <P>That bears out what I have been saying, that food is seen by certain people as a means towards securing dependence by the recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> Here I should like to echo strongly what our spokesman on Foreign Affairs has said, that the priority is not food aid, though I am not against food aid, but to enable peoples in the Third World to produce their own food with the type of technology suited to their economies.  It is no use selling to people in Bangladesh the type of technology appropriate to producing wheat on the Canadian plains, because on the Canadian plains in the production of wheat there might be full-time employment for one farmer on every 700 or 800 acres.  A technology introduced in the Third World that gave employment to only one farmer on every 700 or 800 acres, no matter how efficient it was in the physical production of food, would have serious disruptive effects on the economies of such countries.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent that is what has been happening as a result of the introduction of what has been described as the green revolution in Third World countries; by virtue of introducing new varieties of wheat certain things have happened.  First, Third World countries have come to depend more on expensive means of farming which would employ fewer people, and also they have become more dependent on imports of fertilisers. The essential ingredient in the green revolution is the production of new varieties of wheat which respond to fertilisers. If you gear an agricultural economy entirely to the production of perhaps not enough food but a certain amount to indigenous sources and you replace that with a different variety of grain which is not dependent on indigenous fertilisers but on imported fertilisers, although there may be short-term gains in the physical production of food, you are weakening the economic position of Third World countries.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent that is what is happening, and I suggest that the Third World will probably suffer more than any other part of the world from the present energy crisis which will push up the cost of fertilisers.  For instance, nitrogen, the important fertiliser as far as growth is concerned, is oil-based because one of the major sources of nitrogen is urea, a <Col N="1016" /> direct by-product of oil-production.  If you introduce new technology into the Third World which makes those countries more reliant than previously on imported nitrogen, you are making them far more sensitive than heretofore to the hike in oil prices which is happening at the present time.  This weakens rather than strengthens their position.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we must be careful that any aid given in the future will be of a nature that will encourage more independence on the part of those countries rather than more dependence. I cannot see any safeguards in the text of the convention we are now discussing against this kind of thing happening.  I cannot see anything in the convention which provides that aid shall not be given which would have the effect of creating undue dependence on Western products.  I suggest there should be something written in to ensure this will not happen.</P>
    <P>It is equally important that the giving of food aid will not disrupt the supply of other indigenous commodities in Third World countries.  For instance, if in a given year a Third World country produced not quite enough food from its own indigenous sources, say it produced 95 per cent of its own needs, and the price was high, and then it received food aid equivalent to 10 per cent of its needs at a much lower price, the effect would be to knock the bottom out of that country's domestic agriculture which would be undercut by cheaper imported food, thus destroying the profits of the country's own farmers.  That would be a very serious situation, if it were to arise. I do not think it is likely to arise because I cannot see those on the food aid committee allowing it to arise.  I suggest there should be something written into the convention to prevent it arising.</P>
    <P>The big need in the Third World as far as food production is concerned&mdash;I hope the Minister will give attention to this&mdash;is the development of technology in food production which will be appropriate to the economies of the Third World.  The type of technology being developed in our countries is suitable to our economies but it is not appropriate to the Third World without severe disruption of their economy.  They do not <Col N="1017" /> have enough resources to develop their own technologies; they do not have resources to invest in large agricultural institutes and so forth.  Therefore, it is not a matter of transferring our technologies but of giving them the means to develop their own technologies.  It will probably be small-scale technology which will enable them to do things for themselves, using existing domestic resources rather than imported ones.  That is the type of plan for the Third World that should be developed with the help of money from countries like Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should like to see us de-emphasising food aid over a period and emphasising to a greater extent the type of technology which will enable these people to produce their own food from their own resources.  The decisions to be taken about the type of research to be employed, the type of institutes to be set up, will have crucial effects in the long run and I hope the Minister will give it his attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who have contributed and I should like to congratulate Deputy O'Keeffe on his appointment as spokesman on Foreign Affairs.  I wish him well with his new brief.  I agree with his opening remarks about the idea of 25,000 people per day dying on this globe of ours&mdash;I do not know where he got the figures but I am sure they are ascertainable&mdash;while on the other hand we can spend somewhere in the region of $400,000 million per annum on armaments. We appear to have our priorities all wrong in that regard.  It makes me look askance at the recent agreement of SALT II between the Russians and the Americans.  They all talk about limitations as if it was a victory for sanity and peace.  I can only look on that type of agreement with a certain amount of limited pleasure.  I do not know what it achieves.  If people like President Carter and the Russian leader Brezhnev would sit down and talk about what we are talking about today they would be doing a far better job for humanity.  However, as Deputy O'Keeffe has said, the figures are there, and in the context of armaments  <Col N="1018" /> and the daily deaths of people in the various countries of the world, the world leaders seem to have their priorities all wrong.</P>
      <P>This is where Ireland has a very important role to play.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, while he would not express himself as crudely as possibly I have done, nevertheless has stated that Ireland has a very important moral role to play in world affairs in bringing to the attention of the nations of the world the priorities needed for those people who are less well off and those who are dying daily.  We must bring to world attention the need to alleviate the stress and poverty which afflict those nations on a daily basis.  Ireland will have an influential part to play when the Minister for Foreign Affairs takes on the Presidency of the Common Market within the next few days.</P>
      <P>Ireland's contribution is in the form of cash to the world food programme.  No increase is provided for during the course of the existing convention, as Deputy O'Keeffe rightly pointed out. However, in the re-negotiation of the Food Aid Convention the Community have indicated their readiness to increase the figure.  Therefore, there is a will there to increase the figure and to bring about a situation which the Government, Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Kavanagh have expressed a wish for.  There is no lack of will on the part of the Government as far as increasing the figures is concerned.  Both Deputies are pushing an open door in that regard.</P>

    <P>To come back to my original proposition, Deputy O'Keeffe has made the point, that the larger nations of the world have a very serious obligation which, in my opinion, is over and above those of the smaller nations.  The smaller nations, where we do not see the larger nations discharging their responsibilities to mankind elsewhere or where we consider that they are not doing so, have a moral obligation on the world fora to point out their deficiencies in that regard.  In saying this I am speaking personally; let me not put the Government in an embarrassing situation.  Deputy O'Keeffe asked whether the USSR could become party to the convention.  The simple answer is that they can.  The <Col N="1019" /> follow-up to that question is that they have not become a party to the Food Aid Convention.  Again, this is not good enough.  Of course they should be members of the Food Aid Convention. Of course they have obligations to the rest of mankind, and of course they are not discharging their obligations in that regard.  However, they are not the only ones who take a rather unusual view of their role in regard to the matters we have been discussing.  Again, these are my personal views.</P>
    <P>The new Food Aid Convention and the International Fund for Agricultural Development are being processed at the moment.  As Deputy O'Keeffe has pointed out, Ireland contributes to the Food Aid Convention through both the Community budget and a direct contribution of 3,100 tonnes.  Therefore, as the Deputy says, the total of Ireland's contribution is somewhere in the region of £1 million per annum.  He has asked what the prospects are for the completion of the Food Aid Convention. Negotiations on the International Wheat Agreement were suspended in February last and the present conventions with regard to food aid and the wheat trade have been extended for two years to allow adequate time to negotiate a new agreement.  Prospects for a new agreement are difficult to predict.  Ireland and other EEC countries are pressing for an early agreement.  Here again Ireland has a very important role to play.  I assure the House and Deputy O'Keeffe who raised this matter that Ireland are pushing ahead for a new agreement and the Government of Ireland cannot be blamed for any delay in that regard.  We are pressing ahead for this new agreement as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for Deputy O'Keeffe's contribution, for what he has said will be noted and if we can do anything to deal with some of the matters he has raised we will do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh raised again the matter of the protocol signing and there is no delay here on the part of Ireland. He regrets that the Food Aid Convention and new International Wheat Agreement negotiations collapsed&mdash;to use his expression&mdash;last February.  This <Col N="1020" /> is not altogether a true description of what happened in February.  As Deputy Kavanagh probably better than most other Deputies will appreciate, the negotiations have been extremely difficult. As I have stated in reply to a query raised by Deputy O'Keeffe, it is hoped that the matter will be continued in September next.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh referred to the figure of 1,287,000 tonnes in excess of the figure he received from the EEC a number of months ago.  That figure, which I quoted at the opening of this discussion, covers not only the amount borne by the Community budget but also that borne by member states.  As the Deputy says, the EEC hope, in time, to supply 1,650,000 tonnes.  In that regard I will give figures in relation to the annual contribution of each party to the protocol.  They might be well placed on the record, having regard to the countries that have been mentioned, Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EEC&mdash;I have given that figure&mdash; Finland, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and the USA.  The minimum annual contribution of Argentina to the protocol was fixed at 23,000 tonnes, Australia 225,000 tonnes, Canada 495,000 tonnes, the EEC 1,287,000 tonnes, Finland 14,000 tonnes, Japan 225,000 tonnes, Sweden 35,000 tonnes, Switzerland 32,000 tonnes, USA 1,890,000 tonnes. This gives a total somewhere in the region of 4,236,000 tonnes, which is a quite substantial amount.</P>
    <P>The Food Aid Convention does not cover skimmed milk.  However, the Community provides skimmed milk and butter oil as part of its food aid programme.  Ireland has consisently sought over the years to support efforts to increase all forms of Community food aid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh raised the question of distribution.  He may be referring to both the Food Aid Convention and the Community's food aid programme.  The Community have drawn up criteria to ensure as far as possible that the food goes to the poorest developing countries and to the poorest sections of the population within those countries.  He also mentioned the World Conference on Agarian Reform and Rural Development  <Col N="1021" /> which is to be held in Rome next month and will be attended by the Minister for Agriculture.  If Deputy Kavanagh wishes to bring any matter to the attention of the Minister I am sure he will be willing to consider his point of view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton in his pithy and wise observations raised the matter of the use of food aid and the material products supplied to various countries.  He mentioned the dietary problems in relation to usage of imported food by indigenous populations and the fact that they are not used to the type of food they receive. This aid is to ease the food shortage suffered by the people to whom it is sent.  It is an addition to the food they produce themselves.  Dietary regulations are quite clearly set out.  I agree that people could become dependent on imported food and the day may come when that food may not arrive and these people would have to look for alternatives.  The metabolic balance could be upset and people could become physically ill.  I will bring Deputy Bruton's point of view to the attention of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that food can be used in a political sense.  Ireland would have a very important role to play here. The people who would attempt to exploit populations through the disposal of food would be guilty of the most gross hypocrisy and cynicism and if Deputy Bruton has any information in that regard he has an obligation to bring it to the attention of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton properly says that it should be a priority to enable people in the Third World to produce their own <Col N="1022" /> food.  That is agreed.  I take his point in relation to what has been said by Senator McGovern and the late Senator Humphrey and in relation to the Food for Peace Programmes.</P>
    <P>The matter of appropriate agricultural technology was also raised by Deputy Bruton.  It is not strictly relevant to the Food Aid Convention, which is concerned with the granting of food aid in circumstances which do not disrupt the normal food market.  Food aid helps to satisfy existing demands and releases foreign exchange for other developing purposes.  I have no doubt that the finance so released is properly used for agricultural technology.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a point of information.  The contribution we will be making this year is expressed as 3,100 tonnes.  It will be made not in kind but in cash.  We are entitled under Food Aid Convention to do this and the original convention expressed the cash equivalent to be related to $1.73 per bushel.  Has that rate of exchange been changed since 1971 in view of the very substantial increase in the price of grain on the world markets since that time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke about sections 2 and 3 on Second Stage and I made the point very clearly that this Bill should not be before the House. There are a number of provisions in the Bill which are necessary to protect the interests of the Irish members of the European Parliament.  Section 5 deals with disqualification of Irish representatives for membership of certain boards.  I presume the boards listed are the same as those which apply to Members of this House and the Seanad.  This will hit one European MP fairly hard.  I think he is a member of at least two of those boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I oppose sections 2 and 3 because they put a charge on the Irish taxpayer which should be borne by the European <Col N="1024" /> Parliament.  As I said on Second Stage, this Bill has come before this House because the British Foreign Secretary had a hang up about the levels of pay mentioned in the press for members of the European Parliament.  He said that over his dead body&mdash;or some equally strong language&mdash;members would be paid those inflated salaries.  This became a point of honour and it was a significant plank in the election platform of the last British Government.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that there is a sort of club atmosphere.  There is a superstition that member Governments should look after each other coming up to election time.  A member Government may be in danger and if they all look after that Government, they will rally round the next time.  When it was obvious for 18 months that the British Government would have to face an election, this became a point of principle almost, or a point of honour.  A significant number of the British Labour Party were anti-European. The referendum earlier in the year was carried by the Government. One of the sops they offered was that they would not allow the European gravy to be spread thickly among members of the European Parliament. At the Bremen conference last July it was agreed that the British Prime Minister could go home and say European MPs would not be paid excessive salaries and that each national Parliament would fix the rate of pay for its own members.</P>
    <P>That is why we have this Bill which attempts&mdash;illegally, I hold&mdash;to limit the rates of pay for European MPs elected from the Republic of Ireland to the rates of pay offered to Members of Dáil Éireann.  This is a budgetary matter for members of the European Parliament who will assemble in two or three weeks' time.  It can only be decided by the members of the European Parliament tion with the Council of Ministers.  The Council of Ministers may decide this is what they want, but there is no chance that the members of the Parliament will agree.  They will want to decide the levels of pay which will obtain for themselves.</P>
    <P>This Bill is wasting the time of this House.  I know the Minister will say that unless we pass this Bill&mdash;because this <Col N="1025" /> principle was agreed at the summit by the Council of Ministers last December&mdash;we will be depriving members who were elected to the European Parliament of their pay for the first few months.  When they come to strike the level of payment for themselves they will have the payments made from the date of the election in the same way as members of Dáil Éirean are paid.  Their levels of pay and expenses will operate from the dates of the election, namely 7 to 10 June.  The Minister may say that will not be so, but he has no way of knowing because the Parliament has not yet met.  The Bill provides that they will be paid only from the date on which the Parliament first meets.  That may be what the Council of Ministers say, but I believe they will be paid from the dates of the election.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill.  There is a great deal of business to which we could be turning our attention more profitably.  I want to reiterate the arguments I put forward last week when we were discussing the Bill.  I and the Labour Party believe it is a presumption on our part to be making those in relation to the salaries of the European Parliament members.  The understandable argument put forward on Second Stage by the Minister of State was that we would be depriving our own people of money which was their due as a result of their election.  I thought about that because I do not wish to deprive anybody of any money which is his due. My view, and I have checked with our own elected members, is that whatever <Col N="1026" /> salary is agreed&mdash;and it will not be agreed by us&mdash;will be retrospective either to the date of the election, which Deputy Barry referred to, or to 17 July when the Parliament convenes.  This matter will not be readily solved.  There is no easy formula.</P>
      <P>The argument put forward by the Minister of State, Deputy MacSharry, does not hold.  It is one that emerged in his defence of a rather shabby political compromise that is now no longer necessary. It is one that made us stop and think before we went on to Committee Stage.  I am glad we did that because we have had the opportunity to talk to the people who will be in the largest group in the European Parliament.  Their view is that the matter will be solved after considerable discussion by members of the European Parliament in conjunction with the Council of Ministers.  Consequently, with all due respect to the Minister of State, Deputy MacSharry, and his officials, we are wasting the time of the House in discussing this.  I can understand that the Minister of State has been given a task to do and was told to get this passed before the recess.  I am not querying that or giving out to him. That is his job.  By the same token, our job is to oppose proposed legal nonsense. If there ever was legal nonsense to come before the House it is this.  We are attempting to decide what the level of remuneration will be for a group of European parliamentarians, meeting for the first time, who themselves have been specifically charged with establishing their own rate of remuneration, in conjunction with the Council of Ministers, by the outgoing Parliament.  It was not because the outgoing Parliament pretended there was not a problem to solve or felt they would agree with the compromise proposal of the Council of Ministers.  The outgoing Parliament rightly felt that since none of them was on salary, because they were an indirectly elected parliament composed of parliamentarians from the nine member states, they had not the right to set the salary level for the incoming Parliament. Despite the matter being raised on a number of occasions they refused to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to which this draft <Col N="1027" /> legislation would wish to give effect was a political compromise, the sole objective of which was to ensure there would be the kind of democratic turn-out on June 7 subsequently attained.  That was the only reason for that deal in Bremen. It worked well.  What people want from politicians above all else is a certain degree of honesty.  The establishment of international salaries for people with different standards and costs of living in nine member states is not an easy matter. One cannot say it will be the same in every country.  At the same time, there are basic principles, such as the same rate of pay for the same job that have to be recognised.  There is no simple solution. The proposal we are being asked to give effect to is a political compromise made by one part of a bi-partisan group of people who will ultimately have legal responsibility to make it.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to rush into and validate the Taoiseach's participation in a political compromise so that he can, presumably, go back to the Council of Ministers and say that, along with the other states that have agreed this, we have delivered on this legislation.  I suspect that at the back of this is a request that at least the President of the Council should be in a position to give good example and state his country has delivered domestically and given legal effect to the deal hammered out in Bremen.  If the Minister of State and the Government were to come in and argue on the political pragmatism that is in that, we would be able to listen to an honest political argument and see whether we could do business.  As this party have said, we have every desire to ensure that the Irish Presidency will be successful despite the difficulties that are not the fault of the Government and in spite of the difficulties that are partly their fault.  We do not wish to diminish the success of the Irish Presidency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, section 2 is the Bill.  The rest is sequential and not contentious.  That is not what is being argued.  Perhaps when the Minister of State replies he may respond to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> We are opposed to this and will be voting accordingly.  We do not think we have the right to do it.  We suspect that by virtue of coming into the Presidency the Government are being forced unnecessarily to give a lead in this matter. If that is the case perhaps the Minister would so indicate.  Irrespective of the motives for doing it, it simply is not on. The Minister would do a better job if he left the matter at this stage, waited for the Presidency to take effect and, after 17 July, put on the agenda the whole question of members' salaries in conjunction with one of the committees which will undoubtedly emerge from the newly elected Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is important, though understandable, that we do not have outgoing members from the European Parliament here to speak.  There is an understandable shyness in this matter but it is an unnecessary shyness.  To come back to section 2 and what is explicit and implicit in it, we are being asked to do something which this party do not feel we have the right to do&mdash;to give legal effect to a political compromise which is now no longer necessary and which is wasting the time of the House.</P>

      <P>The philosophy of the Bill and of this section is beyond comprehension. It purports to fix the salary of the Irish representatives of the European Parliament.  Reference to the Irish representatives runs through the Bill. The Title is the European Assembly (Irish Representatives) Bill.  The Long Title is interesting and is related to section 2.  We are told that the whole Act is to provide for the payment of allowances to the Irish representatives in the Assembly of the European Community.

      <P>Are the Government under section 2, proposing to fix the allowances of Dr. Paisley, Mr. Hume and Mr. Taylor?  I do not know how they would go for that suggestion.  This is what a reading of this Bill would indicate. <Col N="1029" /> It is another example of how ridiculous the Bill is.  We are in a situation where, because of a foolish agreement made by the Bremen Council last December, this Bill is before the House. The new European Parliament is meeting next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This point was debated on Second Reading Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the provision in this Bill whereby the Government are attempting to settle the salaries of the new members of the directly-elected European Parliament. From that point of view the situation that must be considered is that the Council of Ministers reached a decision in this regard in December last.  In section two the Government are purporting to pay, by way of funds provided by the Oireachtas, salaries to European Parliament members that are in line with Dáil salaries.  However, the Council of Ministers acting alone have not the power at any time to determine the remuneration of members of the European Parliament.  The Treaty of Rome provides that the budgetary authority is the Parliament and the Council of Ministers.  Therefore, any budgetary decision of the Council of Ministers is not binding unless the Parliament is a party to that decision and in the case we are talking of the Parliament has not been a party to the decision and is never likely to be party to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, we here are continuing the codology by debating this Bill.  Clearly this debate is a waste of time.  It is obvious that the decision reached in Bremen in December last was not acceptable either to the Bureau or to the members of the indirectly-elected Parliament and I have no doubt that the members of the directly-elected Parliament will treat this Bill with the contempt it deserves.  We are doing a disservice to the country by providing for payment under this section.  Why should this country make payments from its own resources to members of the European Parliament when these members should be paid from EEC resources?  Why should we be involved in the payment of <Col N="1030" /> salaries and expenses&mdash;and expenses would be considerable in view of the distances to Strasbourg and Luxembourg? It is all very well to say that there was a decision on this matter at the Council of Ministers but why not wait for the outcome of the European Parliament decision on the matter, a decision which must supersede the decision of the Council?  We are rushing into a situation in which we are putting an expense on the Irish taxpayer that is totally unnecessary. Having regard to the percentage that we contribute to Community funds, it would be far more sensible for us to allow the members of the European Parliament to be paid from Community resources.</P>
    <P>Another question that we must consider is the question of equal pay for equal work.  We are providing in this Bill to send to Europe people who have been through a tough election campaign but these representatives will be paid in some cases perhaps only a quarter of what other members will be paid.  That is an absurd situation.  If we have any suggestion as to how these people should be paid we must have a lot more ambition and vision in regard to any such suggestion. There are precedents for the payment of international officials from different countries.  There are different ways in which they can be paid fairly.  In many cases, though the standard of living varies in different countries, these officials while not being paid the same amount of money, are in effect receiving the same pay for the same job when tax and cost-of-living adjustments are taken into account.  The representatives from here will be spending a certain amount of time in Europe and while in Europe they should be paid in proportion, bearing in mind the amount of time they spend there, to the other representatives in the Parliament.  We must bear in mind, too, that our representatives will be spending only a portion of their time in Europe.  The standard of living here compared with the standard of living in other EEC countries should be taken into account bearing in mind the proportion of time that the members from this country will be spending in Europe.</P>
    <P>It should not be all that difficult to arrive at a formula whereby the representatives <Col N="1031" /> from here would be paid properly but would not be receiving the same amount as, say, a representative from Germany would be receiving.  I urge the Minister to consider some such solution but in the meantime I oppose strongly the view that we should send from here representatives who would be receiving far less money than would be the remuneration of their colleagues from other countries merely because they are from other countries.  Is there any incentive in such a situation for our representatives to work hard in Europe in the interests of this country?  Is it possible that some of them will be at a disadvantage by way of financial constraints and may not be able to attend to their duties as assiduously as might be the case if they were receiving proper renumeration?  All these questions arise but what we should do is to shelve this Bill until the Dáil resumes in October by which time the whole problem will have been resolved in the European Parliament.  The Bill could then be withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I have not very much to say on this Bill.  There are only three points I wish to make and I hope to be able to make them briefly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first point is that the salaries of the European parliamentarians should be paid by the European Parliament since that is the assembly that these people will be serving.  One would think that the first obligation of any parliament would be to pay the salaries of the parliamentarians who serve there.  It is not possible to elaborate at any length on that proposition because it is self-explanatory. When our parliamentarians go to Europe they will be discharging duties not alone on behalf of this country but on behalf of each of the other eight member states.  Surely if Europe means anything it means that the European parliamentarians when they sit in the Parliament of the Community will be acting as Europeans and will not be acting as members of nine individual states.  Of course they will have to bear in mind the rights and the necessities of their own countries but as I understand the concept of the Treaty of Rome, it is a <Col N="1032" /> bringing together of all the member states to act as one Community in the best interest of the Community as a whole, having regard to the different stages of development of each country. In this measure we seem to be saying, in so many words, that these members are going out as our delegates or representatives, with no other function to discharge than their duties and obligations as our representatives.  They are going out as Europeans and should be paid as Europeans from the common European purse.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to fix the salary or allowance of an Irish member of the European Parliament on the basis that he will have an extra salary, a salary as a representative of Dáil Éireann.  The salary appears to have been fixed on that assumption and, in the very first election, that assumption was proved to be wrong, because we have two members who are not Members of this House or not Members of the Oireachtas at all &mdash;Mr. Maher and Mr. Flanagan, both having been returned as European Deputies.  Even all the members sent out from here will not draw the same salaries from any public purse.  Deputy Lalor for example, will draw twice as much salary from the public purse as Mr. T. J. Maher, which is an absurdity.  I am not making individual comparisons; I am just comparing two people, one of whom is a Member of the Dáil and the other is not.  These men will be doing the same duties in Europe.  The members will have to devote practically all their time and attention, and certainly their energy, to travelling to and from Europe and to discharging their duties there.  It is not an answer to say that some people may have two or more salaries.</P>
    <P>We have heard much talk about remuneration for work done.  All the people going to Europe, whether they go from Germany, from Britain, from France, will be performing the same duties in the European Parliament and yet will have totally different salaries.  It could be argued, indeed, that our people will do much more work, or use much more energy in discharging their duties because they will have further to travel, much more time to spend travelling; <Col N="1033" /> everybody knows how exhausting and tiring travel is.  In my opinion, it does not make sense to give one salary to a German, or a Frenchman, who is much nearer the base of his work, and a much smaller salary to an Irishman.  That is making little of the Irish.  It will be much more difficult for the Irish Parliamentarians to fight for our cause.  They will be told &ldquo;After all, in your own salary, you are taking much less&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This comes back to this business of the individual countries fixing their members' salaries instead of the European Parliament doing it.  It is no answer to say that it would be absurd to pay a European Parliamentarian much more than a Minister or perhaps as much as the Taoiseach.  The answer is that they are doing different work, in a different place and in different circumstances. They are working in Brussels, or Strasbourg, and not in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The only other point I want to make is that the salaries should be laid down without reference to travelling expenses. Far too often is regard had to travelling expenses when fixing salaries.  They are two entirely different things.  A man should not have to travel unnecessarily in order to get a decent salary and let us not fool ourselves, that is what we are legislating for here.  Even when no salaries were paid to European members, it is accepted that travelling expenses were so generous that there was a net profit.  I am against that mode of payment.</P>
    <P>When we talk about allowances or salaries that is all we should be talking about, and they should be adequate to remunerate the European members, irrespective of travelling expenses. However, expenses should be fixed at a rate that would ensure that the members were not out of pocket and that they would be able to travel at a standard in keeping with their status.  If we provide miserable salaries, out of line with those of practically every other member, and if there are generous and even extravagant expenses provided, we are then compelling our members to travel there frequently and sometimes unnecessarily to qualify for expenses.  I am against that and the House should be against it.  It <Col N="1034" /> cannot be denied that, because there were no salaries paid to European parliamentarians from 1973 up to this year and they were paid only travelling allowances in order to make sure they were not at a loss the parliamentarians travelled at every opportunity.  I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe that this Bill should be shelved until the European Parliament meets.</P>

If this Bill was not passed until next session the European Parliamentarians would have met and they would have an opportunity of considering this very important matter of who pays them expenses and what their salaries should be.  The European Parliament has control over the European purse strings.  It can change the budget. It can add billions to it or take billions from it.  If the European Parliament can be entrusted with changing the budget why can it not be entrusted with the power to fix the salaries of its members?</P>

      <P>The arguments being pursued by Deputies today on this section are similar to the arguments made on Second Reading.  I will not go into detail and repeat the same arguments over and over again.  I take a little exception to the personal innuendos by Deputy Quinn about me being foolish about &ldquo;this foolish legislation&rdquo;, as he and other Deputies have described it.  If I or this country are to be described as foolish there are quite a lot of foolish Governments around the EEC.  Germany has already passed its legislation. It is being discussed in Denmark.  The Second Stage has been completed in Britain. Luxembourg and France have made their provisions and the others are proceeding with the type of mechanism which is necessary to allow the payment of salaries to their members of the European Parliament. <Col N="1035" /> Deputy Quinn spoke about a statement I made on Second Stage that if this legislation was not passed we would not be in a position to pay our European parliamentarians any salaries or allowances whatever.  That fact is the same as it was last week.  We can only deal with the situation as we find it.</P>
      <P>Deputies suggested last week that there was no necessity for this legislation. When the European Council met last week this matter was not discussed and they did not change what they decided last December.  If we are to have any procedure whereby our members can be paid a salary and allowances, we must have this legislation.  What might happen subsequently is hypothetical.  All the arguments put forward by the various Deputies may or may not arise. We can only deal now with the situation as it is at the moment.  This is the necessity for this legislation and this section.</P>
      <P>Deputies mentioned the powers and the authority which European members of Parliament will have.  How is it that the nominated members of the European Parliament did not fix a salary for themselves?  If they had such power and authority I am sure they would have used it.  That emphasises the necessity for this Bill.  I would like to add, for the information of the House, if the Deputies have not worked it out for themselves, that out of our 15 members of the European Parliament 12 of them will be in receipt of a combined salary of £13,822, one of them will receive £10,979 and two of them will receive £6,911.  The differentials between that salary even here and here <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other countries was mentioned by Deputy Quinn, who said that with different standards of living it would be difficult to have a common salary.  I assume the way this was catered for in the past by the members of the European Parliament was with the generous allowances and resources available&mdash;I do not know the full details of it&mdash;to a member from one country as against a member from another country. They have been, as admitted by Deputy Fitzpatrick, quite generous.  He said that profits were made out of the expenses which were allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that any new points <Col N="1036" /> arose out of the discussion today.  There was the question of the authority of the Parliament to change the budget but I will not go into the detailed mechanics of the European Parliament budget or the budget for the European Communities. As a member of the Budget Council I know that the various technical problems would take some time to explain. It is very hard to understand even one of them never mind the elaborate procedures which are there.  The Council of Ministers and the Parliament are the budgetary authority.  There is a break-up in the expenditure between obligatory expenditure and non-obligatory expenditure. The Parliament have not any say in relation to obligatory expenditure. They have a say up to a certain percentage in the increase of the maximum rate from one year to the other in the non-obligatory area.  A blank statement talking about the authority of the Parliament to change the budget might lead people to assume that the Parliament just set down X, Y or Z, that they can pay themselves £100,000 a year or whatever it might be, but that is not the case.  If that were the case why did they not do it for the last few years?  This Bill is before us to enable us to pay those allowances to the members of the European Parliament at the same rate as paid to Members of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have to try to give effect to a political deal done at Bremen just as have their counterparts in their domestic parliaments and that is the reason we are debating this legislation.  I believe it is silly.  I have no argument about the drafting but it is silly to try to give legal effect to a political compromise that is no longer required because 60 per cent of the electorate went out on 7 June.  That has been well argued and I do not wish to go over that ground again.</P>
      <P>We should turn to a more important point, one that has not yet been raised but which is central to section 2 of the Bill.  In his Estimate speech the Minister for Foreign Affairs talked about the new relationship that would result as a consequence of a directly elected European Parliament between that Parliament and the Council of Ministers and while there was no question of changing the legal powers of the European Parliament which were a function of the Treaty of Rome and amending treaties there was every intention to ensure that the relationship and influence of the European Parliament with regard to the Council of Ministers would be far greater than that of the selected parliament of which we have seen the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before Fianna Fáil got locked into an anti-European alliance with the Gaullist Party the Minister was a fairly fervent European.  He responded positively to <Col N="1038" /> the idea that as President of the Council of Foreign Ministers he should facilitate and encourage such a positive relationship.  Do the Government really think the whole business is getting off to a good start if the first thing the Council of Ministers try to do is to say to the 410 representatives that the domestic parliaments of the member states will decide the rate of pay and that the representatives will have no role whatever in it? Is the Minister of State seriously suggesting that we start a relationship with a unique multi-national Parliament on the basis of the nine domestic parliaments deciding the salaries without any attempt being made to integrate what will be a difficult equation?  To the principle of equal pay for equal work for people living in an economy with a constant standard of living we have to add equal pay for equal work in nine separate countries where there are different costs of living and, consequently, the equation becomes that much more different.  However, it can be worked out and it should be attempted.  It should be attempted in conjunction with the European Parliament or else the whole business is a nonsense.</P>
    <P>By attempting to rush through this legislation in the domestic parliaments of the member countries we are preempting one of the roles of the European parliamentarians&mdash;a minor role but an important one.  Much more important, from the outset we are setting the tone of the relationship between the Parliament and the Council of Ministers.  If that is the case all the talk from Ministers in the various countries and from the Fianna Fáil Government in particular, who were very strong on the idea of direct elections, must be seen as nothing more than verbiage, that in reality the Parliament will be under the thumb of the Council of Ministers despite the fact that there was a great song and dance about 300 million people going to the polls in an historic election.  In the indecent haste in which the Minister is trying to get through the legislation, are we seeing the first real effort of Fianna Fáil opposition to extending any powers to the European Parliament?  Is this the first test of the Chirac-Gaullist-Fianna Fáil alliance, that irrespective of what happens in <Col N="1039" /> other parliaments the Irish Parliament will say by way of section 2 of this Bill that the salary for members of the European Parliament will be decided in the nation states and not in the European Parliament?</P>
    <P>My third point is that if we were talking about the remuneration of officials of the Department of the Public Service, of Agriculture or of any other Department who were going to work in a European institution, does anyone in this House&mdash;whether stenographers, ushers or journalists&mdash;serious think that we would be talking about nine different rates of pay?  When we joined the EEC did the officials who were seconded, many of whom are still on secondment from various Departments, go in at differential rates of pay?  We know the answer to that&mdash;they did not.  There was no question at any stage that it was even on the agenda.  If that applies to everyone else, why can it not apply to us with the qualification I propose?  We recognise that it is not a simple issue that can be easily resolved but neither can it be resolved to the exclusion of the 410 members who will take their seats on 17 July.</P>
    <P>Finally, if we were applying the same logic to members of the European Parliament as we apply to Members here, why does not the salary take effect from the day of election, not from the day on which they take their seats? There is a gap of six or seven weeks.  My reading of the legislation is that the salary will take effect as from 17 July yet in respect of all Members of this House it takes effect from the time they are elected.  If I am wrong in my reading of the section I hope I will be corrected.</P>
    <P>I shall sum up the three points I have made.  The fact that the legislation is being pursued by other member states is the result of the political compromise of the heads of state at Bremen without recognising that it is no longer necessary. My second point was how this will determine the influence of the Parliament <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Council of Ministers. My third point was why we are applying different standards to elected members when we would not dream of attempting to apply them to officials of the European <Col N="1040" /> Parliament or of the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn's last point, I think the answer is that the European Parliament operates on the same basis as our Seanad. Members of the Dáil are paid from the day of the election, while Members of the Seanad are paid as from the date of the first meeting of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>We have wasted a lot of time on this section.  Obviously the Minister has no intention of deleting sections 2 and 3. The Minister is intelligent enough to see that there is a logic in what we are saying but the Government, for the sake of their pride, think they must have this legislation.  We are opposing sections 2 and 3.</P>
      <P>The Minister misrepresented Deputy Fitzpatrick slightly.  The point the Deputy was making was that the Council of Ministers trust the Parliament to have a say in the framing of the budget. They do this under the Treaty of Rome. Whether it is a voice in the obligatory part or the non-obligatory part does not really matter.  The point the Deputy was making was that the Parliament have a say in the framing of the budget.  If they can be trusted with framing a budget that involves billions of pounds, they can be trusted to fix the level of their own salaries.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that if we did not pass this legislation, the people elected from Ireland to the European Parliament would have no salary until something happened in the future.  That is not a major point.  There are many ways they can be given money if they want it.  The Department of Foreign Affairs could be given a Supplementary Estimate&mdash;I am sure if I look at the Order Paper I will see they are already in for such a Supplementary Estimate&mdash;part of which could be used as a loan to members of the European Parliament and which could be repayable in future when salaries are fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also seeks to give the impression that Ireland is the only country out of step.  This is not so.  In Belgium only the Lower House has passed this legislation.  Denmark and Germany have passed the legislation.  It is <Col N="1041" /> significant to note that they are the two countries where the levels of pay of their Members of Parliament are extremely high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of Deputies I wish to state that members of the European Parliament in the past received allowances in respect of travel, subsistence and secretarial expenses, and it is understood that these payments will continue to be determined by the Assembly budget.  It is not envisaged, accordingly, that any expenses will fall to be met from voted moneys at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I announced my intention to oppose this section was because I could not understand it.  The section states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, if he thinks fit, by order provide for the payment of allowances for expenses to representatives in the Assembly or appointed to the Assembly in the manner described in section 2 (1) of this Act.</P>
      <P>If, as the Minister stated, allowances and out-of-pocket expenses that were previously paid by the Assembly will continue to be paid in the future what is the necessity for section 3?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>In case the necessity arises in the future that they be paid from voted moneys here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why it is necessary to introduce a system to cater for something that may happen if the present arrangement collapses in the future.  It does not make sense.  The Minister has not given me any good reason why this is necessary.  The arrangement exists and if the intention is that it should continue the section is unnecessary. I am suspicious that that arrangement may discontinue if the section is allowed remain.  I do not want a Minister deciding by order that a mistake was made and that the expenses of MEPs should be doubled, or halved, or that a peppercorn or caraway seed be given instead of expenses.  If the present arrangement is deemed satisfactory why introduce a section that will change that system in the future?  The Minister has told us that we must deal with things as they are, that we must deal with the actualities, the facts and the fact is that the expenses and allowances paid to MEPs are to continue.  Why should we agree to a provision which will allow a future Minister who may not be a Member of this House and who has the idea that those elected to the European Parliament should go there for the love of the country to change this situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The expenses are paid from the European Assembly budget and it is not envisaged, as far as we can ascertain, that there will be any necessity for the payment of expenses out of voted moneys here.  However, it is considered desirable to include such a provision in the event of a situation developing whereby the Assembly would not pay any expenses.  It is a practical arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the inclusion of the section, and the Minister's defence of it, demonstrates the weakness of the argument in the first instance? The Minister is making provision in this section for a situation that may change and, implicitly, is suggesting that it will change.  By including this section he is recognising that the whole system of payment will change in the not too distant future.  On the one hand we were <Col N="1047" /> arguing about fixing salaries, as we did on section 2, but in section 3 we are being asked to deal with a situation that may arise if the Assembly changes the way in which it pays its members.  While that may be a practical belt and braces operation in the context of the debate we had on Second Stage and the protracted debate on section 2, it demonstrates a contradiction within the Bill.  In principle, along with section 2, this section should be opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any contradiction. Section 2 arises from the agreement reached at the summit conference and section 3 arises because no decision has been made for a continuance of the payment of these expenses by Parliament.  In the event of that Parliament not agreeing to continue the payment of the expenses this section will be brought into being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a contradiction. The argument the Minister is using in connection with this section is the direct opposite to what he used on section 2.  This is a ridiculous piece of legislation.  The Minister warned us about dealing in hypothetical cases but there is nothing more hypothetical than this section.</P>
      <P>It is very unlikely that the European Parliament will decide not to pay expenses but in the event of that happening the Minister could amend this Bill to cater for that situation.  The section does not say that the Minister must get the permission of the House for such an order.  At the stroke of a pen the Minister concerned may make any change he wishes in regard to the payment of allowances to representatives.</P>

      <P>The section deals with the pensions of MEPs, including those who are not Members of this House.  Are the proportions of the pensions related to the double salary or to a single salary?  In other words, would Members who are Members of either House all get the same level of pension or a proportion of the money they draw from the Exchequer?</P>

      <P>The scheme has not been fully worked out yet but where there is double salary or dual mandate involved there will be double contribution. It will be a contribution scheme introduced for European parliamentarians and they will all contribute in the same way towards this fund.  If they happen to be Deputies or Senators they will continue to contribute in the normal way to the pension fund for Deputies and Senators.</P>

      <P>In the absence of a scheme specifically for European Members, am I right in assuming that for the time being they will be added into the existing Oireachtas pension scheme? We are talking about a period of three weeks in which we could work out a pension scheme which will be separate from the Oireachtas pension scheme currently existing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that but the Minister in his speech stated that the provisions will be set out in the scheme itself which will be generally on the lines of that already applicable to members of the Oireachtas and such a scheme will be laid before the House in accordance with section 6 of the Bill.  What I would like clarified is this: it appears from what the Minister stated that from day one of a salary cheque being issued here on foot of this legislation there will be a deduction for pension.  Is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right.  What I did want to find out is that for the time being members would be treated similarly to those under the Oireachtas scheme and that deductions would be made on a similar basis.  There will be no pension deductions until such time as a scheme is provided?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

I think the chance of any one of them doing three terms is not great.  I think the contributions in this case will have to be nearly one third of the salary to make it a viable scheme unless the State is going to contribute 80 or 90 per cent.</P>

It might even be useful to have directors of these companies Members of the European Parliament where they could argue the case of their particular company and perhaps get increased funds or influence loans to some of them.

      <P>Equating the Oireachtas with the European Parliament and equating the relationship of semi-State bodies to the executive of the Dáil and Seanad with the non-executive situation in the European Parliament is simplistic. I wonder if section 5 is necessary.  Suppose one of the medical representatives in a health board subsequently becomes a Member of this House, will he be automatically requested to resign from the board?  The health board may well feel that there is an advantage in having a Member of either House on the board. I can understand the provision excluding Members of both Houses from membership of the boards of semi-State companies.  As Deputy Barry said, there can be advantages in having members who are members of a board. Membership of boards of semi-State companies is not an onerous or time-consuming task.  The relationship of a semi-State company to the European Parliament, particularly in the context of the regional fund or the social fund, could be critical.  What is the thinking on this matter?  Is it merely an extension of the rules that apply here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of applying the same procedure to MEPs.  If a Member of the Dáil becomes a member of the European Assembly, it could be argued that he could become a member of a board even though his membership <Col N="1054" /> of the Dáil disqualifies him from such membership under another Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see why the provision is being made.  Members of the Oireachtas cannot be members of semi-State boards because of the relationship of Parliament to the executive.  As Ministers have powers to appoint members to boards of semi-State companies they are open to the charge of partiality.  That situation does not apply to the European Parliament.  If Mr. Maher, who headed the poll in Munster by a large agricultural vote, had been appointed to the board of the ACC, he would now have to terminate his membership of that board despite his considerable influence and expertise in matters agricultural.  In what way would the public interest be served by such a hypothetical suspension?</P>

      <P>Of course it does.  The person responsible for defending the interests of the legislation that would affect a semi-State company is the relevant Minister who has designated powers under the Act.  When the terms of Bord Bainne were changed as a result of EEC legislation, the Minister was quick to ensure that their position would not be undermined. There will be no conflict of interest there.  By the same logic of the Minister's argument one could debar from membership of this House anybody who had a directorship in any company, contending there would be a conflict of interest because we do not even have a register of interests in this House.</P>

      <P>I can see the Minister's position.  I should have thought that this section could have been deleted.  It is simplistic and is part of a hurried Bill. The Minister has answered as well as can be answered the point concerning the block of rules and regulations applying to TDs and Senators simply being taken over and applied to members of the European Parliament.  In this instance the logic does not stand up because the European Parliament does not have the same relationship to the Exchequer as does this Parliament.  Consequently, the need to remove any potential conflict of interest does not arise and, in my view, section 5 is invalid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding that legislation was introduced in this House incorporating a section saying that the members of that board, if they became members of either House of the Oireachtas&mdash;and in the case of Radio Telefis Éireann and perhaps others, if they were nominated to become Members of either House of the Oireachtas&mdash;could not retain their seat on the board of that company.  My understanding is that there was a fear, because of the history of this country, that such a member could use his position on the board of such a company to his political advantage.  I am not even sure how they thought it would work.  I can see it would work in Radio Telefis Éireann, but in regard to the boards of some other companies it escapes my notice how a member of the board could gain political advantage.  Perhaps, for example, in the Electricity Supply Board he could arrange that, say, the rural electrification scheme would serve his constituency before that of somebody else, an Opposition Member or somebody else.  There must have been that kind of thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the same argument does not apply when these men go to Europe.  As was mentioned by Deputy Quinn, Mr. T. J. Maher is a member of two of the boards here&mdash;as far as my recollection goes, of the boards of the Irish Sugar Company and the B &amp; I.  I am not absolutely sure about that but I think that is so.  Perhaps he is a member of other boards as well.  I would think it <Col N="1056" /> would be a distinct advantage to the B &amp; I&mdash;and we will be discussing legislation in regard to them here tomorrow&mdash;when trying to raise capital, when going to the European Investment Bank, to have one of their directors who was also a member of the European Parliament. Exactly the same would apply to the Irish Sugar Company.  Indeed it would be of great advantage to such commercial companies.  Indeed, there might be a good case for saying that every European Member of Parliament, given the level of salary being offered them, should be a member of company boards as well. But to add three boards to a Bill going through this House prohibiting Members of this House being members of the boards of those companies, namely, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Bord na gCon and Bord na Móna, does not stand up. They are already prohibited from having on their boards Members of either House of the Oireachtas.  To say to them now: &ldquo;You can have a TD, you can have a Senator but you cannot have a Member of the European Parliament&rdquo; is not logical.  Unfortunately none of the Members of the European Parliament is a member of these boards already, but it would be a very big advantage to any one of those boards to have a member of the European Parliament one of their directors.</P>
    <P>If the Minister withdraws those three names from this list then when legislation referring to them comes before this House he can put his case forward, or the appropriate Minister can do so.  He can then include a section for these three companies prohibiting such people from being a Member of either House of the Oireachtas and also from being Members of the European Parliament, when we can then argue the merits or demerits of the case.  But we should not put the cart before the donkey at this stage.  Rather we should delete these three names now when there would be some uniformity as regards the rest of the list, but by inserting those three names the list is being unbalanced the other way.  Is that not correct?</P>

      <P>I did not come to that yet.  What I said earlier, and I am now repeating, is that the situation in relation to this House is now being provided for in this Bill.  In addition, these three other State bodies are mentioned. As soon as the occasion arises for any legislation in relation to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Bord na gCon or Bord na Móna, a provision such as exists for the other boards mentioned will be introduced.  There is no point then in coming back and having them added to the Schedule of this Bill.  That is my view, and is the view expressed here by having them included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  I think the Minister agrees with what I am saying. I cannot remember how old An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is now; I think it dates back to the late 1940s.  Bord na Móna is coming up to 50 years old.  I remember putting through an amending Bill in regard to Bord na Móna which did not contain a section such as that referred to by the Minister.  Bord na gCon went through some time in the late 1950s, in 1957 or 1958; therefore it has been there for 20 years.  Bord na Móna has been there for 40 years at least and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, I think, about the same, but I am not sure.</P>

      <P>I am not sure.  But I would think the Minister should delete those and when the occasion for amending each one arises we can then argue the merits or demerits of including them.  There is some good reason that they are not included.  Certainly in relation to Bord na Móna legislation has gone through before now, because I put it through myself, when there was not a section included which prohibited their board members from being a Member of either House of the Oireachtas.  I cannot remember the reason; I do not remember being asked to put it through.  I do not think Bord na gCon has been amended since its inception, but I am not sure about that.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara certainly has been amended without having a section introduced prohibiting their members from being a Member of either House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The Minister is putting forward legislation applying the same constraints on any fees that apply to Deputies and Senators.  That is fairly clear, although one could argue that it does not necessarily follow.  If we are to live with that application, with all its internal <Col N="1060" /> contradictions, let us be consistent, let us simply apply, to any fees the exact same legal constraints that currently apply to Deputies and Senators. The Minister is taking both sides of the road at the same time.  The Minister said that they will be treated exactly the same, because the Minister proposes at the next available opportunity to introduce amending legislation, or to attach this provision to any semi-State bodies that do not have the exclusion principle, and then in reply to a question from Deputy Barry the Minister contradicted that stand by saying that Irish Shipping was not included because they are in the process of amending their Articles of Association.  By the logic of the Minister's first argument Irish Shipping should automatically be included.  If Irish Shipping is excluded logic dictates that the three bodies that currently do not have it, should also be excluded.</P>

      <P>How long was this legislation <Col N="1061" /> in draft form?  With all due respect to the Department this section is extremely shabby.  It should not be there at all but if the Minister saw fit to include it he should have done the homework and included all of the semi-State bodies, because it is the principle we are talking about here.  We are talking about the principle of a possible conflict of interest between membership of the European Parliament and membership of a board of a semi-State company.  That conflict is assumed, not argued either in the Minister's speech or in any subsequent contribution made by him.  To add insult to injury, having made that global simplistic assumption, it now appears that the Department of the Public Service have not done their homework to the extent that they know what State companies the Minister is talking about. The way section 5 has been handled is a reflection on the Department, on the way in which they analyse a problem and on the way in which they brief their Minister.  The information is totally inadequate and contradictory.  The reason for Irish Shipping being excluded is contradictory to the reason why three other semi-State bodies are included.  AnCO is excluded for a totally different reason. All of this is because of a possible assumed conflict of interest between membership of the European Parliament and membership of the board of a semi-State company.  That is making the assumption that one parliament is the same as the other.  The section is really very sloppy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the responsibility. I gave the information that first prompted this discussion.  There is a standard provision pertaining to 32 of the listed bodies on this schedule; there are different types of procedures in relation to six others, and three are not included as there is no provision in relation to Dáil and Seanad members at present. <Col N="1062" /> The on-going process of having a standard provision affecting all of these, is what has been taking place for the last ten or 15 years.  Even in relation to membership of the Dáil and the Seanad and membership of certain boards there are anomalies.  What we are trying to do in this legislation is to have a schedule which includes all of the boards that are or will be, as soon as the opportunity arises, affecting the Dáil and Seanad membership.  I do not see any real basis for the argument being put forward about why one is left out, or why it affects only certain members of certain boards.  We are talking about having a standardised provision that will pertain to every State or semi-State board affecting membership of the Dáil or Seanad or the European Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was the section and the schedule not drafted to include all semi-State and State bodies.  Some bodies are excluded for irrational, illogical reasons&mdash;Irish Shipping and AnCO for instance.  I accept that the Minister will include this provision, but having left the principle aside we are talking about the administrative competence of getting all the semi-State bodies listed into it, so that we will not have to go back again.  The Minister has left out two.  I have still to be convinced as to why Irish Shipping and AnCO, who at some time in the future will be brought into line with the other companies, are excluded, when three companies which are not in line at the moment, have been included.  The thing is just incompetent.</P>

      <P>To come back to the cases of Mr. T. J. Maher, and perhaps Mr. Seán Flanagan, did the Government put ex-Deputy Seán Flanagan on any board since he lost his seat in the Dáil two years ago?  Is the effect of this that neither Mr. Flanagan nor Mr. Maher will have any other salary from the Irish people outside their European one? Every other Irish MEP will draw a Dáil or Seanad salary.  Therefore, the effect of this legislation is that no matter how small the fees Mr. Maher receives from the State boards of which he is a member&mdash;I understand he is on B &amp; I <Col N="1063" /> and Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann&mdash;he will be deprived of them.</P>

      <P>Such action would not make any difference to the principle of the legislation.  The section will deprive Mr. Maher of the only salary he has outside any private income he may have. When the legislation in respect of each of these State companies comes before the Oireachtas the appropriate Minister could amend the relevant section so as to exclude Members of the European Parliament from being deprived of membership of the boards concerned. Three such Bills will be before the House tomorrow relating to three State companies, and the Minister will have an opportunity to amend them in the way I have suggested.  That would not make any difference to the principle of this legislation.  <i>Mea culpa</i>, I did not realise how important this section is until about half an hour ago when we came to discuss it.  The Minister now in the House should ask the appropriate Ministers, when legislation concerning State boards comes before the Oireachtas, to amend the relevant section which prohibits Oireachtas Members from serving on those boards in such a way that MEPs would not be included.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt, generally speaking, that the electors chose as Irish MEPs candidates whom <Col N="1064" /> they recognised as tough, experienced negotiators.  They chose such candidates because they felt they were the sort of people who could best represent Ireland in the European Parliament, people who could win for Ireland influence and finance.  Tomorrow we will be asked to discuss a Bill to extend the capital borrowing powers of B &amp; I to enable them to purchase more and expensive ships.</P>
      <P>Here we have an instance when one of our representatives in Europe is a serving member of B &amp; I, and whatever else the Minister may think about him, he will have to concede that he is a tough, experienced negotiator.  The provisions of this legislation will debar him from being a member of the B &amp; I board who urgently need additional capital.  It will debar the B &amp; I board from availing of his services to fight for additional finance from the European Investment Bank.  The same applies to all the other companies of which he is a member. This section is contrary to Ireland's best interests in the European context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion has unearthed the full implications of this provision, which is based on the principle of extending to MEPs the same constraints that apply to Members of the Oireachtas in relation to State boards. The two Parliaments are not the same and therefore the same constraints should not apply.  Deputy Boland has just illustrated graphically how we are cutting off our nose to spite our face.  It is obvious that those who drafted this legislation did not analyse the role of the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument that has been made in this respect is substantial and clear.  I do not want to press it, but I suggest that the Minister should drop section 5 and come back to it on Report Stage.  We will be sitting through until Friday and it would take less than an hour to complete this legislation.  We are not talking about a piece of legislation that will die in a couple of years; this is something quite different, because in the context of the Regional Fund, the Social Fund or the European Investment Bank, it is vital to have someone representing us who knows the detailed workings of a company. <Col N="1065" /> A person who has been serving on Irish companies set up by this House on behalf of the Irish people to promote Irish welfare is being deprived of exercising extra leverage in Europe on behalf of such companies.  It seems to be nonsensical. In any formula open to him, I suggest the Minister should withdraw this section and come back to us tomorrow when he will get the Report and Final Stages without delay.  To force section 5 now will be simply going down a path of which I do not think the Minister realises the full implications.</P>

I, and I suppose Deputy Quinn also, are trying genuinely to point out that there is danger for the country in this legislation and we are asking the Minister to look at it again. This is a genuine effort to improve legislation which is before the House on Committee Stage which is the least glamorous stage of any Bill.  Without any acrimony, I suggest that we suspend discussion on this until some time tomorrow and the Minister will have a chance to look at it again.  If at that stage he comes back and tells us that it is necessary, we promise that we will not keep him more than ten minutes for the rest of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not responding to the question of the totally different natures of the two Parliaments. Unless he defines what the conflict of interests will be in the European context the rest does not apply.  There is no <Col N="1068" /> justification for the legislation and all that we can assume is that it is slaphappy legislation lifted from one Parliament House to another.  While the Minister carries the democratic responsibility in the House that is a reflection on more people than himself.  I say that without personal acrimony towards him. That has been argued as well as I can argue it.</P>
      <P>Another point has arisen which requires legal interpretation.  Supposing Mr. Maher refused to resign from the membership or contested the termination of membership of one of the boards that we are talking about on the grounds that he was nominated and elected validly and that at the time he nominated himself for the European Parliament he had no knowledge that this was to happen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and could not have had knowledge, is there a case here in which this could be queried?  This is the road we are about to travel.  Lest the Minister did not take it up, we are suggesting that he might like to consult with the Attorney General on this.  We are talking about a piece of nonsense legislation. We have lost the battle on section 2, but let us not compound the nonsense. There is only a quarter of an hour on this entire legislation in this House as far as I, and I am sure Deputy Barry, are concerned.  The rest is proceeded with and there will be no amendments on Report Stage.  We want clarification on this.  Could the Minister, if necessary, come in with an amendment on Report Stage?  We have until Friday.  We have got this thing through.  The Taoiseach can now go back to the Council of Ministers and tell them that he has delivered on the squalid compromise that was cooked up in Bremen, that he has done his part of the deal and that it has been got through the lower House in the Irish Parliament.  This is a separate issue altogether.  We are talking about defending Ireland's interests in the European Assembly and that is separate from putting legal window-dressing on a political deal which was hatched out in Bremen prior to the direct elections.  I <Col N="1069" /> suggest respectfully that the full implication of this has not been picked up by either the Minister or the Department.  I suggest that the Minister go away and think about it for the night and, if needs be, come back in the morning.</P>

      <P>Irish Members of the European Parliament will not in any way be failing in their defence of Irish interests whether or not they be members of semi-State boards.  That issue does not arise, and that is the main argument being made.  The legislation before the House is the legislation produced, accepted and approved by the Government and put before the Dáil for its deliberations.  I cannot and will not change the section or drop it.  The matter has been discussed fully.  I do not accept the arguments made.  It is a matter for the Deputies to press it to a vote.</P>

I ask him in respect of each and every company named in the schedule to give us the reason why there would be a conflict of interest if a non-Member of the Oireachtas who is now a Member of the European Parliament were to be a member of any one of those.  It is for the Minister to tell us why there would be a conflict of interest, not for the House to tell him why he should not do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The position on the board belongs to somebody on the earth here.  In both the Sugar Company and the B &amp; I board the positions belong to somebody who has a contribution to make not in the European context but in the Irish context.  We are losing sight of that fact.  I am not saying that Mr. Maher is not a great man, but the position on the board in the case of the Sugar Company belongs to the Irish farmers and in the case of B &amp; I to Irish interests.  It is not a matter of a conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not arguing that. Perhaps Mr. Maher should not be on the board.  He is on the board.  He was a member of the board of B &amp; I when he nominated himself to stand for the European election.  He did not know at that stage that he could not remain a member of that board if he was elected to the European Parliament.  It may have made a difference.  It would mean that he went in there with one hand tied, not knowing that legislation was pending which would deprive him of his seat on the board if he was elected to the European Parliament.  He knew nothing about it.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that he put forward all the arguments. I know how all these things work. A memorandum goes to the Government and the Government decide that because a decision was taken in the Council of Ministers that must be translated into Irish legislation.  It was introduced to the Cabinet by the Minister for the Public Service, Deputy Colley, having been assured by the Minister of State, Deputy MacSharry, that the points were covered.  The legislation was drafted and was passed by the Government based on the assurance to the Minister.  I would guess that with all the problems the Government have had during the past six months very little time was devoted to the fine print of this legislation.  Even if ten weeks' solid time were given to this Bill it would not be enough.  It is our job to point out any defects we see and to have them corrected. Ministers of whatever party are too slow to take up points made by the Opposition on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> The Minister should justify the fact that a member of the board of Aer Lingus should not be a Member of the European Parliament and show that it is not of benefit to Aer Lingus to have him as a member of their board.  Otherwise the Minister should suspend this discussion and assure himself that the points raised here are not valid.  He should discuss the matter with the Minister for the Public Service and extract section 5 from the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle here is one of the possibility of conflict of interest between a person operating in a political and commercial capacity.  The same principle applies in relation to each of the boards mentioned here.  The provision applying to membership of this House will apply also to membership of the European Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will introduce a new argument.  Senator Brennan recognised that the lessons of these direct elections cannot be learnt because the next direct elections will be different and will probably be based on some variation of the national list system which is used in continental countries.  It is probable that fewer Deputies and Senators will be elected as a result of the change in the system, because the requirements of popularity will not apply in the list system.  People will be asked to vote for a particular party.  The possibility arises that political parties may put on the list specialists in certain areas who would have a technical contribution to make to the European Parliament.  By virtue of its committee system the European Parliament is complex and handles legislation in a detailed manner.  It is conceivable, if not probable, that the Labour Party could nominate the assistant general secretary of a trade union to be an MEP because of his specialist knowledge.  Frequently trade unionists are members of the boards of State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 now applies only to one individual but after the next election it <Col N="1072" /> could apply to far more people who might be members of State companies.  I cannot see why it should be included here.  There will be new legislation when the new system of election is introduced. There are so many loopholes contradictions and inadequacies in this legislation, the consequences of which will be to deprive this country and the public sector of additional allies in European institutions, that I cannot see the benefit. The Minister of State has been asked very reasonably to consider the points made during the evening and assure us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If Mr. Maher speaks in the European Parliament on transport or food processing issues he will be treated with great scepticism by his colleagues on the basis that he is speaking with a vested interest because of a company of which he is a director.  His view on budgetary matters will be clouded.  A single MEP will be influencing policy for a couple of semi-State companies when it is the duty of the Minister responsible for those organisations to speak for them at European level.  I cannot understand why Deputies opposite cannot see that Mr. Maher will be in a very awkward position.  One assumes that Mr. Maher will spend a lot of time in Europe and will miss many board meetings.  Surely it would be better to appoint a new board member.  I can see complications at European level if Mr. <Col N="1073" /> Maher should seek fiscal aid for either of the companies of which he is a director.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a point to which I referred earlier.  It is an insult to the Irish representatives from Northern Ireland to have a Long Title such as this to the Bill.  We have a Bill with a Long Title which is purporting to provide for the payment of allowances to the Irish representatives in the Assembly of the European Communities.  There are three representatives from Ireland in that Community, Messrs. Paisley, Taylor and Hume, who will not be covered under this Bill&mdash;fortunately for themselves. It is an insult not only to them but to the people who elected them for us to purport to enact a Bill here which will provide for payment to them.  I would like the Minister to consider the matter at a later stage and I will accept an assurance if he will take my point of view in principle.  It is utterly wrong that he should come to this House and ask us to accept a Long Title which does not cover all the Irish representatives in the <Col N="1077" /> Assembly of the European Communities. In that situation it would be fraudulent to a degree to let this Long Title stand.  Consequently, I ask the Minister to amend it accordingly.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> This amendment arises out of the Committee Stage discussion when Deputy Browne suggested it might be desirable, in laying down conditions for the issuing of a licence for the manufacture in this country of artificial contraceptives, that some stipulation be included regarding standards.  I undertook to consider that suggestion and it is as a result of that consideration that I have tabled this amendment, the effect of which would be the stipulating of conditions with regard to the issuing of manufacturing licences so that the conditions may include specifications as to the standards of manufacture.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the final stage of a protracted and rather fruitless discussion on this unhappy Bill.  I would emphasise once again that my party are opposed to the Bill being enacted.  Our opposition is on the basis first, that the Bill is unworkable, that it is unenforceable and, consequently, unacceptable.  For that reason we did not consider ourselves obliged even to consider the question of endeavouring to amend what was indefensible. On Second Stage I indicated why we considered the Bill to be unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We oppose the Bill also because it contravenes the ruling of the Supreme Court in the McGee judgment.  As it stands, by virtue of the three very minor <Col N="1079" /> amendments introduced by the Minister on Committee Stage, the Bill is in a similar position to the Bill as initiated, that is, it strikes at the root of the McGee judgment which was that a husband and wife are entitled to order their sexual affairs in private without let or hindrance from the State or from any person.</P>
    <P>It seems to us that the introduction of a doctor in a non-medical capacity to the decision-making process of a husband and wife in this regard renders the Bill, on the basis of the Supreme Court judgment, to be as much outside the Constitution as was found to be the provision of section 17 (3) of the 1975 Act.  Therefore, it seems to us that this Bill, even with its faulty premise, will not stand either the test of time or the test of the courts.</P>
    <P>It appears to be an extraordinary situation that after the lengthy discussions the Minister has told us so often he had with so many different bodies, he should seek to introduce a Bill that has at its kernel the transfer of the decision-making process from the Minister who is responsible to the surgeries of doctors throughout the country and when the Bill has as its kernel also the making of quasi-judicial decisions in non-medical matters.  This would appear to interfere totally with the clear decision of the Supreme Court that husbands and wives could between themselves in private decide how to regulate their families.  On that occasion Mr. Justice Walsh said that the right of a married couple to decide how many children, if any, they will have is a matter outside the reach of positive law where the means employed to implement any such decision do not impinge on the common good or endanger human life.  The court made the point also that the sexual life of a husband and wife is of necessity and by its nature an area of particular privacy, that if a husband and wife decide by means of artificial contraceptives to limit their families or to avoid having children, that is a matter particularly within the joint decision of both and one into which the State cannot intrude unless such intrusion can be justified by the exigencies of <Col N="1080" /> the common good.  I do not believe that it can be argued, nor has it been argued by the Minister during the debate, that it is in the interest of the common good that a doctor should be asked to make a decision as to whether a person seeking contraceptives intends them for use for <i>bona fide</i> family planning purposes; nor can it be argued that the doctor having issued the prescription or authorisation, that prescription or authorisation would then be conclusively taken to have been issued <i>bona fide</i> for family planning purposes for the purposes of this Act.  This places the doctor in a quasi-judicial role, having first placed him in the role of being the moral arbiter of the decision which the court specifically has said was a decision which should be taken by husband and wife.  It would appear that the Bill strikes at the kernel of the court's ruling.</P>
    <P>Another point on which we did not speak as extensively on Committee Stage as we might have is that the court in that ruling specifically said that the decision was a joint decision of the husband and wife.  In this Bill, the decision will be a joint decision of the doctor, acting in a non-medical capacity and whichever of the couple visits him.  Even taking it, as the Minister was inclined to do, on the restricted basis of the court's ruling in relation to married couples as such and the relationship between husband and wife and their right to make their decisions in private about their sexual affairs, the Bill stands contrary to that decision because now the decision is to be made by a doctor and either the husband or the wife.  On that basis, or on the basis that people might feel that this Bill was too liberal, they could challenge its content on the basis that the husband-and-wife common decision was being removed and assigned to the doctor and one or other of them.  On the other basis on which the court also appeared to indicate that persons have the right to order their own sexual affairs in private as long as they do not interfere with the common good, it appears that the Bill strikes at the heart of that decision and consequently stands as equally outside the Constitution as the 1935 Criminal Law (Amendment) Act which it sought to replace.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> The third reason why we are not prepared to agree to the passage of this Bill is because of the very invidious position in which it places our doctors and, to a lesser extent, our chemists.  Doctors will now be asked to make decisions about people's sexual affairs and in relation to matters of contraception in which doctors have no special training.  The Bill itself recognises that in a number of decisions which a doctor makes those decisions will not be made on medical grounds.  In section 4 (1) (b) (ii) the Bill clearly states:</P>
    <P>the person to whom the contraceptives are sold is named in a prescription or authorisation in writing for the contraceptives of a registered medical practitioner and is a person who, in the opinion of the practitioner formed at the time of the giving of the prescription or authorisation, sought the contraceptives for the purpose, <i>bona fide</i>, of family planning or for adequate medical reasons....</P>
    <P>The persons who framed this Bill recognised that in certain instances the prescribing <i>bona fide</i> for family planning purposes was a different thing from prescribing <i>bona fide</i> for adequate medical reasons.  It therefore cannot even be argued that the doctor has a special medical knowledge.  It is well known that there are very few doctors with training in the many different aspects of family planning which we have gone into in much detail in the course of the discussion on this Bill.  For that reason the doctor is being placed in an invidious position in relation to his patients, in relation to his conscience and in relation to how he conducts his medical practice.  We do not believe it is fair or equitable that the doctor should be placed in that position.  We also, do not believe, because of the failure either to define abortifacients or to set up any statutory body which would give a definition and a guidance as to what abortifacients are, that it is fair to ask doctors to prescribe or a chemist to dispense items which might be found, or could be challenged in the courts to be, abortifacient in their effect and consequently would place either the doctor or <Col N="1082" /> the pharmacist outside the law and, if a test case were brought, might hold them up to public odium and ridicule.  I do not believe that on any basis it can be argued that this is a fair manner of treating these two noble professions.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the House are aware that twice since 1979 the Irish Medical Association were asked to make a decision endorsing the provisions of this Bill and recommending to their members that they should participate in its administration. On each occasion, and especially on the second occasion, despite the considerable pressures brought upon them the Irish Medical Association refused to agree to recommend to their members that they participate in the exercising of the doctor's function in a non-medical capacity, as will be the case when this Bill becomes law, as it apparently will by weight of Government numbers.</P>
    <P>For all the reasons I outlined on Second Stage and again on Committee Stage, we are not prepared to agree to this Bill.  We felt it necessary, in particular, to fight against certain sections of it.  We voted against it on Second Stage.  We shall vote against it on completion of discussions at this Stage.  We believe that it is possibly the worst attempt yet made to mend the hand of the Oireachtas in relation to this matter.  On several occasions I have made a suggestion that the vexed question&mdash;and everyone must realise that it is a vexed question on which there are many differing opinions genuinely held&mdash;be discussed at an all-party Select Committee of the House or the Joint Houses of the Oireachtas.  That suggestion has been rejected. I have said, in relation to this Bill and to other matters coming before the House, that if this House continues to bury its head in the sand and to allow the decisions of tens of thousands of decent Irish men and women to pass it by, if this House continues to endeavour to believe that it still lives in the 1930s, then, with all the pressures of unemployment, social conditions, bad housing, the pressures of modern living, democracy is becoming all the poorer because this House has not mended its hand in the way it approaches legislation, in the way it approaches the issues of the day, in the <Col N="1083" /> way it approaches the need to change legislation.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that many young people of childbearing age have taken the decision in relation to this matter and do not believe that they stand outside their religion, or at odds with their God; as long as they do not, then I do not believe they are.  They will not accept, or respect, the decision of a Parliament which closes its eyes to what is happening in everyday life and the Oireachtas, the Government and democracy will lose respect.  The enactment of this legislation will contribute in one more way towards bringing Dáil Éireann &mdash;and on the passage of the Bill through the Seanad, the Oireachtas in general&mdash; further into disrepute in the minds of the people and especially in the minds of young people.  Unless we realise the type of population we have and the fact that decisions are being genuinely taken, and unless the Oireachtas can even belatedly at least keep up with what is actually happening outside the gates of this Parliament, then this Parliament may not still be here in two decades from now.  I do not believe that this legislation will be here within two years from now, because I do not accept that the courts will look in a benign fashion upon legislation as ill-conceived as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sorry piece of legislation and one which reflects little or no credit on the Government which introduced it and pushed it through the House, despite the obvious unease of many of its supporters over the long period of time we have been debating it, or on the Minister who has piloted it through, except perhaps in relation to the stamina with which, apart from a few irascible interjections, he has borne more abuse and more ridicule on a sustained basis than I can remember any Minister having to put up with justifiably in this House for some time.  One is almost tempted to think that if anybody had wanted to devise a Bill which would have done the political reputation of the Minister concerned more damage they could not have possibly chosen a better one than the one we are disposing of this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> The provisions of this Bill profess to bring about the development of an adequate family planning service in Ireland but those provisions seriously hinder the provision of such a service.  The provision of such a service would be far more likely to occur if this Bill had never seen the light of day and if the existing situation had continued.  It is odd that even at this point in time there is still apparently some confusion in the public mind about what the provisions of this Bill contain. According to one communication, which I received within the last hour, from a group of pharmacists&mdash;a very sincere but wrong-headed communication&mdash;the provisions of this Bill will make contraceptives freely available to any person of any age, male or female, married or unmarried, at the discretion of a registered medical practitioner.  That is not the situation.  Even if it were the situation, I doubt if the Government would stand over it.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are very clear.  They are mainly provisions which, masked by this rhetoric of family planning services, discriminate in very sharp, telling and painful ways between different members of our society whose needs in this area may be very acute. For example, the two main categories of people who will fall under the provisions of this Bill are those with medical cards and those without.  In relation to those with medical cards the Bill effectively discriminates between those to whom mechanical methods of contraception are suitable and those to whom they are not suitable.  It will give, courtesy of our national hypocrisy in relation to the pill, free contraception to those for whom mechanical methods of contraception are suitable and it will force those medical card holders for whom mechanical methods of contraception are not suitable either to go, out of whatever limited resources they have, for ordinary mechanical methods of contraception or to take risks, perhaps even fatal risks, to their health by either abandoning contraception completely or opting for the only form of contraception which is available to them free under the provisions of this Bill, as outlined to us by the Minister, that is, mechanical methods of contraception.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> Let us remember that for a married couple at the present time the qualifying limit for a medical card is not astronomically high.  There is a further serious discrimination for those of our citizens who are outside the ranks of medical card holders.  The Bill discriminates between those non-medical card holders who wish to obtain mechanical means of contraception in this country and people who want to obtain mechanical methods of contraception by post from abroad.  The latter right, which one had thought was established by the judgment of the Supreme Court, is abrogated by the provisions of this Bill.  Under the provisions of this Bill if anybody wants to import contraceptives from abroad who has not been given a licence from the Minister, he or she will be subject to a wide range of penalties.</P>
    <P>The Bill discriminates within the country among the people who are not entitled to medical cards, between people who may live in centres in which family planning services are available and those who may live in centres in which family planning services are not available.  The provisions for conscientious objection, to which one cannot object in principle, are when linked to the other provisions of the Bill quite capable of creating a situation in which effective access to mechanical methods of family planning will be denied to many people in rural and perhaps not so rural communities whose local pharmacists and/or doctors may have ethical objections to the provision of mechanical methods of contraception and who neither have the means nor the desire to travel to centres where such services may be available to them.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill discrimate even between family planning clinics. The Bill discriminates between family planning clinics that may in the future be able to afford to employ a pharmacist at a licensed fee cost to them of £6,000, £7,000, or £8,000 a year and those that cannot or will not.  I have very little doubt that the provisions of this Bill, as the Minister will have enacted here this evening, will be found as repellent by <Col N="1086" /> those clinics as they have been found on those benches.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill, as Deputy Boland has said, introduced the doctor into what is an intimate decision between two adult human beings.  It does so in the name of introducing professionalism into family planning.  I have said it in the House, and I say it again, that families are the people who are professionally involved in family planning.  Family planning can be a health matter but is not always a health matter.  The device seized on by the Minister in this Bill as a way out of his and the Government's dilemma is to regard as health matters all aspects of family planning, including most ludicrously those aspects which are not health matters and thereby making the medical and pharmaceutical professions the gatekeepers of the moral standards of tens of thousands of honest, sober, clean-living Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by reminding the House that this is not the last step.  The Minister, weary though he may be, has at least one more hurdle to surmount, that is the Seanad, where I understand he proposes to introduce this Bill in the near future if it is passed here.  That will be the last he will see of it if he is lucky to get it through that narrow gate.  It is a narrower gate than the gate which he has encountered here.  Even if he gets it through there and if he washes his hands of it, as surely as night follows day, the provisions of this Bill will be contested in the courts.  It may be scant consolation to the Minister if those aspects and provisions of the Bill to which he may be personally opposed but to which he is bound by Cabinet decision are eventually booted out unceremoniously by the courts.  I believe that will happen.  It is not a satisfactory method of legislating and, to some extent, it reflects on all of us in this House but it reflects primarily&mdash;and this must not be forgotten&mdash;on the Government and on the Minister who introduced it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to make clear in some detail on Second Stage and on Committee Stage my reasons for opposing the Bill.  Since the Minister has not seen fit to change any of the underlying <Col N="1087" /> important principles of the Bill or alter the Bill in any of its detail as a result of arguments put forward from these benches, clearly a repetition of the arguments would be futile and time-wasting.</P>
      <P>I believe now that the opposition will have to be carried on outside this House. The courts now appear to be the defenders and safeguarders of personal and individual liberties in our society, something that properly rests with the Oireachtas.  I simply state my continued opposition to the Bill for the reasons I tried to make clear.  I propose to vote against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey) Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies have indicated, we are now coming to the final stages of this long drawn-out debate on this Bill.  There is not much more left for me to say.  By now everything that could be put forward from different points of view has been put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland, with some exaggeration, seemed to suggest that the Bill is striking at the roots of our democracy. On the contrary, I feel that during the discussion in this House practically every possible segment of opinion in our community has been expressed.  They ranged from the rigid conservatism of Deputy O.J. Flanagan to the very liberal viewpoint of Deputy Browne, with many Deputies taking up different stances in the ground in between.  In that way the discussion has reflected very truly the conflicting opinions sincerely held throughout the community on this question.  The only semi-political comment I might make would be that the official attitude of Fine Gael has been quite ambivalent.  They have lacked the courage to oppose the Bill fully and they have sought refuge in this quite transparent device of an all-party committee. For our part we have fulfilled an election promise.  As part of our manifesto we undertook to legislate in this area.  We undertook to carry out wide-ranging consultations and on the basis of those consultations to try to arrive at a consensus and then to legislate.  In so far as this House is concerned, very shortly we will have legislated and I suggest that, in <Col N="1088" /> itself, that is an achievement.  The Coalition Government in their term of office failed to legislate and many other attempts made here to deal with this problem in some coherent legislative fashion have failed.  This Fianna Fáil Government are about to legislate.</P>
    <P>I have never sought to suggest that this Bill was ideal but I suggest it represents a sensible, mature, responsible solution to a complex problem in our society.  The elements of that complex situation are well-known to everyone and have been expressed repeatedly during the course of the discussions in this House.  On the one hand, there is the social need which has been expressed by many people to have access to artificial contraceptives.  It would be foolish to attempt to suggest that there is not a widespread demand from responsible married persons for reasonable access to artificial contraceptives and we must add to that the decision of the Supreme Court.  Whatever arguments there may be about what the Supreme Court decided, it certainly laid it down that married persons have a constitutional right to reasonable access to artificial contraceptives.  That is one element in the situation.</P>
    <P>The other factor is that there is very strong traditional opinion in this country that artificial contraceptives should not be made available to anybody.  That view was cogently and trenchantly expressed by Deputy Flanagan.  There are others who suggest that artificial contraceptives while not very desirable should be made available in a controlled way.  Again, there are others, and I do not think Deputy Browne would quarrel with me when I say that he appears to represent the view of those who believe that artificial contraceptives should be made available without any limit or hindrance.</P>
    <P>In devising this legislation I have sought to tread the middle ground.  I am faced with the necessity to make artificial contraceptives available to married persons or for family planning purposes. On the other hand, I do not and cannot accept the situation where artificial contraceptives would be made freely available to everybody without <Col N="1089" /> any limitation of any kind.  The system put forward in the legislation is one which anyone who studies this situation will eventually come round to adopting. If we want to have artificial contraceptives made available to married persons or for family planning purposes and if we do not want to have artificial contraceptives flooding the country without hindrance, there must be some system of control.  I suggest that the system of controlled availability which is enshrined in this Bill is as good as, if not better than, any system that any Deputy can put forward and no Deputy has put forward any alternative system.</P>

      <P>We have taken this matter out of the hands of the Minister for Justice in the administration of justice and brought it in to where it should be properly located, that is, as part of the health services.  I made that point several times and I can very readily envisage the howls of criticism which would have come from the Opposition benches if I had not brought the doctors, <Col N="1090" /> nurses and pharmacists into this area.  I would have been told that family planning was basically a medical and health matter and should be placed in the hands of doctors, nurses and pharmacists.  That criticism would have been made if I had done what the Coalition did and if I had dealt with it purely as a matter concerning the administration of justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the legislation introduced by the Coalition Government.  I freely accept that Deputy Corish made an attempt during the last months he was in office to bring this into the Department of Health but he did not succeed.  So far as the Coalition Government were concerned, the legislation was introduced by the Minister for Justice as a Justice matter.  However, that is history.  Because I have to sit here and take a great deal of criticism I wanted to make the point that this legislation was brought from the Department of Justice to the Department of Health and that it is envisaged that family planning will be part of our health services and will be placed firmly in the hands of the medical profession.</P>
      <P>I believe this is a sensible, middle-of-the-road type of solution to a serious and complex situation.  Having regard to the different elements of the situation I have outlined, no Deputy has put forward any viable alternative to the solutions in this legislation which I believe will stand up constitutionally.  If they do not, so be it.  We will have the satisfaction that we tried to legislate.  If our legislation fails constitutionally, that is another day's work.  At least we will have tried to put forward legislation which meets the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I claim to be better informed on this subject than any other Deputy because of the trouble I have gone to, because I have discussed this subject with so many people and I have done a great deal of research.  I firmly believe that what is in this legislation is acceptable to the overwhelming majority of responsible <Col N="1091" /> people in our community and a number of Deputies have admitted that.  Some of them have deplored that fact, but the majority of ordinary men and women, sensible, mature, responsible people accept this legislation as reasonably satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I want to be more than just defensive about this legislation.  Whatever Deputies may think about the particular arrangements I am putting forward here, and they have been very critical of them, many of them in favour of it have not spoken because they did not feel it was necessary to do so.  Anybody listening to the debate might think there was nothing but criticism in this House but I believe this Bill has almost unaminous support throughout the House.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the Bill will be the basis for the institution of a comprehensive national family planning service. Deputies may think the Bill is too restrictive to enable me to achieve that objective but I do not think so.  Whether the family planning service which we are going to inaugurate will meet everybody's demands and wishes is another question.  When this legislation is passed, I intend as part of our health services, to provide family planning services for the general public.  The structure of services which will provide advice, help, consultation, assistance, guidance, sympathy and understanding will become available to married couples in the future to enable them to plan their families.  This is one of the big lacks in our health services at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> The primary purpose of this legislation is to enable that to happen.  This is a statutory basis for the provision of a family planning service for the population as a whole.  For those fairly considerable segments of the population who do not wish to have access to artificial contraceptives as part of their family planning, I hope we will be able to provide a comprehensive natural family planning service.  In addition we are asking the general practitioners throughout the country to turn their minds to family planning and to be able to provide for their patients a good, sound advisory family planning service.  All Deputies will agree that this is necessary.</P>
    <P>Quite a lot of criticism was expressed in the course of the discussion that there is not sufficient expertise available in the medical profession and that there is not a sufficient number of our medical people trained in the provision of family planning services.  There is probably a great deal of merit in that criticism but that is something we will have to provide.  In co-operation with the medical organisations we will have to try to ensure that the entire body of general medical practitioners will be in a position to afford advice, guidance and help to married couples in the planning of their families.  So I believe that in putting this legislation through the Oireachtas we will have made a contribution to improving our health services in this very important respect.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Certificates of Reasonable Value.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>On 15 May a number of questions were put down to the Minister for the Environment on the question of certificates of reasonable value and, although some of them were different in nature, they were all taken together.  Arising out of the Minister's reply to those questions many people were extremely concerned about what, in the most charitable terms, can only be described as replies that were grossly misleading.  I am pleased to have been given this opportunity to raise this matter so that the Minister can reconsider the replies he gave on the first occasion.  My question related to the practice of a building firm asking would-be purchasers to sign to the effect that they were aware that the building firm in question would not be applying for certificates of reasonable value for the houses with the result that the would-be purchasers would not be entitled to the famous £1,000 grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain documents accompanied my question and the words &ldquo;details supplied&rdquo; were included with the question on the Order Paper.  However, on more than one occasion on that day the Minister chose to ignore any of those details and, instead of dealing with the issue of the question, he said repeatedly that he did not have any idea of what I was speaking about.  His exact words were: &ldquo;I have no knowledge of what the Deputy is talking about&rdquo; and later he stated, &ldquo;I do not have any knowledge of it&rdquo;.  The Minister also stated that he had no knowledge from the Department of what I was referring to.  Many of us were surprised at that reply.  We understood that the questions were difficult for the Minister for a variety of reasons but, nevertheless, his blanket denial that he <Col N="1095" /> was even remotely aware of any detail of the essence of the questions when he had been supplied with adequate details mystified many of us.  I wonder if the Minister was misinformed.</P>
    <P>After studying the Official Report of the debate on those questions I am convinced that the Minister did not do his homework and genuinely was not aware of what he was talking about at the time or else&mdash;I hope I am wrong in this&mdash;told the House a deliberate falsehood.  I am not aware that the Minister did the latter but that is what it looks like from the evidence staring us straight in the face.  It is my hope that the Minister will be in a position to refute that suggestion but I believe it will take some doing.  I brought this matter to the Minister's attention but I should like the Minister to tell the House if the Taoiseach, some weeks prior to my question, had also drawn this matter to his attention.  Is the Minister aware that there is in existence a letter from the Taoiseach's office to a constituent of mine thanking him for supplying the Taoiseach with the details relating to the case of certificates of reasonable value and stating that the Taoiseach had drawn this matter to the Minister's attention.  That letter is in existence and it makes all the more mysterious&mdash;to use a very charitable word&mdash;the Minister's denial that he had any knowledge of what I was referring to on 15 May.</P>
    <P>If the Minister did not have any knowledge, then it only speaks of the grossest incompetence or a deliberate mischievous falsehood.  A certificate of reasonable value attaches to the purchase of new houses.  Unfortunately, it is voluntary in the sense that the builder does not have to apply for it. However, it was the will of the previous Government and is the will of this Government that the scheme of CRV's would be honoured by all reputable building firms.  The Minister is on record asking the building industry to see to it that CRV's were applied for in all cases. In other words, it would be something which would have a bad odour about it if a builder did not apply for such a certificate.</P>
    <P>Following the Minister's denial of <Col N="1096" /> having any knowledge of a matter that was drawn to his attention on two occasions&mdash;once by his political boss&mdash;I lifted the stone and discovered a number of things under it which made me very unhappy.  It does not give me any great pleasure to raise this matter but it is my duty to do so.  I would be doing a disservice to the House if I did not put the facts as I know them on record.  I have photocopies of letters from a building company called Abbey Homesteads Limited&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not make charges or allegations against an outside firm who have no possibility of defending themselves within the House.  He can make his case without naming firms or people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  I have not made any charges against the company as yet and I shall not do so specifically against the company.  I have letters from that company.  There is nothing essentially illegal or improper about these letters.  All they do is ask would-be purchasers to sign to the effect that particular houses are going to be built and that there will not be applications made for certificates of reasonable value.  People are asked to sign that they are aware of this and that therefore they will be foregoing the Government-sponsored, Government-initiated £1,000 grant.  I want to ask the Minister if his repeated denials in this House, despite very massive evidence that he must have known more than he said in the House about the issue, have anything to do with the fact that there are very strong connections between this building firm and members of his own party.  I do not wish to name anybody who is not here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now making allegations that he should not make.  Allegations should not be made against people who have no opportunity of defending themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am saying is that there are members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party who are involved in the board of this particular company <Col N="1097" /> which is flying in the face of repeated Government admonitions and in the face of Government policy which has been spelled out time and again by the Minister opposite.  How can the Minister and the Government expect the average builder to apply for CRVs when the Minister has within his own party people who daily adopt that particular practice? Further, does the Minister now admit that he had extensive knowledge of the circumstances here prior to 15 May and that he had ample opportunity to have that knowledge but that instead he took refuge in a bland statement that he &ldquo;had no knowledge of what the Deputy is talking about&rdquo;.  So far as I am concerned, unless the Minister takes this opportunity of apologising to the House for a statement that was not only misleading but totally untrue&mdash;there are other options he could consider&mdash;I shall be saying that this is nothing better than a cover up for people with strong political affiliations to his own party.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us the facts of the case and explain how on that occasion he was able to reply as he did despite the fact that the Taoiseach had on 15 March replied to my client in a letter which said &ldquo;I have drawn it to the Minister's attention&rdquo;.  This was in answer to a letter which my client had written to the Taoiseach on 6 March, considerably before 15 May.  The question was tabled long prior to 15 May giving more than ample opportunity for full investigation and assessment of all the relevant facts. Nevertheless the Minister here blandly and dogmatically insisted that he &ldquo;had no knowledge&rdquo; in replying to questions specifically on this issue put by both myself and other Deputies including Deputy Harte, who were likewise astonished.  They could not understand it, as they had never before witnessed a situation where a question which had in parentheses &ldquo;details supplied&rdquo; could be answered by saying: &ldquo;I have no knowledge of what the Deputy is speaking about.&rdquo;  Those two statements do not jell.  They could never be complementary to each other and they hint at something that should be put frankly and fully before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, is the Minister now willing to <Col N="1098" /> try to introduce into the ranks of his own party the standards he demands to be applied by private builders outside? Does he recognise that the example which should start at home, so to speak, will not be followed by people outside if they do not see the Minister honestly making the necessary effort?  I know he does make an effort in regard to the whole housing sector but in this particular case it was so distorted and misleading, so grossly and widely wrong in the way the Minister answered here that one could, under certain circumstances be forced to ask the Minister to accept that the standard he adopted in his replies on that day would lead in the normal course to his resignation in any other Parliament.  Did the Minister tell a lie?  If he did not tell a lie how was it possible to reply as he did when on at least two occasions, once by his own Taoiseach, he had been given sufficient details to be able adequately to answer the question put to him?  Instead, he first took refuge in lumping a number of questions together.  The record will show that I objected to them being taken together because there was no connection between them, three being of an extremely general nature and one from me relating to a specific case related to a backbencher of his own party who is involved in this building firm.  The Minister lumped all the questions together and in my view hoped to get away with it on the day.  Does the Minister not now agree that that sort of standard, if I properly and correctly interpret what happened on that occasion, does a disservice to this House and to the standards of his own party or any decent, reputable party and should be denounced by any right-thinking person? If we have no other standards here, whatever the faults and failings of the House, let us at least tell the truth.  On that particular occasion I suggest the truth was not told but was buried under a concoction, a front, under a cover-up for the most shoddy and devious purposes. I hope the Minister has a very full answer to this.</P>
    <P>It is extremely lamentable that a Minister who is known to be doing his best in so many areas was repeatedly as far as I am concerned&mdash;I do not want to <Col N="1099" /> keep on saying that a man is telling lies but certainly telling&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is completely out of order even to suggest that any Member of the House is telling lies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the Parliamentary substitute is for the word &ldquo;lie&rdquo; I am saying the Minister was guilty of it on that day in the absence of any adequate denial.  He has had ample opportunity since.  I tried to raise this matter on a number of occasions.  I am quite happy that there was no collusion by anybody else involved in the fact that the matter has not been raised so far; that is the normal course of events, but the Minister must have known from my expression of concern on that day, from my repeated attempts to raise it last week and this morning that I was extremely concerned about it and he could, if so minded, have used the opportunity but he has not done so.  I can only reasonably conclude therefore&mdash;the debate does not allow me a bite of the cherry after the Minister has spoken, quite rightly perhaps&mdash;that the Minister intends to put the bravest possible face on it, keep his head down and hope it will be all right.  At this stage, on the evidence I have, as far as I am concerned, it can only be considered to be corruption and that I despise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made some wild accusations as he often does.  First, I want to emphasise that the CRV introduced in 1973 by the previous Fianna Fáil Government is not and never has been mandatory on all builders of houses.  The purpose of the CRV is to keep some brake on house prices and to date it has succeeded in doing that to quite a significant extent.  In regard to making it mandatory in the case of people who will avail of loans from the loan agencies, I have ensured this will happen under the new Housing Bill which has been introduced and which we shall possibly be debating tomorrow so as to get the Bill through and give it the necessary teeth to ensure that it is used with fullest effect in order to exercise some control <Col N="1100" /> over house prices.  Those prices have been the subject of much criticism here by many Deputies including Deputy Keating.  I am taking the matter seriously and ensuring that it will be mandatory in the case of all houses for people who avail of loans, grants and so on under the new Housing Bill which I expect to be through in a matter of days, hopefully.</P>
      <P>In the matter Deputy Keating has raised as regards&mdash;call it what you like&mdash;misleading information given by me, he is quite incorrect, because since it is not mandatory nobody can be accused of evading or avoiding applying for CRVs.  If it is not mandatory it is impossible to evade it.  That is the logic of it in my opinion.  On that occasion Deputy Keating asked if I was aware that members of my own Oireachtas Party were deliberately avoiding applying for CRVs and that, as a result, purchasers of those houses were subject to major financial losses.  I said that I had no knowledge of what the Deputy was speaking about and I stand over my statement.  What was mentioned was a particular housing scheme or development. Names were not mentioned.  Even if he had mentioned company names I could not be expected to know the chairmen or directors of the companies. In no way will I attempt to try to keep up-to-date with what happens at the AGM of any company.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has made wild accusations about individuals and companies. For the Deputy's information, that company were not trying to avoid applying at that time.  I answered the question on 15 May.  On 24 May an application was made to my Department for CRVs for that housing scheme.  That application has been processed in the usual way and further information has been sought in relation to this matter.  In fairness to whoever was responsible for building the scheme, it seems to me that their intention was to apply because they applied on 24 May.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The airport security force at Shannon Airport was, until its transfer to Aer Rianta, part of my Department.  A number of the members of the force had Army service and expected that the whole of this service would be made pensionable as a result of negotiations then <Col N="963" /> current under the civil service conciliation and arbitration scheme.  In the event, the airport security force was transferred to Aer Rianta before the negotiations on the reckonability of Army service for superannuation purposes had concluded.</P>
    <P>On transfer to Aer Rianta the members of the airport security force joined the Irish Airlines superannuation scheme.  It was agreed that in the event of full Army service being made reckonable for superannuation purposes these improvements would also apply to members of the airport security force. Following the agreement reached under the civil service conciliation and arbitration scheme Army service is now, subject to certain conditions, reckonable for superannuation purposes.  The terms of this agreement are being applied in full to the members of the airport security force, and the extra costs involved must be met by my Department.  The cost of such additional service is determined by the actuary to the superannuation scheme.  The actuary's report has not yet been received but when it is arrangements will be made to pay the improved benefits as quickly as possible.</P>
