      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) if he will state the practice observed by the Government Information Service in regard to issuing more than one Minister's script in respect of the same occasion; and (b) whether the practice has any regard to the question whether a Minister has any official responsibility, either original or delegated, for the area of activity within which such occasion belongs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach describe the nature of the official duty which led, on the occasion I have in mind, to Deputy MacSharry, Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service, being present and issuing a script at the official opening of an industrial estate in Sligo, which is his constituency, on 5 October 1978?  What was his official duty there?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that, when the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy is also appearing at the same function and has also wasted a day of an official's time in writing a speech, that is enough without Deputy MacSharry being present and issuing a script as well? In view of the country's problems, would the Taoiseach not agree that these Ministers have enough to do without tripping over each other, slapping backs, at openings and closings?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the stated policy intentions of certain member Governments to revise the Community agricultural policy in a manner which would have serious economic implications for our economy? Would he agree that if there is this growing lessening of support for the CAP in its present form it would be to our national advantage over the period of our Presidency to seek to meet constructively some changes that may be pressed upon us later?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply and the fact that he has stated that they are working to advance our interests at present, is he aware, despite the fact that he is President of the Council of Ministers and the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Gibbons, is President of the Council of Agricultural Ministers, that cattle and milk prices are collapsing and that the regional fund has been reduced by £200 million?  Is that working in the interests of Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of the supplementary question was whether the Taoiseach would accept that certain member states now have very grave recently-expressed reservations about the continuation of the CAP in its present <Col N="957" /> form, and whether our period of Presidency should have been used to the national advantage in meeting constructively the sought for changes.  Since there is a ceiling of 1 per cent on VAT revenue there is no possibility of reaching it.  This increases the pressure for changing the CAP, and the Taoiseach's earlier commitment to preserving the CAP will not be possible to maintain in these circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I should like to ask whether it is in order for the Ceann Comhairle, when not ruling the reply out of order, to interrupt on two successive occasions before the Taoiseach had a chance to reply?  This seems to lead to great disorder rather than order.  I feel that, when the Chair wishes to rule a question out of order, he should do so; but to interrupt when it is not out or order is unhelpful.</P>

      <P>I suggest that order is best preserved if the Ceann Comhairle rules out of order what is out of order and allows questions that are in order to <Col N="958" /> be answered.  Other procedures do create confusion in the House.</P>

      <P>Statistics are not maintained in a form that would allow of the remaining information sought by the Deputy being readily obtained.  However, examination of a random sample of applications met in 1978, including applications accorded priority, showed that 26 per cent of them were met within three months, 51 per cent within six months, and 76 per cent within 12 months.  The remaining 24 per cent of applications were made over varying periods in excess of 12 months before service was provided.</P>

I am not denying that this does not merit a reduction, but if we reduced the rate in this case we would have to pass it on to other sectors of the postal business.  It is very difficult to pick out this particular aspect and say that we should not also apply the reduction to the numerous organisations from whom we receive applications for a reduction in the postal rate.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Questions Nos. 17, 18 and 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, I regret, heavy delays to calls at Ballivor, Longwood and Summerhill. All three exchanges are affected by a shortage of trunk circuits to Dublin and there have been problems recently with the maintenance of the existing circuits to Dublin in some instances.  Additional circuits to Longwood were provided recently but more are needed at all three exchanges.  These, regrettably, <Col N="974" /> cannot be supplied until additional equipment is installed at Dublin about the middle of next year.  Special maintenance attention will be given to the exchanges and to the circuits serving the three centres with a view to ensuring the best possible service to subscribers. Every effort will be made to improve the service otherwise also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the Summerhill area there are seven lines and not one in three have been in operation at any one time?  The Minister will agree that there is no reason for allowing this.  Is he aware that in these three areas there is quite substantial industrial employment which is being jeopardised because services are not operating properly?  Promising something for next year is like saying, &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;. There is no evidence that the service will be improved within the next 12 months and I fear that many people will be out of work because of the inactivity of the Department.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the standard of service in Donegal and in some other western counties has been unsatisfactory. Several schemes designed to improve substantially the service in these <Col N="976" /> areas are, however, in progress and at the advanced planning stage.  For example, Letterkenny exchange was converted to automatic working on 24 October. It is planned to convert progressively 44 other manual exchanges in County Donegal to automatic working over the period to the end of 1981 and conversion of the remaining 22 exchanges in the county will follow over a period of about two years afterwards.</P>
    <P>Work on the provision of a new key trunk exchange at Sligo is also in progress and the exchange is expected to be available in 1982.  A new microwave link between Dublin and Sligo and Letterkenny is also being installed at present and should be ready for service in mid-1980. When the link is in service the capacity of the existing co-axial cable between Dublin and Sligo will be increased from 960 to 2,700 circuits.  The provision of the link and the increased capacity of the co-axial cable to Sligo will not only lead to a much better trunk service in normal course but will also enable satisfactory communication to be maintained should either the co-axial cable or the microwave link be out of order for any reason.  These three schemes will raise substantially the standard of service in the north-west generally.  In addition, 20 other schemes to improve the trunk service in County Donegal are also in progress or planned.</P>
    <P>There are many other improvement schemes in progress and planned in the north-west and west but the few examples I have given will serve to show what is being done to raise the standard of service in these areas.  The Deputy is, I am sure, aware that the Government have approved an accelerated telephone development programme costing £650 million to provide a high quality of telephone service nationally over a period of about five years.  Action to implement this programme is already being taken and it will be pressed forward in every way possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the agreement by the EEC Council of Ministers last June on agricultural prices for the current year, the subsidy which island milk producers receive on their skim milk used for animal feeding was increased by about 1 p per gallon in July.  This subsidy was again slightly increased as a result of the Green £ adjustment earlier this month and at over 17p per gallon is now about 7.5 per cent higher than the preJuly rate.  This level of aid is similar to that paid to mainland creameries in respect of skim milk taken back by their suppliers for animal feeding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the co-responsibility levy in fact the same thing as far as the producer is concerned except that it is a penalty rather than an inducement? I am seeking an inducement for the small man rather than penalising the big man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain areas of the country and certain farmers are excluded from the co-responsibility levy <Col N="986" /> which is now at 0.5 per cent.  It is no possible within the European Community to determine prices nationally and if I understand the Deputy correctly that is what he is looking for.  I think that he is looking for the introduction of a two-tier price system and this is no possible under Community law at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by way of the penalty clause.  The net effect, I submit is the same except that in the case of two-tier or differential weighting in favour of the smaller farmer, it is not discriminate in that the suggestion would be and is that it would be the first number of thousands of gallons that would get the higher price and without penalising those who produce the higher number of gallons.  In fact, what I suggest is much more acceptable within Community rules than what is being done at the moment. The £180 million cut which is now proposed by the budget committee will bring about certain things that we will not like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is mistakenly trying to equate the exaction by the Community of a co-responsibility levy which is a variable one and may well be varied upwards, and the introduction of a tiered price system of payment for milk.  This is not possible. The exaction of a levy has a specific purpose&mdash;to restrain over-production of milk.  It is just as unpalatable to the Irish Government as it is to a great many others but there is a very real oversupply situation in the Community and the sooner people face up to that the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not fact that the over-supply through the larger output of larger producers is where the problem <Col N="987" /> arises and that the penalisation by way of the co-responsibility levy is only the beginning, that the £180 million cut proposed on milk this year will hit the entire industry if it is not restored?  I am suggesting a way in which we can have the best of both worlds rather than the worst.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow the Deputy's reasoning.  I understand him to be advocating the extension of the co-responsibility levy in order to procure a situation where the bigger producers are penalised for being big.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1, in the name of Deputy Enright, has been ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  Notice shall also be served by the applicant on the Secretary of the local authority in whose area the person proposes to engage in the occasional trading, on the same day as the application for an occasional trading permit is made to the Minister, and such notice shall contain the same information as that forwarded to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(c)  An occasional trading permit shall not be granted by the Minister until he has received a recommendation as to the safety of <Col N="1012" /> the premises to which the application relates from the Chief Fire Officer of the relevant local authority.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My reason for proposing this amendment is that notice should be served on the secretary of the local authority by the person applying for a permit.  In regard to (b) the local authority should have some notice regarding such occasional trading taking place in some hotel, hall, rooms, or some other establishment. There may be a number of very valid reasons why this notice would be served.  The local authority may wish to have certain checks carried out in regard to whether or not the premises are suitable for occasional trading, whether or not the building is adequate for the purpose, whether or not it is safe for the purpose, or whether it will be satisfactory for occasional trading on that particular occasion.  The reason for specifying that the notice be served on the local authority on the same day as it is served on the Minister is that it will give the local authority an opportunity to carry out a check during the period of 30 days.</P>
    <P>In regard to (c), the local authority should have an opportunity of checking out the suitability of the premises in regard to fire prevention and control. The chief fire officer, in this particular instance, should have had at least a 30-day period to call to the premises to ensure the safety of the premises where the sale is taking place.  A fire officer should be in a position to recommend the number of fire extinguishers to be made available on such occasions.  It is important that a sufficient number of extinguishers are left convenient to the area where the sale is taking place.  The fire officer should also ensure that there are proper entrances and exits and a fire escape.  It is the duty of the fire officer to see to it that windows are not barred.</P>
    <P>It is essential that fire officers see to it that the precautions I have mentioned are taken because on the occasions of such sales a lot of highly inflammable material is displayed, such as furniture and clothing.  Unless there is a provision <Col N="1013" /> in the Bill to ensure that the precautions I have spoken of are taken, there is a danger that such matters may become a minor part of the regulations with the result that they will not be strictly adhered to.  To leave such precautions out of the Bill and make them part of the permit would be underestimating the importance of this matter.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, when they receive notice of such a sale, should ensure that the premises are inspected by the fire officer before issuing a certificate which will form part of the permit to be issued by the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Enright's concern that those engaged in occasional trading do not operate in breach of the Planning Acts or other legislation relating to other Departments or local authorities.  However, as I pointed out on Committee Stage, my Department are primarily concerned with regulating occasional trading and ensuring that consumers are protected.  The matters which the Deputy raised are the concern of the Department of the Environment and local authorities who, in the last analysis, are responsible to the Department of the Environment for the regulations.  I am not satisfied that my Department should become involved. My Department do not impose the restrictions suggested by the Deputy on established traders and occasional traders should not be subject to stiffer legislation in this area than established traders.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to officials of local authorities inspecting premises being used for occasional trading and imposing restrictions.  I do not have any objection to the Department of the Environment insisting that local authorities carry out fire inspections.  I appreciate that the Deputy is concerned that adequate fire safety precautions are taken where occasional trading is carried on and large numbers are likely to gather.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 28, after &ldquo;permit&rdquo; to insert: &ldquo;and every occasional trading permit shall include a condition that the applicant shall have a comprehensive fire insurance policy in respect of the premises or place to which the application relates, covering the period of the permit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is essential that a comprehensive fire insurance policy is taken out in respect of the premises where occasional trading takes place.  In the event of such trading taking place in an hotel the ordinary hotel insurance would probably cover those attending the event and it would be a matter for an injured party to decide whether to sue the proprietor of the hotel or the person whose negligence caused the fire, the person holding the sale. However, I am concerned about such events taking place in local community halls, because insurance policies in respect of such premises may not be in force.  It is important to stress that the type of material offered for sale is highly inflammable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned already the necessary safety precautions.  There should be included in the Bill a detailed clause placing an obligation on people to provide adequate fire insurance on the premises where they are holding the sale, covering the period of the permit, in order to safeguard people who may be injured. <Col N="1015" /> Most of such sales are of considerable size and the cost of the provision of an adequate fire insurance policy would not be such as to prevent a person going ahead with a sale.  It is necessary to ensure that such people are obliged to provide adequate fire insurance cover in respect of anybody who might be injured on the premises.</P>
    <P>If we take the example of a public dancehall the courts are now quite strict in specifying that fire insurance cover be provided when functions take place there.  These sales are such that they will be attended by large numbers of people. In the event of a fire in a hall, or wherever the sale is being run, it is essential that there be provision for people injured&mdash;or, even more seriously, if there is loss of life&mdash;to have redress and to have somebody from whom damages can be claimed.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes that a condition be attached to a trading permit requiring a fully comprehensive fire insurance policy on the premises that an occasional trader wishes to lease for the period of trading. As in the case of the last amendment, my Department do not require established traders to have a particular fire insurance policy.  Established traders are almost as likely to be uninsured or very often under-insured.  Very often they find out to their loss after a fire has taken place that they have been very much under-insured.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not purport to do more than impose fair and reasonable restraints on occasional traders.  Of course, we must bear in mind at all times that they have certain constitutional rights.  While the Bill imposes additional obligations on occasional traders it does not absolve them from any of their commitments or obligations, whether they be under the Planning Acts or any other Act with which established traders must comply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Enright rightly said, it is in the interests of a person who leases a premises, whether it be a dancehall, community hall, a room in a ballroom, or indeed <Col N="1016" /> a shop premises to ensure that if he himself has not adequate insurance cover he insists that the only circumstances in which he will lease the premises is if the prospective lessee takes out a fully comprehensive fire insurance policy.  That would probably take care of the Deputy's argument that we should be the people to ensure that such is included in the permit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not very likely that all business premises in the country today have insurance cover whereas this instance is entirely different, in that they would be there for a period of days only? That is the difference.</P>

      <P>The onus should be on the lessor of the premises&mdash;whether it be a hotel owner, dancehall proprietor or chairman of a parish council, in the event of the leasing of a local community hall&mdash;to ensure that if he has not adequate insurance cover himself he would insist that one of the conditions of the lease to the relevant lessee would be that he has adequate fire insurance cover.  As the Deputy rightly said, if somebody is injured, or if there is loss of life on the premises, then the injured person, or next-of-kin in the event of death, would have the right to sue the owner of the premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 39 and 40 to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  An applicant for an occasional trading permit shall be required to obtain a bond of not less than £5,000 from a licensed assurance company, for the protection of consumers purchasing goods or property at the premises to which the permit relates&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for moving this amendment is that, since this Bill was introduced in the House, I have received a number of representations from people who attend <Col N="1017" /> sales or auctions and who have bought property, items of furniture and so on, from people engaged in occasional trading.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, the vast majority of occasional traders are honest, respectable people engaged in commerce, going about their business in a legal and lawful manner. However, there are always people who will avail of a situation and who will cut corners.  It has been brought to my attention that people have purchased property or goods from occasional traders who had not in fact proper ownership of the property or goods concerned at the time of sale, that they had been stolen previously, items of which they had taken possession through different channels and so on.  I might add that this is the exception rather than the rule.  But we must endeavour to ensure that even exceptions are prevented, if possible, and that people who are caught out in such circumstances are protected and have some remedy or redress available to them.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the amount of money which changes hands and the extent of the transactions that take place at some of these auctions or sales is quite considerable&mdash;amounting perhaps to £10,000 or more.  I want to ensure that people have some redress available to them if they purchase property which they discover to be seriously substandard or to have glaring defects of which they were not aware at the time of purchase and had no way of knowing.  The injured party in such circumstances should have some remedy available to him, somebody against whom he can claim, some way of collecting if he obtains a decree.  Very likely the Minister will reply that there is no such obligation incumbent on ordinary business people.  But if the Minister gives me that type of reply she is missing the point, in that the position is that, when a person makes a purchase from an ordinary trader, an established trader, the purchaser knows the person with whom he is dealing, and that if anything goes wrong he will get satisfaction from him.  If he is dealing with a <Col N="1018" /> supermarket or a big company he will feel happy in the knowledge that, as the company have issued share capital, he can proceed against them.</P>
    <P>Purchasers have often been fooled because merchandise was of an inferior standard and was not suitable for the purpose for which it was intended.  The occasional trader gets a permit and trades in an area for a day or two.  If the purchaser gets his name and address from the permit, he can get in touch with the Department to make his complaint. The only satisfaction he will get from the Department will be that that trader will not get another licence.  While it may be some consolation to know that nobody else will be caught, it will not be of any benefit to the man who spent £400, £500 or even more and who cannot obtain any redress, because the trader may not have any means.  This situation should be looked at.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that when £10,000 changes hands in a few days such a trader could not be regarded as not having any means.  Such a person could be very short of money when the complaint is made.  The consumer is entitled to know that, if he purchases at these sales, he has some protection.  As has been plainly seen in the light of the controversy which has arisen because of this Bill, there are two points of view.</P>
    <P>The only way we can be sure the consumer is protected is to ensure that a bond of £5,000 from an assurance company is provided.  That is not an excessive amount and the premium would not be so high as to drive any person involved in occasional trading out of business, but it would be a great safeguard for purchasers.  In its own way it may also be of benefit to people involved in occasional trading, because at the moment there is dissatisfaction among the public and, if this bond is provided, purchasers will realise they are dealing with reputable people.</P>
    <P>My main reason for putting down this amendment was to ensure that people who buy from occasional traders will have some redress if the goods are substandard. If we do not provide this <Col N="1019" /> protection people may be faced with losses of hundreds of pounds.  There is an obligation on us to ensure that this does not happen.  If the Minister has an alternative system to safeguard the consumers, and which would achieve the aim in any amendment, I will be very happy.  As I said, I do not think the sum of £5,000 is excessive and I recommend it to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Deputy Enright was right when he said that my first reaction would be &ldquo;Here we go again.  We are going to place obligations on occasional traders that established traders do not have&rdquo;.  It is true to say that because of their mobility it is not as easy to get at occasional traders as it is at established traders.  I want to make a point already made by Deputy Enright: that the name and address of the occasional trader must be attached to the permit and available for consumers to see.  Therefore, if something goes wrong with the goods purchased, the customer will know who to go after.  The Deputy is unfair to my Department when he says that the customer will get a standard reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Even by foreseeing it I think the Deputy is being unfair.  The matter would be followed through by the Department, in particular by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  If a person buys goods and something goes wrong with them and he feels he has no redress, we have to get after the person whose name and address is given on the permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many consumers will agree with me when I say that where people have purchased goods in the past, and maybe in the very recent past, from traders they thought were reputable or established, and when something went wrong they were not treated with the courtesy or the redress to which they were entitled.  That <Col N="1020" /> is why it was so important to bring in some type of consumer protection legislation to cover them.  I feel very strongly about that.  As I said, in the past a minority of established traders have not fulfilled their obligations or stood by consumers when they should.  We all agree that the vast majority of established and genuine traders have stood by their consumers and that is why their businesses have increased.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the time has come when we should require a bond from all traders, whether established or occasional, but I do not think that should be done under this Bill.  I shall have to find out whether or not that can be done on examination. It would be a matter for other legislation and should not be considered under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say concerning the application of the bond to traders apart from occasional traders.  I saw reference in a newspaper yesterday to a singling out of this group for what was regarded as harsh treatment.  I do not know if the Minister was referring to this when she mentioned application of the bond across the board.  The bond would be a great help because of the complexity of the appliance sold through this channel where the consumer has no comeback and the bird has flown if he discovers that the product is not up to a standard.  In putting down the amendment Deputy Enright had this in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The excuse given by the Minister of State that it should not be applied to one section of traders only is rather lame.  If she feels in the future that this type of bond might be made applicable to all traders, so be it.  We are dealing with occasional traders of a certain kind and this is the place for this kind of protection. We are talking about consumer protection basically.  It is a more positive approach from what the Bill might be seen to be.  The view that it is meeting out fairly harsh treatment to a certain group of traders is a negative approach and I do not agree with it.  We must ensure that consumers are protected as <Col N="1021" /> much as possible and that is basically what the Bill is about.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why this amendment cannot be accepted by the Minister as a gesture towards the protection of consumers. The type of trader we are dealing with deals in a variety of goods many of which are complex and in the high technology field, electrical goods and television sets.  The average person does not know what he is buying.  He is depending on the good name of the trader and unless he has some comeback he can be treated badly by some traders. I know there are some people in the trade who are making an honest living but from the consumers' point of view and if we are to be consistent and seek protection for the consumer this is one way to do it. As the Minister has said, it could be applied to all traders.  Under a Bill which will later come before the House consumers will have a comeback on traders from whom they purchased goods which in their opinion are inferior. Under this Bill the consumer dealing with that kind of trader will not have the same protection.  For that reason this amendment is not out of place.  This is the Bill in which it can be included more appropriately than in any other kind of Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the reasons given by the Minister are valid.  I accept her reluctance to accept an amendment from this side of the House.  It is traditional in the House unfortunately, but for the sake of the consumer this is where this amendment should be put in.  I appeal to the Minister to review her attitude towards it.  It would be a step in the right direction if the Minister is considering that it should apply to all traders.  This will be the first step in that direction and this is the Bill under which it should be done.</P>

      <P>I am sure many Members like myself have received reports <Col N="1022" /> about people who purchased property and have suffered seriously in regard to moneys they parted with.  No later than yesterday I was discussing this with a person who has incurred a substantial loss from purchasing property which was unsatisfactory and of very poor quality.  He learned to his cost that the bargain he thought he was obtaining was no bargain at all.</P>
      <P>Many of the people engaged in occasional trading are making profits of thousands of pounds each year.  It is difficult for the State to obtain tax and other revenue from them.  We now have an opportunity of safeguarding people who are purchasing from them.  Such people are entitled to protection.  I took this amendment from the Auctioneers and House Agents Act, 1947.  I changed it around to suit this occasion.  One of the reasons the Minister gave for refusing this amendment was that at times people are hard done-by by ordinary business people.  No matter what walk of life one enters there will be people who will be difficult to deal with.  We must ensure that the consumer is protected.  The cost of providing the protection would be minimal.  The bond would have a premium of about £100 per year.  The insurance companies would make their own investigation and would have to be satisfied as to the reputation of the people they are dealing with, their honesty and integrity.  In its own way it would ensure the protection of both seller and customer.  For that reason I feel that it is a simple amendment and would ask the Minister to agree to it.</P>

All three were primarily <Col N="1025" /> concerned with ensuring that certain implied rights could not be excluded by a seller where goods or services were supplied or provided to a consumer.  The reason for the change in terminology in this Bill is that the expression &ldquo;deal as consumer&rdquo; lends itself more suitably to general use, even as in Part IV, when we are dealing with contracts for the supply of services.

On the other hand, a person who buys to restock his shop and with the intention of reselling almost immediately is dealing in the course of a business.

    </Speaker>
    <P>One frequently meets officers of organisations, incorporated and otherwise, who claim they have no knowledge whatsoever of a particular <Col N="1029" /> contract and this is often advanced very strongly as a defence in litigation.  Frequently bodies facing grave prospects of litigation enter into voluntary liquidation and endeavour to evade prosecution or have it mitigated on that basis.  We know this situation is competently covered under section 6 but the Director of Consumer Affairs in the memorandum which will emanate from the Department should strongly stress the collective liability of a large number of persons who may face prosecution.  In many cases a number of innocent parties on the contract side are caught.  It is a sweeping provision, the implications of which may not yet have dawned on the public.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister given any consideration to the fact that it might be desirable to provide for a period longer than 12 months?  In some circumstances an offence may come to light eight or nine months after the contract has been entered into and invariably there ensues a period of <Col N="1031" /> correspondence which may last two or three months.  When it becomes apparent that a remedy is not likely to be achieved, the Minister and the consumer are constrained to proceed and the period of 12 months seems to be inordinately short.  Has the Minister any second thoughts on this matter?  She might consider not spancelling the prosecutory process unduly and extending it to 18 months.</P>
      <P>Warranties and guarantees are generally for periods of up to 12 months and if somebody discovers he has been conned the period of time to get the bureaucratic machinery moving may extend longer than 12 months.  Perhaps the Minister on Report Stage might consider extending the restrictive period of 12 months.</P>

Indictment proceedings can be taken at any time but if the Deputy feels strongly about the matter I will look at it between now and Report Stage to see if there are genuine reasons why the period should be extended.  While we are trying to protect consumers to the greatest extent possible, it is important that we do not place more severe restraints than are absolutely necessary on manufacturers or on retailers.

      <P>In page 7, lines 12 and 13, to delete &ldquo;and not known to the buyer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The recast version of section 12 of the 1893 Act which appears in the Bill is the same as that introduced by section 1 of the UK Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act, 1973, expect that the words &ldquo;or known&rdquo; after &ldquo;disclosed&rdquo; in section 1 of the latter were not included in our Bill.  The effect of this omission is that there will now be an absolute obligation on the seller to disclose any charge or encumbrance that there may be on the title to goods which he is passing, that is, he cannot now claim that the buyer knew about the charge and that there was no need for the seller to disclose it. However, in subsection (2) (a) which deals with the passing of a limited title to goods the corresponding change was not carried through in the Bill.  Therefore, it is considered that the words &ldquo;and not known to the buyer&rdquo; should be deleted from subsection (2) (a) also to strengthen the buyer's position in this case.  In other words, we are putting the obligation on the seller.</P>

      <P>In page 7, after line 44, to add a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Where a seller or manufacturer advertises goods and a consumer purchases those goods having read the advertisement by the seller or manufacturer, the advertisement shall constitute a sale by description&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is self-explanatory. This section already deals with sale by description and we are seeking to enlarge the scope of the provision by putting forward this amendment.  It is a reasonable amendment.  I regret the Minister has not had much opportunity to consider it.  We feel that the connotation of the word &ldquo;description&rdquo; is unduly loose.  The use of the term &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; as a supporting reference in that section would strengthen it greatly and would be of considerable benefit to consumers generally.  I do not know what reaction there may be from manufacturers. The section would ensure that the greatest of care would be given in the placing of advertisements and in the descriptions in the advertisements.  I should like to hear the views of the Minister.</P>

      <P>The general feeling on our side is that, if the Minister between now and Report Stage could perhaps introduce the word &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; into the section, we would be very pleased and relieved.  &ldquo;Advertisement&rdquo; in the public mind and legal acceptance of the use of the term is fairly clearcut, perhaps more so than the term &ldquo;description&rdquo;, which could be surrounded with all sorts of connotations.  Perhaps the Minister, between now and the Report Stage, would look at the drafting on our part.  If the Minister were to introduce the phrase &ldquo;Where there is a contract for the sale of goods by description or advertisement...&rdquo; that would strengthen the section.  Descriptions may be oral or written but I think that &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; would in the public mind and in most court cases be accepted as meaning precisely what it is intended to mean.</P>

This seems rather harsh at first glance, but since this Bill is fundamentally intended to improve the basic rights of consumers we feel there is some merit in an amendment of that type being considered by the Minister&mdash;if necessary on Report Stage.

      <P>This is different from the previous amendment in that the Deputy seeks to extend the ambit of the Bill to product liability which has nothing to do with contract law <i>per se.</i>  As the Deputy knows, an EEC directive on product liability is being discussed at present.  It would be undesirable to pre-empt consideration of this directive at EEC level.  Of course, when a decision is reached on the directive we shall be party to it and we shall have to comply with it.  Therefore, it would be better to leave this matter of product liability until that directive comes along.  The amendment only begins the story of product liability. When the directive and any developments arising from it are at a more advanced stage we shall have to consider all the implications for our own laws here.</P>

      <P>The biggest problem here today is that there is planned obsolescence. Goods are being manufactured so fast that models are changed and spare parts are not available.  I have had numerous requests about this which I have brought to the attention of the Department.  Manufacturers are not supplying parts for goods.  When a consumer goes back to see about spare parts, or replacement parts, he is told that the model is out of date, sometimes within two years, which is a reprehensible practice.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (3), line 34, after &ldquo;sale&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;at second hand&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> This amendment will have the effect of confining the certificate requirement of section 13 (3) of the Bill to the sale of secondhand cars.  The Society of the Irish Motor Industry have strongly opposed the application of this provision to the sale of new cars in representations that they have made on the Bill.  Not only have they made these representations to me but I am sure they made similar representations to all Deputies. Furthermore, at the society's instigation, a substantial amount of representations were made to Deputies and the Department. The argument of the SIMI can be summarised as follows: (1) they consider that there is already more than a reasonable amount of official documentation involved in the sale and registration of a new vehicle; (2) they point to the issuing of a manufacturer's warranty on the sale of a new vehicle and maintain that this practice provides adequate protection for an aggrieved buyer and (3) they state that if the dealer had to issue a certificate as envisaged in the published Bill it would place an undue burden on him.  The argument here is that dealers would not feel sufficiently confident to issue such an all-embracing certificate, in respect of the new cars they handle, short of conducting an extensive and impracticable survey of each car they sell.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, those arguments are strengthened by the fact that the report of the National Consumer Advisory Council recommends that the warranty of fitness be provided in relation to &ldquo;all used mechanically propelled vehicles&rdquo;. The origin of this recommendation is a scheme operated in Canada under the Ontario Highway Code which was apparently viewed with substantial approval by the NCAC.  The merits of these points have been assessed in some depth at departmental level and it is felt, in addition to the basic points made by the SIMI, that this subsection should be amended as outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is going some way to meet my <Col N="1042" /> point.  The SIMI have been in touch with most Deputies about this section, one of the objectives of which is to reduce the number of unsafe vehicles on our roads. The SIMI are anxious that specific road tests be made in regard to the safety of vehicles.  They want a proper vehicle-testing scheme introduced.  It is their view that the section places too much of an obligation on them.  The Minister's amendment may not go far enough.  Is it the intention of the Minister to meet representatives of the motor trade to outline in detail the regulations she has in mind?</P>

      <P>Prior to the Minister's amendment the section was more in the interests of the consumer.  I am aware that the Minister is bowing to motor industry interests in introducing the amendment and, perhaps, it may pose problems and serious difficulties for dealers.  However, with the massproduction of cars, it is important that a certificate in writing to the effect that a car, new or otherwise, is in perfect mechanical order be given to the purchaser.  Lots of new cars are what are called &ldquo;lemons&rdquo;&mdash; they are defective.  It should be possible to have a road test on a new car and a dealer should be in a position to give a certificate to the effect that a vehicle is devoid of any defect which would render it a danger to the public.  I am aware of an incident where a man was given a new car without oil in the engine.  I accept that the section as originally drafted would pose problems for the motor trade, but the trade should be able to cope with them.  It is a <Col N="1043" /> retrograde step to amend the section.  I recognise the Minister's problem in the fact that the motor trade put up a good case to the effect that such a certificate would be unnecessary in the case of new cars, but the section was better before the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A new car carries a manufacturer's warranty and, if something goes wrong, safetywise, with the vehicle, a consumer has a right to fall back on the warranty.  Deputy Enright suggested the setting up of road-testing procedures to ensure that all vehicles are free of any defects that would render them a danger to the public&mdash;something which I would be in favour of&mdash;but that cannot be done by my Department; it is a matter for the Department of the Environment. I do not think that we can afford to wait for that situation to arise, because it may take time.  It was for that reason that I decided to go ahead with my own provisions.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell appreciates that there was great concern in the motor industry to ensure that we did not put those involved in the industry out of business.  It was in order to relieve some of their problems, and at the same time provide adequate covering, that I introduced this amendment.  In the case of a new car a manufacturer's warranty is available.  The NCAC, who investigated this matter, advised the Minister that this should only apply to used vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The SIMI are in a much stronger position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the manufacturer than the consumer.  The motor industry can apply pressure on manufacturers more than consumers.  If I had a warranty or guarantee card I would tear it up because it deprives me of my normal rights under common law. I always advise consumers to do that. When one discovers a defect in a car one gets in touch with the manufacturer through the dealer, but one is left without a car for a long time.  The dealer could co-operate a lot more with the consumer against the manufacturer.  The SIMI and its members are in a much stronger position to apply pressure on the manufacturers <Col N="1044" /> than is the consumer.  That is why I feel they are taking a wrong approach. They would be acting much more in the public interest were they to co-operate in the operation of this section without this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the gravest of reservations about the amendment proposed by the Minister.  Indeed, the whole purport of the section is now, one might say, dramatically halved.  The only strengthening of the section of which I would have been in favour&mdash;rather than having the amendment proposed by the Minister whereby it is proposed to have a certificate of condition applicable to secondhand cars&mdash;would be the inclusion of a definition specifying that it should apply to every sale of a new or secondhand car so that people would know exactly where they stood.  Such is possible for the Minister because she is taking unto herself here the right to prescribe the form of certificate. Therefore, it should be possible for the Minister&mdash;in relation to a new motor vehicle, or a new motorcycle, which is also covered here&mdash;to devise a certificate for new motor vehicles less onerous than the one which must be provided on the sale of a secondhand car.  There is no difficulty in having two forms of certificate.</P>
      <P>I totally share Deputy O'Connell's view&mdash;and certainly judging from the number of complaints I have received over the past ten years as a Member of this House&mdash;new motor cars can be as dicey as a good, so-called secondhand car.  Indeed, Deputy O'Connell spoke about a new motor car being delivered without motor oil.  I have heard of cases of new motor cars being delivered where the wheels fall off as the consumer drove his first 100 miles.  Furthermore, I totally agree with Deputy O'Connell that any consumer foolish enough to sign a manufacturer's warranty deserves a zero mark on the Bunny Carr Show, or something like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for this section.  I have had the strongest representations from the Society of the Irish Motor Industry. Indeed the society in their comments to me make all sorts of references to the <Col N="1045" /> number of rogue dealers in the Dublin area, when they enclosed extracts from the recent excellent series of articles in <i>The Irish Times</i> on the purchase of used cars.  That particular series pointed out that the used car market is littered with dealers who are a law unto themselves.  I share the concern of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry about the rogue dealers who operate outside the ambit of their society and, very frequently also, the ambit of the law.  But their concern has been used by the society to try and gain an exemption for all motor dealers, an exemption I would not favour.  I would point out that we in the Republic of Ireland are one of the costliest purchasers of motor vehicles, new or used.  In France, Germany or indeed in the United Kingdom one can buy a secondhand car at a vastly cheaper cost whereas the purchase here of a new motor vehicle, or secondhand car, will amount to several thousand pounds. If that blows up in one's face or is totally defective, that can literally destroy a person's livelihood.  Quite apart from perhaps costing them their life, that motor vehicle can cause very considerable financial stress to any one family.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge the Minister to have a second thought on this.  I know the political pressures are there for us to amend section 13.  I am not in favour of it.  The Spring 1979 Information Bulletin published by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry carried an article entitled &ldquo;SIMI to oppose Consumer Bill&rdquo;&mdash;not a very illuminating caption&mdash;in which it reported the President of the Society as saying:</P>
    <P>We have great reason to fear that if section 13 is passed in its present form it will have an effect contrary to the intentions of the legislators.</P>
    <P>Our intentions are very simple: to give fundamental protection to persons who buy either a new or secondhand car. That is all.  Section 13 is strong.  Were I in the Minister's shoes I would strengthen it further&mdash;in the portion the Minister purports to amend&mdash;by the addition <Col N="1046" /> of the phrase: &ldquo;in the case of every sale of either a new or secondhand motor vehicle&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I would strongly urge the Minister to have another look at this section and perhaps introduce a double variation in the regulations.  One can have a fairly broad, general certificate for the consumer in relation to a new car, and that is all that would be needed.  Those of us fortunate enough to be in a position to buy a new car, and they are becoming increasingly rare citizens&mdash;I have never bought a new car in my life; I shall make no further comment on that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is far better to buy a good secondhand car, provided one knows something about cars, when one can get a far better deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore I urge the Minister to vary her intention here, to have another look at the amendment, because I know there are very considerable political pressures being brought to bear in relation to the section.  I know there are rogue operators in all parts of the country who work wonders, who flog cars at inflated prices that literally cause people to lose their lives.  They can be caught effectively under this section.  For example the Minister could respond to the views of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry&mdash;they <Col N="1047" /> maintain that people have to have business premises and that therefore anybody with business premises will be caught&mdash;by amending the section to say &ldquo;anybody purporting to sell either a new or secondhand car, whether or not it is their principal business, or whether or not it is sold from a private home&rdquo;.  Perhaps I might quote from one of those excellent <i>Irish Times</i> articles, a piece of good, investigative journalism by Peter Murtagh in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Tuesday, September 11, 1979 when he referred in one paragraph to:</P>
    <P>In one recent issue of an evening newspaper the same phone number occurred 21 times throughout the columns.  The placer had no less than 30 cars for sale from the roadside in Kenilworth Square.  Another person was selling six cars from his mother's house in Ranelagh.  In these cases, however, at least the seller could be found again which is not always the case.</P>
    <P>You may call to a house to buy a car and find the seller in the car outside the house waiting for you.  It is not his house at all.  A number called may be in a pub or phone booth and the seller will meet you in town or at your house.  In each case you have no comeback whatsoever, and if you find yourself with a tarted up wreck, forget it.</P>
    <P>These practices are quite common and yet cannot be stopped.  You might also find yourself buying a hire-company car which has been registered in the name of a secretary with a company.  Before you get it this car will have been driven up and down the country by any number of people. &ldquo;One lady owner,&rdquo; says the ad.</P>
    <P>This is commonplace.  It is amazing that people will hand out £700 or £1,000 for a secondhand car.  Recently I met a young teacher who had taken up her first job at the other side of Dublin.  She spent £700 of her parents' money to buy a secondhand car.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>She learnt her lesson, I hope.</P>

    <Col N="1048" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>She found herself with £700 worth of rubbish and was in danger of killing herself each time she went to work.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the section be left as it is.  If a person wants to buy a car he signs a hire purchase agreement.  Most people do not even read those agreements nor do they inquire about their true rate of interest.  People buying cars are appallingly neglectful about these things.  People also sign the general contract of sale.  If they have to have a certificate signed or initialled by the salesman, it will take him precisely half a second to initial or sign the certificate, which was collected from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  I do not think this will cause the Society of the Irish Motor Industry any wakeful nights nor will dealer members of the society find themselves in court.  In their representations to me they said that the Bill would have a very serious impact on reputable dealers who would be discouraged from handling used cars which are more than two or three years old and which are not in prime condition in case they subsequently should find themselves facing a criminal prosecution, with all its attendant adverse publicity.  If any dealer, who purports to sell a car which is three years old, says it is in prime condition, he is covered by the amendment. That is desirable and necessary but the same should apply to a new car.</P>
      <P>The motor manufacturers, on balance, will not object to this.  They have 70 years of writing warranties and 70 years of international legal expertise in excluding from any one of their warranties any prospect of a person getting at them if he finds his new car dividing in two as he goes over a humped-back bridge. There is no difficulty facing dealers in this situation.  The Minister should leave the Bill as originally drafted and strengthen it by the inclusion of &ldquo;secondhand cars&rdquo;.</P>

This is a <Col N="1049" /> complex legal document and it is very important that when it leaves this House, it will be the best legislation to protect consumers we can have.  Having listened to Deputy Desmond's arguments in favour of leaving the section as it originally was, I am prepared at this stage to withdraw the amendment and to consider, between now and Report Stage, the possibility of having a two-fold form of certificate&mdash;one certificate for secondhand cars and another for new cars.  In my view, the industry would be quite prepared to accept that.</P>
      <P>In bringing in the amendment we were trying to meet the situation which had been represented to us by the industry&mdash;that it would pose very serious difficulties for the people involved in the motor industry.  Bringing in the two-fold form of certificate would possibly alleviate the situation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (3), line 36, after &ldquo;certificate in writing&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in such form as the Minister may by regulations prescribe&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section provides in subsection (3) that a certificate in writing be provided to buyers of motor vehicles to the effect that the vehicle is at the time of delivery free from any defect which would render it a danger to the public, including persons travelling in the vehicle.  It further provides in subsection (5) that the Minister may by regulation prescribe further matters to be included in such certificates.</P>
      <P>The Society of the Irish Motor Industry in their submission on the Bill sought to have an amendment made which would ensure that the Minister should, by order, lay down certain reasonable minimum standards because they maintained that the question of whether a car was free from defect would otherwise be a subjective one for the garage concerned, and that regulation by order was essential also to ensure a specific implementation date for the provision of such certificates.</P>
      <P>As the section stands the Minister could only prescribe that information additional to the basic certification of freedom from defect be given and the power is, in any event, an optional one. The section is in its present form because it was considered that it would be undesirable that the Minister should be called upon to lay down the basic engineering standards called for in this certificate.  However, it is now agreed that subsection (5) is superfluous because it is difficult to envisage further matters which the Minister might require beyond those ensuring freedom from safety defects which subsection (3) already requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed, therefore, to amend section 13 (3) to provide that a written <Col N="1051" /> certificate would be given to the buyer &ldquo;in such form as the Minister may by regulations prescribe&rdquo;.  This should meet the argument put forward and ensure a uniform standard of certificate which would be to the benefit of the consumer. This would be a good thing and in fact we discussed it on the earlier Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the certificate that would be provided under regulation, I take the point that it will encourage people to deal with honest, reputable motor firms and help them to move away from dealers such as those Deputy Desmond referred to in relation to telephone advertisements in Kenilworth Square and other traders he read out from the article.</P>
      <P>The difficulty I see is that the Minister is dealing with vehicles that would be a danger to the public.  Is that all-embracing and does it cover the situation fully?  How long will these regulations that will be prescribed run for?  I see the necessity for the regulations but different people will buy secondhand motorcars. One person could buy one and look after it.  The car would be perfectly roadworthy in 12 months' time.  Another person could buy the same motorcar and through pure carelessness and blackguardism on their part they could damage the vehicle in a much faster space of time.  I should like to see the purchaser of a car protected but I would not like to see it over-extended so that the protection would run indefinitely.  It should be specifically covered for a period.  I hope that the Minister understands what I am getting at.</P>
      <P>The length of time for which it would run is all important.  We must protect the person who buys the car but this must be reasonable so that he could not have an action against the proprietor of a garage in nine or 18 months' time.  There should be a specific period.  A person buying a car probably has it inspected and it is then roadworthy for a period.  We should stipulate a certain period so that the protection will not run indefinitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment to section 13 is badly needed.  I am glad the <Col N="1052" /> Minister has withdrawn subsection (5) which she deems superfluous as a result of accepting the amendment.  Subsection (5), now withdrawn, stated that the Minister may by regulations prescribe further matters to be included in a certificate to be given.  That was very sloppy in that nothing had been prescribed and there was mention of further matters being included.  It was no harm to withdraw it.</P>
      <P>I endorse what Deputy Enright said concerning the danger to the public element in the Bill.  One could have a vehicle which would be totally useless to the consumer and far from being a danger to the public.  For example, the car may travel at five miles an hour or less or perhaps not at all.  It would not be a danger to the public.  I presume that would be covered by coming under the purpose for which it was meant.  I should like to know if this might be interpreted in a narrow sense.  If so, we run the risk of the dealer getting away on this technicality.</P>
      <P>If one confines the demand for the issuing of the certificate to a trader, one is letting out another category of salesman who cannot be defined as a trader but who is still selling cars.  I refer to the private person who sells one, two or three cars per week, per month, or per year, who is in other employment and merely does this as a nixer.  The danger is&mdash;the motor trade industry have been very honest about this to me and I am sure to the Minister and others interested&mdash;while the vast majority of these traders are honest dealers there are members, despite the control of the SIMI and other agencies, who, because they will not be in a position to stand over the certificate, may offload the vehicle on to the private market and have somebody on the side not registered as a trader who could dispose of the vehicle without issuing a certificate of roadworthiness.  This is a regular fear on the part of traders. The vast majority of them would not do that but there are some who would bring the whole trade into disrepute by their action.  Could this loophole be closed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulty of the Minister.  It would be difficult to implement <Col N="1053" /> if it were extended to private sales. In the light of the danger and the risk involved in offloading these cars by certain traders, we should make an effort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on the ideas in the section and on her general approach to it.  The Minister is endeavouring to ensure that there are fewer dangerous vehicles on the road.  To achieve this end the Minister is trying to make those involved in the motor trade share the responsibility by providing certificates with new and secondhand cars. It is essential that the Department work in conjunction with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry in the setting up of some type of vehicle inspection scheme. The only way to reduce the number of dangerous vehicles on the road is to carry out regular inspection tests.  The number of accidents caused by dangerous vehicles is highlighted daily in the media.  A number of Government Departments have already advised the public of the necessity of regular servicing and testing of vehicles.  The Minister should make every effort to include in the Bill a provision which would ensure that adequate road and vehicle tests are carried out.  We have the resources to ensure that road tests are made.  Occasional <Col N="1054" /> checks have been made in some of our towns.  The number of dangerous vehicles on our roads is nothing short of alarming.  The Minister and her Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, on whom the main responsibility for the Bill rests, should endeavour to ensure that safety tests are carried out on vehicles in order to reduce the number of accidents.</P>
      <P>The number of honest motor traders is high.  The Society of the Irish Motor Industry are as anxious as we are to ensure that there are fewer dangerous vehicles on the road.  Reputable garage owners service cars as well as selling them.  They also sell petrol and oil.  There is the danger that people may try to sell defective cars to dealers who do not provide the same service as garage owners.  If a reputable garage owner refuses to buy a defective vehicle, the owner of the vehicle may try to sell it to a less reputable dealer, a person who deals in cars as a sideline.  As it stands, the section makes no provision for those who are on the fringe of the trade.  To make the Bill effective the Minister should include those who are on the fringe of the trade and who deal in secondhand cars in order to safeguard the people who deal with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the section as a whole.  It seems that in section 13 (2) this is an implied condition and it deals with public safety more than with consumer protection and is subject to very narrow legal interpretation.</P>
      <P>In section 13 (3) there is a grave flaw in that there is an omission; there is no offence if an incorrect certificate is issued, so far as I can see.  I would suggest that the Minister of State would apply her mind to the content of this certificate as she has done in section 16 concerning the conditions of a warranty. The minimum content of a certificate should be spelled out when drawing up certificates both for secondhand cars and for new cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the last points made by Deputy O'Toole.  In subsection (4) the last line <Col N="1055" /> deals with those points: it provides that the seller shall be guilty of an offence if he issues an incorrect certificate.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Toole will remember when we debated the famous Consumer Information Bill.  We had a long drawn out discussion on whether private sales should be included.  Houses were talked about at that stage, if I remember correctly. At the time we felt they should not be included.</P>
      <P>The point was made by Deputies O'Toole and Enright that very often one can get a person who does not have a business premises as such but who is in fact engaged in the motor trade.  The example given was someone dealing in cars who gave the same telephone number for several vehicles in newspaper advertisements or somebody who sells three or four cars every now and then and makes a profit.  These would of course be included in the Bill because if a person is engaged in the business of selling cars, whether he is a teacher or a civil servant or, indeed, a politician, he would have to be covered in the Bill if it were proved that he was selling more than just his own car.  If he is buying a car and holding on to it for a week and then selling it and making a profit on it, then he is involved in the business of selling cars, regardless of whether or not he has a permanent business premises.  That reasonably covers the points made.</P>
      <P>The second point is the one which Deputy Enright and I discussed earlier, the question of setting up a facility for testing road worthiness here.  I said I was totally in favour of that being done and I represented that fact to the Department of the Environment and the Minister for the Environment on numerous occasions. It is very essential that this be covered in legislation but, as Deputy Enright and I agreed it is not a matter for this Department; it is a matter for the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Toole made the point about what should be included in the certificate which would deal specifically with road safety precautions to ensure that a vehicle would be safe to have on the road.  I would say that the requirements on the certificate would be matters which we should not specify in the Bill.  I think it would be dangerous to state that a certificate would include (a), (b) and (c) and then find that when we go into the business of having these certificates issued that (d), (e) and (f) should be in it as well.  It is better to leave it and, after consultation with the Department of the Environment and interested parties, then the specifications that would be required should be made.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> This section establishes the joint and several liability of a finance house where the finance house pays the price of the goods to the seller and this amount is in turn repaid by the buyer to the finance house.  The purpose of section 14 is to remove any doubts which may militate against an effective redress for the buyer where a pre-existing agreement or an arrangement operates as between a particular seller and a particular finance house.</P>
    <P>Representations were made by the Joint Credit Card Company Limited to the effect that in their opinion credit card companies would be caught by section 14 as it stood.  The Department explained to them that such companies were not intended to come within the ambit of this section.  In order to ensure absolutely that credit card transactions are not covered by section 14 it was felt that the section should be amended.  The insertion of the words &ldquo;in relation to the sale&rdquo; will clarify that section 14 relates to a specific agreement and so cannot cover credit cards because a buyer does not enter into a separate agreement with the finance house on each occasion he buys by credit cards.  It is an ongoing procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister happy that this section covers the situation sufficiently? Let us take the example of people who purchase property, whether it is combine harvesters, motor cars, televisions and so on.  They go to one of the credit houses and obtain money to proceed with the transaction.  Does the Minister consider it necessary or desirable that such companies should carry out some inspection of the goods? I appreciate the difficulties which would arise and the feeling of the finance companies that this would curtail their business.  I have come across numerous transactions involving people who have bought defective goods and who have been stuck with hire purchase agreements. The contract is between the buyer and the hire purchase company and the vendor manages to escape responsibility. A man wishing to buy a machine may go <Col N="1058" /> to a finance company for the money and the vendor steps out of the picture.</P>

Any action in such a case would involve the purchaser, the hire purchase company and the vendor and the unfortunate purchaser would be faced with such difficulties that he might decide to cut his losses and take no further action.  Is the Minister satisfied that finance houses take sufficient care to ensure that the item purchased is not defective?  They may have more expertise than the consumer in checking such matters.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 10, lines 1 to 3, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and shall&rdquo; in line 1 to the end of the section and substitute &ldquo;and the finance house and the seller shall, jointly and severally, be answerable to the buyer for breach of the contract of sale and for any misrepresentations made by the seller with respect to the goods.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Submissions from several groups raised the point that the phrase &ldquo;for fulfilment of the contract&rdquo; could give rise to problems.  First, it was argued that it might be capable of narrow construction and thereby enable a finance house to avoid liability for a breach of contract. Secondly, it was said there was a basic injustice in requiring the finance house to <Col N="1059" /> provide specific performance of a contract in regard to merchandise which it had never owned or seen.  The Irish Finance Houses Association maintained in their submission that, should the Minister insist on retaining section 14, it should contain some of the provisions of the United Kingdom Consumer Credit Act, 1974, one of which is that claims can only be for breach of contract or misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>The finance house is not at present liable under common law for misrepresentations made to the buyer with respect to the goods.  However, section 14 will make it statutorily liable in this respect.  This amendment, therefore, can be said to be streamlining section 14 in so far as it makes the section more specific and eliminates any possibility of ambiguity.  Furthermore, it strengthens the section by extending the liability of the finance house to misrepresentation. The amended section, therefore, can be viewed as a better provision from the consumer's point of view.  This section statutorily reiterates the liability of the seller to the buyer for breach of contract, which is already confirmed by the Sale of Goods Act, 1893.  It also gives statutory recognition to the existing answerability of the seller to the buyer for misrepresentations under common law.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this section as amended.  The term &ldquo;fulfilment of contract&rdquo; could, as the Minister has stated, be open to misrepresentation in the narrow legal sense and cause certain problems.  Spelling out liability in a much more definite approach.  Agreements of this nature are in writing.  Do we take it for granted that such agreements would include rates of interest, repayments and so on in definitive terms?  In many cases the consumer is given a global figure of what the contract would cost without reference to the interest rates being charged.  Detailed information is necessary and should be supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> Another aspect of sales which will change concerns joint and several liability.  The practice has been widespread whereby sellers of certain goods have been in a position after a sale has been transacted to call in the consumer and sign on behalf of the finance house.  I assume that from now on finance houses will insist on a much tighter system in the giving of finance to consumers.  This is one of the problems. The finance house will not be aware of the quality of the commodity being sold to the consumer.  The trader must be taken on trust because the finance house is entering into joint liability.  The end result in some cases will be that the facility granted by finance houses to certain traders will be withdrawn.  That will be the logical consequence of the section. That will be a good thing and I hope it will redound to the benefit of the consumer in the long run.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very enlightened section and I welcome it. Now the consumer has some protection and the finance house, as happens in all other countries, must accept responsibility. They cannot just grant a loan and then wash their hands of it.  The finance house must take a much more responsible role.  They will be behind the consumer and will be of considerable benefit to him.</P>

The important conditions were that in the case of sale of goods by sample the goods should correspond with the samples; in the case of goods sold under a trade name the goods must be of merchantable quality and in the case of goods sold for a specific purpose to a buyer who relied on the skill and judgment of the seller, the goods must be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were required.  One was allowed to contract out of some of the purchases under the 1893 Act.  I am dealing here with the sale of bloodstock&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My point was that Deputy Enright should have brought up the matter of bloodstock under section 3 (2) and when he did not do so I did not remind him of it.  Now he is endeavouring to bring it up under this section which deals only with guarantees. With regard to bloodstock sales, there are no guarantees; there are conditions and warranties and I think this is the point that the Deputy was confusing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here the conditions of sale relating to the sale of bloodstock.  This is an important matter for a number of people.  Will the Minister consider what will be the situation with regard to the sale of yearlings?  In such a case a person buys an animal for a specific purpose.  The animal may prove to be suitable for the purpose or it may be unsatisfactory or completely useless. In this instance we are trying to have a situation allowed to ensure that a person who buys an animal at a bloodstock auction cannot come back after a period and say that the animal is not fit for the purpose and is useless.  There is some concern regarding this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There need not be any concern because they are not included at all under the guarantee section. That is the point I am making.  I was somewhat confused, just as the Deputy is and as I am sure many people are, about the meanings of &ldquo;warranty&rdquo; and &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo;.  People often think the two mean the same thing.  They do not; they are totally different.  Perhaps on Report Stage we can discuss it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot is sold as it stands; unless expressly announced at the time of the sale, no guarantee as to soundness is made.  They then say this is subject to certain conditions.  Basically, I am anxious that the Minister should be aware that concern is being expressed about the Bill as a whole, not just with any one section.  That is why I was anxious about the terms in regard to auctions.  That is why I asked specifically before I discussed this section if auctions were included under sections 15 and 16.  I gathered that auctions are included. Perhaps we can discuss this at the end of the Committee Stage in order to clarify the situation, but I want to ensure that there will be no difference in regard to say, sales of bloodstock here as compared with sales in England.  Here we are not really dealing with motor cars or TV sets or with people who are unaware of what they are doing.  The people involved here deal with such matters on a regular business basis and they are not consumers in the ordinary sense and there is no need to have them regulated in the same way as is perhaps necessary in the case of other items under consumer protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to spell out the guarantee.  Over the years we have seen this word abused very often.  I bought a thermometer a year ago and it says: &ldquo;Guarantee; made in Japan&rdquo;&mdash;nothing else.  What would you do about that?  There has been tremendous abuse.  I am delighted to find spelled out exactly what a guarantee means.  I hope we shall see an end to this irrelevant use of the word and that consumers are protected.  A certain type of sheet was guaranteed for five years&mdash;I do not see it advertised now&mdash;which was well advertised but there was no indication on it of the actual guarantee and I wondered how people would know from the sheet that it was bought five years previously.  I felt this was an abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although it may present enormous problems I should like the Minister to <Col N="1065" /> consider including a provision that a guarantee provided by the manufacturer will not deprive a consumer or purchaser of his rights under common law.  This may be somewhere in the Bill without my seeing it.  At present in many cases a person by signing a guarantee form is deprived of his rights under common law.  I consider that is an injustice.  Also, many of these guarantee forms provide that unless they are returned within 21 days the guarantee does not apply.  That should be removed.  The fact that the date of purchase is put on it by the retailer should be sufficient.  People frequently find they have forgotten to return the card.  The Minister might consider putting in another subsection providing that the terms of the guarantee shall not deprive a consumer of his right to sue under common law.  That might strengthen the Bill and ensure that people were not deprived of their rights, which is what normally happens with guarantee cards at present.</P>

      <P>Guarantee means &ldquo;any document, notice or other statement&rdquo;.  In other words, the definition covers other than written documents.  We then come to the terms of guarantee where it is said that the guarantee should be clearly legible and should refer only to specific goods.  How can a non-written statement be legible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking as a layman, not one with any legal training, section <Col N="1066" /> 15 would mean both written and other statements.  The word &ldquo;statement&rdquo; can be interpreted as oral or written.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless that is so, section 16 would not make sense because a statement has to be legible and obviously an oral statement would not be legible. Can this definition be tightened up more as otherwise it would not make sense? Written guarantees are to be found in all sort of places accompanying the goods purchased.  Normally the guarantee card is found inside the box or package is cannot be read until the package is opened.  If the goods purchased are in a sealed container you cannot scrutinise the contents of the guarantee.  This poses problems.  For example, I can visualise such a guarantee being in a sealed container and the breaking of the seal could render the commodity useless unless it is used immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many cases I would conceive of where it would be literally impossible for the purchaser to scrutinise the contents of the guarantee at the point of purchase.  In those cases the consumers are not being allowed to exercise their full rights under the provisions outlined in the Bill.  Would it be desirable for retailers to be required to make copies of contracts, supplied I would hope by the manufactures, for consumers?  Could this be included in this section?  For example, after the seal is broken, there are many foodstuffs which must be used almost immediately or, as regards carriage, the goods cannot be easily brought home by the consumer.  I want to stress that point.  I want to reiterate my innocence so far as section 15 is concerned. To me it could be constructed that a guarantee need not be written.  Is it accepted universally that a guarantee has to be written?  For example, in the Consumer Information Act, oral statements made by a vendor can be held against him, even if it is in the form of a promise. If a retailer guarantees verbally, can that guarantee be upheld?  Can he be held liable for what he said?  As far as I recall, <Col N="1067" /> in the Consumer Information Act this is so.  This is one area where we must be very careful.</P>
    <P>Section 15 which outlines in details the minimum requirements of a contract is acceptable and will alleviate a great deal of hardship on many consumers.</P>

      <P>Section 17 (1) covers the point made by Deputy O'Toole when he spoke about a guarantee being in the oddest places.  He said that if one had to get at the guarantee one would probably break the seal.  Section 17 (1) covers that point.  Regardless of when or how the guarantee is delivered, the person has the same rights. Therefore, it would not be necessary to include a separate subsection.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be awkward about this, but we can all conceive of cases, such as processed foods and many other commodities, which can be bought in delicatessens and shops where the guarantee is anything but legible, and in many cases it cannot even be seen.  The Minister says that section 17 covers that point, but I do not think it does.  Section 16 says it should be clearly legible.  I know what that means but that does not make it easier for a consumer to read a document which is out of sight at the time of purchase.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann deplores the Government's economic mismanagement, which has resulted in the credit squeeze and in a general loss of confidence <Col N="1071" /> in agriculture, industry, construction and other parts of the economy.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on this motion last Wednesday evening, I dealt with a widespread and rampant loss of confidence throughout our agricultural community and with a serious situation regarding a severe drop in cattle prices and with losses being suffered by people engaged in pig and cereal production.</P>
      <P>For the first time for many years, our cattle and pig numbers have fallen seriously.  There has been a drop in the yields of cereals.  We have a situation where farmers, because of serious shortages of cash, are being obliged to sell cattle at prices far less than they paid for them earlier this year and suffering serious losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have limited time, and I intend to deal with the present credit squeeze.  On Thursday, 25 October, the Minister for Finance allowed an extra £10 million for bridging loans, to ease the &ldquo;bottleneck&rdquo; as it was described in one of our national newspapers.  Following numerous representations from people on this side of the House, calling on the Minister to recognise the fact that the credit squeeze was having a serious effect on the building and construction industry here, the Minister decided to take some action. We had warned that, unless action was taken, there would be serious redundancies likely in the building industry, which would affect all the other people involved in the business of building, such as architects, engineers and auctioneers.  I put it to the Minister that, in national <Col N="1072" /> terms, this extra £10 million was far too little.  The number of new houses that this would help would be very limited and far less than was essential&mdash;between 400 and 500.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister, as a senior Cabinet Minister, that this was far too little to alleviate the present situation.  In the year 1978, the total number of new houses for which loans were obtained from building societies was 6,386 and other houses numbered 7,691, making a total of over 14,000 people who obtained loans from our building societies.  The total money coming from building societies alone was £166 million.  The money the Minister offered for bridging finance is only a drop in the ocean.  The Minister and the Government must be aware that the building and construction industry is of immense importance to our whole economy and that this industry is slowly but surely grinding to a halt because of the biting, serious and severe effects of the present squeeze.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to know that there is a problem, but it looks as if he is going to do little or nothing about it.  I would urge him to do something about it immediately.  The Central Bank guidelines to which the Ministers and the Central Bank have referred were to run from mid-February 1979 to mid-February 1980.  As far as I am aware, and the Minister may contradict me if he has evidence to the contrary, these guidelines were not issued by the Central Bank to the associated banks until towards the end of March of this year. These deal with a period of just two months.  At that time I understand that most of the allowable ceiling of 18 per cent had been exhausted, or near enough exhausted.  A period of just over two months had been allowed to elapse before the Central Bank set down this ceiling.  There is an obligation on the Central Bank and on the Minister to ensure that finance will be made available before it is too late.  I am dealing only with building societies but throughout every county council, loans of up to £9,000 are being granted&mdash;I have not the exact figure but it would be in the region of 67,000 houses.  The Minister, <Col N="1073" /> with his extra allowance, is helping a paltry 400 to 500 new houses.  I can assure him that this matter is extremely urgent.  The Minister has said that if somebody gives him proof he will take action and is prepared to take further action, if the situation warranted.  The proof is there.  Ask any one involved in the business of building and if you want further proof, ask any bank manager what the situation is in regard to credit. The present severe credit squeeze is very serious for everybody.  Credit must be extended to encompass further people and to be more widespread, otherwise the greatest possible hardship will be inflicted on young married couples, buying houses for the first time.  They need houses, they have entered into contracts, into commitments, and find that, because of being unable to obtain bridging finance for two to three months, they cannot complete sales in many instances. This is a solid, actual fact, and the sooner it gets home to the Government the better for everybody.  The Minister had better bring this across to the Cabinet table in the very near future. If action is not taken and this situation is allowed to continue there will be many people in the building industry facing a very severe winter.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for Finance is not here.  The other night he stated that in the course of an interview I had on Radio Éireann I was asked if I had any answers in regard to increased costs and he stated that I had none.  If he had been listening correctly he would know that I was asked if I had any magical solutions. I was honest enough to say that there were none.  Instead of trying to look for magical solutions the Government should take off their coats and recognise the essential work that needs to be done, which would be better for us all.  The Minister was less than honest in the statement that he made regarding that interview.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to do three things in the time allotted to me.  I should like to deal with <Col N="1074" /> the motion tabled by Deputy Kelly and others and then deal with some of the remarks made by Deputy Kelly last week since they did not have relevance to the motion before the House.  Finally I should like to deal with the Government's amendment to that motion.  The motion states that Dáil Éireann is expected to deplore the Government's economic mismanagement which has resulted in the credit squeeze and in a general loss of confidence.</P>
      <P>I was reading through what Deputy Kelly had said in order to see what evidence he had produced that it was the Government's mismanagement that had resulted in the credit squeeze and general loss of confidence.  I could find almost no reference in the whole of his 40-minute contribution to these matters.  There were one or two paragraphs at most that could be held to be touching on these aspects, but most of his time was taken up with other matters, some of which I will turn to later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial part of his opening contribution is best described as by way of contributing to the entertainment of the Members of the House rather than having anything to do with informing them. I am sure entertainment has a valid role in our society and I do not dispute that Members of the House enjoy a little of it from time to time.  I suppose we should be grateful that Deputy Kelly possesses these talents.  However there was another aspect to it to which I should like to draw attention.  I notice that the Deputy made various attempts to refer to me by reference to some character in an entertaining show rather than refer to me by name.  Very interesting.  I presume the motivation is to try to undermine or ridicule a person rather than deal substantially with their arguments or case.  I put it to Deputy Kelly that in this approach of trying to engage in the rather school-boy practice of name calling he is indeed following in the footsteps of his leader who I notice has been indulging in the same practice with increasing frequency over recent weeks.  If that is the best they can offer to the people by way of any opposition or alternative to the Government's policy let the message go <Col N="1075" /> out clearly to the people that on that side of the House they will be offered schoolboy entertainment and name calling&mdash; they must look elsewhere for any serious debate or discussion on the important issues that come before this House.</P>
    <P>The motion has two substantive parts as I see it.  We are expected to take the argument that the credit squeeze is due to Government mismanagement and also that there is a loss of confidence which is due to the same cause.  Let us take each of those.  In the very few remarks Deputy Kelly made on the credit squeeze being due to Government mismanagement he stated that the reckless and remorseless expansion of the Government's demand for money has left the private sector strapped for credit and that that will shortly be reflected in increased unemployment and so on.  This is the substance of his case.  He appears to want to argue that because of the size of Government borrowing this year this is reducing or restricting the availability of credit to the private sector. That is not true.  There is no substance in that statement or no foundation for it whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank is the authority in this country entrusted by law with the management of the monitoring of credit policies of the nation.  It draws up credit guidelines and considers the needs of the different sectors of the community quite independently.  It is the Central Bank which lays down credit guidelines for the private sector indicating the priority which should be given to various productive forms of investment and indicating the degree of restraint that should be exercised in the availability of credit for non-essential purposes.  It is because the banking institutions exceeded the guidelines laid down by the Central Bank, not once, not just for a temporary period, but over a sustained period of 12 months or so and after several warnings from the Central Bank to moderate their supply of credit&mdash;it was only after this process of excessive credit provision to the private sector had gone on for some time that the Central Bank imposed the more severe restrictions <Col N="1076" /> that have now been operating for some months.  That is the essence of the situation in regard to the credit squeeze. If there is a credit squeeze at present it is due to the fact that the Central Bank is exercising the responsibility entrusted to it by this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have their own credit needs.  These, like other credit needs, have to be financed, but the management of Government credit requirements is not the reason for the credit squeeze on the private sector. It is the Central Bank which manages the credit arrangements for the private sector.  If the Deputy thinks that is untrue or disputes it in any way I would be delighted to hear the counter-statement put on the record of the House.  I will gladly deal with it.</P>
      <P>That is the basic truth of the situation with regard to the credit squeeze.  Quite apart from our entry into the European Monetary System which would of itself have caused some changes and developments in our financial arrangements, we had the added short-term problems caused by the disruption of oil supplies internationally&mdash;we know that has unsettled the money markets of the world &mdash;and we had the more local destruction to our financial affairs associated with the various industrial disputes during the course of the year.  It has been an unsettled year for the conduct of financial affairs.  It is for that reason that one would expect the appropriate authorities, the Central Bank and the Government, with their responsibility for managing the public sector, to keep the credit situation under continuous review.  This is being done.  There have been various developments in the course of the year and the most recent, even since this motion came before the House last week, as Members will know is that arrangements have been made to make some additional credit available for bridging purposes in the case of housing loans and additional credit for farming purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> As the Tánaiste and other members of the Government have made clear, this situation will be continually reviewed so that if any further adjustments are deemed appropriate to deal with prevailing circumstances they can be made. There can be no question of a totally uninhibited expansion of credit.</P>
    <P>I was appalled by some of the remarks that Deputy Enright made in his concluding statement.  I can only assume that he did not really mean them, just as I can only assume that Deputy Kelly did not mean the remarks he made last week.  In order to clarify that let me put it clearly and bluntly to Deputy Kelly before he replies: am I to take it that the Fine Gael position is that there should be no credit restraint, no guidelines laid down for the availability of credit, that it should be a simple case of letting everything flow without any direction, guidance or regulation of any kind?  If that is not the case, and they are dissenting from the type of credit arrangements that are operated by the Central Bank, then I suggest that as a responsible opposition, as distinct from an opposition which sees its role as providing entertainment for the House, it is their duty to place their alternative views on the record.  If they do not have such views, then we on this side of the House and the people are entitled to arrive at the appropriate judgment and to recognise their sham posturing for what it is.</P>

      <P>Having dealt with the one about the credit squeeze, the second part of the motion talks about a general loss of confidence in agriculture, industry, construction and other parts of the economy.  I have <Col N="1078" /> waited to see the evidence for this general loss of confidence.  I cannot find any contribution whatsoever by Deputy Kelly on this aspect of the motion.  In fairness to Deputy Enright, in the few minutes in which I heard him he made some effort to supply such evidence.  If I heard him correctly, he talked about a reduction in cattle numbers and a drop in cereal yields as some of the indicators of this loss of confidence.  Of all the examples to try to quote to this House, I have to say that he deserves a medal for bravery but not for accuracy.  The drop in cattle numbers can be directly traced to the massive slaughtering of our breeding herd in 1975 in the wake of the worst winter of discontent for our farmers, when calves had to be virtually given away.  We all know that that happened, and the numbers are there to show it.  We know that the numbers of cattle will not be restored to a full level of output until 1982 because we have to pay a terrible price for the wholesale slaughtering that went on during that period.</P>
      <P>The other example the Deputy gave was of cereal yields.  With all due respect, it has nothing to do with any Member of this House.  Does the Deputy forget that last winter was a very bad one and that it affected the whole of Western Europe?</P>

      <P>Those are the two main components of the motion before us.  I have now shown that no evidence has been presented from the other side of the House to deal with them.</P>
      <P>Now what did Deputy Kelly do with his time last week?  I was so curious that I got the notes which had been taken by people who had been listening to him. Apart from the entertainment which he supplied, I see that a lot of his time went in making various inaccurate statements about different aspects of our economic performance.  I want to pick up some of them because I think they are very interesting; they throw some fascinating lights on the nature of Fine Gael policy in so far as I can discern Fine Gael policy.  At one stage we were told that the terms of the National Understanding were too generous.  He told us that the result was that last year, and even more so this year, there was a national understanding which was far more generous than the country could afford. He said that when he was talking about what happened to pay increases.  He went on to talk about the management of public finances and he accused the Government of bringing in a phoney budget.  He said: &ldquo;I must point out that we began the year with a phoney budget. I am not a financial expert but I followed as well as I could the passages between him and the Leader of my party earlier this year and I still think it is a phoney budget&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue has been debated both inside and outside this House.  It is a matter of record now that the Deputy's Leader had to back away from his initial wild allegations.  He withdrew the more <Col N="1080" /> serious allegations of fraud because he was impunging the integrity not just of politicians but of members of the Public Service.  He recognised that danger and had a belated burst of common sense which enabled him to back away.  If I had the time I would go through all the different statements which he made as he wriggled off the hook created for himself by his intemperate remarks.</P>
    <P>The fact is that there was no phoney budget.  If the Deputy asks why there is a difference between the likely outturn and the budget estimates, the major reasons for it are clearly identifiable.  There is on the revenue side a substantial shortfall in tax revenue associated with the postal strike in addition to some of the other losses of revenue associated with the slower rate of growth that is now in prospect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I call that a phoney explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a phoney explanation.  In his remarks last week the Deputy said that he could not foresee the upheaval in Iran.  It was not part of the Government's budget estimates either.  I invite the Deputy to put his alternative view on the record of the House.  The estimates which we have put forward as a Government indicate that at least 1 per cent to 1½ per cent of the slow-down in growth is attributable to the effects of the oil price upheaval.  That is true not only for Ireland but for the western world generally.  The remainder of the shortfall is attributable to the effects of the postal strike and the other disputes.  If the Deputy disputes those estimates he should put forward an alternative. I am now saying that those are the main reasons for the shortfall on the revenue side.  I just note in passing that one of the reasons why expenditure will be higher than the budget is that the level of pay settlement was higher than originally budgeted.  The Deputy's leader criticised the provision which we had made in the budget as being excessive and suggested that a smaller provision should have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he was talking about the level <Col N="1081" /> of public borrowing, the Deputy said: &ldquo;Last week the Minister for Economic Planning and Development said in relation to the need for scaled-down borrowing progressively that there is no ideal or necessary level of borrowing for any country.  I hope the Minister will not be offended and that the Chair will not get excited if I say that that is the kind of looney talk that gets academics a bad name&rdquo;.  I did indeed say that there is no ideal level of borrowing for any country. I did not say that it was only a fiction.</P>
    <P>So that we may have the record right I would like to quote from an interview I gave published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 12 October.  I was asked a specific question about the philosophy towards borrowing and I drew an analogy between a country's state of development and the different ages of people in order to show that different levels of borrowing are appropriate to different circumstances. Deputy Kelly misquoted me.  I said:</P>
    <P>There is no ideal level of borrowing appropriate to a particular country. Each individual case stands on its own merit.</P>
    <P>I went on to list some of the further reasons or characteristics which would be taken into account in judging this. Deputy Kelly seemed to think that because I said that there was no ideal level of borrowing that that made a nonsense of the various targets for borrowing which have been set out by the Government over the past few years.  It does no such thing.  The whole point was that the borrowing targets set out by the Government from 1977 onwards are to be seen as part of a coherent, consistent policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is the consistency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a borrowing level to any given level of growth and output, any given level of inflation, any given level of balance of payments position.  If those other factors change so too does the appropriate level of borrowing.  So, with respect to Deputy Kelly, he did indeed demonstrate that he is no financial expert, because it would <Col N="1082" /> be the height of financial stupidity and absurdity and crass mismanagement to persist with a simple piece of arithmetic when the economic circumstances and realities had changed.  The Deputy is making my case by saying that.  If economic circumstances change of course it is sensible to adjust the arithmetic or borrowing requirement to take account of those changing conditions rather than to persist blindly and foolishly with an outdated and inappropriate set of numbers.  It is the leader of Deputy Kelly's party who has always had an obsession with numbers which so blind him that he forgets to consider the underlying factors and circumstances which go to make up the economic performance of a country.</P>
      <P>There are two other points I want to answer.  Deputy Kelly talked about the increase in employment which has taken place.  He said that many of these jobs were only apparent jobs; they consume wealth instead of creating it.  What does that add up to?  It tells us very clearly that Fine Gael's alternative to the Government's approach would be lower wages, thousands of people out of work and increased taxes.  Those are the three basic messages that I drew from that.  If Deputy Kelly thinks that is a wrong interpretation, again I invite him to refute it and to show how he can claim that the level of pay increases provided for is too generous.  If that is so he must want to reduce it.  How can he claim that he would not increase taxes, because unless he wants to cut Government spending or cut employment further in the public service then the only way in which he can reduce borrowing is by increasing taxes? If he thinks many of the extra jobs are only apparent jobs then presumably the logic of his own argument is that he would throw these people out of their jobs; incidentally many of them are in the civil service.  Again he is being consistent in following in his leader's footsteps, since I notice that his leader took the time off to attack a civil servant who happens to be the secretary of a Government Department.  So much for Deputy Kelly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the few minutes that remain to me I <Col N="1083" /> would like to deal with the Government's amendment.  It will come as no surprise to Members of the House why quite clearly we could not accept the Opposition motion.  I have given the reasons. They cannot even put forward evidence in support of their own motion.  I have given the reasons why we would reject the motion in the terms in which it is before the House.  I have also dealt with the inadequacies of the case made by Deputy Kelly and Deputy Enright, and I will now move on to say why the House should approve the Government amendment which asks the House to approve the Government's economic policies and note the progress they are bringing about.  It is a fact that there has been very rapid progress in the last two years. There has been increased confidence. The evidence I would put forward for that is to ask what is happening to investment. The volume of investment in 1978 rose by 15 per cent, the largest increase on record.  That is being repeated this year.  Naturally we do not yet know the official figures, but it seems very likely that the growth in investment this year will be very close to the record increase of last year, so that for the two years as a whole the volume of investment will be up by about 30 per cent. That is a major signal of the revival of confidence which has taken place in the Irish people.  It is not confined to any one sector.  There has been a massive growth of investment in agriculture, in industry and in the building and construction industry. Along with that growth in investment, which of course holds the key to sustained growth in the years ahead and which therefore enables us to look forward to the future with confidence, there has also been a record growth in employment.  Employment is up by over 30,000 since the Government came to office.  There have been over 50,000 new jobs created, and because there is now a much lower level of jobs lost through redundancies the net effect is that there are over 30,000 more people at work. That again is a record which is unprecedented in the history of this State since independence.  Another pointer of <Col N="1084" /> progress is that living standards are up by about 10 per cent in the last two years.  This is again one of the fastest improvements on record.</P>
    <P>Let me digress for a moment to refute the charge that is frequently made that we are not paying attention to the needs of the weaker sections in our community. Let me note that while the average increases in living standards is 10 per cent the real improvement in social welfare benefits is much greater.  It is of the order of 15 per cent plus, thanks to the very substantial increases in social welfare benefits which have been made since we came to office in the summer of 1977.  These are three major indications of the progress we have made in the short span of two years.  We have already undone most of the damage caused by the Coalition's wasted years. In their period in office we know that investment, far from rising, actually fell.  I have given one example of it in the agricultural area.  Let me point out that the level of industrial investment also came to a halt in the awful period of 1975 and that even by 1977 it had only just got back to the 1973 level.</P>

The point in doing so is to show the kind of progress which can be achieved.  It is to make the contrast with the gloom and despair which comes from the benches opposite.

      <P>We have had a plea by the Minister in trying to suggest that the Government are not really responsible for some of the unfortunate things <Col N="1089" /> at present occurring in the economy, such as the high rate of inflation and the targets which will not be met.  One could say there is a headlong retreat by this Government from responsibility for leadership of the economy.  While one could sympathise with some of the points made by defenders of a Government in pointing to external factors in regard to difficulties and nonperformance at home, one can have little sympathy for members of this administration who after all engineered their present large majority on the policy that under our own control it was possible to bring about what has been frequently referred to by this Minister as an &ldquo;economic miracle&rdquo;.  According to his most recent interview, the miracle is not yet over but still exists underground.  He also made the point during his recent interview that we should not be obsessed with the arithmetic of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>He said that the long-term course of the economic miracle continues unchanged, despite the 15 per cent rate of inflation and the credit restrictions, which he says are not the Government's responsibility.</P>
      <P>The case that cannot be disputed by this Government&mdash;and it is the central criticism to be made of their economic policies&mdash;is that they dramatically misread the situation in 1977/78 when, in their reckoning, the economy needed a large infusion, in classical Keynesian fashion, to stimulate demand.  We can now see, as many of us saw then, that the economy was in full recovery at that time.  At this time, in the midst of an unmistakable recession, our manoeuvrability has been bartered and sold away. We have increased borrowings and increased investment and directed budgetary policy to expansion at a time when it was not really needed.  Now when it is needed we are faced with restriction and credit squeeze.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House should reflect the unease which is felt in the country regarding the economy.  Last weekend we had the results of a survey from the Confederation <Col N="1090" /> of Irish Industry.  They make it clear that their member firms around the country expect a very difficult year in 1980.  They are very pessimistic about employment targets.  Those fears are well grounded.  We know that many leaders in the building industry are extremely concerned about the effect of credit restriction, and we have already had discussion in the House on the impact on young couples of the unavailability of bridging finance for house purchase.  The larger impact on the economy is demonstrated by the replies received by the member firms of the CII.  Nobody knows exactly how long this credit squeeze will last, but it would appear that it will last most of next year.  The likelihood is that the credit squeeze may become tighter, and the international situation looks very grave.  Because of the mistaken policies of the Government they have very little manoeuvrability left.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country there is grave discontent about the tax burden of PAYE wage and salary earners, and one wonders about the scope there will be in the forthcoming budget to meet the legitimate demands for reform in this sector.  I have made the case before that a substantial element of the reason for the industrial discontent, which has led to such a bad relations record over this year, cannot be confined to the four walls of industry itself, that we must go outside to seek general reasons for the kind of industrial malaise that has afflicted Irish industry in the past year.  I have suggested that one source of a good deal of the grievance which has fuelled many disputes in the public service has been the discontent felt at the present too onerous obligations borne by PAYE wage and salary earners.  One wonders what the Government will do in the forthcoming budget to meet legitimate demands for reform in that area.</P>
    <P>The case will be made by PAYE industrial workers that it is hardly worth while doing overtime.  There is growing up in Irish industry a very marked reluctance to engage in overtime because the taxation burden is too heavy and it does not make sense to lose the leisure hours that would have to be spent doing that <Col N="1091" /> overtime.  Because of the fact that the successive budgets of this Government were the wrong ones for the periods in which they were followed, the Government must meet with empty hands many of the demands for reform.  The case is that the economy was in full return to growth in 1977-78, that the expansion in employment had more to do with the work of the previous administration.  The correct course was to allow the natural uplift that was occurring in the economy to take its course because it did not need the kind of fuelling exercise engaged in by the Government at that time.  That general criticism could be made of Government budgetary policy.</P>
    <P>Now, of course, various speeches are being made by Government spokesmen that seem to indicate a realisation of certain realities on their part, but many of the decisions which led to the earlier mistaken policy are now taking their toll. We have had reports from various international organisations pointing out the dangerous inflationary situation in the Irish economy, that our targets, which previously had been said to be attainable, cannot be met.</P>
    <P>To night the case was made that credit restriction, which is holding back investment and which will have a very serious impact on jobs in the new year, had little to do with the general economic policy of the Government.  I find it very hard to accept that.  The fact is that Central Bank guidelines have been issued to meet a very serious situation, one for which the Government must accept a great deal of responsibility because of their budgetary policy.  It is interesting to hear that the Government accept implicitly the kind of credit guidelines decided on by the Central Bank at this time.  It is interesting to see that kind of obedience to criticism and advice from the Central Bank which has not obtained up to now. One recalls certain reports of the Central Bank in the past few years which issued very unmistakable and unambiguous warnings and the members of the Government almost took a pride in ignoring those warnings.  Now they take <Col N="1092" /> an equivalent pride in saying, &ldquo;We can do nothing because this is the advice of the Central Bank in relation to credit restrictions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If these credit restrictions are persisted in during next year they will have a very serious impact on employment and many small businesses will go to the wall.  Many such firms are very worried about the situation, and I can only conclude that Government Departments must be receiving the most pressing representations from businesses in peril throughout the country.  I do not know what answers the businessmen are getting, but one can only worry about the fate of the employees and the concerns themselves.  One cannot foresee in the immediate future any relaxation in the credit squeeze.  High interest rates mean there will be a downturn in economic activity and it will be difficult to maintain the kind of expansion in employment that is necessary.</P>
    <P>It is obviously not enough for the Government now to try to pass the buck, to suggest that if there had not been bad industrial relations during this year, if oil prices had not gone up, if a credit squeeze had not been imposed, everything would be all right.  That is not the case.  A good deal of responsibility for the present very serious situation must be laid at the door of the Government. They got the rhythm of the Irish economy all wrong from 1977 onwards. In a period of growth they considered it necessary to aid that growth.  When we entered what would be referred to in the economist's jargon as the cyclical upturn they thought it necessary to assist it even further, and now that we are in an unmistakable downturn they find themselves unable to give any assistance other than to say what the economic Ministers are saying, &ldquo;We are not responsible.  Our hands are clean.  It is somebody else's fault, not our fault.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not good enough.  In the past the electorate have shown that they adhere to the philosophy that a party who win an election with comprehensive claims on their competence to run the economy will be judged on those claims. There was no shrinking in the ambition <Col N="1093" /> of the people who won office in Government in 1977.  They knew the answers. They had the capacity.  They would engender confidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is why the Confederation of Irish Industry are worried and are looking for action.  They are not blaming the Central Bank.  They are looking to the Government for leadership, the Government who claimed they had the secret of running the Irish economy effectively.  Now, in conditions of world recession&mdash;the Minister for Economic Planning and Development at least recognises that fact&mdash;what may we do at home to withstand the full effect of that recession on our economy?  We find the kind of budgetary strategy pursued by the Government is itself an impediment to taking the right steps, that the credit restriction must go on and the Government cannot afford or pay for any moderation in the kind of credit squeeze we have, that we cannot increase our rate of borrowing, that we must keep the economy tuned down and must look forward to rising unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a pretty dismal picture for the New Year.  That is why the people have good reasons to ask awkward questions.  It would be inexplicable if ordinary people would not be asking these questions when the Government have made the cost of living which ordinary people must face even more difficult due to budgetary decisions.  We can point to <Col N="1095" /> increases that come from abroad, but when it comes to a political decision such as the removal of food subsidies the Arabs cannot be blamed.  The blame lies on the Government. We had the Minister here tonight defending the economic miracle, as he is still pleased to call it, admittedly running away from arithmetic. We had the same Minister here quite recently saying that they were quite right to abolish the food subsidies.  Also, on that occasion he was apparently silent when we said that if the inflation rate had reached an annual figure of 15 per cent, as it now has, surely the time had come to revise the policy of phasing out food subsidies.  We had silence on that&mdash;blame the unions, blame the Central Bank but do not blame the Government. That appears to be the general cry from the Government.</P>
    <P>They do not appear to have the answers.  They cannot do anything about it if industrial relations, which they claim are responsible for so many targets not being reached, have been bad over the past couple of years.  We shall not go into the reasons for certain large disputes, but it must be said that if much of the industrial disruption in the past year has been in areas directly under the control of the Government and their managers, some responsibility must attach to the Government in their handling of the way those disputes occurred. Without pressing that too hard I have made the point that much of the discontent which brought about a good deal of industrial unrest in the past year and which has given us such a bad record in industrial relations in that period has to do with the PAYE earners' discontent with their present rate of tax payments. One can only wonder if that sense of injustice on the part of the PAYE section has been made even more sensitive by the realisation that the Government could, by budgetary policy, deliberately absolve from tax payment the very wealthy in our society, as they did apparently without any consideration of the repercussions it would have on the general sense of fair play.</P>
    <P>They have given us a society which is <Col N="1096" /> more divided than the one they inherited in 1977.  They are now giving us an economy which is grinding to a standstill, an economy in which the building industry on which they have had to rely in the past for more than moral support is calling out for help and no help can be given to them.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the present position of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is within the Cabinet.  Originally, he was brought before a wondering public as the architect&mdash;not the over-modest architect&mdash;of the miracle which brought the Government into power, the manifesto.  There is some justice in politics after all in that he is now here defending their record.  We know how he reached his present eminence, but the position he is defending tonight is quite different from the picture thrown on the screen by the magic lantern of the <Col N="1097" /> manifesto some two or two-and-a-half years ago.</P>
      <P>In answer to the Minister's defence that it is not their responsibility the general case I would make is that the Government must answer for their budgetary policy over the past two years.  They got the analysis all wrong; they tried to prime the economy when it did not need priming, and now when it may be in need of priming they are not in any position to give any help or leadership except the one kind of leadership we are now experiencing of many speeches blaming anybody else but themselves.</P>

One would have expected that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development or the Government would be able to give us some hope of measures contemplated to change this picture.  The figures suggest otherwise.  Business and union leaders throughout the country are concerned about the lack of leadership by the Government.  We see reason for supporting this motion.  We understand the political exigencies that make it necessary for the Minister to oppose it, but we do not believe his heart is in it. Certainly, his intelligence cannot go along with a defence of the present economic performance.  That is why this motion can be fully supported; it is most in accord with the way the people are thinking at the present time.</P>

      <P>We are in the position that we have had to give cash incentives to get skilled workers back from abroad. One of our biggest problems in Dublin at present, and also in Cork, is the maintenance of houses because there are not sufficient skilled tradesmen.  The complaints about people's houses is caused by a shortage of skilled tradesmen.  We are having to bring these people back. We are the people who started tax reform here.  In two years we have increased by 103 per cent the income tax allowance for married people.  That is a fact.  The gap between our inflation and that of our trading partners, Britain and the EEC generally and the United States, was 10 per cent under the Coalition&mdash;30 per cent as against 20 per cent.  Under Fianna Fáil, we have narrowed that gap by 1 per cent, from 20 to 19 per cent&mdash;1 per cent difference as against 10 per cent under the Coalition.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister defended what he had said in a relaxed moment to a reporter from <i>The Irish Times</i>, in an interview with regard to the ideal level of borrowing and he related that also to what I had been saying about the level of the pay settlement.  &ldquo;The pay settlement,&rdquo; said <Col N="1103" /> the Minister, a few minutes ago, &ldquo;was something which came out higher than anticipated&rdquo;.  No one is so unreasonable as to forbid a Government some marginal room for manoeuvre when something quite unpredictable happens, but there was nothing unpredictable about the 1979 wage settlement.  Even people like Messrs.  Dudgeon and Company, whom I have never seen at a Fine Gael branch meeting, and I doubt if they turn up at Labour Party meetings either, government stockbrokers warned in their annual report that a moderate wage settlement was out of the question once the food subsidies had been partially phased out, and doubly out of the question, I would say, once, the cowardly and appalling and indefensible bungling about farmers' taxation took place.  Why should a man who is living on £70 or £75 a week, and being taxed on every wage docket he gets, settle for a moderate wage increase when he finds things like that happening?  I am not saying that for the first time.  Those points were made from these benches, from the Labour Party benches and from forces outside parliament&mdash;which are not in the pockets of Fine Gael and whom I never met at one of our party's functions&mdash;in the early part of this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has absolutely no right to come in here talking about the unpredictability of wage settlements when the extravagance of the wage settlements, to which he and the Minister for Finance testified, was entirely predictable once they set themselves on the course which they outlined in 1977 and with appalling blindness have followed up to this present moment.</P>
    <P>The ideal level of borrowing was something which the Minister was also inclined to make little of.  Of course, he said there was no ideal level of borrowing because an economy is not static or does not follow predictable and chartable courses, and of course it has to react when things turn out in a way which was not anticipated, but the very thing we are talking about&mdash;the level of the national wage agreement&mdash;is part of <Col N="1104" /> the circumstances which created this situation.  It was absolutely predictable.</P>
    <P>For that Minister to spend half an hour talking here about the form in which the debate was conducted last week and to say nothing about the predictability of what he has been complaining about and how it was predicted from these benches in chapter and verse, in line, word and comma, a year ago and two years ago exhibits him as not having a serious approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He will have a university to go back to, and he will be enriched by many lessons he learned in his years here, and he will be able to tell the students the mistakes which were made and what to avoid.</P>
      <P>Let me hammer home to him one lesson that has been roared from these benches for the past two-and-a-half years.  Do not antagonise simple, defenceless people who exist in their hundreds of thousands.  Deputy O'Leary mentioned them in the context of PAYE workers.  If I have a chance before I finish I will come back to that very briefly.  This Government alienated them at once.  The benefits which the Government bestowed on them in terms of extra pound notes have been long since swallowed and forgotten, as we warned them they would be, but they are alienated in the sense that they do not see themselves dealt with with justice. There is no visible justice in the tax situation.</P>

All sections have to be screwed equally if they are to get the level of services which they vocally demand.</P>
      <P>If, on the other hand, they want to go back to the style of Government which we had in 1800 or in 1850 when the Government scarcely did more than provide a police service&mdash;and a damn bad one at that&mdash;then perhaps they can be let off taxation.  But if people in all sections are going to expect the level of services to which they have become accustomed&mdash;and to which we on all sides of the House have invited them to become accustomed&mdash;then they are going to have to bear taxation.  The large mass of the people who pay by PAYE have to put up with it whether they like it or not.  They are defenceless.  But there are others to whom the thing has not yet become so evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless the Minister can insert a fearless crowbar there&mdash;and I believe he is in the wrong party for fearlessness; he is in a party which does not go in for fearlessness, but which goes in for the easy way out&mdash;and unless he can relearn these lessons and convert his party, there will be room for him over here, as there is always for an honest man.  I believe that at bottom he is that, even though a bit unreal.  If he fails to do this I advise him, as a personal matter, to get out quickly before the next election, to resign, to find himself a visiting fellowship somewhere and no one will wish him good more heartily than I will, or follow his future career with more interest. He is building up trouble for the country and for himself and his party, <Col N="1106" /> although the party is a low priority there, if he allows them to continue suggesting to the people that they can have all they want and that somehow the Germans, the Dutch and the Japanese are going to get up at 6.00 a.m. and work that bit harder to pay for it, because they are not.</P>
    <P>I want to end by taking one simple and very topical example of the way in which this Government have approached their problems.  Every time the CII or any other independent body, or even dependent body, issue a statement from which a series of priorities in regard to economic development can be identified, or in which a set of obstacles to economic growth can be spotted, they never fail to mention infrastructural development.</P>
    <P>We have the lowest telephone density and worst road network in Europe.  We are a small country and have come from very far back.  I do not want to take credit from people from the far side, and there have been many of them, who have pulled their weight trying to get this country off the ground where it was when we got independence.</P>
    <P>We are agreed, I hope, that development, in particular, of the telecommunications infrastructure is of absolutely major priority here.  I am not simply talking about the personal inconvenience of individual subscribers, or would-be subscribers of whom some 70,000 are waiting for service.  I am talking about the millstone around the neck of industry and enterprise generally which our defective telecommunications system represents.  What is the Government's response to this crisis and to this general chaos?  It is to create, if you please, An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom. Maybe there are some Deputies here who did not read their handouts, but that is their response.</P>
    <P>I am sick complaining in this House about the way in which the party opposite, more than anyone, take their tone from the English.  The English, so far as I know, are the only country in the EEC who have pushed off from the political Minister for Posts and Telegraphs responsibility for the Post Office and the <Col N="1107" /> telecommunications service.  And so the sliveens in the Soldiers of Destiny&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to know, before the Government can invite a welcome for the bouncing baby boards, if they will have more finance than Deputy Faulkner, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, is being given; and where is the formula for magic industrial relations? Do not appeal to the British model for this, because the British Post Office Authority was not created in response to a crisis, it was not created to lift the country out of chaos; it was the result of 20 years of administrative development of which they may be the judge.  I will not judge it.  It did not arise out of crisis or chaos.</P>
      <P>No one on this side of the House has any ideological objection to a statutory board rather than a Minister running either or both of these services&mdash;I want to make that clear&mdash;if it will provide a better service for the public.  Where is the evidence so far that it will?  So far as I can see the only visible benefit from this development will accrue to Deputy Faulkner, namely, that he will be let off the parliamentary hook for the disasters over which he presides.</P>

      <P>Slaughterhouses are not, however, exempted from the hygiene requirements of the Food Hygiene Regulations and health boards were specifically requested in June last year to ensure that they comply with the requirements of those regulations.  Sixteen points of structural and operational hygiene were listed for attention, a survey of all slaughterhouses was made and a planned programme of inspections was introduced.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 398 and 400 together.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the general position regarding access for physically handicapped people and I am reviewing the matter in the context of the building regulations now in preparation in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part S of the draft building regulations sets out standards which are designed to meet the special needs of disabled persons <Col N="1005" /> and which are intended to apply to buildings to which the public has access. Provision is made in relation to means of approach to such buildings in order to facilitate access and entrance to them. Provision is also made for standards designed to facilitate circulation within such buildings.</P>
    <P>The regulations (section A16 (1)) will empower a planning authority to alter or pull down any work begun or done in contravention of any regulation except in specified cases, e.g. failure to give proper notice of the commencement of work or deposit of plans etc. (section A 16 (2)).</P>
    <P>Section 86 (8) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1963, provides that a person contravening any provision of the building regulations shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £250 plus £50 for each day the offence is continued after the conviction.</P>

      <P>The general matter of circulation and access by the handicapped was brought to the attention of all planning authorities by my Department's circular letter PD 1/1972, which was issued on 28 February 1972.  Following a debate which took place in Seanad Eireann on 8 November 1978, local authorities were again requested to make their own offices, libraries and other public buildings accessible for physically handicapped persons and to use their powers as planning authorities to see that the plans and designs of shops, offices, schools, churches and places of public resort also allow for similar facility of access.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals for promoting legislation on the lines suggested in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if in the case of an unfair dismissal he has satisfied himself that a situation can arise whereby a dismissal is held to be unfair by the Employment Appeals Tribunal but re-instatement or compensation is not awarded and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, provides that the forms of redress for unfair dismissal shall be re-instatement or re-engagement or monetary compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When assessing whether monetary compensation should be awarded in an unfair dismissals case and the amount of such compensation, the Employment Appeals Tribunal takes into account the loss sustained by the dismissed employee and the extent, if any, to which he contributed to the loss or failed to mitigate it.  In individual decisions the tribunal has decided that dismissal had been unfair but that no monetary award should be made because the employee had immediately obtained alternative employment and sustained no financial loss. The tribunal has also made no monetary award where it held that an employee has been entirely to blame for dismissal, although he had been summarily dismissed, without getting an opportunity <Col N="1008" /> to defend himself and the dismissal was held to be technically unfair.</P>
    <P>The Act does not provide for the payment of a basic award in a case where a dismissal is adjudged to be unfair.  The desirability of a basic award was raised during the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas.  It was considered then that the assessment of compensation should be left to the discretion of the adjudicating body.  The matter is one which will be looked at again in connection with any future review of the operation of the Act.</P>

      <P>The directive requires member states to introduce legislation before 1 January 1981, specifying the signs and colours to be used when safety signs and colours are required by law or provided on a voluntary basis; it does not specify when and where signs should be provided but that, wherever such signs are used, they should conform to those specified in the directive.  As a first step the terms of the directive have been widely circulated, most recently through the journal of the National Industrial Safety Organisation.  I intend to give effect to the requirements of the directive by regulations to be made under the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>

      <P>(a) The National Rehabilitation Board, at the request of the interdepartmental committee which was set up to implement the scheme have carried out a survey of a number of Government Departments and State bodies to obtain a clear overall picture of the types of jobs into which eligible handicapped persons could be placed.  The NRB is also arranging to provide a register of handicapped persons considered suitable and most likely to be placed successfully.</P>
      <P>The NRB survey report was received in my Department on 30 October and will be presented to the interdepartmental committee in the next week or two.  I have made additional staff resources available to the committee to speed up the advancement of the quota scheme when they have considered the report.</P>
      <P>(b)  It is not possible to give the percentage of handicapped people now employed in the public sector as separate statistics of such persons are not compiled.</P>
      <P>(c)  Due to the complexities in the implementation of employment quotas of this nature which came to be realised only in the course of the committee's deliberations it may well be necessary to revise target dates, but I am hopeful that existing deadlines can be met.</P>
