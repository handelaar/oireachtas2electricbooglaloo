      <P>The most recent source of information on unemployed persons classified according to age groups is the 1977 labour force survey. The results from this survey show that there was an estimated 42,200 unemployed persons under 25 years at the end of April of that year, of which 14,500 were seeking regular work for the first time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he proposes to introduce legislation to provide compensation for hit and run victims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question refers only to hit and run accidents where neither the driver nor owner of the vehicle concerned is subsequently traced or, though traced, is not a mark for damages because he has no funds and is not adequately insured.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, as a result of an agreement made in 1964 between the Minister for Local Government and the Motor Insurers' Bureau, there is a scheme in operation under which the bureau will assume responsibility for the payment of unsatisfied judgments obtained against users or owners of mechanically propelled vehicles in respect of personal injury or death.  The scheme does not extend to cases where the owner or driver of a vehicle cannot be traced, but I understand that, where a person has sustained serious and permanent disablement, or has died as a result of injury sustained in these circumstances and there is, in the view of the bureau, reasonable certainty that the disablement or death was caused by the negligent use of a mechanically propelled vehicle, the bureau will, at their discretion, give sympathetic consideration to making some <i>ex gratia</i> payment.</P>
      <P>Any question of extending the existing arrangements would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that, as he would see it, any further action would fall to the Minister for the Environment.  Is the Minister aware that legislation in other EEC states gives some recourse to the victim in such an accident? Is the Minister aware that there are many such instances? I do not know the exact numbers on an annual basis.  I put down this question because of the case of a constituent victim of a hit and run accident having to spend many weeks in hospital with no compensation coming to him.  Surely the requirement <Col N="4" /> is that the law should give some protection to such innocent victims who may not be disabled for life but may be forced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the proposals, if any, for improving the enforcement of the regulations governing the management of road traffic; and if he would consider the setting up of a separate traffic police.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Síochána are the primary enforcing agency in relation to road traffic law.  There is already within the Garda Síochána a special traffic corps who were formed some years ago with a unit in every Garda Division, and who have special responsibility for accident prevention and traffic control.  The corps have 339 members, consisting of one superintendent, five inspectors, 44 sergeants and 289 gardaí.  The strength of the corps is kept under constant review and last year it was increased by almost 20 per cent.  I do not consider that there would be any advantage to be gained by setting up a separate traffic police force, as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="5" /> An important aspect of road traffic management in the larger cities and towns is the enforcement of parking regulations.  In Dublin, the city council notified my Department at the beginning of March that they had decided not to establish their own traffic warden service under the provisions of the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act, 1975, and that responsibility for the existing traffic warden service, which they had been operating on an agency basis, should be handed back to the Garda. Consequent on this decision by Dublin Corporation, arrangements have been made for the Garda to give greater attention to the improvement of traffic flow in the city, with particular emphasis on clearway enforcement.  Garda activity in relation to traffic law enforcement in the city has been intensified since 30 April and there has been a substantial increase in the Garda resources being deployed on traffic duties.  Approximately 40 extra gardaí have been assigned full time to traffic law enforcement in the city and 35 more have been assigned to the duty on a part-time basis. Moreover, the Garda authorities hope shortly to be recruiting about 50 part-time traffic wardens to assist the Garda in the general enforcement of parking regulations in the city, including the enforcement of the meter parking rules.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is already a variety of regulations governing this matter.</P>
      <P>The Garda are bound by certain general rules and directions which apply to the treatment of persons in custody irrespective of whether those persons are adults, young persons or children. Included in this general category are the Judges' Rules, which are intended as a guide to police officers conducting investigations and are concerned with the admissibility in evidence against a person of answers given and statements made by him in the course of such an investigation. There are also internal administrative directions to the force about such matters as refreshments, medical attention and other facilities for persons in custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of children and young persons there are special additional <Col N="7" /> directions to the force dealing with the manner in which interviewing and questioning should be conducted in the varying circumstances that can occur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible for us to have the special directions which are issued to the force for the treatment of children held in custody? Secondly, is it a fact that as most of these children are charged in the District or Metropolitan Courts statements made by them, in the absence of a guardian or solicitor, are accepted as being admissible for evidence by these courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary which I can answer, I understand that the Garda Commissioner regards the documents concernings rules and directions to gardaí about the treatment of persons in custody as confidential.  I am not too sure that I can answer the second part of the Deputy's supplementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is absolute rubbish that the Minister for Justice should not know whether it is a fact that unfortunate children&mdash;terrified by being in a Garda station&mdash;can be questioned in the absence of a guardian or solicitor.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>What are those regulations?  They are secret and confidential. Surely the Minister cannot stand over that.  Would the Minister say why it is that when, in relation to adults, we know that by the application of the Judges' Rules certain standards are accepted for the admissibility of evidence before all the courts, we cannot have the same position in relation to children? Surely it is even more important for children than for adults?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Following receipt of recent representations in the matter I asked the Garda authorities to carry out a further examination of the policing arrangements for the Littleton area.  They state that, having reviewed the matter in consultation with the local Garda officers, they still consider that the re-opening of a station in Littleton would not be justified at present.  Improved patrolling arrangements for the area have, however, been introduced and they are satisfied that these new arrangements provide for an effective police service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister three questions.  First of all, is he aware&mdash;since I raised the question in the House 12 months ago&mdash;that this matter has become one of prime urgency in the Littleton area and that despite the best efforts of mobile patrols in Thurles the situation has worsened considerably? Vandalism is rampant in the area and £8,000 damage was done to the local school.  Is the Minister aware that the people there are living in fear for their lives and safety?  Will the Minister <Col N="11" /> confirm or deny that a deputation which had arranged to meet him in Dublin found that their journey was fruitless because they could not make contact with him having been told that he was unavailable?  Would the Minister agree that his many statements on the need for increased Garda strength, particularly in rural Ireland, is of little consolation to the people of Littleton who feel there is an urgent need to reopen the station? Littleton is situated on the main Dublin-Cork road, is a growing centre of population and experiences a lot of traffic daily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's supplementary, whether it was an allegation or a statement of fact, I should like to state that the figures for indictable crime in the former Littleton sub-district, population approximately 350, clearly show that there is nothing to substantiate the Deputy's allegation.  I accept that a deputation travelled to Dublin to meet me.  My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, arranged that I meet that deputation.  I was confined to bed on the Thursday and Friday of that week and a Member, who is a doctor, can testify to that because he wrote a prescription for me to combat the flu.  The deputation met Garda Commissioner McLoughlin and since that meeting the additional measures I mentioned have been adopted.  I understand that the Garda are satisfied that the arrangements are more than adequate to meet the situation.  I should like to tell the Deputy, as I have already told the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Deputy Smith, that in six months' time I will ask the Garda authorities to review the situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me as Minister for Justice to make any statement about the Bennett Report or the related matters mentioned in the question.  Those matters will be dealt with in the near future by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in reply to questions which are on the Order Paper addressed to him.</P>
      <P>As far as the present question is concerned, the answer is no.  I am satisfied that the co-operation that exists between the Garda Síochána and the RUC is of vital importance not alone in curbing the incidence of crime in this jurisdiction but also in the context of achieving peace in the whole of this island.</P>
      <P>I consider that a decision to do as the Deputy suggests would be extremely harmful to the interests of the Irish nation and that it would represent a positive rejection of the aspirations of the majority of the people for a peaceful and agreed solution to the problem of Irish unity.</P>

I have tabled questions for three Ministers, and the Taoiseach, but they <Col N="13" /> are being taken by the Minister for Justice.  That is rather unfair to him.  I should like to know if any cognisance has been taken of the fact that the continued co-operation&mdash;the charitable way of putting collaboration&mdash;is a complete acceptance of the worst and the best of the RUC and all that goes with it? Knowing that the Minister is fully alive to the implications, and that it would be far from his mind to have anything to do with what is going on up there at the moment, I should like to know if he will consider, with his colleagues, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Defence, and the Taoiseach, if necessary, bringing this to the attention of the other members of the Government?  We cannot ignore what is contained in the Bennett Report or the disclosures of Doctors Irwin and Elliott.  We cannot ignore the continued co-operation that is taking place, something which did not take place not so many years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that what the Deputy has in mind is the danger of itinerant children being exposed to neglect or hardship in cases where the parents are in custody.</P>
      <P>The Garda have instructions to the effect that when an itinerant parent is detained, the garda responsible for the detention should notify either the local itinerant settlement committee, the child welfare service of the local health board or the local ISPCC inspector, so that the interests of the child or children can be looked after.</P>
      <P>Where it has not been possible for the Garda to establish in advance of the first court appearance whether the itinerant has any dependent children, they have instructions to seek a remand until this has been established.  I understand from the Garda authorities that these arrangements are operating satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>While he does not say so in the question, it may be that the Deputy is also concerned with the related problems of itinerant children wandering abroad, begging and sleeping rough.  On that I would have to point out that these are social problems which are not primarily the concern of the Garda Síochána, although of course the Garda are anxious to, and do in fact, co-operate with the various agencies having direct responsibility in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Dublin Corporation's Community and Environment Department have set up a special group of welfare officers to deal with these particular problems.  I understand that this <Col N="18" /> group are anxious to have the courts commit such children to residential care and the Garda have agreed to assist them to obtain the necessary evidence for application to the courts.</P>

I should hope that in the event of our making any progress in terms of the possibility of a new Criminal Law Bill we might be able to cater for this situation.</P>

He failed to return to the prison.</P>
      <P>I might add that since Portlaoise Prison was set aside in 1973 for the type of prisoner now accommodated there more than 60 prisoners have been given temporary leave on compassionate grounds and this was the first one who failed to return on the due date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that there is a long-standing practice of allowing compassionate parole to suitable prisoners to visit members of their immediate families who may be in danger of dying or to attend funerals of immediate relatives.  Immediate relatives include parents, brothers, sisters, husbands and wives.  The list may extend beyond these relatives in the case of a grandparent or an aunt or uncle who reared the prisoner after his parents had died.  In general the granting of compassionate parole is influenced by an assessment of whether the prisoner can be relied on to honour the conditions of the parole and to return on time.  The experience in the matter of compassionate leave for the type of prisoner concerned <Col N="22" /> has been excellent.  Of more than 60 prisoners released on this basis from Portlaoise prison since 1974, every single one has honoured the terms of the parole until this one.  The tradition in this regard goes back long before 1973. Regrettably the practice of granting compassionate leave to this type of prisoner will have to be examined more critically in the future.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities state that they consider the existing arrangements for policing the Puckane area from Nenagh give a reasonably adequate service and also provide the most efficient use of manpower over the district as a whole.

The indictable crimes in 1978 showed a 25 per cent decrease over the year before which, in reality, is only one less in that in the earlier year four were committed and three were committed in 1978.  The Garda are satisfied they can police the area reasonably well from Nenagh.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, when agreement on delimitation of the Continental Shelf between Ireland and Britain could not be reached between the two Governments following lengthy negotiations we proposed to the British that the dispute be submitted to an arbitration tribunal.  The British, after <Col N="25" /> some delay, agreed to submit the question of delimitation to an independent settlement of disputes procedure through some form of third party settlement of a judicial nature.  We are still in negotiation with the British on the form which the procedure should take.  Representatives of our two Governments met in London in July last year and the British indicated they were still considering our proposal but were not yet in a position to agree to an <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration.  We have continued to urge them to agree to the procedure and as I stated in the House last March I again indicated to the Minister of State at the British Foreign Office when I met him in Brussels recently the urgency of the matter.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that agreement on the form of the third party settlement procedure is a matter which is of vital concern to both sides and one to which very detailed consideration of all aspects must be given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from what the Minister has said that, in effect, the British Government have a <i>de facto</i> veto in allowing this matter to be processed any further by their refusal to agree to the proposed system of arbitration he outlined?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident that they will agree to a settlement procedure.  In principle there is no disagreement between the British authorities and ourselves on this matter.  There has been delay on the part of the British&mdash;I am speculating here&mdash;largely on account of the British general election situation and the lead-up period into it.  From now on we can take an immediate initiative to try to get the procedure moving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is not directly involved.  If the British refuse to agree to the details of an agreed procedure does that give them an effective <i>de facto</i> veto in the matter?  If so, could the Minister outline to the House what action our Government propose to take?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the case in all matters of this kind.  We are seeking to get agreement with them on the arbitration <Col N="26" /> procedure.  Of course, there must be agreement between the two parties on that.  We have no reason to doubt that such agreement will be forthcoming. Discussions will be resumed immediately with the new British Government with a view to getting this arbitration procedure moving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been privy to this matter since a certain event in July 1977.  Would the Minister agree that the tribunal which was to adjudicate on this dispute was agreed between our Government and the British Government in 1975, or at latest early 1976, and that tribunal was the International Court of Justice?  The only matter still outstanding to be fixed was whether it would be the full court or a panel of the court.  That agreement had been extracted from the British after very gross delay on their part only by the fact that the National Coalition Government authorised the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make very substantial designations in the disputed area.  But for that, not even that much agreement would have been reached.  Since that time, since the National Coalition Government left office, nothing has been done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if the Government or a Minister of State of the Government received communication or communications from the General Rapporteur of the Committee on Culture and Education of the Council of Europe concerning Wood Quay; if so, if he will state the nature of the communications and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I understand that the General Rapporteur for the Architectural Heritage of the Committee on Culture and Education of the Council of Europe wrote to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance in September <Col N="29" /> 1978 and that the communication referred to the archaeological potential of the Wood Quay site.</P>

      <P>That was a very short answer to a detailed question.  Is the Minister aware that a request was put to the Minister of State to allow time for the proper excavation and preservation of the Wood Quay site? In the circumstances, is the Minister satisfied that that request was acceded to and is he satisfied that the time allowed is sufficient to recover valuable national treasure in view of the finding of a priceless sword in this corporation dump?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs what action it is proposed to take to foster economic co-operation between eastern and western Europe as defined within the context of the Helsinki Final Act and what specific contribution Ireland can make towards such co-operation in the six months of our Presidency of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As these two question both relate to the Government's preparations for the Madrid CSCE meeting, propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Question Nos. 22 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The meeting planned for Madrid in late 1980 will be the second follow-up meeting to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the CSCE. As in the case of the first such meeting which closed in Belgrade in March 1978 its purpose will be twofold.  The participating states will take stock of the degree of progress they have made in carrying out their commitments under the Helsinki Final Act and they will discuss possibilities for further improving their co-operation.</P>
      <P>The Final Act contains a chapter of measures relating <i>inter alia</i> to economic co-operation.  This has the aim of fostering co-operation in the economic sphere between all the states of Europe with due account being taken of their different economic systems.</P>
      <P>Work on the implementation of many of these measures which have multilateral implications is being carried on in the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, within the framework of which it is proposed to hold a high-level conference on the environment in November this year.  The recent opening of negotiations between the Community and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, CMEA towards the conclusion of a framework agreement which would include economic co-operation is an important step towards an improvement in the implementation of the economic chapter measures of the Helsinki Final Act.  Ireland has sought to develop further its economic relations with the countries of Eastern Europe, since the signing of the Final Act, most notably by the signing in December 1976 and June 1977 respectively of agreements on the development of economic, industrial, scientific and technological co-operation with the USSR and Poland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Central to the CSCE process is, of course, the full implementation of all aspects of the Final Act which envisages improved co-operation in the fields of military security, economic relations, <Col N="31" /> science and technology and contains provisions governing a number of humanitarian issues such as family reunifications as well as those relating to co-operation in the information, education and cultural fields.  In preparation for Madrid we consult regularly with our EEC partners on developments relating to the CSCE process and monitor implementation of the Final Act by all the participating states.  We are also considering the question of a joint over-all approach to the meeting and of the identification of realistic objectives we would hope to attain there.  In addition, we are using the opportunities provided by our bilateral contacts with representatives of other CSCE states both to stress our interest in the continued and progressive implementation of the Final Act and to discuss the prospects for Madrid.  I had a useful exchange of views on this question during the recent visits of the Foreign Ministers of Austria and Yugoslavia and will also discuss the issues in the near future with the Foreign Minister of Finland.</P>
    <P>As regards Ireland's specific contribution in the economic area during our Presidency, the Deputy will be aware that many of the economic chapter matters fall within the competence of the Community and there is consequently little room for initiatives by individual member states in these matters. Nevertheless as President Ireland will seek to further as far as possible Community preparations for the Madrid Review Meeting, bearing in mind the totality of the Final Act.  We will also make a contribution within the Community to the negotiations with CMEA, which are complex and difficult.</P>
    <P>It is too early at this stage to define our approach to the Madrid meeting in concrete terms.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that it will be guided by our concern to promote the peaceful development of co-operation in Europe for the benefit of all our peoples.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether he has any expectation that the results of the Madrid conference will be more satisfactory than the results of the Belgrade conference which, from the <Col N="32" /> point of view of the West, appeared to be unsatisfactory?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Kavanagh</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if it is proposed to publish a statement indicating Ireland's formal position in relation to the terms of entry of the Republic of Greece into the EEC; and if such a document, if published, will contain any assessment of how the entry of that country is likely to affect Ireland's position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the accession negotiations with Greece have now reached their conclusion.  It is expected that the Treaty of Accession will be signed in Athens on 28 May 1979 and allowing time for ratification by national parliaments, Greece is expected to become the Tenth Member of the Community on 1 January 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In due course a resolution will be brought before Dáil Éireann for approval of the terms of the Greek Treaty of Accession.  There are no plans to publish a document of the sort described by the Deputies but, as I said, the Dáil will have an opportunity to discuss the terms on which Greece will enter the Community.  Deputies will also be aware that I have on many occasions expressed support for Greek membership while at the same time advocating measures to <Col N="33" /> alleviate structural and regional disparities in the existing Community.  I may say that up to now we have been satisfied from a national point of view with the arrangements which have been arrived at in the context of the negotiations with Greece.  We will have an opportunity of discussing these arrangements in the course of the debate on the resolution I have referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With specific reference to Question No. 25, I asked if it was the Government's intention to publish either by way of a document or in the course of the Government's speech on the resolution a statement giving an indication of the Government's assessment of the entry of Greece into the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the debate will give ample scope but I am not aware that the Government will take the opportunity to tell us anything.  Is it the Government's intention to publish, either by way of a document in advance of the resolution or during the course of the Minister's speech, a detailed assessment of the effect of the entry of Greece into the Community on our performance and prospects?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in assuming that this debate will not take place until the terms are already signed, sealed and delivered?  Secondly, is the Minister aware that Greece will become the only country in the EEC with a lower GNP per head than Ireland and that, therefore, they will be making demands which are not now being made on the regional and social funds, thereby making less money available for Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered Deputy Bruton's question.  I stated that while supporting the Greek application there are many aspects in regard to the existing structural and regional disparities in the present Community which are obviously of concern to us, with a further country having a lower national product becoming a member of the community. That goes without saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Irish Government, at the time the Greek application was made, made two pre-conditions in no unfriendly spirit towards Greece.  The pre-condition to the opening of negotiations was that additional resources should be provided <i>pro rata</i> with the expansion of the Community and this was accepted.  The second pre-condition was that the conclusion of negotiations would be preceded by a significant improvement in the <Col N="35" /> decision-making mechanism of the Community.  Will the Minister say what has happened to the second Irish pre-condition? Has anything been done about it or has it been dropped?  Is action to be taken on it before this matter is finally concluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the second aspect is concerned, Ireland is pursuing vigorously the whole question of the improvement of the decision-making process of the Community.  This matter has been taken up by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in several discussions at summit level and elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for once must not dodge the question.  We made it a pre-condition of the conclusion of negotiations, in the most formal way, that there must be a change in the decision-making mechanism to make it more effective.  Has that been dropped? Will the Minister answer a straight question?</P>

      <P>Without in any way questioning your ruling which I entirely accept, would you allow me to raise very briefly the question of the way the House does its business in regard to Private Notice Questions?

      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling but merely because I put down this question yesterday it was just outside the three days for getting on to Thursday's Order Paper.  It may duly appear on Thursday's Order Paper on the grounds that this is still in advance of Friday when the notice will expire.  It may be on Thursday's Order Paper, but in the rotation it will not appear until October, by which time, for all I know, the factory may be sold or closed down.  Surely the rotation of questions is a matter which ought to be looked at as a practical feature in the practice of the House in regard to Private Notice Questions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a number of points about the Finance Bill.  This Bill, in line with financial policy during the last two years, will not help those most in need.  The best way to illustrate this is by referring to what has happened to a large family with, say, six children as compared with a married couple who have no children.  Since 1974-1975 the tax-free allowance of the married couple with six children has increased by 76 per cent, whereas the tax-free allowance for the married couple without children has increased by 178 per cent.  In other words, the married couple without children have received two-and-a-half times the increase in the tax-free allowance of the couple with six children. This is most unfair.</P>
      <P>The argument is made that this is to facilitate the provision of money for increases in children's allowances for the really poor, but there is no reason that only people in the middle-income group with large families should have to bear the burden of increasing children's allowances for those who are really poor. Surely the entire community, whether or not they have large numbers of children, should be asked to pay for this.  All taxpayers should be asked to pay for increases in children's allowance.  In fact, increases in children's allowance under the social welfare code have not at all kept pace with the increases in the tax-free allowances for married couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1974-75 the increases in the children's allowances in the social welfare code have been only 43 per cent <Col N="54" /> whereas the tax-free allowance of a married couple with no children has gone up by 178 per cent, about four times as much.  Families with children, both under the tax code and the social welfare code, are doing a great deal worse than families with no children.  Not being married and not having children myself, I am not hostile to couples with no children but I believe everybody must agree that their needs are less than the needs of a family with six children.  In our financial code over the past four or five years we have been progressively discriminating against people with large families.  That is wrong.  Also those who are helping to keep people out of institutions where they would be a complete burden on the State, and keeping them in the family, have been doing very badly.  I have already said that the dependent relative allowance has gone up by a mere £15 since 1974-75 or 18 per cent&mdash;that is the allowance under the tax code.  The tax-free allowance of a married couple with no children and no dependent relative has gone up by ten times that amount.  It is entirely wrong to be giving ten times as much of an increase in tax-free allowances to a married couple with no children as you are giving to a married couple looking after a dependent relative.  That is what has happened in our tax code over the last five years and it is entirely unjust.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the blind persons's allowance has only gone up since 1974-75 by a mere £25 or 17 per cent while the married person's allowance has gone up by 178 per cent, ten times as much.  The whole trend of our tax code has been to help people with few children, living on credit and who have a high income and not to help those with a large number of children, a large number of dependent relatives and a large number of responsibilities and people to look after.  We are encouraging people with those responsibilities to pass them on to the State, put their people into institutions and in some way not to look after members of the family in the home.  We are giving back the money we are taking from them to married couples who have little or no responsibility.  We are also giving it to single people who have little or no responsibility because their increase has <Col N="55" /> also been quite high, though not quite as high as in the case of married couples but a great deal higher than the increase given to a married couple with six children.  That is the wrong sort of policy to pursue and it is something that should be condemned.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are discussing a Finance Bill here today which does not represent the last word of the Government on financial policy is a sad reflection on the sovereignty of the Dáil.  Since this Finance Bill was presented an entirely new financial package has been put to the people, an entirely new regime of farmer taxation has been presented.  Entirely new proposals on general taxation have also been presented.  These are not in the Finance Bill and were not in the budget.  They were negotiated with people who are not in this Dáil in negotiations which did not take place in public and they will be sanctioned outside the Dáil.  That indicates that the importance of the Dáil in the making of financial policy has greatly diminished as a result in part of the fact that we are prepared to give tax concessions in order to get national wage agreements.  If in the long run the cost of obtaining wage agreements is to ensure that financial policy is no longer made in Dáil Éireann by the elected representatives of the people but negotiated outside Dáil Éireann with groups outside this House I believe we are paying a very high price for national wage agreements.  This is something we as legislators should consider very carefully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is against negotiation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I say we should look very carefully at this because we represent in this House the people who are not in those negotiations.  We represent the people who are not in trade unions, not party to the national understanding, the people on fixed incomes, retired people, children and others who are losing in these negotiations.  We represent all the people as no pressure group does and if our say in the making of tax policy is diminished I believe democracy in this <Col N="56" /> country is diminished.  It is in large measure our fault that this has happened because we have not reformed our financial procedures so as to make sure that Deputies are in a position to contribute. As I have said elsewhere, I believe that very radical changes need to be made in our tax policy and in the way tax and expenditure matters are dealt with in this House so that the diminution of the authority of the Dáil in financial matters will not continue.  Since this is not the occasion to discuss it I shall not proceed further on this matter.</P>
      <P>We are told that if the national understanding goes ahead £39 million will be given back to the PAYE sector at the end of the year in increased tax free allowances. What is not mentioned is that as a result of a 15 per cent increase in incomes the Government will net £127 million in increased income tax receipts because more people will be in higher tax bands.  So, in return for the national understanding wage increase bringing the Government £187 million in extra receipts they will give back a mere £39 million in tax reductions at the end of the year.  It does not seem to me that the wage earner is doing particularly well on that deal, giving up £187 million to get £39 million back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need to encourage industrial harmony through the tax code.  One way it can be done is by giving a tax incentive to the introduction of profit sharing in industry.  This has been an item in the policy of my party since 1965 and I believe it should be implemented in an early Finance Bill.  If you give a tax incentive for profit-sharing schemes you can use them as a means not only of encouraging workers to identify with the interests of the firm in which they are working and so achieve greater industrial peace but also as a means to reward employees of firms which are particularly profitable.  You can use a profit-sharing scheme to achieve that. One of the problems in national wage agreements has always been that they do not provide a means to reward the employees of firms that are particularly profitable and it tends to be those employees who are against national wage agreements and make their <Col N="57" /> negotiation difficult.  A profit-sharing scheme for such employees would supersede their objections by giving them the income in the form of a sharing in profits apart from their normal wage.</P>
    <P>I believe there is need for the introduction of indexation of tax-free allowances. This is one of the policies of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I have made a study of this and I know it operates in Canada and Denmark.  I have been in correspondence with the Minister for Finance in Canada on the matter and I should like to quote very briefly from a letter which he has sent me and which shows how indexation has worked in Canada since it was introduced there in 1974.  He says:</P>
    <P>Section 171 of the Income Tax Act is the legislative basis for adjusting personal exemptions and tax brackets automatically each year for inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index.  The exemptions to which the indexing applies are described in sections 109 and 110 of the Act while the tax brackets are described in section 170 of the Act.</P>
    <P>Our Department should look very closely at those provisions of the Canadian legislation and introduce an automatic indexation of tax-free allowances.  Over the years what has happened is that taxation has been increased here by the operation of inflation without an increase in tax rates and without the authority of the Dáil.  If there is automatic indexation any increase in taxation would have to get the authority of the Dáil because indexation would ensure that inflation did not do the job of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote one further passage from the letter of the Minister for Finance in Canada.  He said:</P>
    <P>Contrary to initial fears indexing has not had any destabilising effect on the economy.  Several economic studies have indicated that timely tax cuts from indexing played a significant role in moderating the impact in Canada of deep recession experienced by our trading partners during 1974-75.</P>
    <P>This letter is signed by M. Jean Chrétien, <Col N="58" /> the Minister for Finance in Canada.  The matters contained in it should have the attention of our Department of Finance with a view to the introduction of automatic indexation in the next budget.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the taxation of farmers in particular which is dealt with in this Bill and in other pronouncements by the Government. The entire debate on taxation of farmers has been carried out on the assumption that a given share of the total income of the entire agriculture sector should be taken in taxation.  No other sector of our economy is taxed on the basis of a share of the income of the entire sector.  Other sectors of the economy are taxed on the basis of a share of the income of the individual members of the sector.  I do not think it is fair that farmers alone should be taxed on their sectoral gross income and a share taken of that.  They should be taxed as self-employed persons, the same as other self-employed.  Agriculture should not be treated separately in the matter of determining what its share should be.  We do not have any figures as to the total income of doctors and we do not look for a given share of all doctors' incomes.  We do not have any figures for the total income of lawyers and do not look for a given share of all lawyers' incomes.  Why should we look for a given share of the income of all farmers? In fact it is demonstrable that a huge number of farmers do not have incomes that would exceed their tax-free allowance yet their incomes were all included in the gross figure of agricultural income when the alleged fair share of agricultural income was being calculated by the Government.  The taxation of farmers should not be on that basis.  The 2 per cent levy and the resource tax are both unrelated to ability to pay.  No other sector of the community is being taxed on a fixed rate basis, whether they make a profit or not.</P>
    <P>The agricultural levy will ultimately be passed back by means of the operation of the market place to those farmers who must accept whatever price they get and cannot quickly switch to another line of production.  Typically, the farmer in this position will be the small farmer with poor land suitable to only one line <Col N="59" /> of production.  The store cattle producer does not directly pay the levy because he is not selling cattle into slaughter or for export, but because of the operation of the market place and the elasticities of demand ultimately the farmer who will pay the levy will be the small store cattle producer in the west who is not in a position to switch to other lines to avoid the levy, whereas people with better land in better parts of the country can do so. This needs to be hammered home.</P>
    <P>The resource tax, also, is unrelated to ability to pay.  It starts at the moment at £3.50 per £ of poor law valuation, on farms above £70 poor law valuation. That, probably, in itself is not a very high figure.  However, once this tax is introduced there is nothing to stop the Government from doubling, trebling or quadrupling the rate of resource tax next year and bringing in other farmers later on.  It is worth reminding people that when income tax was introduced it only applied to farmers with over £100 valuation; it now applies to over £40 valuation. The resource tax applies now to farmers over £70 valuation.  There is no assurance whatever that this resource tax will not be £10 per £ of poor law valuation next year and £20 the following year, bringing in more farmers. Indeed, this seems to be the way it is pointing and it is unfair because that tax is not related to any profit being made on the land.  A profit may have been made this year but there is no guarantee that a similar profit will be made next year.  Indeed, it is quite possible, as a result of a combination of a food surplus and an energy crisis which reduces people's ability to buy food and the community's ability to support agricultural surpluses, we could have a serious recession in agriculture in the next three or four years.  If you have an income tax position where agricultural incomes go down and income tax payments go down, although the farmer may face a problem he is not being unfairly treated. However, if farmers are on a resource tax and agricultural incomes generally go down, no Government will reduce the resource tax; it will stay at the level fixed <Col N="60" /> for this year and next, even in the face of an agricultural recession.  Farmers could, under this resource tax system, find themselves paying out taxation from incomes they do not have.  If they were on an income tax system that would not happen.  The tax, being based on poor law valuation, does not reflect real incomes in agriculture.</P>
    <P>In Donegal-Leitrim farmers earn between £20 and £40 per £ poor law valuation.  On the other hand, farmers in Cork, Limerick and Clare earn four times as much.  They earn between £80 and £100 per £ poor law valuation.  Yet, all these farmers have to pay exactly the same resource tax, which is not fair because it is not related to what those farmers are earning.  The resource tax is nothing more than a wealth tax on agricultural land.  If a wealth tax for a 75-acre farm is justified, why did the Government abolish wealth tax for those who hold their wealth in the form of house property, shares, antiques, painting and so on?  These latter people have been exempted from a wealth tax by Fianna Fáil.  Farmers alone among people who own property will have to pay a wealth tax in the form of a resource tax.  Why is this discrimination taking place?  It is obvious that farmers with 75 acres or so have no influence with Fianna Fáil, while the people with house property, who were leaving the country because of the wealth tax, had influence with the Government and succeeded in getting the wealth tax abolished.  Farmers could not leave the country.  They alone among property owners are being asked to pay a wealth tax because of this resource tax being introduced.</P>
    <P>Take the example of a 100-acre farm. Taking all taxes together the 100-acre farmers will earn about £10,000 a year. He will be paying about 25 per cent income tax, £2,500, rates £1,400 and resource tax £350&mdash;a total tax on an income of £10,000 of £4,250.  A self-employed person, on the other hand, with the same income will pay 25 per cent, or only £2,500.  In other words, a farmer with £10,000 annual income will be paying £2,000 more tax than a self-employed person on an equal income. <Col N="61" /> The farmer would be paying almost half his income in tax under the combined tax system.  Farmers should be put on the same basis as farmers in Northern Ireland.  They pay income tax on accounts the same as everyone else; they have no resource tax, levy or rates.  They are treated the same as other self-employed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I refer to the situation in relation to inheritance tax.  This is a particularly heavy burden on farmers. When it was introduced, farmers were told the threshold would be adjusted regularly in line with inflation, so that the level of the farmer paying inheritance tax on a transfer from father to son would be the same, at any given time, as it was when the tax was introduced in 1975.  The fact is, if we take the example of a 100-acre farmer, that he would have been completely exempt in 1975.  Indeed, anyone with an acreage up to 220 acres would have been exempt from capital acquisition tax when the tax was introduced. Now if you have 80 acres of land, you are into the inheritance tax net. Without any money changing hands a transfer from father to son, to take the example of a 100-acre farm being transferred on death, the son would have to pay £22,500 inheritance tax, or the equivalent of the income derived from two-and-a-half years' work.  In the case of a 200-acre farmer, if he were transferring his land to his son he would have to pay £165,000 inheritance tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene briefly in this debate to make a few points on certain aspects of the Finance Bill and to make some suggestions on things which were omitted from the Finance Bill, and <Col N="62" /> which I think might be helpful in many areas, in regard to the economic and ordinary life of the people.  In my experience budgets have always been kept secret, except from the Cabinet, prior to their introduction in the House and they were the final word on how the Government of the day proposed to run the affairs of the country during the year ahead.  On this occasion a new departure was taken in that the budget seems to be negotiable.  The programme was set out, and before the ink was dry, a lot of the provisions in the budget were being renegotiated.  The Government backtracked in relation to the 2 per cent levy on farmers.  They then negotiated as to how this money could be raised from the farming community through some other method.  This was a complete departure from the procedure in previous budgets. Up to this year the ordinary people, and the people not involved in the framing of a budget, had to accept the criteria set out as to how the county would be run.</P>
      <P>The Minister thought it right at the introduction of the budget to introduce a 2 per cent levy on certain agricultural commodities but changed his mind quickly and was prepared to negotiate as to how the money could be raised in other ways.  I am not against farmers paying tax but the 2 per cent levy is the wrong way to do it.  Apparently the 2 per cent levy was reintroduced and was due to operate from early May.  It is hard to know now whether it is operating at all, but I understand that as far as the Minister is concerned, it is operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This 2 per cent levy is a mistake and has been shown to be so by subsequent events in my constituency.  Since its introduction there was a complete drying up of the supply of fat cattle to the meat factories.  In Leixlip there are 450 workers employed in the meat plant and they have been under notice since last Friday because no cattle have come into the factory.  About 1,000 people are employed in three meat processing factories in Kildare and their jobs are in jeopardy because of the 2 per cent levy. A person who wishes to evade the tax cannot bring the cattle to the meat factory. If cattle are being exported agents <Col N="63" /> can buy them anywhere.  Apparently the port is the place where the levy is collected; but no one can say what was paid per head of cattle when they were bought.</P>
    <P>The levy is a major obstacle to promoting the meat processing industry. I met the three managers of the three meat processing factories in my constituency and they unanimously agreed that the levy would have a detrimental effect on the full-time employment of the 1,000 workers in Kildare.  Apart from that aspect, I oppose this levy because I oppose any tax that has no regard for a person's ability to pay.  This levy takes no account of the person who sells one pig, bullock or calf; he is expected to pay the levy in the same manner as the man who sells hundreds of cattle.</P>
    <P>It is well known that in the last few years the buying, fattening and selling of cattle to meat factories has not been very profitable.  A man might buy 300 cattle at £300 or £400 each.  The money to buy the cattle would have been borrowed and he would have to pay a high rate of interest on the money, so that when the cattle were finally resold, deducting the interest, the cost of feeding and so on, a man might make a profit of less than £50 per head.  I do not have much sympathy for beef barons, the rich men who can change their methods of farming overnight, the men who can go into grain growing or beet growing, but I am worried about the situation because these men are the kind of people who keep our factories going through the winter months when cattle are not available off grass.  These men are the principal suppliers who keep the workers in full-time employment in the factories. We have now reached a situation where one factory have given notice to their employees that they will close down for one month at least and possibly three. Responsibility for that rests squarely on the shoulders of the Minister for Finance for introducing this stupid levy.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that I am not saying farmers should not pay tax.  I say they should pay tax, that anyone with a taxable income should pay tax.  During the period of office of the previous Government <Col N="64" /> and of this Government I met farmers in my constituency and I told them in no uncertain terms that I thought they should pay tax on their accounts the same as every businessman in the community.  I make no bones about this.  In fairness to the IFA and to many larger farmers in my constituency, they agreed it was the only fair way of taxing farmers.  Why should a man with a small shop or a person engaged in a small way in the building industry have no option but to pay tax on his accounts? If such a person does not pay his taxes the Revenue Commissioners will send him an assessment and he will come forward with his accounts very quickly.  The same method should be applied in the case of farmers.</P>
    <P>There has been a tradition here of making a special case for farmers and making an exception of them.  I do not think this should be done for any section. Farmers should be dealt with in the same way as shopkeepers, small builders or the unfortunate man on the milk round.  If these people do not pay their taxes the Revenue Commissioners send them assessments that are three or four times what they know they would have to pay if they submitted their accounts. A period of 21 days is allowed to make an appeal to the Revenue Commissioners and the people concerned can submit accounts in that time.  The farmers should be treated in this way.</P>
    <P>The question of land structure is vital. The Chair may say this is not relevant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I will relate it to the Bill in this way.  One of the most serious problems facing agriculture is land structure. This Finance Bill can help by making provision for people to live and work on the land.  A prohibitive stamp duty should be imposed in the case of the sale of land to people who have sufficient land already or who are not interested in agriculture.  Such stamp duty should apply to farmers who have enough land already.  These people are buying up land and are ensuring that small farmers <Col N="65" /> cannot afford to buy much-needed acres.  The person who has sufficient land should be prevented in every possible way from acquiring more land and an obvious way this can be done is by imposing a prohibitive stamp duty.  If a person has more than a certain amount of land or has a valuation in excess of a certain figure, he should be charged at least 50 per cent tax duty.  That would give a chance to the smaller man who needs the land if he is to survive in agriculture.</P>
      <P>The same should apply to multinationals who are buying up agricultural land.  They are making a laughing stock of the Land Commission because they are signing legal agreements with people and are not transferring the land.  This is happening in my constituency and elsewhere.  Recently I met a group of farmers from Kerry and they told me that 700 acres had been bought by a German company.  The land had not been transferred because the Land Commission, in carrying out the provisions of the Land Act, would not transfer it.  There was some kind of agreement between the foreign company and the owners of the smallholdings but many people who needed that land to survive were out of the market.</P>
      <P>The Minister has an opportunity in this Finance Bill to do something about the matter.  We were told that a Bill dealing with land structure would be brought before the House before the end of the year, that the heads of the Bill were before the Minister for Agriculture at the end of last year.  If something is not done about the problem now we will be back to worse days than in the time of Michael Davitt, with ranchers, multinationals, foreigners and very large farmers owning all the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I shall be proposing an amendment to impose large stamp duty on sales of the kind I have mentioned.  So far as the Land Commission are concerned, the acquisition of large holdings has finished completely by direction of this Government. The Land Commission are refusing to take over holdings and are introducing regulations that have not been used for many years, such as limiting the miles <Col N="66" /> when assessing applications.  I ask the Minister to help in the situation by way of increasing stamp duty on the purchase of land by people who have sufficient land.  In my area a multinational bought agricultural land several years ago and sold it back to a Government agency for industry a few months ago at ten times what they paid for it.  If this is allowed to go on we will be back to a worse situation than anything experienced previously.  We used to talk about absentee landlords. We are now talking about Germans and others owning our land.  Small farmers have no option but to sell to them because they cannot hope to increase their holdings to make them viable.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to try to do something about this in the Finance Bill and not to wait for the proposed land restructuring Bill of the Minister for Agriculture.  This multinational cheque book buying of land by foreigners must be stopped.  The land must be left available at competitive prices to private buyers or for acquisition and distribution by the Land Commission to small holders who want to stay on the land and who are willing and able to work it. A provision could be inserted in the Finance Bill in relation to stamp duty on land sales, and I will try as best I can, within the rules of order, to try to devise amendments to that effect.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the amount of money being made available this year to local authorities is greater than a few years ago but councils have been told the areas to which it will be allocated.  I will give a typical example.  The Minister for Finance is the final arbiter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will give examples and the Chair can stop me if I am out of order.  In Kildare, the county manager looked for £889,000 from the capital budget for schemes of new houses.  He had the support of the council.  He got £135,000.  It was a complete waste of time because of the kind of bungling that has gone on in relation to the capital budget.  I am not saying it is wrong to have abolished the car tax or the rates, but they were a pre-election gimmick and the revenue has not been replaced for local projects.  As a result, local finances have been starved.  In Kildare there has been an extra bill of £155,000 which they could not pay last year.  It occurred because of the new VAT Act. That kind of juggling is nothing but a three-card-trick by the Government because local councils are without the money.  Anybody travelling the roads, which are full of potholes, will know what I am talking about.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about the PAYE sector.  The Government have told us about the great concessions that were given to them this year in the budget.  In the last year of the Coalition Government and in Fianna Fáil's first year, reliefs amounting to £50 million annually were given to the PAYE sector. This year the amount is £27 million.  We all know that in the previous two years the £50 million was swallowed up in inflation and that any wage increases given disappeared in that way.  This year, despite all the crowing about the great benefits, a worse situation prevails because the amount has been only £27 million, and that is the main reason why the PAYE people took to the streets. Under successive Governments&mdash;I do not want to blame any Government unfairly&mdash;the public sector, who represent a big percentage of the workers, have been treated badly.  They are the sector who are most frustrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks about this great national understanding&mdash;I do not know what understanding there is&mdash;which he has ironed out with the ICTU.  I am not too sure that it is the wonderful thing he said it is, but we are not discussing that here and I have my own views on it which I may express elsewhere.  That <Col N="68" /> kind of understanding has the faults of many more agreements and understandings in that it is percentage-bound. If you have percentages here, there and everywhere you have the fellow with the low wage getting the low percentage and the fellow with the high income, high ownership and high everything else getting the high percentage.  That is not good.  I am not saying that this is peculiar to the present Government; it has been going on for a long time on the same lines of 15 per cent over two years or over 15 months or whatever it is. That will never solve the problem.</P>
    <P>The removal of food subsidies was a most retrograde step in the context of the budget and of the national wage agreements.  People would prefer to know that there would be some price stabilisation and smaller income increases. After the performance of this Government over the last six months I do not blame people for fighting to have their wages doubled.  Inflation as far as food prices are concerned has really gone mad.  I am hearing this day in and day out from ordinary people, and I claim that I am as well acquainted with the ordinary, plain working people as any Member of this House.  The worst and most disappointing thing for the ordinary public in regard to the Government is that at the last election the Fianna Fáil Party gave the impression that food prices would not rise.  Everyone knows about their shopping basket and how it was displayed on television and at every street corner and brought around the supermarkets and how the prices were compared with previous prices and so on.  Somehow people got the impression&mdash;and fair play to Fianna Fáil, I admire their machine which got that message across so well-that they were going to do something about it.  Lo and behold, this has been the greatest disappointment for the ordinary people.  Not alone did the Government do nothing about controlling prices, but they deliberately added to price increases by the removal of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House.  I will be here on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have put some very relevant points before the Minister.  I ask him to consider <Col N="69" /> them and particularly the one that more could probably be done for the improvement of the land structure in this country than by the Bill to be introduced at the end of the year by his colleague.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House is to give effect to a budget which will go down in history as one of the fiasco budgets of the century.  Never before in the history of parliamentary budgets has there been so much confusion and confrontation and so little conviction and courage.  The Government's composite memoirs, if they are ever written, could be entitled aptly &ldquo;Profiles in Cowardice&rdquo; or &ldquo;Why Ireland Slept&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wish to dwell a little on why a Government with such a majority are so cowardly and weak, and then I want to deal with the subject of why Ireland sleeps and endures the industrial and social nightmare that now haunts us. Cowardice in Dublin parlance is normally connected with or represented by the colour yellow.  The Lynch Government is the yellow Government who published in quick succession white papers and green papers equally insipid, equally infirm and equally based on inequality, particularly as far as taxation is concerned. There lies the paradox.  There lies the root of the Government's cowardice. They were elected as and remain the Government of privilege, of the stiff upper lip and the hard neck.  Their pampering of the rich and the very rich leaves them exposed nakedly to the wrath of the organised masses so that when confronted by the organised farmers they cave in not, as many suppose, to diminish the tax taken from the farmers but simply because the Government's budgetary proposals, like their election manifesto promises, are based not on sure and defensible grounds of social justice but on the indefensible grounds of pandering to the rich.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was of course the caving in to the farmers which ignited the smouldering indignation of people on PAYE and brought unprecedented thousands on to the streets.  Indeed, given the provisions of the national understanding, it is very clear that those unprecedented marching thousands wasted their time and that the <Col N="70" /> Government have learned nothing from those demonstrations.  The fear that controlled the Government five or six weeks ago as the thousands marched by this House&mdash;fear not merely for the Government but also for the system&mdash;has been forgotten.  A deep wedge, hitherto avoided by fair play, has been driven between town and country.  I submit to this House that this is potentially the most divisive occurrence in Irish history since Partition.  A new division in our society has, in the light of its eventual importance, gone relatively unheralded inside and outside the Dáil.  A tax curtain has fallen right across Ireland to the extent that one section of our land is beginning to look at the other not so much as the beloved Mother Ireland but as the begrudging Step-Mother Ireland. We are a nation divided against itself. One of my constituents, describing it as a nation like Humpty-Dumpty, wrote to me as follows: &ldquo;Humpty-Dumpty elected to the Dáil, Humpty-Dumpty had a great fall.  All Jack's promises and all Jack's men Won't get poor Humpty moving together again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ireland is Humpty and Ireland is humped so long as it sleeps and tolerates this nightmare.  This division in Irish society is due solely and totally to the financial policies of a mistaken, unjust and inept Government, a Government for whom it is to be regretted the bell does not yet toll.  This division is based on the notion that the other side are not paying their fair share of tax or that their own side, for one reason or another are being asked to pay a disproportionate share of taxation.</P>
    <P>My first reaction to the budget and the subsequent climb down to the farmers was that the Government would exploit the town and country divide, ending up extracting more taxation from both.  I said as much in a speech I made at Thurles, County Tipperary, a few days after that infamous climbdown.  The point I made then was described by one commentator as innocent and, by another, as precipitate.  Three months after budget day what are the facts?  The budget and this Finance Bill provide for a 37 per cent increase in PAYE receipts. That is the Minister's own figure and one <Col N="71" /> that will have to be amended not downwards but upwards as a result of the proposed national understanding. Therefore, the House must agree that the thousands who marched around this House and the streets of this and other cities a few weeks ago wasted their time and taught nothing to a Government sold to the rich.  The climbdown which precipitated these huge PAYE demonstrations and the consequent deep divisions in our society have ended up with no concession whatsoever, on the one hand, to the PAYE sector and, on the other, the clobbering of all farmers, big and small, regardless of their ability to pay.</P>
    <P>It is no part of my brief as a Dublin Deputy to plead the case of farmers.  But it is a fundamental commitment of mine and of my party to social justice that compels us to oppose the 2 per cent levy. It is unjust in its application, as is the imposition of income tax on the PAYE sector. I shall not continue at length about the 2 per cent levy.  That has been dealt with by my colleague, Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <P>However, I want to come to my central criticism of this Bill, of the national understanding and so on, which is the Government's treatment of those in the PAYE sector.  If one considers merely the budget provisions in regard to changes in income tax, as if nothing else whatsoever had happened, perhaps I may be allowed cite my own case.  As a married man with three children my personal allowance goes up by £500.  That is immediately reduced in respect of three children, £22 each, by a total of £66.  I lose £500 at 20p and pay now at 25p.  That is £500×5p, totalling £25. Translated into a tax-free allowance, that is £75.  Therefore, I lose £400 at 25p, and am now paying at 35p, a difference of 10p.  The total extra in tax is £40, the equivalent of a tax-free allowance of £120, and I lose my social welfare tax allowance, a total of £68. Therefore, £66, £75, £120 and £68 total £329.  If one deducts that figure from £500 increase in married allowance one is left with a net increase of £171 tax-free allowance or, when paid at standard rate, amounts to something like £55 a <Col N="72" /> year or slightly over £1 a week.  That is the so-called benefit of this budget to me as a married person with three children. And that is before one takes account of the first budget of this year, the one which removed the food subsidies.  My wife when she goes to the shops now must pay more for her bread, butter, milk, cheese and so on and, as any mother with three children will tell you, the increased price of those commodities amounts to a great deal more than £1 a week.</P>
    <P>Like the great majority of taxpayers, I am a net loser under the tax adjustments in this budget.  That constitutes the most annoying factor for those people at work who read the headlines the day after the budget: &ldquo;£500 increase in tax-free allowance.&rdquo; Again expectations were raised falsely because, when the 6 April came and went and likewise the first pay packet, there was not that extra cash to be found in the pay packet as the workforce were so erroneously led to expect; in many cases, there was less.  Certainly there was less for the wives who had previously demanded an increase in the take-home pay to meet the increased food costs brought about directly by the financial policies of a Government who understand little and care nothing for the problems not merely of the poor but of the majority of our people living from week to week.  Those false expectations are at the root of so many of our problems.  As I have said so many times before both inside and outside this House, many of our industrial problems today are connected with the euphoric expectations engendered by the infamous manifesto of 1977: we could have everything for nothing, nothing would have to be paid for.  The people took the Government at their word. Then came the 1979 Budget with a £500 increase by way of tax-free allowance for married couples.  What most people immediately read from that was that they would pay £500×35p less in tax. That is what people were led to believe, that they would have 500 times 35p extra in their pay packets.  That was deliberately misleading to the people.  It may have been good for a week or two following the budget but was disastrous in the medium and long term.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> I should now like to deal with the terms of the Finance Bill as they affect the proposed national understanding.  At the outset I should like to state that Fine Gael fully support, and have always done, the concept of national centralised bargaining because we believe that such centralised bargaining offers the best hope of bringing about industrial peace. We must admit that last year's national pay agreement did not bring about industrial peace but rather its provisions fuelled the industrial chaos which now haunts us.  Towards the end of last year, when the initial negotiations on the national understanding commenced, we expressed the hope that it would not be a repeat of the 1978 agreement.  We stated that Fine Gael would consider canvassing against any agreement that was similar to the 1978 one.  We made that statement not because we were opposed to centralised bargaining but because the 8 per cent pay agreement last year turned out to be an average of 16 per cent.  It was highly inflationary and not in keeping with the objective of job creation. That was our concern then as it is our concern now.</P>
    <P>What then will be the effect of the Finance Bill on this new national understanding and other matters for 1979? According to the ESRI the estimated total national pay bill at the end of the 1978 pay agreement was £3,775 million and a 15 per cent increase on that would raise the pay bill by £585 million.  It must be remembered that one-third of that increase will go straight to the Exchequer under the PAYE system and a little more in social insurance.  My calculation is that the Exchequer will benefit to the tune of £190 million.  The so-called rebate of £35 million at the end of the year is, by comparison, an insulting response to those thousands of people who demonstrated in this and other cities a few weeks ago.  It is not a response to the genuine grievances held by the people in the PAYE sector because the net result at the end of the current tax year will not be that the people will pay £39 million less but that they will be paying at least £150 million more.</P>
    <P>The Government have not learned <Col N="74" /> anything from the deep-felt sense of injustice of the PAYE sector.  The worry is that the ignoring of the grievances not alone threatens the Government but, as was privately articulated around the House by Members of the Government party and Opposition, threatens the system.  Like the £500 increase in the marriage allowance which turned out to be a mirage, taking into account the removal of the food subsidies, the tax provisions of the national pay understanding will mean little.  That is the area to which I am opposed.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to comment on the scale of the increase except to say that without any wage drift it will be three times what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development were talking about a few months ago and is a long way from the rigid discipline which the Taoiseach spoke about some months ago.  It stinks more of an electoral tactic than economic strategy. Like the £500 tax allowance increase, the beneficiaries will not know the true extent of the fraud being perpetrated upon them until they receive the increase.</P>
    <P>In case there is any misunderstanding I should like to state that Fine Gael are anxious to see the national understanding carried.  We understand the reservations of certain unions but we want that agreement carried because, warts and all, we believe it is better than any alternative in the short term. However, we also have a duty to point out that the increase in the pay packet would be the same if there was a 10 per cent tax-free increase.  The 15 per cent taxed increase will have the damaging result of increasing costs 15 per cent more than a tax-free 10 per cent increase. Therefore, it reduces Irish competitiveness and reduces also our hopes and aspirations for job creation.  And one of the most important aspects of the national understanding is in the area of job creation.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the General Secretary of the ICTU speaking in defence of the national understanding said that it related to more than pay.  It is an understanding which not merely promises the creation of 25,000 jobs&mdash;and who could <Col N="75" /> have any credence in a Fianna Fáil promise&mdash;but guarantees the creation of this number of jobs.  A better way of creating the environment in which extra jobs could be provided would be to maintain and, where possible, improve Irish competitiveness so that we might sell our goods more easily abroad, a situation which in turn would ensure at home that there would be jobs in the area of the production of the goods concerned. Yet the tax provisions of this Bill mean that a 15 per cent increase in wages with the consequent increases in costs and prices is necessary where a 10 per cent increase would have been sufficient if the Government had accepted Deputy FitzGerald's proposal for the indexation of tax allowances and tax bands.</P>
    <P>The environment for job creation is disimproved by reason of those tax provisions which, therefore, are in conflict with the guarantee of the provision of 25,000 new jobs.  I call, too, for an acceptance of the national understanding but regardless of whether it is accepted, we all have the right to expect the Government to create the promised 25,000 jobs.  The country needs those jobs.  It is wrong that that man of high repute, the General Secretary of the ICTU, should seem to threaten those who would oppose the national understanding by saying that if it is not accepted there will not be jobs.  That seems to imply that the Government would sulk in their corner in such circumstances and would not provide the jobs that are so necessary.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the implications for the Exchequer and regardless of the consequences of having to increase perhaps the percentage of GNP which will be borrowed this year, it would be better for the Minister to reconsider the income tax provisions in this Bill.  It would be helpful if he would tell the House how much it would cost, for instance, to index-link pay increases and how much it would cost if the Government were to agree not to take any tax as a result of the pay increases. He might tell us also what would be the benefits of such an approach or what would be the loss to the <Col N="76" /> Exchequer.  Obviously, there must be money in the Exchequer if we are to help create the jobs that we all agree are needed.  Therefore, the Minister might tell us, too, how there could be made up any loss that might result from the policy I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to consider the inflationary aspects of his taxation provisions in terms of the national understanding. I trust that he will tell us whether 5 per cent of the 15 per cent maximum increase proposed will go back to the Exchequer by way of taxation and also whether price increases could be reduced by the Government saying that they would not take extra tax from the pay increases that would result from acceptance of the national understanding. Such a policy, though resulting in a loss of revenue to the Exchequer, would help to bring about a situation of demands for price increases being less than would be the case otherwise and it would help also in the area of our competitiveness abroad and, consequently, our job creation prospects.</P>
    <P>We have been told, not only by the economic mandarins of this House but also by the economic commentators in the media that we need to have a situation of a convergence of wage increase rates, of inflation rates and of growth rates with those of our partners in the EMS, that we need to break away from the British situation of high interest rates and high inflation.  We are told that we need rigid discipline but this year there is a proposal for a basic wage increase of 15 per cent during a 15-month period while in Germany, which is our leading competitor on the continent, there will be pay increases of only 4 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has had a good innings on the national understanding, a subject that was referred to briefly by the Tánaiste and on which other Deputies were allowed to speak briefly.  I would ask the Deputy now to confine his remarks to the Bill which is totally a taxation measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for having been so tolerant and kind.  Now is <Col N="77" /> the time to introduce a system of index-linking income tax having regard to the benefits of such a move in terms of inflation and also in terms of the likely benefits in the area of social stability. The income tax provisions of the Bill purport to improve the income tax situation but that is not so.  This is becoming evident now that we are into the new income tax year.  Constituents have said to me that they understood they would be paying less income tax from 6 April but that they have found this not to be the case.  Yesterday I spoke with a man who has six children and who told me that after the removal of food subsidies he decided to give his wife an extra £4 per week for housekeeping on the basis that he would be paying less tax this year whereas he is paying more.  He said he has lost £22 for each of his six children, that he has lost his social welfare tax allowance, that he has lost the first £500 allowance at 20p.  He said he is now paying taxation at 35p after the first £1,100. He is now paying 45p on some of his income, which he never did before in his life.</P>
      <P>That is the fraud which has been perpetrated by this Finance Bill.  People were led to believe they were getting improvements in income taxation.  That is the fraud and it is being seen to be the fraud.  That is the sort of dishonesty which infuriates people and generates social instability.  It will be seen even more at the end of this year when more and more people go into the 45p bracket which they were never intended to be in. That is happening and the tax provisions in this Finance Bill are an insult to those aggrieved people like myself in the PAYE sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is: will this Finance Bill help to create the thousands of real jobs we need?  Will it help in what must be the central economic problem and challenge to anyone who has any interest in this country&mdash;the creation of jobs?  We have heard a great deal from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and other Ministers and other Fianna Fail personages about job creation. They have talked themselves into believing that so many thousands of jobs <Col N="78" /> have been created.  Will the tax provisions in this Bill improve the possibility of job creation?  This Bill taxes PAYE people more and taxes farmers more.  It is taking money out of the economy and, therefore, it does very little to create the environment necessary for real job creation.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not meet the needs of our times.  It does not meet those needs also because associated with this budget, like the food subsidies, were the changes in the social welfare code, if I may refer to them in passing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the changes in the social welfare code are not contained in this Bill.  That is one of my gripes.  In his speech on the budget the Minister for Health and Social Welfare told us about changes in the social welfare area which nobody else knew about, changes in farmers' dole for instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir. What I am concerned about is the overall impact of this Bill and associated measures on the job creation effort.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it might surprise you, it might surprise some Members of this House, and it might surprise some of our people to know that, even though social insurance contributions here are a great deal less than they are in some other countries as a percentage of income, it still costs a good employer as much as £500 to employ one person.  There is a pay roll tax of £500 when all the new arrangements have been taken into account which, of course, are associated with this Finance Bill.  There is a tax on employment. I am talking about the effect of this Finance Bill on job creation prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> The associated measures which are not contained in this Bill, and which were not contained in the budget, but which were announced before and after it, combine in an aggregate and composite way to tax employment, to make it more difficult to create new jobs, and make it more likely that the State will have to create more fictitious ones, thereby requiring more taxation.  That is the effect of this Finance Bill and the associated measures since 31 December last.  That is a sad commentary when the need to create jobs is the central challenge of the economy.  This Bill and associated measures since 31 December must be judged on whether they help to create the environment in which more real jobs will be created.  I submit to the House that this Bill is a failure on that count.  It is also a failure on the PAYE count.</P>
    <P>It is not my wish to detain the House. When the Minister is replying I should like him to tell us what inflation figure he is now expecting at the end of this year and how that figure is compiled.  We had the magic formula of the Minister of Economic Planning and Development which got the inflation rate for the month of December multiplied by twelve or for the last quarter multiplied by four. We want to know what inflation rate is now expected as a result of this Finance Bill and compare that with what the Minister told the House in his budget speech he expected.  What is the difference? What happened in the three months since 7 February which changed that projection, when 5 per cent was the magic inflation rate?  Why is an inflation rate of at least 11 per cent referred to in the national understanding?  I want to know if we are expecting even higher price increases.  I also want to know the rate of economic growth expected if the Finance Bill is passed.  In this, the fifth month of the year, when we should be able to make more accurate projections than we did in January and February, what are the projections for economic growth?  The Minister should tell us how much of the economic growth has been created by the fiscal policy of the Government.  At the end of this year the <Col N="80" /> people will want to know whether the figures presented in the budget were as valid then as they are invalid now and they will want to know why they are now invalid.</P>
    <P>To return to what I said earlier about the divisions in our society, the budget's financial provisions and the subsequent climb-down of the Government have divided town and country as never before.  A tax curtain has divided this country in a way never achieved since Partition.  The PAYE sector has not been given a concession.  The PAYE sector will pay 37 per cent more tax and the farmers will pay more tax.  However wily or lucky the Government think they are, they will extract more taxation from the farmers and the workers who, when given the opportunity, will unite to tell the Government that they have had enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with a number of the major points raised during the debate.  A few points were raised in the concluding speeches of Deputies Bermingham and Mitchell on which I should also like to comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to start by dealing with a matter raised by Deputy P. Barry.  He suggested that the conditions attaching to the tax concessions proposed in the national understanding should be removed.  In particular he referred to the condition relating to the funds needed for employment creation.  This condition is simply a reflection of the Government's over-riding commitment to job creation as their first priority.  We feel that the first call on the funds available to the Government should be to finance job creation programmes&mdash;both the measures to which the Government have already committed themselves and the additional measures set out in the <Col N="81" /> national understanding, which would apply only in the event of a shortfall in the employment targets.  If the Exchequer situation were to reach the position where a choice had to be made between tax concessions and job creation, I think people would accept that priority should be given to job creation.  However, I have no reason to believe that the budgetary position will not be in line with expectations provided that the terms of the national understanding are reasonably observed.  If such a conflict should emerge it is only prudent that the Government should not make an unequivocal commitment which might harm the progress towards our economic and social objectives.</P>
    <P>One of the problems about this matter is that so little attention is paid by so many to the need for job creation.  In his concluding remarks Deputy Mitchell referred to job creation and the need for it.  For what it is worth, I compliment him on being the first Opposition Deputy for a long time to talk about this matter.  I am afraid that I cannot further compliment him in so far as a number of the things he was advocating would not do anything to help job creation, but at least he adverted to the need for it.  I began to wonder if the Government were the only people worried about job creation. Before I conclude I will have more to say on job creation and how it fits into the pattern of what we are doing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully said that since existing loans form part of trade union agreement they could not be legally interfered with under the provision in section 9 of the Bill.  I want to make it clear that the section does not interfere with any contractual agreement between employer and employee.  It merely proposes to restrict the relief for interest on preferential loans as defined in the section.  The intention is to restore an element of balance between taxpayers who enjoy such preferential loans and those who do not.  As the position stands, a preferential loan taxpayer enjoying a loan at, say, 3 per cent can claim relief for interest, taking the proposed image of £2,400, on borrowings of £80,000, whereas those without such facilities <Col N="82" /> borrowing at commercial rates of, say, 14 per cent, will only be allowed relief on borrowings of about £17,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly referred to what he called the scaled down relief in the case of loans at preferential interest rates and said that it would mean a difference, depending on the level of income, of £3 to £4 a week and £7 to £8 a week in the net pay of individuals affected.  As I indicated in my opening speech, people enjoying preferential rates of interest on all their borrowings will suffer no loss of relief except in the case of the part of the borrowing which exceeds £20,000.  I suggest to the House that this represents a moderate restriction.  Other borrowers paying commercial interest rates in excess of 12 per cent would not get full relief on borrowings of £20,000, as I have already indicated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry also suggested that he would be seeking to amend section 5 to allow the tax deduction of £64 in respect of social welfare contributions.  Deputy Mitchell referred to the fact that the tax allowance in respect of social welfare contributions has disappeared, as indeed it has.  I suggest that it is quite misleading to refer to this allowance having disappeared and not to refer to the fact that the social welfare contribution has been reduced.  As was pointed out in the debate on the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, with the introduction of fully pay-related social insurance contributions from April of this year it was not administratively feasible to continue the relief in respect of part of the contribution as was done previously.  The administrative reasons were spelled out. In determining the level of contribution to be made under the new scheme operating from April, specific account was taken of the taxation factor and the rate of contribution was adjusted downwards to take account of that tax element.  I hope it will be appreciated therefore that the present rate of contribution would have been higher had tax relief continued to be available.</P>
    <P>Relief now comes to the employee not through the adjustment of his tax-free allowance, where the relief would have been lost if there were not liability to tax, but by way of net social insurance contribution. <Col N="83" /> This adjustment, taken in conjunction with the progressive nature of the contributions, means that the vast bulk of employees now pay a smaller contribution than if the old flat rate contribution had remained.  This differential is particularly significant for lower-paid workers.  In many cases the decrease in the level of contribution outweighs the benefit lost by the withdrawal of the tax allowance, and this is so notwithstanding the significant increase in insurable benefits announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>The increase in personal allowances and the restructuring of the tax bands give a tax saving to all but the single or widowed person with an income in excess of £6,865.  There is no increase in tax for any taxpayer other than the single or the widowed person with an income in excess of £7,000 per annum. Where such a person qualifies, as would be normal, for other allowances and reliefs such as life insurance, medical insurance or loan interest, this figure could be substantially higher.  Married couples will now benefit in the main by a figure in the region of £110; that is a minimum.  The additional tax which the affluent single person or widow might be called upon to bear will where it arises be minimal, less than 30p a week.  We ought to take these factors into account in assessing the changes which had to be made for administrative reasons in regard to the social welfare contribution allowance which, as I pointed out, benefit in particular the lower paid substantially more than they would have benefited if we had adhered to the old system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry referred to the decrease in the child tax allowance from £240 to £218 and said the budget changes were of little benefit to large families.  The opposite is true.  By directing resources through the social welfare children's allowances rather than by income tax child allowances the Government are concentrating on the area of greatest relative need.  Deputies do not need to be reminded that to obtain benefit from the income tax child allowance one must have a taxable income and that such measures tend to favour the wealthy in <Col N="84" /> that the higher a couple's tax band the greater the benefit.  Families not liable to income tax will enjoy the full benefit of the increase in social welfare children's allowances and the lower families are on the income tax scale the greater will be the net benefit derived from these changes.  Most families should benefit from my proposals and even where the decrease in the income tax child allowance is not fully offset by the increase in social welfare children's allowance the loss is minimal.  This will happen only at the higher levels of income.</P>
    <P>The married couple with three eligible children and an income of £12,000 a year would suffer only a marginal net increase in tax of about 1p per week.  Even for such a couple, taking the increase in the marriage allowance into account, the combined effect of the income tax adjustment and the increase in social welfare children's allowances will be a net tax saving in the region of £135 a year.</P>
    <P>In talking about the budget changes as provided for in this Bill, Deputy Barry also said that everybody had moved into a higher tax band.  This is not correct. For married couples the £500 increase in the personal allowance, together with the £100 increase in the 25 per cent tax band, means that all married taxpayers have benefited and any change in the marginal rate of tax could only be downwards.  Before the changes announced in the budget a married couple without children would have commenced paying tax once their income exceeded £1,730, assuming only the personal and children's allowances apply. The budget changes mean that they will not now pay any tax at all until their income exceeds £2,230.  This same couple would have entered the 35 per cent tax band where their income exceeded £3,220 but will not now enter this band until their income exceeds £3,330.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, single taxpayers have had their tax liability eliminated or reduced up to an income level of at least £6,860, while the maximum loss above that level is not more than £15 per annum.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary stated that in some <Col N="85" /> instances workers see up to two-thirds of their earnings going in taxation.  I should point out that to become liable for income tax at 60 per cent a single man would have to be earning in excess of £7,715 per year, while a married man with two children would have to be earning in excess of £9,266 per year.  Of course, if either were claiming allowances in respect of such things as mortgage relief and insurance, then the threshold at which they would become liable for tax at 60 per cent would be considerably higher.  It is sometimes suggested that overtime earnings should receive more favourable treatment in respect of income tax liability.  A similar argument has been put forward before in relation to payment for night duty, danger money and &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; money and the point has also been raised in relation to bonuses for increased productivity.</P>
    <P>The view has always been taken that this claim cannot be admitted.  The fundamental principle of the tax code is that income tax is a tax on income and a departure from this principle would be bound to lead to inequities between taxpayers. A possible result would be the adoption of schemes between employees and employers to alter conditions of working so that a greater part of wages or salaries could be claimed to be within the exempted category.  Further inequity would be created between taxpayers who had the opportunity of overtime and those who had not&mdash;and there are many who do not have that opportunity. In all the circumstances, therefore, there are very great difficulties in accepting that overtime earnings should be treated more favourably in regard to income tax than basic earnings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry said that on Committee Stage he would be proposing that indexation of the income tax rate bands should be introduced and he also referred to the fact that indexation was introduced in respect of capital gains tax. Deputy Mitchell also referred to the great advantages that would accrue from indexation in regard to income tax and I think he referred to it as a Fine Gael promise.  From that and from the fact that Deputy FitzGerald at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis put it forward as a panacea <Col N="86" /> for all ills we may now take it that it is Fine Gael policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame the Deputy for being apprehensive.  I am merely establishing the ground on which this has been put forward.  It should be clear that at a time of low inflation at any rate the indexation provision would be less than popular.  It should be realised that if indexation were introduced it could also mean pegging the increase in personal allowances to, say, the increase in the consumer price index for a corresponding period.  Let us see what would happen if we did that.  Since this Government took office the married allowance has increased from £1,100 in 1977-78 to £2,230 in 1979-80, an increase of over 102 per cent.  On the other hand, the consumer price index in the two years to mid-November 1978 increased by less than 20 per cent.  If this percentage increase had been applied to the married allowance in 1977-78 the allowance for this year would be only £1,315 as against my proposal in this Bill for £2,230.  Calculations show that a married man with two children earning £100 per week would have paid in 1978-79, this year, significantly more tax if, instead of the increase I introduced last year and propose for this year, 1977 and 1978 allowances and rate bands had been indexed to the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>One should not be carried away, as I felt Deputy Mitchell was somewhat carried away, in speaking about indexation. I do not blame him; I suppose he has been taught to believe that a proposition of this kind put forward by Deputy FitzGerald is brilliant and has no flaws. I would advise the Deputy to look more carefully at these things in future because what he is really advocating and what his party are advocating is that instead of doing what we are doing, providing a married allowance of £2,230, we should be reducing it to £1,315 to keep it in line with the consumer price index increase for the last two years.  I do not think that is what the Deputy wants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But if he is advocating indexation that is what he is advocating. But it is worse than that.  I have to hand it to Deputy FitzGerald because after his Ard-Fheis speech when he was interviewed, I think on the following day, on the radio, he was asked about this proposition and he was honest enough to admit what logically follows.  There are others who would not have the honesty of Deputy FitzGerald and admit that if you go for indexation of tax bands and income tax allowances in order to be consistent you would have to have indexation of flat-rate indirect taxes also. If you had that, the effect on the cost of items which carry specific excise duties can be shown by example.  If the duty on a pint of stout and other beers were to be increased to bring it into line with the consumer price index in 1976, which was the last time the duty on the pint was increased, an additional tax increase of nearly 5p over and above that provided for in this Finance Bill would be required.  So, instead of a 2p increase there would have to be an increase of nearly 7p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That depends on Fianna Fáil inflation rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The bulk of inflation since that time was Fine Gael-Labour inflation. I want to make sure that Deputy Mitchell understands the implications of what he advocates.  Let me go on to point out that in the same way the tax on the glass of spirits would have to be increased by more than 6p over and above the budget increase if the level of tax was to keep in line with the consumer price increase since 1976.  The corresponding increase for cigarettes would be over 4p per packet of 20 for the popular tipped brands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I should also mention the effect that Fine Gael proposal would have on the price of petrol.  The duty on this item has not been increased since 1976 and a tax increase of 19p per gallon would be required in order to maintain the tax element in line with the CPI. I hope the examples I have given clarify the issue.  Indexation of personal tax allowances <Col N="88" /> and bands would, on the face of it, give taxpayers more after-tax income but it is obvious that a corresponding indexation of indirect taxes would lead to significantly higher prices. To recapitulate in case there is any doubt, I want to make clear that the policy of indexation advocated by Fine Gael, put forward by Deputy FitzGerald at his party's recent Ard-Fheis and put forward again here by Deputy Mitchell in winding up for his party, would have the consequence of, for example, reducing the married allowance which we are providing for in this Bill of £2,230 to £1,315 while at the same time increasing the tax on the pint over and above what we provide for in this Bill by an additional 5p and an additional 6p on the glass of spirits and an additional 19p on the gallon of petrol.  I hope people will note the effect of the policies being advocated by Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry also referred to the fact that indexation was introduced by me in respect of capital gains tax.  It was.  I pointed out in introducing the Second Stage of that Bill that to have no provision in that code for indexation could mean that a person might become liable to capital gains tax on a paper gain when in fact a loss was made.  Whatever arguments there may be for indexation in relation to income tax nobody is charged income tax if he does not have an income. On the other hand, one could have a charge of capital gains tax although no gain had accrued.  This is essentially the difference between the two.</P>
    <P>For that reason I believe that in the case of the capital gains tax&mdash;because of the nature of the tax, as its name implies&mdash;indexation was justified.  There is a considerable argument to be put forward for indexation in regard to income tax allowances and bands and indirect taxes but they should be put forward by people who know the consequences. They should not be put forward by people who have a Government in power which has been far outstripping the consequences of indexation in what it has been doing in regard to increasing income tax allowances and not increasing indirect taxes.  In different circumstances, under a different Government, <Col N="89" /> the argument for indexation might be considerably stronger.</P>

      <P>There were references in the debate to the restriction on capital allowances in relation to farmers.  That is in connection with the announcement by the Government on 24 April, in so far as this would apply from 6 April next, in connection with the farming taxation system which is designed to bring in a yield from farmers in line with that from other sectors of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the capital allowances provision there, because remarks were made today in this debate.  I want to make it <Col N="90" /> quite clear, because there seems to be some confusion about it.  The restriction will apply, first of all, to all the free depreciation provisions, that is, over and above normal wear and tear allowances, and secondly, to the 20 per cent initial allowance for buildings.  The allowances in question will be limited to such an amount as would not reduce net profit below 70 per cent of the figure before deduction of capital allowances.</P>
    <P>This restriction is designed to inhibit overinvestment stimulated by, in some cases, a desire to avoid payment of tax. A number of commentators, many of whom would be generally accepted as discerning commentators on agriculture&mdash;indeed, including some farmers&mdash;have felt that many farmers were seriously overinvesting, particularly in the case of machinery, almost all of which is imported.  I want to make it quite clear that no restriction is proposed in regard to ordinary wear and tear allowances. I also want to make it clear that the restriction represents merely a deferment to later years of part of the extra capital allowances and that it certainly should not adversely affect genuine development.  In other words, it is not that the allowances are being taken away; they are being restricted in such a way that they cannot all be taken in the first year.  That is all that is involved in it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry referred to section 31. That section proposes to allow a transfer from a mother to her illegitimate child to qualify for the relief given under section 27 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, if the other conditions governing the relief are fulfilled.  The Deputy asked about the position in relation to a similar transfer by a father to his illegitimate child.  Section 31 brings the position in regard to capital gains tax into line with that of the capital acquisitions tax, whereby an illegitimate child who has not been legitimated or formally adopted is to be treated as the child of his mother.  That provision was made to cater for cases where, under section 9 of the Legitimacy Act, 1931, an illegitimate child might succeed to his mother's estate on her death intestate.  The illegitimate child of a mother is also treated as legitimate for the purposes of <Col N="91" /> stamp duty and customs duty in certain cases where an illegitimate child derives property from his mother; that is under section 44 of the Finance Act, 1972. These precedents recognise the certainty that surrounds the relationship between the illegitimate child and his mother. There is no such similar degree of certainty in regard to the relationship between the illegitimate child and his father.</P>
    <P>This matter is a difficult and complex one and I should remind the House that the Law Reform Commission in their first programme, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, mentioned that they would be examining:</P>
    <P>...the law as to the illegitimacy (including the succession and other right of illegitimate children).</P>
    <P>I do not know what will emerge from their consideration of this difficult topic but section 31 goes as far as we can go in relation to the law as it stands at the moment.  If a solution to the problem, which I have just touched on in what I have said, can emerge, I shall of course have no difficulty, and indeed shall have considerable pleasure, in applying it to fiscal measures.  It would of course have to be applied in a lot of other areas besides fiscal ones.  However, as things stand at the moment, it is not, I believe, legally possible to extend the situation beyond what is provided for under section 31.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pursue this matter unduly at this stage.  Basically, the problem is to have a method by <Col N="92" /> which you can establish with certainty under the law that the father either acknowledges that he is, or is deemed in law to be, the father of the illegitimate child, so that you can have the consequences flowing from that.  We do not have such a situation at the moment and, as I have indicated, the Law Reform Commission is, I understand, examining this matter.  It is a difficult matter, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, to get a watertight solution.  If that can be produced, as I have indicated I shall have no difficulty in applying it in fiscal measures and my colleagues in other areas where it would be applicable.  There is a difficult legal problem involved concerning the establishment of certainty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy speaking in regard to section 6 and residence related relief said that while the intention of the section was worth while its operation was cumbersome and could deter taxpayers from availing of its provisions.  The Deputy's main objections were that there was a necessity for the completion of two forms by the householder to obtain relief and that the process of registration for the person carrying out the work was unduly complex.  The use of the two forms, the prescribed form and the claim form, is felt to be necessary. They are aimed at preventing collusion, the use of forged documents and things of that kind, and because of job creation objectives they are aimed at ensuring that the householder will employ personnel registered under the scheme. There is also the question of whether the work to be carried out is qualifying work as defined and is eligible for relief.  Experience <Col N="93" /> has shown that if the proper safeguards are not built into provisions of this nature they may be abused with consequential loss of revenue.  An example is the legislation governing subcontractors in the construction industry, introduced in 1970.  Due to abuses that crept in because the matter was perhaps not tightly enough defined it had to be tightened up considerably in the 1976 Finance Act.  Furthermore, the system which the section envisages is to the advantage of the householder in that he will know before any expenditure is incurred whether the work he is contemplating will qualify for relief.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy felt that the Revenue Commissioners might be unduly restrictive in the issuing of registration certificates to the contractors, but I assure the House that that is not the intention. Paragraph 5 of the Second Schedule provides that a certificate shall be issued by the Revenue Commissioners where an application is made in the prescribed from and the applicant is resident in the State.</P>
    <P>These are the only conditions and could not be said to be an elaborate process or in any way limiting a <i>bona fide</i> contractor's ability to obtain registration.  This paragraph is not similar to the provisions in section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970, which was amended by section 21 of the Finance Act, 1976, dealing with the issue of certificates of authorisation to subcontractors in the construction industry. Different criteria apply there, and paragraph 5 will not be operated as an adjunct of the sub-contractor's certificate procedure.  It was also suggested that paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 of the Second Schedule should be omitted.  These are precautionery paragraphs designed to limit the abuse of the scheme and the <i>bona fide</i> contractor has nothing to fear from them.  I will certainly watch the operation of the scheme with a view to ensuring that it is not operated so restrictively or in such a cumbersome way as to inhibit people from availing of the allowances proposed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry referred to the PAYE march of some weeks ago and alleged that the march would have been much <Col N="94" /> smaller were it not for what he described as the intemperate and ill-advised remarks of mine in Brussels on the previous day.  I indicated, when Deputy Barry made that statement, and I indicate again, that the Deputy is simply propagating a falsehood when he says that.  What transpired in the press conference in Brussels was that I was asked by a journalist whether I had any last minute concessions to make to the PAYE marchers.  As phrased, the question clearly referred to concessions which might be announced on the eve of the following day's march.  In reply, I clearly indicated that no one seriously expected last minute concessions.  Since it was reasonable to point out that an instant response on a matter so farreaching and complex as the tax system was not possible, there are no grounds for criticising my reply as intemperate and ill-advised.  Perhaps the Deputy's view of the matter was coloured by the reporting of my remarks by certain elements in the news media, but I thought that by now the message would have got across at least to Deputy Barry, as to what actually happened.  I regret that Deputy Barry should continue to propagate something that he must know is untrue.</P>
    <P>In the course of his Second stage speech on 1 May Deputy Barry said that the order introducing the 2 per cent levy had been signed by the Minister but had not appeared on the Order Paper.  The position is that the Government made the following orders under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, on 30 April 1979: the Imposition of Duties No. 239 Agricultural Produce (Cattle and Milk) Order, 1979, Statutory Instrument No. 152, and the Imposition of Duties No. 240 Agricultural Produce (Cereals and Sugar Beet) Order, 1979, Statutory Instrument No. 153.  Copies of both of these orders were presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas on Monday, 30 April, immediately after they were made.  Copies of the orders were received at 5.12 p.m., too late to allow notice to be given on the Order Paper for 1 May.  The Order Paper for 2 May included the relevant notice under the section &ldquo;Documents Laid Before the Dáil&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods and Deputy Kelly <Col N="95" /> raised the question of the £70 limit on tax exempted deposit interest.  Deputy Kelly said that the current £70 limit existed here because the limit in the UK is £70 and alleged that we had slavishly copied the British in this regard.  That might be a fair criticism in some other areas but it certainly is not in this.  The £70 limit was set here in 1967 and at that time the UK limit was £15.  The UK limit of £70 was set in 1977.  A number of considerations arise in connection with this whole question of the £70 limit. In the case of a married couple with a joint account the limit is £140 which represents £1,866 of savings with the Post Office Savings Bank at the current interest rate.  In addition the State gives other very generous tax reliefs for savings. The accumulated interest on the holding of savings certificates is free of income tax.  A maximum holding of £7,500 is prescribed for both single and joint holders.  There are also Index-Linked National Instalment Savings. Under this scheme a person agrees to save a stated investment each month, a maximum of £50 and a minimum of £1 for 12 consecutive months and after that to leave the total saved on deposit for two years.  The savings may then be withdrawn or may be left on deposit for up to three more years.  The bonus and interest are free of income tax and capital gains tax.  Then we have indexed-linked savings bonds.  A purchaser in this case must be aged 65 years or over. The capital value of the bonds is related to the movement of the consumer price index.  Minimum returns are guaranteed, bonds held for three years qualify for a bonus, and bonus and interest are exempt from income tax and capital gains tax.  The maximum holding is £750.  With regard to prize bonds, the prizes are free of income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax and there is no limit to the amount of holding.</P>
    <P>I should point out that in principle it would be very easy to argue that there should be no exemption at all for income tax from interest paid on deposits by those institutions that are covered by the provision.  However, as the provision has existed for quite a number of years, it is <Col N="96" /> clear that withdrawal or modification could be seen as a hardship in some respects.  The whole question is one which is appropriate for consideration in the broad context of personal taxation and budgetary implications.  It is my intention to keep this matter under review but not to make any change in it at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly said something on the following lines: &ldquo;I would be very attracted towards any Government who would commit themselves towards reducing the debt, who would not promise to do this, that and the other to raise a facile cheer.  Governments should commit themselves towards reducing the debt over a term of 15 or 20 years on the assumption that the plan will not be changed even if they were not in Government that long&rdquo;.  The national debt increased from £1,440 million on 31 March 1973 to £4,219 million at 31 December 1977.  This is an increase of 193 per cent in less than five years.  Unfortunately it was necessary to increase the debt by a further 24 per cent last year in order to get the economy moving in a way which would allow us to begin to create new jobs needed to solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>If we were to reduce the national debt this year, the first thing we would have to do would be to increase taxation by £779 million or else to cut Government expenditure by that amount.  That is, we would have to eliminate this year's borrowing requirement.  Until we had taken that step we would not have reduced the national debt.  I doubt very much if anybody, even Deputy Kelly, is suggesting that taxation should be increased by such a massive amount.  If it were to be done by cutting expenditure it would involve eliminating Exchequer borrowing for capital purposes with disastrous consequences for the job-creation programme.  In addition to this, current expenditure on social and other areas would have to be reduced by at least £289 million.  That is just to hold the national debt at its existing level.</P>
    <P>There would have to be additional cuts in expenditure if the debt were to be actually reduced.  To eliminate it over 20 years, as suggested by Deputy Kelly, <Col N="97" /> and to do it evenly over the period would involve a further reduction of about £250 million in current expenditure this year.  What Deputy Kelly is suggesting is equivalent to a cut of 19.4 per cent across the board in every service provided by the Government.  Even if this were possible, I think it should be obvious that it would have disastrous consequences both for those receiving the services and for the economy in general.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that the only sensible way to deal with the problem which the national debt has become is gradually to reduce the level of borrowing requirement as a percentage of GNP and, at the same time, to increase the real wealth of the country.  This Government are committed to restoring order to the nation's finances but, as we have said repeatedly, our first priority is the creation of jobs.  In line with that policy, as I have said already, it was necessary to increase the borrowing requirement last year but, as I outlined in my recent budget statement, the borrowing requirement is to be reduced to 10½ per cent of GNP this year and it is my intention, with the full support of my colleagues in the Government, to repeat the process of reduction next year.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputy Kelly was just making one of his usual colourful statements and that he did not seriously suggest that we should embark on the kind of course I have outlined, but if it is any consolation to the Deputy I would point out to him that the budget figures show that for the first time since 1973 the proportion of State revenue used to pay interest on the national debt will not have increased over the previous year. The budget estimate is that 21.9 per cent of State revenue will be used to pay interest on the public debt in 1979, the same proportion as in 1978.  This is the first year there has been no increase since 1973.  It suggests it is a movement in the right direction but a movement which is being taken in a way that does not cripple the economy or the people depending on the services provided by the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>What he said is true. Did he say the amount being used has not increased this year, that it is the same as last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I said:</P>
      <P>The proportion of State revenue used to pay interest on the national debt will not have increased over the previous year.</P>
      <P>There is a very important thing in that that bears on the whole question of how we treat the national debt and it is this: the proportion has not gone up although, as the Deputy said, the amount has gone up.  Why?  Because our GNP has gone up.  If you can get growth you can accommodate the kind of problem we are talking about here.  This is why we had to make such an effort to get the economy moving and part of that effort is the creation of jobs.  It is a very fundamental part of our whole approach to the economy that we make every effort to get growth up and to keep it up.  If we do that we can afford to get the kind of results I have talked about where even though we are paying more money it is no bigger proportion of State revenue.  I do not want to go overboard on that, but I am glad Deputy Barry drew my attention to it because I think it is an important point.</P>

      <P>I also said that the State are paying more money.  Despite the Minister's talk about the proportion of GNP as borrowing, the fact is that in the last two years more money has been borrowed by the Government than by any Government in the history of the State.  I am leaving aside percentages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not stress percentages too much, but because Deputy Barry has raised the point let me repeat that the national debt increased from £1,440 million on 31 March 1973 to £4,219 million at 31 December 1977, an increase of 193 per cent in less than five years.  I do not think I need to comment further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As compared with what had been done in the previous four or five years by the Government of which Deputy Barry was a member, what we did was chicken feed.  What is vitally important is the rate of debt growth and the rate of growth of the economy, thereby, if it is being done wisely, matching the ability of the economy to pay the debt.  If Deputy Barry wants to look at the performance of the Government of which he was a member he will find that not alone was there an enormously sharply increased rate of growth in the national debt but there was a correspondingly sharp reduction in the growth in the economy.  Therefore, we were getting the worst of both worlds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today, Deputy Bruton referred to the tax on the inheritance of a farm by a son from a father.  The threshold applicable in that case is £150,000.  On the basis of 1977-78 statistics this threshold is extremely generous in comparison with the position in 13 other OECD countries.  In those countries the thresholds for children range from £80 to £33,000.  Our £150,000 threshold is coupled with a relief of up to £100,000 value in respect of agricultural property, provided for in section 19 of the Capital Acquisitions Act of 1976, and it means that a beneficiary who qualifies as a farmer under that provision can inherit property worth up to £250,000 free of tax from his parents.  The relief is extended to agricultural property and is not available to any other type of property.  That <Col N="100" /> threshold of a quarter of a million pounds is available to each individual child.  I do not propose to make a change in that threshold for inheritance tax.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also mentioned that on the inheritance by a son from his father of a 100-acre farm, the son would have to pay £22,500 inheritance tax. This would involve the farm being worth £333,000, and £22,500 amounts to 7 per cent, giving an effective tax rate of only 7 per cent.  If the farmer divided the farm between two sons, each would inherit £167,000 free of tax.  Therefore, Deputy Bruton and others who make this case should consider the case they are making not just in the context of the value of agricultural land and stock but of other non-agricultural sectors in the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham today said that this year's budget was negotiable after the event.  I will make it clear to him and to anybody else who is under that illusion that there is no truth in it.  Let me put this question to anybody who wonders about that.  Which figures given by me on budget day have been changed since?  I can tell you the only one has been in regard to the yield from the agricultural levy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that not negotiated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy saying we should not have made that change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, just was it negotiated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be quite clear about this.  Is Deputy Horgan saying we should not have made that change?  I want to be clear about where the Deputy stands on this.  The revenue to be received by the Exchequer is not being reduced.  We indicated that the levy, being introduced for the first time, was obviously something we could not calculate as precisely as we could other items which had been operating for a considerable time and of which we had experience.  I have indicated that we were aware of the fact, as announced, that it could in some cases of small farmers <Col N="101" /> present some hardships, that it had not been possible to engage in consultations in that respect prior to the budget and that we engaged in such consultations afterwards.  If that is regarded as negotiation&mdash;apparently Deputy Horgan so regards it&mdash;I wonder what is his opinion of what happened under the previous Government, which he supported and of which Deputy Barry was a member, when in relation to the provision introduced on budget day by my predecessor on farm taxation there was an enormous reduction brought about by substantial changes in the budget provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister disagree with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy Barry is uncomfortable about this.  Let me answer the question.  My recollection is that I objected to it at the time and said so, not on the grounds now being put forward but on the merits of the case. Everybody knows that frequently changes are made as a result of representations made between budget day and the Finance Bill, and indeed between the Second and Committee Stages of the Finance Bill.  That is common practice.  It is part of democracy. What Deputy Bermingham was implying is that the budget had been negotiated as a result of pressure.  Which pressure was there that resulted in that change?  I will come to Deputy Mitchell in a minute and to his comments in that respect.  If Deputy Bermingham believes, as he said, that the 2 per cent levy is the cause of layoffs of employees in four meat factories in his constituency, he would believe anything.  I suggest he knows more about the position than he said in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a good deal of talk from Deputies Bermingham and Mitchell about PAYE and the dreadful things this Government have been doing in that respect.  Indeed I heard Deputy Mitchell on a number of occasions talking about the cave-in to the farmers by the Government.  I did not interrupt either Deputy but I was tempted to ask them what cave-in.  I should like to put the question on the record of the House and <Col N="102" /> maybe some day Deputy Mitchell or somebody else will tell us what cave-in to farmers did this Government engage in?  Deputy Mitchell said that this Government had introduced a wedge between rural and urban people which had hitherto been avoided by fair play and that they were pandering to the rich.</P>
    <P>On the question of PAYE I said before&mdash;I cannot recall whether in this House or outside&mdash;and I say again that no Member of the Fine Gael or Labour Party, if he has any sense of shame should open his mouth on the topic of PAYE.  Whatever view one takes of the present and proposed PAYE allowances, one thing is quite clear, and that is that the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition were anything but concered about the burden on the PAYE taxpayer, apart from a number of other things.  If there is any doubt about that I will draw the attention of the House to certain facts.  In the case of a married person with two children under the Coalition in 1976-1977 and under this Government this year, 1979-1980, leaving the special allowance next December out of the calculation, on weekly earnings of £30 under the Coalition in 1976-1977 that person was paying £18 tax, nil under Fianna Fáil; on £40 a week under the Coalition he was paying £153 tax, nil this year under Fianna Fáil; on £50 earnings a week, £289 tax under the Coalition, nil under Fianna Fail this year; on £70 earnings a week, £634 tax under the Coalition, £244 under Fianna Fail this year and on £90 earnings a week, £1,034 under the Coalition, £595 under Fianna Fáil this year.  That is only one example and I hope it clearly illustrates my point that whatever may be said about PAYE no Member of Fine Gael or Labour should have the nerve to open his mouth on the topic of PAYE.</P>
    <P>In the light of the continued argument put forward from the other side of the House that Fianna Fáil is the party of the rich, to quote Deputy Mitchell; that we have sold out to the rich and are pandering to the rich, what I have just said about tax illustrates the attitude of Fianna Fail to people who cannot, by any stretch of the imagination on the figures I have quoted, be described as rich.  In <Col N="103" /> regard to the poor, however one defines them, there are two ways of tackling poverty.  The first is in relation to those who cannot help themselves because of age or infirmity of mind or body.  The Government have to help them through the social welfare system.  In this connection, despite all the propaganda we have been hearing, the facts are that Fianna Fail increased social welfare three times greater than the Coalition.  That is true of the present and previous Fianna Fail Governments.</P>
    <P>In regard to those who can help themselves, who can work if they have a job, this is a fundamental way of tackling poverty, not a handout but enabling people to support themselves.  That is tackling not only their poverty but that of their families.  In that context no Government in the history of the State have created as many jobs as we have in the time we have been in office in any comparable period.  Let no one try to tell me that we are the party of the rich, that we are pandering to the rich or that we have sold out to the rich and that the parties opposite have social concern.  I do not deny that they have social concern but the real test is not what one says but what one does.  On the basis of what we do, as compared with what our opponents across the floor of the House do, our record is one of which we can be and are extremely proud.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred a number of times to a 37 per cent expected increase in revenue from PAYE and then said &ldquo;Some rebate&rdquo;, clearly indicating that, far from reducing liability for tax, we were increasing it.  I should not have to explain this but, lest anybody be taken in by it, the increase expected from the PAYE sector is considerably less than the increase expected from the self-employed sector.  The implication in what Deputy Mitchell was saying was that the same number of people would pay that much more tax.  That is not so. That estimate allows for a very substantial increase in the numbers working and paying income tax and also allows for a number of other factors which I already dealt with and which go to make up the increase.  To suggest that the increase <Col N="104" /> will be applied to the same body of PAYE taxpayers is totally erroneous and misleading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy looks at the record of what I said in replying to the budget debate he will find a good deal on that.  Deputy Mitchell was repeating another misguided idea when he said that the increase of 15 per cent over 15 months envisaged under certain circumstances in the national understanding was three times higher than had been indicated some months ago by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and myself.  What was indicated was that the increase over a 12 month period&mdash;I am speaking from recollection&mdash;should not be greater than about 4 per cent in real terms, which means of course on top of inflation. Deputy Mitchell has not grasped the difference between the two, but there is an enormous difference for those receiving the money.  I should point out that, unlike people in some neighbouring countries and unlike people in this country a few years ago, employees are now receiving not merely increases in line with inflation or even below inflation but real increases in their standard of living. In other words, their buying power is going up and in the long run it is what can be bought with one's money that counts and not how much the increase one gets is; that does not mean anything if in fact inflation is going up faster than increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the oil situation it could be a little more but I would hope it would not be very much more. Deputy Mitchell was also talking about tax and take home pay and on a number of occasions he brought in the question of food subsidies.  Without pursuing that too far I will just ask why do the Opposition Parties, in talking of income tax bring in food subsidies?  If they do that why do they not also bring in the abolition of rates and the corresponding reduction in local authority rents and the abolition of car tax?  If we are going to compare like with like let us have them all in on the table and have a look at how it works out for people.  I was a little disturbed to hear Deputy Mitchell say that, regardless of the implications for the Exchequer returns, I should reconsider the taxation provisions in this Bill.  I want to make it clear that it may be that Deputy Mitchell and some of his colleagues over there can make proposals and so on regardless of the implications for the Exchequer returns but we do not enjoy that luxury.  Even without that luxury I want to suggest that the provisions of this Bill, to be debated in much more detail on Committee Stage, form part of a programme which in economic terms is not only achieving its objectives but is <Col N="106" /> achieving objectives which we have never succeeded in achieving before in this State.</P>
      <P>Of course we have a lot of difficulties and at any given time any Government have; some of them are external over which we have little or no control and some of them are internal and of the internal difficulties I would think most people would agree that the major problem is industrial relations and the consequences of what is happening.  I am not proposing, and I am sure the Chair would not allow me, to pursue the question of industrial relations.  What I am saying is that in economic terms the policy being pursued by this Government as added to, underlined and underpinned by the provisions of this Finance Bill is being singularly successful at the moment.  It can be more successful given certain other factors that I cannot discuss. Let us not delude ourselves into thinking that the evidence is not clear that we are on the right road economically.  There are steps we have to take to get maximum benefit from the policy we are following but nobody can say that the economic results being achieved&mdash;and by economic results I am of course including at the top of the list the question of job creation&mdash;indicate that we are following the right policy and that this Bill, being part of the process of implementing that policy, deserves the full support of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dail Eireann notes with grave concern the continuing and prospective shortages in oil supplies, and deplores the failure of the Government and of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to take early and effective steps to guarantee the maintenance of supplies to industry, agriculture, fishing, and socially essential services.</P>
      <P>This story is one which has no scandals in it.  There will be no shocking revelations in it.  It is a very ordinary story.  It is essentially one of neglect and inertia. It is a story to which the personality of the Minister&mdash;I do not mean the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, but Deputy O'Malley&mdash;adds the predictable dimension of human confrontation, bad temper and neurosis.  These are the elements which cumulatively have left this country in a quite needless state of near panic in regard to oil supplies since the beginning or middle of March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large part of the case which not just I but most of the people will wish to make against the Government in this regard rests on the absolute predictability of the oil shortage, of the form it was going to take and the absolute possibility <Col N="109" /> of taking adequate measures in time to avert scrambles, public disquiet, panic and perhaps damage to the economy of the kind it looked as though we were going to have when it was apprehended in March that there would not be enough gas diesel oil for the agricultural operations which rely so heavily on it in the early part of the season, and subsequently that there would not be enough petrol or diesel oil for the operations of the tourist industry later.  That is something which is being seen only now.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that this was predictable not just by me, not just by wiseacres who are saying after the event that they knew all along it was coming, it was predictable also for the Minister and his advisers.  The other day I asked a question in regard to the technical periodicals which the Minister receives.  I got an answer from him in which he revealed in tabular form a long list of periodicals to which his Department subscribed and which deal with energy and oil supplies.  It was an impressive enough list, particularly when one has regard to the fact that the staff in the Department are small, actually smaller by one than two years ago, notwithstanding the very serious dimensions which the energy situation has developed in that time.</P>
    <P>There were only two out of the list of about a dozen of which more than one copy was taken, but one periodical of which three copies were taken and which I can only suppose is a periodical which is read in several parts of the rather small section at the Minister's disposal, was the <i>International Petroleum Times.</i> In their issue of 15 January they sounded the absolutely clearest possible warning of the difficulties which were in store.  They said:</P>
    <P>The world was set for an oil crisis both of supply and price.  We are going through the quite months again. We ignored all the signs that were flashing in 1973.  We are probably making all the same mistakes again.</P>
    <P>I do not want to read the whole article, but they pointed out that the Iranian exports which were in the course of completely <Col N="110" /> dropping out, even though they had been decreasing during the period of strikes leading up to the exit of the Shah, accounted for almost 14½ per cent of crude oil in world trade terms.  The article continued:</P>
    <P>The further shortfall of 3 million b/d which has occurred since November cannot be made up from any other source and unless demand falls by a similar amount, a severe supply crisis will exist for as long as Iran is producing significantly less than those 3 million b/d.</P>
    <P>There were tables in the periodical which showed the oil companies which were particularly dependent on Iranian supply. It showed that the Shell group relied on Iran for 18 per cent of their oil.  That group account for a very heavy proportion of the Irish supply.  The Burmah company relied for all of their oil on the Iranian supply and that supply has completely disappeared.  That alone ought to have been enough to warn a Department and a Minister who were taking their responsibilities seriously what was coming.</P>
    <P>A week earlier, on 6 January, <i>The Economist</i>, a general paper devoted to serious economic and political matters, warned:</P>
    <P>The problems posed by Iran are cumulative.  If it produces no oil from now until March, and stocks are run down companies will be hoping to make up during the summer, usually a slack time in the oil markets.  If Iran is still producing only intermittently, or at low levels, the companies will find it difficult to rebuild their stocks to acceptable levels to meet next winter's demand which may be a per cent or two higher than it is this winter.</P>
    <P>In a country like this, it will be more than that because of the low base from which our economic growth is starting.</P>
    <P>So renewed trouble in Iran would put more serious pressure on supplies, weaken stocks further&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>One of the most esoteric of all these journals, but which is on the Department's subscription list, is <i>Petroleum Intelligence Weekly</i> which strictly for-bids <Col N="111" /> copies of itself to be made, referred to the International Energy Agency's optimistic forecast in their issue dated 5 February&mdash;still six weeks before anyone in Ireland began to get panicstricken, least of all the Department who, I believe, were exclusively relying on that forecast.  <i>The Petroleum Intelligence Weekly</i> said:</P>
    <P>IEA officials say the shortfall is &ldquo;still far from 7%&rdquo;....</P>
    <P>Thus far, IEA has purposely avoided speculating about the possible duration of the Iranian oil cutoff and what to do if it continues beyond the winter.</P>
    <P>The International Energy Agency forecast of about 5 per cent shortfall, I understand, was based on figures which they had collected some time around mid-December.  In other words, at a time when the Minister should have been showing some activity&mdash;other than going to the United States on promotional tours on which he could have sent Deputy Burke or Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn&mdash;and asking if this shortfall prediction accurately reflected what was going to happen in this country because this was an overall shortfall in crude.  It was not necessarily a shortfall which would turn out to be only 5 per cent in regard to the kinds of fuel on which our economy, apart from the generation of electricity by heavy residual oil, very heavily depends, in particular gas diesel oil and petrol.  That was not necessarily going to be merely a 5 per cent shortfall, but when I found the Department and the Minister persistently saying that the shortfall would be only of that order, I had to come to the conclusion that they were taking the IEA figure and, with gross inexpertness and ignorance, applying that right across the board to various different forms of refined products.  If they had been properly advised, they would not have been exposed to this.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Economist</i> on 10 February in an article entitled &ldquo;The shadows of Iran are falling on the West&rdquo; said that western Governments and oil companies were beginning to worry about oil stocks&mdash;&ldquo;western Governments,&rdquo; except the <Col N="112" /> Fianna Fail Government in Merrion Street.  They have other things to worry about&mdash;the Family Planning Bill, British policy on the North, the British Dimension, the Irish language as part of what we are, being able to speak three or four scraps of kitchen Irish, and how they were going to scrape an extra seat in the European elections.  But the things that concerned the rest of mankind, like how they were going to keep their economies going on fuel and oil, heat their hospitals, keep traffic from seizing up, were of no concern to the Government. In fact, one would need to comb the February newspapers to find any reference of official concern with the oil situation.  There were signs but they were not coming from the Government.  There was the occasional complacent remark from the Minister of the sort we have heard before that we were moving into an era in which this finite resource would need to be husbanded and in which it would behove us to be economical with it, not to waste it and so on, but that was all.  There were no measures intended to forestall or avert the consequences of the severe shortage which we had, and have. <i>The Economist</i> went on to say that the time to worry would be late next month&mdash;the end of March&mdash;when importing countries normally expect their stocks to start rising again through the spring and summer.  That will be the time to worry.  The only one worrying about it was Deputy Bruton in my party who was complaining that his farmers could not get diesel oil for their tractors.  The only one on the Government side who really reacted was the Minister who said that people were being greedy and selfish in topping up unnecessarily and the Minister opposite who said that the oil companies were behaving like criminals. That the International Energy Agency, which is supposed to organise any share-out among 19 OECD members if there is a repeat of the 1973-1974 oil crisis, is complacent is the judgment of <i>The Economist</i> on 10 February.  They are no more complacent than the Minister and his advisers, but the December information on stocks is rapidly becoming out of date.  I quote:</P>
    <P>When its governing council meet early next month&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> that was in March</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;to review the situation it will have more up-to-date (and perhaps more alarming) figures.</P>
    <P>Those figures evidently did not penetrate to the Minister or to those whom he allows to advise him.</P>
    <P>On the subject of the people who advise the Minister I want to say&mdash;and I intend no reflection on the official advisers whom the Minister has in his Department who naturally do their best with the material to hand and with the training which they have&mdash;there are very few of them.  I got figures from the Minister the other day which showed that he had one person fewer in those sections of his Department than existed two years ago when the Department was in charge of Deputy P. Barry.  He has no full-time non-civil servant consultants at all.  He told me in reply to a supplementary question that he had some part-time consultants&mdash;or not even that but consultancy firms to which he had recourse occasionally.  I asked him from this bench, &ldquo;Did you ask them about the likely supply situation in March and April?  Did you ask your consultants about that at the turn of the year?&rdquo; There was no reply.  I repeated the question and I was gonged out by the Chair. I would have thought that that was a harmless question which did not put the national welfare at risk or anything of that kind.  Having been frustrated by a combination of the Minister and the Chair, I put down a question on the following morning for written reply today which I hoped to have by this evening, and I got it.  I asked if the Minister would give the names of the outside consultant or consultants to whom he has occasional recourse on energy and on oil supply matters as stated by him in his reply to a Dail question on 2 May, the matters on which they have been consulted and the dates on which in respect of these matters their advice was sought. The answer I got an hour ago was this:</P>
    <P>Since I have assumed responsibility for energy matters, consultants have been engaged in my Department to advise on a variety of subjects in the energy field including matters relating <Col N="114" /> to coal, electricity, turf and petroleum. In view of the commercial and strategic considerations involved I am satisfied that it would not be in the public interest to give further information in respect of these studies.</P>
    <P>I am not so dim as not to realise that there are conceivably strategic dimensions to energy even in a little country like this which is so holy and so above the common ruck of mankind that it feels it can sit on the fence and does not need to take sides in global conflicts or on issues which divide the rest of mankind.  We have the attitude that we are far above the grimy little disputes between the free world and the communist world.  We are very free to throw words like &ldquo;fascist&rdquo; and &ldquo;communist&rdquo; around when it suits us but we will not spend one penny to keep either of these forces of tyranny out of the way.</P>

      <P>Maybe in a little country like this, which intends merely to provide a sort of police force for itself and is not too good even at that sometimes, there are strategic dimensions to its energy problems, but that was an outrageous reply to a serious question.  Surely the Minister could have said, &ldquo;There are some questions like alternative energy sources, the feasibility of a nuclear energy proposal, price developments in coal supply and the likely developments in the oil market, on which I have sought advice from outside consultants.  There are other matters on which I have also sought advice but these are of a sensitive kind involving national security and high public policy, and I ask the House to excuse me from revealing them on those grounds.&rdquo;  I would have accepted that without question, but I am going to keep on asserting until the Minister denies it that his reply was designed to conceal the fact that he never asked anyone outside his Department about the likely situation in regard to oil supply this spring.  He got no advice except from the <Col N="115" /> officials sitting in Kildare Street who are, no doubt, honest, devoted, dedicated and hard-working but who have not the expertise necessary to advise the Minister in a crisis situation such as we have.  Still less have they the expertise to warrant their giving personnel to a national oil corporation.  Where are they going to get the staff for a national oil corporation? We have not got in Kildare Street a single consultant who knows anything about the oil business but we are going to staff a national oil corporation, an Chorparáid Náisiúnta um Ola and they will have a cathaoirleach and a board.</P>

To give such a reply to a Dail question is cowardly.  I would have asked for an oral question except that I needed the answer for this evening, and if he had given such a reply orally he would have been shouted down in a disorderly way, I have no doubt.  He would have been laughed at if he had given that reply orally to the House.  But do not worry, if he and I live long enough he will be getting that question from me as soon as the six months is up, as soon as I am in order in asking it again orally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give an idea of the atmosphere of the world outside when the Fianna Fáil world was worrying about the Family Planning Bill, whether the Minister for Health could be persuaded to complete negotiations with the doctors, whether the Irish language was in order or whether some other national objective to which they had never given two minutes continuous thought could be held out to the people as something on which the <Col N="116" /> Government were at work, let me give this little montage of headlines, all from <i>The Irish Times:</i> 28 December 1978: &ldquo;Iran oil crisis to hit world prices&rdquo;; 17 February 1979: &ldquo;O'Malley warns of petrol price rise&rdquo;.  The newspaper states, &ldquo;The cost might approach £1 per gallon by the end of the year.&rdquo;  It is at £1 a gallon at the beginning of the year.  That is the value of his prediction on 17 February.  Within six weeks of his saying that the price was at £1 bar a fraction of a penny.</P>
    <P>27 January, 1979: &ldquo;Oil shortage not yet critical&rdquo;.  However, on 14 February, &ldquo;Filling stations running dry&rdquo;.  1 March, 1979: &ldquo;Iran to nationalise oil as Western firms told to leave&rdquo;; 2 March, 1979: &ldquo;EEC countries warned of 22 per cent rise in oil prices.&rdquo;  Of course, that does not affect us.  We are the Irish, we are special.  We do not need to worry about rises in prices as everybody else has to do.  If we have a Minister who can put his tongue out at the oil companies and who can down-face them and see them off by putting out his tongue at them, we do not need to worry.</P>
    <P>3 March, 1979: &ldquo;Oil price rises forecast to cost economy £80m; 6 March, 1979: &ldquo;ESB to apply for increase in charges&rdquo;; now the ESB are coming to life.  7 March, 1979: &ldquo;Aer Lingus may have to restrict services because of oil shortage&rdquo;; 8 March, 1979: &ldquo;Oil firms seek price increase&rdquo;; at last it is beginning to come home.  9 March, 1979: &ldquo;5p petrol price rise likely soon&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Petrol and heating oil to go up by 4p a gallon&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At last we are getting action.  On the same date we have: &ldquo;State may buy oil in bulk&rdquo;.  I asked a question about this oil corporation who are going to buy oil in bulk.  There is not a single firm proposal about it that was fit to be told to the House the other day.  The Minister opposite me was asked about it on 26 April and he had not a single, firm thing to say about it.  I renewed the question in a different form on Wednesday last when I could not get a single bit of information out of the Minister, not even as much information as would tell me whether this national oil corporation was designed&mdash;as obviously was originally <Col N="117" /> intended on 9 March&mdash;merely to buy oil for the semi-State bodies, or whether the public at large would benefit from it as well.</P>
    <P>On 26 March we read: Government urged by Garages to bring in Petrol Rationing: on 28 March: &ldquo;Fears of Oil Crisis Worse than 1973.&rdquo;  What is happening in all these benches?

      <P>On 12 April, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, having at last got back from America from his second trip there in two months: &ldquo;Government Order puts oil supply in O'Malley's control&rdquo;: &ldquo;The Government decided last night to confront&mdash;&rdquo; There were nearly overtones of the beginning of a Franco-Prussian war or something like that general mobilisation, call to the colours.  &ldquo;The Government decided last night to confront the oil companies by standing on its right to insist on deliveries of diesel, petrol and heating oils when and where it considered it necessary&rdquo;.  That is a fine phrase.  One can see the torches burning on the Doric columns of the GPO with that phrase.  What was the net result? They were laughing at him because it let them off the hook.  They were now able to suspend their domestic heating oil contracts with impunity because they had got from the Minister, who represented it as a major victory against <Col N="119" /> the oil companies and allowed the Government Information Service to go around whispering to that effect, an order which they themselves had requested. They saw it as letting them out of the legal obligation which they otherwise had incurred to stick to domestic heating oil contracts and keep up supplies which they could not maintain, at least not at the price levels to which they were attached.</P>
      <P>The next morning <i>The Irish Times</i> published an editorial entitled &ldquo;The Sleeper Awakes&rdquo;.  After the country had been shouting at the Government for three weeks&mdash;&ldquo;The Sleeper Awakes&rdquo;. When I saw that editorial&mdash;I am sorry to introduce this recondite little item&mdash;it reminded me of a cantanta by Johann Sebastian Bach entitled &ldquo;Sleepers Awake&rdquo;.  It is built around the parable of the wise virgins and the foolish virgins who were bridesmaids&mdash;and funnily enough that was about an oil scarcity too&mdash;who had neglected to fill their lamps with oil.  These foolish bridesmaids were caught napping when the lord arrived for the wedding.  Now this foolish bridesmaid had some of his wits about him.  He knew that what was in this for him was a lot of facile headlines.  Mind you, the thing ended happily enough because he was in the facile headline business, the cheap headline business, and the oil companies were in the making-money business. Both of them made a good deal of what they were out for.  I have to hand it to the two of them.  Of course those headlines are water under the bridge now because the country is again shouting at him. And the oil companies made some money, not as much as they wanted to make but a fair bit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was the official policy, that there was no real shortage.  Even last week the Minister said there was no real shortage when I put it to him that there was a garage which had been advertised in the paper as having&mdash;and it is still doing so&mdash;offered petrol at £1.20 a gallon and that there were queues half a mile long, 24 hours a day, to get in to buy that petrol at £1.20 a gallon.  The Minister's reaction was: he would <Col N="120" /> prosecute them.  Of course, he had forgotten, or perhaps he did not know, that that particular brand was outside his control order, as was any brand that was not named in the control order, so that he had no legal power at present to prosecute them or do anything with them at all.  The Minister might perhaps have had the grace to accept that when he finds people selling petrol at £1.20 a gallon and people glad to get it at that price, then something like a shortage is going on and that it is not just little local difficulties, as he put it then.</P>
    <P>But it was not simply a denial, not simply a policy or, if you like, an attitude which varied between denying that there was a shortage and abusing motorists for topping up, putting unnecessary petrol in their tanks, or some diesel consumers putting the necessary diesel in their tanks&mdash;that was not his only line. His other line was that the multinational companies were out to do us down. When he was talking about motorists topping up&mdash;this was in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 2 April&mdash;he said that they could not allow price to dictate supply.  If I heard that coming from Deputy Quinn, from Deputy Barry Desmond, or from some far-out member of the Labour Party not in the Dail at all and never likely to be, I would not be surprised.  Naturally that is a point of view which one associates with the extreme Left, that one cannot allow supply to be determined by price. That, naturally, is a capitalist maxim and cannot be tolerated by a certain wing of the political sprectrum.  Deputy O'Malley is absolutely the last man from whom I ever expected to hear that sentiment. He is one of the leading officeholders in a party which intoned the profit motive, which intoned the market economy as the third national objective of this country.  They said repeatedly that there was nothing disgraceful about profit.  Mark you, I think they are quite right about that.  I agree with them, there is nothing disgraceful about profit.  But suddenly, for this one commodity, in this one context, it was disgraceful to associate price with supply.</P>
    <P>I will make the Minister opposite a present of this in case he thinks I am going to embark on a defence of the oil <Col N="121" /> companies: I think that price and supply have got a connection with each other. The reason supplies are a bit shorter here than they would be otherwise is because the companies have been squeezed on price.  My information, such as it is, is to the effect that, even if they got twice the present price, there would not be enough oil to go around to satisfy the demand at its present level. Therefore I do not think price constitutes the whole answer.  I do think it is true, I would not mind admitting it.  I do not hold a brief for the oil companies.  I have not a share in any of them.  I have no friends or relations in any of them.  I have no motive in the world to stand up for them except to say, as I said before in the House, that even an oil company is entitled to justice, even an oil company is entitled not to be a whipping boy of a Minister just when it suits him to use that excuse to cover up his incompetence and inertia.</P>
    <P>If the oil companies were getting a bit more for their product there would be more of it around.  The reason they were not producing more of it or that there is not more coming in is not because they are hoarding it somewhere in a subterranean cave by the millions of gallons and barrels; it is because they are finding it more profitable to sell it somewhere else. That is the reason.  I want to put a question to Deputy Burke, who is a businessman. I beg Deputy Killilea's pardon.  I do not mean to be personal to him.  I do not know what his line of country is, but I would not be surprised if he has business interests, too.  Perhaps he has not but, if he has, I should like to put this to him: if he finds that some product he is in the business of selling will fetch more money in Tuam than it will in Loughrea, I am damned sure Tuam is the place he will sell it.  I am certain that if the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, finds he can advertise something he is in the business of selling more profitably in Mullingar than in Athlone Mullingar is the place that will get his custom.  Why are the oil companies supposed to be any different?  Are they any different from the suppliers of any other commodity which we do not produce?</P>
    <P>I am not asking that anybody should <Col N="122" /> be tender-hearted towards the oil companies because they are well able to look after themselves.  I want a bit of realism and honesty towards the public; a little less of a public relations exercise, a little less flak and talk about confronting this and down-facing that.  The Minister has done his best or his worst in regard to confrontation and the queues at the petrol stations are still a mile long.  There have been two increases in price in the meantime and we are not at the end of them.</P>

      <P>There are a few things that can be done by a State which finds itself squeezed for a vital commodity of which it provides not one drop.  Oil, of course, is the most vital one.  I do not mind what the commodity is&mdash;for example, the raw materials we use for industry, in the building industry in particular, exploded in price during the recession and were a very serious factor from our point of view in 1975 and 1976&mdash;if it comes from abroad and explodes in price it will cause the same difficulties.  However, in 1975 and 1976 we did not have a Coalition Minister posturing, strutting and pretending by putting out his tongue at the suppliers of these products he could call them to heel.  None of our Ministers was so ridiculous.</P>

      <P>I will use a more homely expression: he has got a bee in his bonnet about the oil companies.  It is only one of a number of bees that buzz around that cranium.  He has a large noisy bee in his bonnet about the oil companies.  The oil companies, no doubt, are a very hard-nosed lot of people.  I could see the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, as an oil company executive had he not been steered into politics by destiny. Such companies are no worse and no better than anybody else in private enterprise and we must deal with them realistically.  The result of the Minister's operations is that there is a shortage and I have no doubt that it could be relieved by something of a price rise.  I give the Minister credit for the fact that he does not want to push up the cost of living index but which is better: to be going through the motions of appearing to keep down the cost of living by resisting a moderate price rise or refusing that price rise and having everybody queueing up to buy petrol at three times what that price rise would be?  People are falling over themselves to buy petrol at £1.20 per gallon.  I have heard rumours of diesel truck drivers who are desperate. One garage owner told me yesterday that some of them were coming to him crying for £3 or £4 worth of diesel&mdash;that amount of diesel would not go very far in a big truck&mdash;and those drivers were willing to pay up to £2 per gallon if they could get it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to gather the information the best way I can.  A Minister is in a better position to gather reliable information <Col N="124" /> than I.  I am not arguing that the Minister should let prices rip.  I accept that it is a respectable and necessary thing for a Minister to try to keep prices down but where he is dealing with a commodity which he does not produce that may not be a realistic attitude, particularly when it is evidence by petrol being freely sold at £1.20 per gallon and people willing to pay that money in order to keep their businesses afloat.</P>
      <P>Another possibility&mdash;one which I am not recommending&mdash;is to nationalise the distribution networks of all the oil companies. There was a rumour in the newspapers, which the Minister denied, that he was going to do that and supply the plain people of Ireland, between industry, agriculture and everything else, with oil from the Soviet Union.  I accept the Minister's denial that that is not true but anybody who imagines that we have the expertise, or would be likely in 100 years to develop the expertise that would enable us overnight to switch from the present structure to a nationalised one and still sell petrol and oil at the same price, known nothing about the operation of State companies here.  All the evidence of the State companies we have is to the effect that because they do not have the profit motive and have boards of whom it can be said that it does not mean one penny out of their pockets if the thing makes a loss at the end of the year they are not run as efficiently.  The result is that the prices are higher.  There is a State oil company in Italy which has direct arrangements with Iran and before this year's crisis petrol was being sold in Italy at 500 lire per litre which works out at £1.34 per gallon or 40 per cent higher than the Irish price before the crisis.  The State company in Norway made such colossal losses that it went bankrupt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not against State involvement where it is reasonable.  It is possible that Deputy O'Leary will suggest that.  If I can be persuaded by Deputy O'Leary, or anybody else, that this is a solution I will go along with it but the evidence of our State companies suggests that we would be a damn sight worse off with the thing in the hands of a State monopoly.  Another possibility is that we <Col N="125" /> diversify our energy supply sources. That was urged time and again by the Minister, and others, because they realise we have got to do that.  Nothing like enough effort is going into that or into providing ourselves with alternative sources of energy.  We are talking about biomass, wind, waves and tide but almost all the research on those has been done by outside agencies towards which we contribute a few pounds.  Very little is happening here in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another possibility is energy conservation. That is vital in a country which has housing which is the most wasteful of heat in Europe, as reported by the ESRI.  It is ironic that a Minister who whenever he opens his mouth about this says a few dutiful words, goes through the motions of giving a leg-up to energy conservation, who when he was asked what he was doing about it gave us an answer like the one given on Thursday week on his behalf by the Minister of State.  At the time I put down that question I did not have any inside information but I was anxious to contrast the situation which I casually noticed during the rare hour or half-hour I find myself watching television with that which existed when we were in office.  I did not notice any advertising recently of the kind initiated by Deputy Peter Barry of trying to persuade people to put lagging jackets on cylinders, turn off hot water taps and be careful and economical in the way they drive.</P>
    <P>In 1976, the last full year of the National Coalition, more than £70,000 was spent on that type of advertising.  I know that it is but a fraction of what is being spent on television trying to persuade us that it is part of what we are if we can say go dtuga Dia slán abhaile duit, but it is a lot of money for something serious in this little country. What was spent in the first three months of 1979 by this Government of geniuses on the same topic was £150.  A subeditor in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> obviously could not believe that because he gratuitously changed that figure to £15,000.  Obviously, he could not believe that it was only £150.  I believe that amount was for a bill left over from the Coalition time, that went astray and was <Col N="126" /> paid belatedly.  In other words, no money has been spent.</P>
    <P>We need from the Government, and the Minister, a sober, realistic and active policy on oil and energy, informed by a proper consultancy service.  I do not care whether it is permanently in the Department or outside so long as it is properly informed and led by a Minister who is less interested in personal confrontation and who is less interested in having flak jobs done by the GIS in an effort to put himself in a David-and-Goliath situation with the oil companies who are only laughing at him.  Until such time as we have this service we will have this recurring crisis.  The Minister smiled when I referred to rationing but it is time that we were considering rationing of supplies. We could introduce rationing and, should it be found not to be necessary, it could be forgotten about.  Nobody will blame a Government for being that bit too careful but they will be blamed for being asleep and this Government, this sleeping bridesmaid, has been asleep during the crucial early months of 1979&mdash;a situation that had led to the crisis and the panic we are talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; in line 1 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>having regard to the general short-fall in oil supplies and to the need for consumers generally to make the best use of available supplies, has full confidence in the Government and in the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to take such steps as they deem necessary to ensure the continued availability of supplies for our essential needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened with interest to Deputy Kelly's speech and I am impressed by the concern he has shown for the needs of the Irish consumer; but his concern, however well-intentioned, seems to be based on a misreading of the facts and to be distinctly divorced from reality.  The Deputy spent a considerable amount of his time quoting from various journals and articles.  He had before him copies of <Col N="127" /> a number of publications that come to us in the Department.  The Deputy knows that there are as many forecasters as there are journals and experts and that all of these experts are writing in these journals.  I envy Deputy Kelly the time that is obviously available to him to read in such detail&mdash;from front page to back page, line by line, it would appear&mdash;the daily newspapers.  He has referred particularly to a considerable number of headlines that have appeared from time to time.  One of the headlines he quoted was from a newspaper of some date in March and which read that Aer Lingus may have to restrict services.  Did they have to restrict their services or is that quotation as inaccurate as were many of the others used by the Deputy?  He quoted, too, the activity of one of his colleagues in the farming world who was involved in talks about oil supplies to the industry earlier in the year.  It is extremely misleading and totally inaccurate to say that farmers were not able to get supplies of gas or diesel in January or February.  The certified returns indicate that in January gas and diesel sales were 27.4 per cent greater than the comparative figures for January 1978 and that they were up by 12.3 per cent on sales in February 1978.  Would these figures appear to represent the kind of crisis that Deputy Kelly speaks of?</P>
    <P>The Deputy uses such phrases as &ldquo;new panic since the middle of March was predictable.&rdquo;  The panic has been generated by the type of speech we have just listened to.  What did emerge from the Deputy's statement was his obvious attraction to the operations of the multinationals. It would not be going too far to describe him as the darling of the multinationals. During the past couple of weeks we have heard from the Deputy in a series of questions and supplementaries his expression of concern for the role and the activity of the multinationals. We have had it here again this evening.  As the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy will be intervening in this debate tomorrow evening, I shall not refer to all the points raised by Deputy Kelly, despite the strong temptation on my part to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> On this question of energy the principal fact is that, as an energy-deficient country we are particularly vulnerable to any interference with oil supplies.  We are dependent on imported oil to the extent of about 75 per cent.  No amount of fudging can obscure this salient fact.  We do not have oil resources of our own.  All the oil we use&mdash;and we are now using more than six million tonnes a year&mdash; must be imported either as crude oil for refining at Whitegate or in product form. As most of us are aware, about 40 per cent of our oil needs are met by the Whitegate refinery with the balance coming from refineries elsewhere in product form.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly said, rightly, that we should be considering alternative sources of energy.  I would refer him to the Energy Ireland document published by the Department in July last.  Deputy Kelly made the point that we were making contributions towards investigations of alternative energy supplies but said that we are not involved in Ireland in any such investigation.  I would remind the Deputy of the project in Kerry and of the research being done in relation to the biomass project.  We must have regard also to our available resources as a small nation.  It would be ludicrous for us to try to duplicate the efforts of major countries in various parts of the world who are involved in investigations into alternative sources of energy&mdash;wave and wind power and so on.  Very sensibly what we are doing through the IEA and through EEC connections is making a contribution to the overall cost of the investigations that are taking place.  In this way we can save the nation financially and we can benefit by participating in the overall experiments which we could not hope to fund on our own.  Even if we had that sort of money it would be directed to other channels.  Therefore, ours is the intelligent approach.  We are involved, for example, in a joint wave project on the Scottish coast, an area that has many geographical similarities with our south-west coast.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might recapitulate the sequence of events that have led to problems of oil supplies.  The oil market is very sensitive to external pressure of <Col N="129" /> any kind.  Developments in Iran in the past six months have unbalanced the market completely.  The troubles there which started in the autumn culminated in the cessation of crude oil exports from that country for a period of more than two months from the end of December to early March last.  As is known generally Iran supplied about five-and-a-half million barrels of crude oil per day to the western world.  That was about one tenth of the western world's crude oil requirements.  About 10 per cent of our oil imports also came from Iran.  The loss of Iranian crude oil was temporarily made good by increased production in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, but a combination of circumstances, including the recent very severe winter and the Iranian decision not to export any more oil to Israel and South Africa led to unprecedented demand for any oil that became available.</P>
    <P>In addition, some industrialised countries, such as Japan, have been quite prepared to pay very high prices for what oil they can get.  Moreover, as soon as exports from Iran resumed on what was essentially an <i>ad hoc</i> basis some weeks ago, the Iranian authorities made the oil available, not on contract terms but at auction prices which, in turn, contributed to the upwards pressure on supplies.  Although oil exports from Iran have recommenced the flow of exports has been at uncertain levels and there are no assurances, as of now, that the oil flow from that country will be resumed on a regular basis at contract or fixed-price levels.  This uncertainty in supplies has meant that very few countries in the western world, except those fortunate enough to be entirely or virtually independent of oil imports, have not been affected by developments in Iran.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, prior to the disturbances in Iran about 10 per cent of all our oil imports came from that country.  It would unrealistic, therefore, to expect that we could get by without any adverse repercussions.  The reality is that the loss of Iranian oil, taken in conjunction with increased production elsewhere, resulted at the time in a shortfall in oil supplies of about <Col N="130" /> 5 per cent across the board, the shortfall being greater in some products than in others with consequent pressure on available supplies.</P>
    <P>In his contribution to this debate Deputy Kelly referred to a number of companies who had connections with and depended on Iran for their supplies to a limited degree or in varying degree. He mentioned two companies in particular. One company to which I should like to refer accounted for about 5 per cent of the market in this country, or did until this problem arose in Iran.  In my view they had not been meeting their obligations to the people of this country, to their contracted customers.  For a number of months that company did not supply any oil and, consequently, put pressure on other companies within the Irish economy.  Other companies who had a shortfall because of the Iranian situation tried to make up the shortfall by various other means, on the spot markets and in other ways.</P>
    <P>Our Department can in no way be held responsible and in no way do we agree with the attitudes taken by that company who had 5 per cent of the market.  I referred particularly to the treatment they attempted to mete out to their contract purchasers by the delivery of letters asking for increases of 50 per cent and 60 per cent in prices.  As Minister of State I and others in the Department abhor this.  In no way have they met their obligations to the Irish market and to their contracted customers.  I want to compliment the other companies who have attempted to take up the slack and handle the consequent pressure put on them by the failure of this company to meet their obligations to the market.</P>
    <P>A shortfall across the board of the order of 5 per cent, meant in an Irish context, a greater shortfall on motor spirit and gas-diesel than on other oil products such as fuel oil.  The shortfall has been highest in gas-diesel oil which is used for a variety of purposes including domestic central heating, as a tractor fuel, and as fuel for fishing boats, road haulage trucks, and so on.  A continued shortfall in supplies of gas-diesel oil in the current quarter is anticipated and, as Deputies will be aware, an order <Col N="131" /> providing for priority to be given to certain users of that product was recently made.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember what exactly the order made was.  Deputy Kelly referred to it as window-dressing.  That is not the exact phrase he used.  He said it was so much public relations work on behalf of the Government Information Services and so much bluster on behalf of the Minister, Deputy O'Malley.  The reality is that the order is very specific and lays down specific sectors of the community and of the economy which must be looked after.</P>
    <P>The Order is S.I. 142 of 1979, 3: in the period beginning on the commencement of this order and ending on 30 June 1979 an oil wholesaler, or a retailer, or a distributor shall in the delivery of gas-diesel oil give priority to the delivery of such oil for the purposes of the following: agriculture, which was quoted earlier as having a problem, commerce, fisheries, hospitals and similar institutions, industry and tourism.  Does Deputy Kelly suggest this is a bluster on behalf of the Minister?</P>

      <P>The Government and the Minister are fully conscious of the special importance of the tourist industry and of the major contribution it makes to the development of the national economy.  We are all aware of the jobs involved and the other contributions made by the tourist industry.  For these reasons, the Government will ensure that the essential requirements of that industry, including the provision of adequate supplies of petrol for tourists are met, and the necessary consultations to achieve this end are in train at the moment.</P>
      <P>A shortfall in supplies of motor spirit also cannot be ruled out but I would not care to speculate at this stage on what the level of shortfall in these two products will be during the current quarter.  There can be no certainty as to the level of future supplies but it is relevant that, in the first quarter of this year, direct deliveries into consumption of oil products by the oil companies were substantially in excess of direct deliveries during the corresponding period last year.  The information at my disposal indicated that in fact there was a total increase of about 10 per cent in deliveries of motor spirit as between the first quarter of 1979 and the corresponding quarter last year.  For gas-diesel oil the total increase was of the order of 15 per cent which by any standard is not unreasonable and, by reference to the known pressure on supplies elsewhere, was positively generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties in present circumstances of fully meeting what might be <Col N="133" /> called an insatiable demand for motor spirit and gas-diesel were somewhat starkly, if not brutally, put by President Carter recently when he made it clear that in the USA next winter it may be a choice between motor spirit and gas-diesel oil for domestic heating, but not both.  I need hardly stress the degree of &ldquo;muscle&rdquo; which the USA carries with its high level of indigenous oil production and its capacity to absorb enormous imports. In such circumstances, it would be unrealistic for us to continue to act on the assumption that unlimited supplies of all forms of oil products will continue to be available to us in the future.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise that, as of now, there is no oil crisis but there are oil problems.  Because of our special circumstances to which I adverted in my opening remarks we are particularly vulnerable.  We are at the end of a long queue for whatever oil supplies are going. We cannot hope to insulate ourselves from the effects of the constraints on oil supplies which other and more prosperous countries than ourselves are experiencing.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the future and the role of conservation referred to by Deputy Kelly.  He made great play with this figure of £150.  I admit that in 1976 expenditure on energy conservation by the then Government was £70,645.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On advertising the conservation message.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimate for energy conservation for 1979 as announced, amounts to £422,000.  This money will be spent not only on advertising but on other constructive suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present supply situation it is essential&mdash;Deputy Kelly referred to this matter and I take his point&mdash;that every effort be made to improve conservation and reduce demand by eliminating all wasteful uses of energy, some of them referred to by Deputy Kelly as being part of the advertising programme of the previous administration.  In international fora such as the EEC and the International Energy Agency more and more stress is being laid on the importance of <Col N="134" /> energy conservation.  This was part of the communique from the last meeting of the Heads of State.</P>
    <P>For some years the Department have encouraged the efficient use of energy through grant schemes to cover the cost of engaging consultants to carry out fuel efficiency surveys in industry and steps are being taken to give added impetus to this scheme.  Plans have already been drawn up for an invigorated campaign on the industrial front.  The IIRS have been given a leadership role in energy conservation.  The industrial energy department of the Institute will expand its existing consultancy, boiler-testing and advisory services to industry.  Considerable savings and additional profits can be achieved in the industrial sector. In their new role the Institute will actively seek out the areas in which they can assist rather than waiting for projects to be presented to them.  Particular attention will be paid to the follow-up action required to ensure proper implementation of the consultants' recommendations.</P>
    <P>The IDA provide grants of up to 30 per cent of the cost of machinery, equipment, instrumentation and building modifications designed to achieve savings in energy.  As regards new industry, the Minister for Industry Commerce and Energy has requested the IDA to ensure that the energy efficiency of a new industry is one of the criteria used in deciding whether aid should be granted. I am sure Deputy Kelly will agree that that is a positive approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>The maximum grant provided towards the labour and material costs of research and development projects of manufacturing firms which show a reasonable prospect of energy savings has been increased from £15,000 to £50,000 for any one project.  Again, I am sure Deputy Kelly will agree that that is a positive approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>A number of publicity campaigns have already been mounted.  The Department of the Environment will introduce building regulations for grant-aided new houses to meet specified thermal performance standards.  Again, I am <Col N="135" /> sure Deputy Kelly will agree that that is a positive approach to the matter.  As a contribution to energy conservation, in April 1979 that Department announced that insulation work in a private house qualified for a grant under the house improvement grant scheme.  Again, I am sure that Deputy Kelly will be prepared to admit that this is a positive approach to the matter.  Before a grant is paid for any reconstruction or improvement work the dwelling must provide a satisfactory measure of thermal insulation. Again, I am sure that Deputy Kelly will agree that that is a positive approach to the matter.</P>
    <P>As regards the energy saving from attic insulation, it is estimated, assuming that 40 per cent of the potential saving is taken up in increased comfort levels, that there would still be a saving of about £13 a year for a semi-detached house, £20 a year for a detached house and £32 a year for a bungalow.  The possibility of further encouraging the insulation of dwellings is being examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree; I have acknowledged that these are useful measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy.  A report of the IIRS, commissioned by the Department, on the energy conservation options in buildings is expected to be released within the next week or so. Almost one-third of the energy used in the country is consumed by the domestic sector.  The report will show that substantial savings are possible in new and existing houses through a combination of improved insulation standards and the use of smaller heating systems.  As a result of the study, it is estimated that energy demand for new housing can be reduced by as much as 55 per cent through the implementation of high insulation standards, and by 40 per cent for existing houses.  The study is primarily intended to assist technical and commercial people, but the result will also be made available in a separate volume to householders.  The Department have also commissioned An Foras Forbartha to study the efficiency and use of domestic <Col N="136" /> heating systems and their report is expected by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>When one considers that record one will find that it does not match Deputy Kelly's statement that the Department are not conscious of the importance of conservation and are not making an effort on conservation.  I have not yet before me the definitive figures for April but it is clear from what I said earlier that the shortages of gas, diesel and motor spirit experienced during the first quarter of 1979 were due not so much to reduced supplies coming onto the market but to supply and distribution difficulties aggravated by severe weather conditions.  The situation was further aggravated by unfortunate industrial disputes, the details of which it is not necessary for me to go into now.</P>
      <P>The recent estimates prepared by the IEA regarding the Irish oil supply situation for the second quarter of this year indicate that there will be a slight shortfall when compared with the average daily consumption for the period 1 April 1978 to 31 March 1979.  This outlook may alter later in the light of efforts being made by the IEA to alleviate the supply situation in this country but I'cannot be more positive at this stage.</P>
      <P>The oil companies are fully cognisant of their responsibilities for ensuring adequate supplies of oil and oil products and they have been left in no doubt that they must discharge these responsibilities to the best of their ability.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to a couple of points made by Deputy Kelly which I thought were unfair.  He refers to the Minister being involved in promotional tours.  I am not here to defend the Minister; the Minister will be here to defend himself tomorrow night.  It is rare for an Opposition spokesman to accuse a Minister of junketing, a Minister who is in New York on IDA promotional work, trying to get the best coverage for the achievements of the IDA in securing a plant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Do not blame me for the decisions of the Coalition Government. Deputy Kelly referred to the national oil corporation.  I am sure that this point will be covered by the Minister tomorrow night.  The Deputy referred in an insulting way to the ability of the people to regulate their own affairs.  He poured cold water on the idea that there is anyone in this country capable of managing a national oil corporation.  It is a sleeveen attitude to suggest that we are not capable of organising our own affairs. The Deputy's speech confirms once again everything that I have to come to take for granted from Deputy Kelly, the darling of the multinationals.</P>

      <P>There are two aspects to this debate.  The aspect which presumably concerns the public most immediately is the sale of petrol to motorists.  It is an undeniable fact that unofficial rationing exists at present in the Dublin region and possibly elsewhere.  Whether the Government accept this or not, the ordinary person attempting to get petrol will find this is the case.  Retail outlets are confining sales of petrol to a certain amount and are closing down earlier.  In fact, there are all the characteristics of a rationing system. There is widespread confusion about supplies to industry in the immediate future.  It does not get us very far to contrast the present confusion and chaos with the ordered situation which will exist when legislation comes before this House establishing a national oil corporation. I wish to make it clear that I support the concept of such a corporation because it is necessary in the national interest that the State should be involved in the area of energy.  It appears at present that the multinationals have this economy by the throat regarding the supply of oil products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must address myself also to the actualities of the present situation.  The scare headlines we have seen reflect some of the unease felt throughout the <Col N="138" /> country.  There are accusations about this group or that group hoarding supplies and I do not want to cast aspersions on any group.  The future plans of industry are imperilled by the present confusion.  Deputy John Ryan has informed me that there are farmers in Tipperary North who are short of six or eight weeks' supplies.  Their suppliers tell them there is a grave shortage and they are very worried about future energy requirements within the agriculture industry in that area, both in relation to early summer work and to the harvest later on.</P>
    <P>Industry is also concerned.  The Minister read certain listings for priority supplies but I agree with Deputy Kelly that there does not appear to be any ordering of priority as between particular groups.  The Minister has jumbled together hospitals and industry and expects order to reign, but confusion will continue unless there is clear formulation of how supplies are to be allocated. The motorist knows there is unofficial rationing of petrol and the queues outside garages testify to this.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a blanket curtailment of supplies of houshold heating fuel.  Many of the newer housing estates surrounding the cities have no heating facilities except oil-fired central heating. One can imagine the plight of families during this unexpected cold spell when faced with the fact that there will be no further supplies.  These unfortunate householders are being met with a blanket refusal by the oil companies. Granted there is priority for industry, hospitals and those who are ill, but surely there must also be priority for families living in houses such as I describe.  They were encouraged to purchase their homes at a time when it was considered there would be no shortage of this kind of fuel in the future.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary insight into the calibre of this Government that this confusion should reign at this time.  The events in Iran have not occurred overnight. There were many Irish technicians working in Iran who could informally tell Members of this House in mid-autumn that there was an exodus beginning from Iran's oil industry and that <Col N="139" /> there would be a severe strain on EEC countries who depended on supplies from that area.  Because of Ireland's lack of refining capacity it was clear that we would be in a more vulnerable position than most.  I put down a question to the Minister regarding the Iranian crisis and how it would affect us.  My memory is that a rather bland reply was given which suggested that the crisis would not have an excessively detrimental effect on supplies.  I recall that this was before Christmas and I must check the record to see if my memory is correct.  This crisis was long in the making and it is extraordinary that this Government should have been so unprepared in view of the obvious and immediate consequences for our energy supplies.</P>
    <P>To say the way to deal with the crisis is a set of jumbled priorities, about which no one is very clear, and to say that later there will be legislation for a national oil corporation is not the kind of action one would associate with a Government doing their job properly. This Government, faced with the supply problem, have proved themselves incompetent. The Minister must act far more decisively than he has done so far. It is not sufficient to talk about future plans for a national oil corporation, though I support that concept; the State should have an involvement in this area. In setting up a national oil corporation we would be dealing with powerful vested interests.  A large State investment would be entailed and the operations of the corporation should extend to distribution as well as supply.</P>
    <P>Such is the control exerted by the multinationals over distribution and storage that up to recently no one was clear as to the supply situation in this country.  There have been reports to suggest that even EEC requirements at certain points were not fulfilled in their entirety, that a certain capacity was held elsewhere and that there was not available to us the amount which officially we were told was available.  There was also insufficiency of information about the actual grades held, a vital factor in knowing what sort of situation faces us.  If you do not know how much <Col N="140" /> diesel you have, how much heating oil and so on you cannot plan with any degree of confidence.</P>
    <P>The powers that the companies undoubtedly have in Ireland must be faced and the State must if possible compete in this area to ensure a fair deal for Irish consumers.  I am not certain that Irish consumers are getting a fair deal from the oil companies at present.  It is an extraordinary coincidence that in the period in which we await the result of an application for a price increase shortage is experienced.  There is widespread public suspicion of profiteering in this situation of price applications.  Perhaps profiteering is a sensational term but nonetheless that is the feeling of many members of the public, that immediately pending a price increase there appears to be an artificial shortage.  Again, the problem here is that the State lacks sufficient knowledge of the actual supply situation.  That appears to reinforce the case for a strong State presence in the area of supply and distribution of oil products.  It would mean that when the State draws up a priority list for industry, for the services, for hospitals it would have some reality whereas the suspicion can legitimately be held that the Minister is powerless at present when it comes to attempting to control the situation in any discernible way.</P>
    <P>My accusation would be that this first Minister for Industry Commerce and Energy&mdash;and energy was added to his title by a Government that was proud that it was going to deal with energy in a constructive and imaginative way&mdash;has not coped adequately with the kind of crisis that has erupted.  The Government have been found wanting in its duty to industry and services in the matter of presiding over a serious situation.  We have many factories worried about their energy needs in the future.  The farming industry, which we are so often told is important to the national economy is worried and farm leaders are talking of making their own arrangements in regard to supplies, so lacking in confidence are they about the situation confronting them.  Industry, therefore, is at the mercy of the multinationals; the Government are apparently powerless <Col N="141" /> and unprepared for a crisis which was some time in the making.  The Government in this particular instance have proved to be incompetent and unable to deal with a crisis that was reasonably predictable.  As they said subsequently, it is a crisis which affects this country more severely than others.</P>
    <P>We have asked questions in the House about what contacts, if any, were to be made with other EEC countries about assistance in our situation.  No information is forthcoming and it is very doubtful if any assistance can come our way from EEC sources in this matter since oil is the industrial lifeline in so many of them.  I think the Minister should first explain and clarify the priority system that the Government wish to be adopted by industry and the services; clarify the new surveillance provisions drawn up with the companies, clarify the matter of the staff available to the Government for that sort of surveillance.  The Minister says we have not a crisis, just a problem&mdash;I do not know.  The fact is that the industrialist is worried about his supplies, the motorist cannot get sufficient petrol to bring him to work, the family depending on a single source of energy have been told by the oil heating companies that there can be no deliveries indefinitely.  In this weather it can easily be imagined what a crisis that can be.  It is true that there is supposed to be priority for sick people but there is confusion about whether a doctor's certificate suffices in such cases.  One does not know what sort of data exists on the number of households depending on oil heating.</P>
    <P>During the period of the last Government we awoke to this problem being the first Government to be hit by this unique problem of the seventies with which we now live and we will live into the indefinite future in an era of energy scarcity. Before the early seventies that was not recognised.  In that Government we attempted to ensure that all new house building would at least give the occupants a choice of forms of heating.  There are still too many not in that position since there was official encouragement over the years for uni-heating in our homes.  Too many recently built homes <Col N="142" /> depend solely on oil for heating.  To deal with such cases with a complete and comprehensive refusal of further supplies is not fair or adequate.  The Minister and his staff, and the Minister of State present here, have a good deal of explaining to do to a public very confused and at present suffering a rationing system.</P>
    <P>It is merely a battle of words to say whether the Government will or will not introduce a rationing system; in my opinion <i>de facto</i> rationing is in operation in the Dublin region.  There is a shortage in Dublin; there are garages that are not open and there is curtailment of supplies which appears to be accentuated about the time when the companies are applying for another price increase.</P>
    <P>One cannot say how many more price increases we will have in the case of petrol products this year.  From my last reading of reports there are two or three pending.  One may certainly say that at the minimum fuel will go through a threefold increase in price in 1979; that is a pretty safe prediction.  Pending each price application, are we to experience further artificial shortages?  Is industry to be held up to ransom?  Are the motorists and householders to be held to ransom and must we all wait for the wonderful day when the legislative framework of the national oil corporation will appear?  Pending that legislation we need more information and the Minister should get a more realistic understanding with the oil companies.  I sympathise with him and I agree with speakers who suggest that these are very strong companies.  The budgets of some of the multinationals far surpass the budgets of individual states.  They are huge corporations wielding great power over supplies.  I do not pretend that it is an easy task, nor would we think it is, for us to preserve the national interest in the midst of this welter of international strength existing in the oil world.  On the other hand, the vulnerability of the country in relation to oil supplies which will continue for some time into the future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing this question to be raised on the Adjournment and to thank the Minister for consenting to reply to it.</P>
      <P>There is no more emotive issue in Waterford than the question of a second bridge.  There is nothing more calculated to lead to argument, public and private, and more likely to lead to criticism of public representatives in Waterford than the naked question of the state of the Redmond Bridge and the need for a second bridge for Waterford.  There is justification for the concern expressed by the people of Waterford about the present state of Redmond Bridge.  This is an old bridge which was built at the beginning of the century, opened around 1913, in a day when we had no articulated vehicles.  Today we have these 40-foot containers, long vehicles, heavy vehicles weighing 32 tons gross, indeed sometimes weighing even more, because there is certainly an allegation that many companies are exceeding the permitted axle loadings.</P>
      <P>Because of the age of the bridge and the rapid development in transport technique, especially in the last 20 years, it is becoming clearly obvious that Redmond Bridge is not capable of facilitating this traffic.  It is not capable of handling the weight or the volume of the traffic at this point in time.  It just was not built for it technically; and that it has lasted for so long is a high tribute to the engineers who designed it and the builders who built it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern has been expressed in public&mdash;and the Minister is aware of <Col N="144" /> it&mdash;about the future of Redmond Bridge. The Minister is more than aware of the public pressure being brought to bear on him to provide a second and preferably a high-level bridge in Waterford.  It has come to the time in relation to the heavy traffic when the life of Redmond Bridge can be counted in years.  Concern has been expressed about the need to enforce the maximum axle loading regulations and unless these regulations are adhered to the bridge is in danger.</P>
    <P>It was in that context that the Minister received, on 29 March last, a deputation of public representatives and local authority employees&mdash;managers and engineers&mdash;from Waterford city and county, Kilkenny and Tipperary.  It was the unanimous wish of that deputation that the Minister would sanction the building of a high-level bridge for Waterford. I have never seen such unity of purpose in any deputation with which I was concerned.</P>
    <P>It is to be regretted that the Minister has decided that, due to the state of repair of the present bridge, a low-level bridge, or a twin for Redmond bridge, should be built.  His grounds are safety ones and are quite valid.  The safety of people and traffic is his responsibility. However, it was the opinion of the City Engineer, certainly, that if certain arrangements were made, especially in relation to the maximum axle loading limits being enforced, that the bridge would last for six years at least.  This period, it was agreed, would elapse from the time the Minister gave sanction for the bridge to the time of completion.  We were satisfied that the bridge could be maintained in proper repair, assuming money was spent on it and the maximum loadings adhered to during that period of six years.</P>
    <P>We require a high-level bridge for a number of reasons.  One&mdash;and by far the most important&mdash;is that we must have a second bridge to cater for the volume of traffic, particularly coming from the north end of the city, the main Dublin road, Kilkenny road, the road to the north and the road from the north-west. There is an incontestable case for a high-level bridge in Waterford.  The other reason we are seeking a high-level bridge is that we need to have a network of <Col N="145" /> roads serving the city, ring roads which will facilitate and dilute the traffic around the city rather than continuing the present situation where all the traffic is filtered right into the centre of the city causing severe congestion.  It has been the wish for nigh on 15 years that we should get this second bridge.</P>
    <P>I think it was on 5 October last year that the final plans for a high-level bridge were submitted to the Minister's Department. Those plans were meticulously drawn up and we were satisfied that they were the best possible plans in the context of the overall development of the city, the industrial and commercial development.  The roads required would be neatly linked in and would allow for a ring-road from the new high-level bridge across the southern part of the city to connect up with the main Cork road.  On the north side of the city we were putting a ring-road around the Ferrybank side of the city to connect up with the New Ross road and also feeding from and feeding into the bridge would be a major road linking up the main Dublin and Limerick roads.  That would have solved the traffic problems in Waterford for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is to be regretted that the Minister is in favour of a low-level bridge for Waterford, a twin to Redmond Bridge.  In the booklet entitled <i>Road Development Plans for 1980s</i> the Minister quite clearly has set his sights on a low level bridge in Waterford city which should be completed, if I have read the relevant section correctly, by 1984.  The question of a high-level bridge to be completed by 1989 has been suggested. I would like the Minister to confirm that he does mean that the high-level bridge will be completed by 1989 as is suggested in his booklet although I doubt the Minister's intentions in the matter because if we take a time scale of six years in the building of the bridge I would feel that the Minister does really not have his heart in the question of a high-level bridge in Waterford because if he did and if his intentions were clear and if his intentions were to allow the corporation to continue to purchase all the necessary land and property in order to have the feed roads into the bridge ready he would have issued a letter of <Col N="146" /> approval of the technical design for the high-level bridge.  This has not been forthcoming to my knowledge.  I am not aware that he has issued it or that he intends to issue it.  I would ask the Minister to say clearly if he intends to issue this letter.  If he does not, there will be grave disappointment in Waterford and the setback will be very great.  It will be obvious to all that the Minister does not intend to put his heart into the provision of a high-level bridge for Waterford.</P>
    <P>Waterford's population in 1977 was 42,250.  I do not mean the strict legal population but the population as specified in the Brady, Shipman, Martin Report, the Waterford Environs Study, Structure Plan Stage.  That population of 42,250 is expected to rise to 53,584 by the end of the eighties.  Waterford has only one bridge.  Towns of smaller size have two bridges and I understand Sligo town has three bridges.  If anything should happen to the Waterford bridge, if it should fall, apart from the personal disruption it would cause, the commercial life of Waterford would be in jeopardy because there would be no way across the River Suir.  If the low-level bridge is provided the present traffic congestion will not be alleviated; the city centre will continue to be a turmoil of congestion; the commercial life of Waterford might be irreparably damaged if a high-level bridge is not built.</P>
    <P>I know it is the Minister's intention to allow a second-level bridge to be built and I know it is his intention to allow the Ferrybank dual carriageway to be built within the next four years.  I know his reasons are safety reasons and I take his point but if he does not say that he is going to issue a letter of approval for the technical design of the high-level bridge and if he does not say, &ldquo;yes, we are going to build a high-level bridge and it will be completed by 1989&rdquo;, there will be grave disappointment in Waterford and there will be a certain feeling that Waterford is not getting its fair share of the national cake.  That opinion is very prevalent in the city and I am sure the Minister will find that out from any of the Deputies from the constituency that Waterford is not getting its fair share.  It has got more than its fair share of unemployment <Col N="147" /> and industrial hardship in the past ten years but has not got its fair share in respect of new industry and in respect of the infrastructural service which any growing city needs.  Waterford was designated as a growth centre but very few people in Waterford would believe that it is a growth centre now.  I am putting it straight to the Minister and I want a straight answer.  Will he forthwith issue a letter approving the technical design of the high-level bridge thus allowing proper planning and acquisition to continue and to be completed so that the high-level bridge can then be constructed?  I want the Minister to give his assurance that money will be provided and set aside year by year and a commitment made to the people of Waterford that this high-level bridge will be completed before the end of the eighties.</P>
    <P>All the public representatives in Waterford would prefer to see the high-level bridge built first and if necessary the low-level bridge built afterwards. That is the clear opinion of the people of Waterford and of the members of the staff of Waterford Corporation.  We have had full support for our cause from all the public representatives in the adjoining counties.  It is obvious that the future development of Waterford in the long term depends on proper access to proper service roads and proper ring roads and unless the Government give a commitment in respect of this high-level bridge the people of Waterford will be gravely disappointed.  I want straight answers to straight questions.  I want to know will the Minister issue the letter approving the technical design and give a clear commitment to the House that the high-level bridge will be proceeded with as soon as the property and lands have been acquired by Waterford Corporation. I want this question answered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is looking for straight answers to straight questions.  I can assure him he will get straight answers.  First of all, I would like to explain the problems in Waterford.  I am afraid the Deputy was trying to put the <Col N="148" /> cart before the horse.  Waterford Corporation are proposing to build a high-level bridge.  I told them what they had to do in order to set up an inquiry when they sent a deputation up here on 29 March last.  I also confirmed this in writing on 9 April.  I told them that I am in no way opposed to a high-level bridge. They are fully aware of this.  I told them that in order to get the bridge under way they would have to be able to assure me that they have the land available for approach roads.  They admitted they had not.  I also explained that they would have to hold a bridge inquiry and when they could satisfy me that they had acquired the land either by negotiation or compulsory purchase order that the construction of the bridge could be got under way.  I also explained that the bridge inquiry and the inquiries for the compulsory purchase of land would have to run simultaneously.  I made this clear in writing to Waterford Corporation and I do not know what the confusion is about.  I said I would set up the inquiry as soon as they satisfied me on those matters.  How much straighter can I be with regard to an answer than that?</P>
      <P>With regard to the letter the Deputy is looking for about the design of the bridge, that can come only after the inquiry because, as Minister, I am in the role of final adjudicator with regard to the inquiry.  Therefore, I cannot prejudice objections that may be voiced at the inquiry by taking the action the Deputy is asking.  The inquiry must come first and the bridge order afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That should satisfy everyone that I am in no way opposed to the high-level bridge, that I am in favour of it.  I appreciate how necessary it is for the further development of the area and I shall continue to support the project. Waterford Corporation must play their part.  Otherwise they will delay having the high-level bridge.  It is estimated now that it will be almost seven years before a vehicle crosses the high-level bridge.  At my meeting with the deputation the county manager, without my posing the question, said that it would be at least six years before traffic would cross the bridge.  If the corporation get on with the job they will have the high-level bridge in <Col N="149" /> the minimum time.  The delay is not at this end.  It is the corporation who are delaying matters now.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the second issue which is involved, namely, the state of Redmond Bridge, the only bridge crossing the River.  Without a bridge into Waterford the commercial life of the city, of other parts of Waterford and as far as south Wexford would be completely strangled.  Even the ferry service from south Wexford to Cork would be interfered with.  The Redmond Bridge is in a very bad state of repair and I have responsibility in the matter.  I did not make the decision about the poor state of repair of the bridge.  The consultants employed by Waterford Corporation said so in their report.  The estimated cost of temporary repairs is now approaching £500,000 and even if those repairs were carried out the consultants state that they cannot guarantee any life for that bridge thereafter.  It could well be that £500,000 would be thrown down the drain and Waterford might be left without any bridge.  Does Deputy Collins and his colleagues want that to happen? What about the economic and commercial life of the area and the further development of Waterford city?</P>
    <P>Last Friday when I was launching the national road development plan I said that Redmond Bridge is inadequate for the volume and type of traffic using it and is also structurally deficient.  I said that the immediate requirement for Waterford city is the replacement of Redmond Bridge.  I stated, however, that having regard to a number of considerations such as regional development, the growth of port activity and industrial development, the proposal to replace the present bridge is without prejudice to the development of proposals for another new bridge to be built upstream of Redmond Bridge with new connecting roads to the Rosslare, Kilkenny and Cork roads.  In the page which I presume the Deputy referred to with regard to Waterford, it does not speak about a bridge but about bridges.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the present state of <Col N="150" /> the bridge, even after carrying out the repairs I mentioned it would be unsafe. In the event of a serious accident, perhaps loss of life or property, responsibility would rest here, not with Deputy Collins.  The Minister of the day would be the person responsible.  I have responsibility to the people who use the bridge. I also must ensure that traffic can come and go into Waterford.  In an effort to ensure this in the minimum of time, I have decided that Redmond Bridge must be replaced so that vehicles may cross the replacement bridge in two years' time as against the minimum of seven years for a high-level bridge.  Do the people want a bridge into Waterford or do they want to be in a situation where they may have to wait seven years?  I do not think the people of Waterford want to wait so long.</P>
    <P>I wish to give straight answers to the questions put by the Deputy.  So far as I am concerned the high-level bridge is on. Waterford Corporation should take the necessary action.  It is they who are causing the delay, not my Department. The Deputy said plans were submitted last autumn but they were not adequate, as he knows.  They did not make provision for approach roads or their acquisition. There is little use in looking at plans to put a bridge across the river when it is not possible to get on to the bridge or to get off it.  The corporation should look into these essential matters.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that the high-level bridge is on, but equally the replacement of Redmond Bridge must also be on.  Waterford Corporation and the Minister have a responsibility to sure that there is no loss of life or property on the existing, inadequate bridge.  They must also ensure that the commercial and industrial life of Waterford does not come to a standstill.  We must ensure that traffic can use the replacement bridge until the high-level bridge becomes operational in about seven years' time.</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>(1)  The figure for local authority housing for 1979 is the total of the amounts allocated to date to housing authorities in County Donegal and relates to commitments on hands at 31 December 1978, and new works to be started before 31 July 1979.  Additional allocations may, subject to availability of resources, be made to finance additional starts in the second half of 1979.</P>
    <P>(2)  The 1979 figure for loans and grants is the allocation under that heading for the half year to 30 June 1979.  A further allocation will be made for the second half of 1979.</P>
    <P>(3)  The figures for loans and grants relate to new and previously-occupied houses and are applied by the housing authorities according to demand to either new or previously-occupied houses.</P>

      <P>A review was undertaken during the course of the present school-year of the classroom accommodation requirements for pupils of national schools in Killarney and the extent of the accommodation already available.  A report of a working party which considered the matter is to be submitted formally to my Department.  Pending receipt of a formal submission from the relevant authorities and a full examination of all aspects of the question I am not in a position to make a statement in regard to the proposal for an extension to the Presentation Monastery Schools.</P>
