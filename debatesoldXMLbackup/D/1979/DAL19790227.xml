      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development if he will make a statement concerning the meeting early in January between members of the Government and the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions concerning pay negotiations in 1979, with particular reference to Ireland's entry into the EMS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the beginning of January I have had a number of meetings with representatives of the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The first meeting was on 4 January and it took place at the request of ICTU. Discussion centred on issues arising from Ireland's participation in the European Monetary System.  As the commencement of EMS has been delayed, it was decided to complete these discussions at a later date.  The Government's White Paper, <i>Programme for National Development 1979-1981</i> was also discussed at the later meetings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussions were very comprehensive and wide-ranging.  We attempted to review all the relevant issues which would arise as a consequence of membership of the EMS and at the later meetings we discussed the implications for domestic action of the various development objectives set out in the Government's White Paper.  As a result of those meetings, I undertook to convey an outline of the <Col N="153" /> Government's thinking on these matters to the Executive Council and I have done so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of those negotiations, did the Minister put before the social partners a desirable wage figure for 1979?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The specific position of the two representatives was that they had not a mandate to discuss pay increases or the likely format of any possible new wage agreement. For that reason, there was no specific discussion on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that talks would take place as soon as the inaugural date of the EMS was known. When does the Minister expect this might be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the delay in regard to the introduction of the EMS is associated with the need to resolve a number of specific issues in the agricultural area, the operation of the MCAs.  It is understood that these issues will be further discussed at a meeting of the agriculture Ministers next Monday and Tuesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development if he has under consideration any meetings with the social partners to <Col N="154" /> devise a wages policy in 1979 after the expiry of the national wage agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development if any arrangements are under consideration to replace the present national wage agreement on its expiry in view of his recent speeches on the general theme of moderation in wage increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>No discussions have taken place so far on a new wages policy to follow on the expiry of the present national wage agreement.  The House will be aware, however, of the Government's wish, as expressed by the Taoiseach in a recent address, that a broad understanding between Government, the trade union movement and other interests should be achieved.  This would embrace employment targets and other policies, as well as pay.  The Government are encouraged by the positive attitude towards such a possible understanding adopted by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in their statement issued today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister see any basis for further talks with the social partners, particularly the trade unions, on possible wage targets for 1979? Does he see a basis for such discussions arising out of any similarity between the document which has been circulated to affiliated unions and the document sent out by him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, the Government are encouraged by the positive attitude towards such a possible understanding, that is, towards the specific issues that would need to be dealt with in the context of any broadly-based understanding.  The trade union document appears to expand these various issues.  It deals with questions of policy for employment creation, with relevant policies in the taxation area as well as the nature of the guidelines for pay developments that would appear to be appropriate in these circumstances. However, my understanding is that at <Col N="155" /> this juncture it is a discussion document and it is a matter for the trade union delegates to decide on some course of action in response to that set of proposals before it would be appropriate for formal meetings to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention to comment on the aspect of the document which refers to a probable inflation rate in 1979 making it necessary to go for wage claims of approximately 16½ per cent?  If the inflation rate is as high as 10 per cent, is it the Minister's intention to comment on that aspect of the document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the trade union document does not contain any figures and, to that extent, I think it appropriate that it should avoid seeking to identify specific numbers as being the relevant issue at this juncture.  In my view it is far more important to seek to identify the basis on which prices and incomes might move during the current year and the nature of the arrangements that would be appropriate to ensure not only that the living standards of workers are protected but also that they share fairly in any improvement in living standards that would be possible as a result of increased national production.  I think that is the position of the trade unions.  I should like to add I would not endorse the various reports that have appeared today in newspapers and other media that make references to fairly large numbers.  I do not regard them as an accurate representation of the situation because even without any new pay increases this year the incomes of most, if not all, workers will rise anyway as a result of increases under the final phases of the 1978 agreement and also as a result of the carry-over effect of last year's figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it would be in the interests of all that there would not be any premature references to figures at this point in the hope of getting some settlement for wage and salary increases during the coming year in line with other income increases.  However, does the Minister agree that it would be <Col N="156" /> helpful in this connection, if trade union thinking is tending to believe in an inflation rate that seemingly is in excess of the rate forecast by Government sources, if Government Ministers would come in on this one and give the facts which would suggest a lower rate of inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated already, I do not think it appropriate to go into numbers in any great detail at this juncture.  I would be surprised if there were any misunderstanding in this area because in the course of the meetings that I had with representatives of ICTU when we were discussing the various White Paper targets and so on, one of the issues on which clarification was sought was the nature of the inflation target the Government had in mind and its interpretation and, therefore, the likely trend of price rises which might occur this year.  Since those meetings took place prior to the budget, obviously it was not possible for union representatives to form a final judgment as to the overall rate of price increases that would arise because, of course, indirect tax changes would affect the overall increase in the consumer price index this year but I think there was sufficient awareness of the likely trends in prices throughout the various quarters of the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the principle that pay rises be index-linked both to the consumer price index and increases in GNP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>While I recognise and support the underlying principle behind indexation, namely, the desire to protect the living standards of workers, I have to point out there would be circumstances in which it would not be appropriate automatically to seek to guarantee indexation.  The obvious example is in the case where there could be a price rise because of a severe import price increase&mdash;oil is a classic example. If there was a severe increase in oil prices there is no way in which everybody could be compensated for such an increase because the effect of such a rise would be to make the nation <Col N="157" /> as a whole poorer.  Clearly there would need to be some understanding of the arrangements that would be appropriate in such circumstances.  It might be possible to compensate some groups in such circumstances&mdash;let us assume the lower income groups.  If that were so, quite clearly it follows that other groups would not be compensated.  The second area where I do not think there would be an automatic presumption in favour of indexation would be where indirect tax increases occurred.  Very often the purpose of such increases is to raise additional revenue to finance improvements in social welfare benefits or other desirable developments in the social area.  Clearly it would defeat the purpose of such an attempt if those tax increases were to become the cause of a general wave of income increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot continue with this question all the afternoon. We have spent a long time on it.  I am calling the next question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state if he excludes the possibility of a national deal that takes into account taxation, social insurance and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not exclude such an understanding.  On the contrary, I thought I made clear in my initial reply that I was encouraged by the positive approach of the trade union movement on these issues.  I am saying that I cannot just jump to an automatic acceptance of any particular formula. While particular proposals, whether for indexation of pay increases or a guarantee of living standards of groups, may be relevant and might be the subject of some form of understanding, they need to be placed in a wider context. They need to be part of a more comprehensive understanding and this was what the Taoiseach called for in his original address about a month ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state to what extent he is prepared to go to <Col N="158" /> achieve a new national pay deal?  What would be the Government's attitude to a free-for-all?  What action will the Government take, arising from the attitude of the Minister for Finance in his budget speech, if the free-for-all is envisaged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it useful at this juncture to speculate on hypothetical situations.  The appropriate approach at the moment is to await discussion of the ICTU document by trade union delegates, then see the nature of the position which the trade union movement will adopt, because until such time as there is some approved trade union position, I do not see how the executives of the trade union movement could be in a position to negotiate any form of agreement&mdash;they would not have the authority to do so.  Therefore, it is appropriate to await the determination of the trade union position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the correctness of what the Minister has said about awaiting the outcome of the unions discussions on the document, but would he not agree it would be helpful if someone on behalf of the Government were authoritatively to state their view on the facts known to them after the budget and what their estimate is of inflation for 1979?  This would have a close bearing on wage expectations.  Can the Minister tell the House now what he expects the 1979 inflation rate to be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with that matter.  I said I did not regard it as being relevant at this juncture.  I pointed out in my earlier reply that the trade union document by itself does not go into numbers.  Numbers are not a relevant issue at this juncture and it would not be helpful to seek to introduce them into the discussion at this stage.  It is far more important to seek to clarify the nature of the issues on which some form of decision is required and some sort of policy formulated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The policies for the development of agriculture set out in the White Paper <i>Programme for National Development 1978-1981</i> derive mainly from the options discussed in the Green Paper <i>Development for Full Employment</i> and from the public response to them.  The emphasis of the options was on general measures for raising the growth rate of the sector and <Col N="160" /> not on specific commodities.  As stated in the White Paper, a wide range of factors can affect the levels of individual commodity outputs and have to be examined before targets for these outputs can be set on a well-informed basis.  This work is under way and its results will be taken into account in deciding to what extent in the further development of the planning process the setting of more detailed targets is likely to be helpful in improving agricultural performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept any of these things.  Indeed, this illustrates some of the differences between us.  I have always sought to avoid what I would call the spurious position of decimal place planning.  It is not relevant at this juncture to be publishing long detailed series of targets through decimal places for individual sectors of the economy when they are not the immediate priorities or the immediate <Col N="161" /> problems to be overcome if we are to have a successful planning process.  The immediate issues lie in the areas which we have already identified: the action within the public sector to redirect the nature of public spending, the very large increase in capital spending this year, especially in key areas of relevance to development, such as roads, water supplies and so forth.  In so far as other sectors are concerned, we have placed emphasis&mdash;we have discussed it on earlier questions&mdash;on the need to achieve a sufficient degree of understanding and support from the trade union movement and other groups, including farmers, on the nature of the development programme to be pursued and the manner in which that programme should be financed.  Until these important key issues have been the subject of some reasonable basis of understanding and agreement, it would be not only futile but laughable to be indulging in these fantasy exercises of detailed decimal place targets, whatever entertainment and amusement they might provide for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy goes back to compare the circumstances in which the detailed targets in the Second Programme were formulated he will find that they were the subject of discussion at a time when there appeared to be a reasonable degree of consensus among the relevant groups concerned as to the direction in which they were to move.  For that reason it made sense at the time to have them published.  I do not believe there is that sufficient degree of understanding at the moment or that there is the same degree of underlying stability in likely price and output trends. If we go back to those days in the first half of the sixties we will find that we <Col N="162" /> were not then emerging from a severe international recession, we were not coming out of very rapid price and output fluctuations such as we have experienced in recent years.  We must tailor our behaviour according to the relevant circumstances and not become locked in some blind automatic formula which may be totally irrelevant.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that one of the major objectives of economic planning is to provide certainty in business as to the Government's expectations of what will happen and to create an atmosphere of confidence generally?

What we can seek to do is to identify the range of uncertainty, to indicate the factors that influence the range of uncertainty, the extent to which varying outcomes are possible over a period of time and then to indicate the nature of the action that can be taken either to reduce the incidence of undesirable development or to reduce the hardship or damage that might be caused if certain undesirable external developments were to occur.

      <P>I do not have the calculation in that form.  To give it in that form would not serve any useful purpose.  If somebody enters regular full-time employment on, say, 1 December 1978 that is as valid an employment creation activity as somebody who has entered a full-time regular job on, say, 1 January.  To convert each of those recruitment activities into full-year equivalents would be to refer to the second <Col N="164" /> person, the person employed from 1 January, as the equivalent of one man-year, and the person employed on 1 December would emerge as one-twelfth.

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue) (for the Minister for Finance) Martin O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue) (for the Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recent speech I said that the investment policies of the German trade unions should be worthy of the attention of Irish trade union leaders and trade union members.  I pointed to the powerful role played by the trade unions in the German economy.  The West German <Col N="169" /> trade unions own the largest conglomerate in the Federal Republic of Germany; they have dominant stakes in one of West Germany's biggest banks; and they are heavily involved in other commercial and building activity.  The trade union conglomerate and its subsidiaries employ over 40,000 people.  I understand that the trade unions' primary purpose in this development was not to make money but to get into important areas of the economy so that they were able to influence to some extent the prices charged to the consumer. Moreover, if they were able to compete and to provide goods and services at a reasonable price, then everybody competing with them had to do so also.</P>
    <P>I have made this point on the possibilities of trade union investment on a number of occasions.  In February 1978 I said that I would be genuinely and sympathetically interested in seeing the trade union movement here establishing industrial projects which could become pilot schemes for a more enlightened and sensible pattern in industrial relations, and I assured those who initiate such projects of a warm welcome at Government level.  In April last I drew attention to a paper published by the ESRI and delivered at an ICTU summer course in July 1977.  This paper pointed out that trade unions in Israel had developed large industrial enterprises embracing such industries as metals, chemicals, electronics and construction.  I believe that the activities of the trade unions in Germany and Israel deserve examination by the Irish trade union movement.</P>
    <P>My remarks were made primarily in the context of job creation and the need for all sections of the community to play their part in tackling this major national problem.  I was not suggesting that Irish trade unions should slavishly copy what is done in other countries.  On the contrary, I suggested that they should examine the best features of trade union activity in a number of other countries with a view to evolving a system which would be more suited to Irish conditions.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also refers to the wage bargaining methods of German trade unions.  German trade unions have been prepared to agree to moderate rises in <Col N="170" /> nominal incomes in the recognition that the consequential slow rate of inflation will retain the real value of these increases for their members.  This attitude has been an important factor in securing German post-war economic growth.  The recognition by the German unions of the connection between moderate incomes increases, low inflation and substantial economic growth should, I think, be of interest to Irish trade union leaders and members.</P>
    <P>In my recent speeches I made no reference to the question of whether wage agreements should be legally binding.  If this matter is dealt with in the report of the Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Relations, the Government will consider on their merits any proposals the commission may put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Minister and Deputy O'Leary, but I want to make it clear that any remark I made at the end of the last question and answer was directed purely at the Minister and did not in any way refer to the Chair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the German trade union movement has been in the happy position of, as he puts it, accepting moderate increases over the last number of years because their members and members' families have the basic assurance that the welfare system in Germany prevents them having very poor conditions at home, that poverty is largely outlawed in the country, and that this more than any negotiating technique of the German trade union movement is responsible for the basic sanity of their industrial relations code?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point about the more comprehensive nature of the understanding that exists, but I do not see how poverty could have been abolished at the time that this type of approach was adopted.  I understand that it was adopted in the fairly early years of German recovery and reconstruction after the war when there <Col N="171" /> would have been relatively low levels of income and significant degrees of hardship in a number of areas.  As a consequence of sufficient commitment to and support for a particular policy approach there was a very sustained period of rapid growth, which of course meant a very sustained period of rapid improvement in the living standards of German workers.  I recognise the relevance of that.</P>

      <P>Yes.  That is why the Taoiseach and other members of the Government, including myself, have sought to encourage more comprehensive types of agreement or understanding with the trade union movement.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider a system whereby political parties in this country would be funded directly and totally by the State, thus eliminating the need for seeking and accepting private contributions from individuals and organisations, which in some circumstances would tend to limit the freedom of action of a Government or political party; and if he is satisfied with the present arrangements.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that political parties already receive payments from the Central Fund by way of an allowance for expenses paid to the leaders of the parties and that these allowances were increased substantially in 1978 to meet the cost of a transport allowance for the Opposition leaders.  Furthermore, funds are made available, through the Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas, for secretarial assistance for Deputies who are not office-holders.</P>
      <P>In view of the many demands on the Exchequer, I would not be prepared to consider proposals along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the question I am not concerned with secretarial facilities.  I do not think that this is a party political issue.  Does the Minister feel that a system which ensures that there is adequate funding by political parties directly from the State, with perhaps statutory elimination of funds from private sources, would help to put Governments in a position where they would not be compromised, as might be possible on some occasions, by people who simply pay the piper and sometimes want to call the tune?</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Donnellan</b> asked the Minister for Finance if there will be an acceleration in the overall amount of arterial drainage being carried out in the country as a whole as a result of the introduction of the EEC-aided accelerated schemes in the west of Ireland; and, if so, if he will (a) state the extent of the anticipated acceleration in terms of the numbers of acres drained and men employed in the next five years as against the preceeding five years, (b) arrange for the EEC-aided schemes to be separately accounted for from the Office of Public Works on-going arterial drainage programme so as to make it evident that the latter is being maintained independently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is yes.  The extent of the acceleration of the drainage programme will be the work under the three EEC-aided arterial drainage schemes proposed in the west of Ireland, that is in the catchments of the Corrib-Mask-Robe, the Boyne and the Bonet. <Col N="179" /> Under those schemes it is expected that about 57,000 acres will benefit and that at peak some 600 men will be employed on the works.  Each scheme will be carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 and will be separately costed and accounted for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the 57,000 acres are to be drained over five years, how many more acres per five-year period will be drained under the accelerated scheme than were drained in the past five years under the normal scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, we cannot give an accurate figure of the amount of land that will be available until the drainage has been completed.  The draining of the Boyne benefited 150,000 acres and the Corrib-Mask scheme will benefit 57,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): When I reported progress when this Bill was last before the House I had not overcome the shock that I had suffered at the brevity of the introductory speech of the Minister, the lack of information concerning the proposals behind the Bill and the Government's proposals for major road development to anticipate the demands of the eighties&mdash;to use their own words&mdash;and also concerning the Government's policies for an efficient and economic transport system for goods and passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill was introduced by the Minister in a speech which takes barely three-quarters of a column plus something more than a half column in the Official Report.  It seems an extraordinary way to treat the House and the country in introducing a Bill such as this which represents a complete departure <Col N="228" /> from past and existing policy regarding the provision of roads and bridges and the method of financing these.  For the first time in modern history road users are to be asked to pay as you travel. That is the first time we have had this system of financing the capital cost or the maintenance of roads or bridges.  It took this country a very long time to get rid of a toll system of one kind or another which was the property and prerogative of the landlords of old.  We had tolls for fairs and markets and for some bridges and they were always operated by the landlord class.  It is only a short time ago since the present Government decided to abolish road tax, a charge for using the roads.  The proposal in this Bill seems to be another way of charging people for using the roads.  I should have thought that the Minister would have told us whether it is intended to abolish road tax altogether on commercial vehicles and so on and substitute a form of tolls.  All we know, as far as the Bill and the Minister's speech are concerned, is that the Bill gives authority to local authorities and the Minister to charge tolls on existing roads and bridges if they decide to provide a toll scheme, submit it to the Minister and get his approval.  There the Bill begins and ends.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes some oblique reference to the fact that a private enterprise is interested in operating the toll system but he leaves it at that and does not say exactly what is behind the Bill.  One would have thought that, in seeking to put on the Statute Book a Bill which represents a complete departure from existing road policy, the Minister would have given a comprehensive statement spelling out exactly what Government policy is in regard to tolls, to what extent they would be operating and to what extent it was proposed to change the present system.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to deal with a Bill the provisions of which are so comprehensive. It is an enabling measure.  The local authority and the Minister might use it for very extensive purposes just as the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, is to be used for a purpose for which it was never intended.  In putting a Bill like the <Col N="229" /> present one on the Statute Book we should be very careful that we know what Government thinking is on it.  I find it very difficult to contribute to a debate on this Bill when it has been introduced without a comprehensive statement giving the Minister's and the Government's thinking on road and transport policy.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Fianna Fáil Party have been thinking about this policy in the past.  In their manifesto, which brought them successfully through the last election, they said in regard to roads that they would prepare a major road development plan designed to anticipate the demands of the eighties. In regard to transport, they say they will establish a transport authority to investigate and report on measures necessary to achieve the most efficient and economic transport system for goods and passengers having regard to the need to maintain a flexible and competitive transport system thereby ensuring the facilities necessary for industrial development throughout the country as a whole.  Regarding the transport authority, I have a feeling that perhaps it was set up.  I tried to check this before I came into the House but, due to the breakdown in the telephone system, I was unable to contact the Department of Tourism and Transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They call it a commission, for the Deputy's information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It is referred to as an authority.  The Bill, though short, is all embracing because it confers extraordinary powers that were never enjoyed before by a local authority or by a Minister for the Environment.  I would have thought that the Minister in introducing this measure would have spelled out in a fairly lengthy, well-researched speech, the Government's policy on roads and transport.  However, the Minister did not do that.  He introduced the Bill with a few words and left it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is premature having regard to Government proposals for a road and transport policy.  We should have been told exactly what that policy is and <Col N="230" /> where this Bill fits into it.  If, as I suspect, this Bill is being introduced on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis for one specific purpose it should have been introduced on that basis and should have dealt with the purpose for which apparently it is going to be used. That is not what happened.  It has been introduced as an enabling Bill which could last for decades and which could change the whole face of road transport and the methods of financing it.  This has been done without any explanation, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister, because he obviously had to push this Bill through without any decision from the Government on road or transport policy.  We have not been told how the toll system is worked in other countries. Surely we should have had the benefit of the Minister's research and knowledge on that.  My information is that they have proved expensive and are not all that popular.  Tolls in a general way would be quite unsuitable for a small country such as ours.  The Minister has given us no information on that or what his Department's records and research show.</P>
    <P>The roads in this country are beginning to show signs of neglect and become run down.  Some of that deterioration is due to the fact that the Minister, in his capacity as holder of the local authority purse, is not providing sufficient money and not allowing the local authorities to provide sufficient money.  Coming here today from Cavan I travelled on the Kingscourt-Navan road and, while it is not a major road it is not a minor road either.  It is in a bad state of repair with potholes and so on over an extensive length of it.  The Minister should tell us about that type of thing when he brings a Bill like this before the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it is public knowledge that interest has been expressed by the private sector in the provision of new road and bridge facilities on a toll basis.  That is the only reference made by the Minister to the purpose of this Bill.  If the only purpose of this Bill is to make possible the provision of a bridge in the city of Dublin, and if the Bill is to fall into disuse when it has served that purpose, <Col N="231" /> the Minister should tell us that.  If that is the only toll bridge to be provided, we all know it could be provided by the local authority just as well as by private enterprise.  It is sure to be a financial winner.  A charge will be imposed on the users of that bridge which will be as expensive as, if not more expensive, than the road tax the Minister abolished.</P>
    <P>I am not against private enterprise doing a job if they can do it as well or better than the public sector, but it should not be a case of the private sector spinning off the cream without becoming involved in any other enterprise or work. If private enterprise undertake work like this, it should not be just once on a site on which they are sure to reap a rich reward.  They should undertake other work which might not be so remunerative but where their expertise might be able to make it pay.  It should not be the policy of the Government or the House to hand over a prime project to private enterprise and not ask them to do some less rewarding work.  I hope I am getting that across.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the Government's published policy for major road development and transport development, it is wrong to set about it piecemeal or on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis as this Bill proposes to do. Being the first speaker I am at a disadvantage because it is not possible to come to a conclusion on Government policy on tolls, on what their short-term, medium and long-term policy is to be on tolls generally, and on the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges by the private sector.  The Minister has done himself and the Government less than justice in introducing this Bill without giving us that information.</P>
    <P>I would describe it as a most extraordinary Bill, introduced in a most extraordinary manner, with a complete lack of information on what it is intended to serve and a complete lack of information as to Government policy.  For that reason, and because of the way the Minister has put the House into blinkers, I find it impossible to support the Bill.  I propose to oppose it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> Things have changed completely since we first saw the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  I do not want to read it again, but it promises these three things&mdash;a major road development plan designed to anticipate the demands of the eighties; a transport authority leading to an efficient, economic transport system; and we have had road tax abolished for the vast majority of road-users.  After a complete transformation in the promised approach to road networks and transport since the Government assumed office, this Bill is thrown before the House giving the local authorities and the Minister authority to provide tolls <i>ad lib</i> on old roads and bridges and on new roads and bridges.  We are given no indication as to whether there will be one toll bridge in the immediate future or toll bridges all over the country.  Without giving us this information, the Minister seriously expects this side of the House to vote him these powers.  It would be a complete dereliction of duty on the part of the Opposition parties in this House, and certainly on my part, to give the Minister the authority he seeks in this Bill in the absence of any explanation as to how it is to be used.</P>
    <P>The Bill is wide enough to impose tolls on every road and every bridge.  It might not be used at all, or it might be used on one occasion only.  The House is entitled to know the thinking of the Minister and the Government on this matter, especially as it is a complete departure from existing policy on roads and bridges since the foundation of the State. I am unhappy about the Bill.  If it had been introduced to make possible the provision of one bridge, we could investigate it to the best of our ability and debate it in the House, but that is not what we are being asked to debate.  All the information we have about that is a passing remark by the Minister in his short introductory speech&mdash;that it is well known that private enterprise is interested in this and that this Bill will facilitate them.  That is not good enough; it is not the proper way to treat the House or the country.  It is because on some occasions measures like this get through the House without being discussed properly, and without a proper explanation being given, that we find <Col N="233" /> ourselves in trouble later.  I do not want to be responsible for putting the House and the country in that sort of trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party regard this Bill as dishonest, badly drafted and totally at variance with the statements made by the Minister in his opening speech.  It was no surprise to me that the Minister's speech was so historically short.  Anybody introducing this Bill in the context in which it has been introduced would be extremely shy about saying anything.  I want to try and explain why I have made that kind of charge against a Minister for whom I have some regard.  In this instance, willingly or unwillingly, he is the voice for what can be described only as a rather nasty hatchet job between a number of Government Departments.</P>
      <P>We are told this is an enabling Bill for local authorities throughout the country. A lot of valuable parliamentary draftsmen's time has gone into its drafting.  A lot of Dáil time&mdash;because we have a full Order Paper&mdash;will be used in this and the other House debating it.  If the Minister was simply the Minister for Roads there would be some justification for introducing such a Bill.  But I would sincerely and respectfully suggest to the Minister and his advisors that had they dusted the files on local government reform and removed the <i>ultra vires</i> restriction that currently prevents local authorities from taking initiatives in the form in which this Bill now enables them, a far better day's work would have been done without the contradictions buried in the fine print of the Bill.  Let us not fool ourselves about it being an enabling Bill and the apparent neutral umbrella under which such a Bill can sail through this House.  There are other ways of providing enabling legislation that would be much more beneficial to all local authorities and would achieve the Minister's objective in this regard.  I do not regard the Bill as simply an enabling one in that sense although, in the strict legal interpretation of the words, it enables local authorities to do things which previously they were unable to do.  In my opinion it is a wrong way to go about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> The second thing is that the motivation for this Bill is very clearly and explicity stated by the Minister in his short opening speech when he states:</P>
    <P>It is the Government's policy that, subject to certain primary considerations on which the provisions of this Bill are based, private enterprise should be facilitated in participating with road authorities in the financing, construction, maintenance and operation of suitable projects.  The Bill before the House will accommodate such a development in that it will enable road authorities to enter into agreements with private persons who are prepared to participate in the improvement of our public road system.</P>
    <P>This is a response to the private sector which, on a number of occasions, has indicated its willingness and desire to participate in financing and benefiting from that financial involvement in our overall roads system.  I recall the presidential address to the annual lunch of the CII in May last&mdash;the President.  Mr. O'Donovan, did not deliver the paper; rather it was delivered by the then Vice-President, Mr. Williams, to whom the Taoiseach responded&mdash;in which they clearly indicated their willingness and enthusiasm in becoming involved in improving the roads system.  In their newsletters and other documentation the CII have repeated this willingness. Understandably the building materials section have shown no reluctance to participate in any kind of activity that will promote the improvement of the roads system because, whether the private sector or the State finances it, the building materials industry will have to provide the material.  Any proposal to improve and develop the roads system will automatically be welcomed by such a body.  If this is a serious response to the request by the private sector to become involved in helping and developing our roads system would it not be fair to investigate whether this Bill enables the only one, specific, hard-edged application of the private sector to significantly develop our roads system at present? Could not the question be reasonably posed to the Minister for the Environment <Col N="235" /> that if this is a Bill designed to enable a one-off project, then it should have been so phrased and introduced here.  Subject to correction by the Minister my interpretation of the provisions of this Bill is that they will exclude specifically the only one explicit response the private sector has made in terms of wanting to improve the roads system.  I am referring to the proposal to construct a bridge in this capital.  By explicitly excluding harbour authorities and boards as having no role under the provisions of this Bill the Minister will exclude any prospect of the private sector responding by way of investment in a bridge project in any of our major cities. Why do I make that charge?  I make it for the following reasons: any serious study of toll facilities in Europe, or more explicitly in the United States, will show that the majority tend to be bridges or ferries rather than roads.  The figures are taken from an article in the <i>Irish Engineer</i>&mdash;unfortunately I do not have the date; the volume number is 32, the number is 2&mdash;by Wilbur S. Smith, Chairman of Wilbur Smith and Associates. The title of the article is: &ldquo;Toll Road Facilities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In that article, which I am sure is known to the personnel in the Custom House, the following figures are given with regard to toll facilities.  In the United States, of 394 such facilities, 190 were bridges, 132 were ferries, 11 were tunnels and 62, or 15 per cent, were roads.  Of that 15 per cent many of the roads were toll roads in semi-private condominium resorts and not part of the major system.  They were privately run, of course.  On the basis of experience in other countries, the most likely prospects are bridges as distinct from roads.  Yet in this Bill harbour authorities in Limerick, Cork, Waterford or Dublin are seen as having no role whatsoever. My interpretation of the definition section of the Bill is that they would be explicitly excluded from having any say.</P>
    <P>Studies done here on the possibilities of toll facilities have clearly indicated that the volume of traffic throughout the country is, relatively speaking, quite low <Col N="236" /> and would not in many instances justify a commercial private investment in toll roads: there are only a certain number of areas where the volume of traffic, coupled with the time saving by the shortening of a distance over a river, would represent a serious prospect for commercial investment.  I am satisfied with my own research in this regard.  I am satisfied that if there is a commercial possibility for toll facilities here it is located in those large urban areas where there is sufficient demand in terms of volume of traffic and where an effective saving in terms of travelling time would result from the construction of a toll facility.  I also know that in most instances port authorities would have a major role in agreeing to, participating in or supervising the provision of such a bridge or ferry facility.</P>
    <P>Therefore, for the Minister to come in here with a page-and-a-half of a speech and to say that this enabling legislation, which has taken up valuable time, is designed to meet the response of the private sector here is, I can only conclude, at best an attempt to confuse this House.  I would have liked to have heard in a Second Stage debate the indentification of the private sector interested, the scale of its interest, the form of its interest and the identification of the balance between the public and State which must be established at national level in order to facilitate a known interest by the private sector in developing our road facilities.  The Minister opened his career as Minister for the Environment in this House by abolishing rates on domestic houses and introducing the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill of 1977.  This Bill, which, regrettably, is now law, had the effect, among other things, of taking away the financial autonomy in any real sense of local authorities.  For that Minister to come back within the same calendar year and to give them extraordinary powers through this enabling legislation, so that they can all go off and make separate profit sharing and non-profit sharing arrangements with the private sector up and down the country, is to demonstrate total confusion and chaos either in the mind of the Minister or in the mind of the Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> I have some respect for the people in the Custom House and I am brought to the conclusion that this is a token response to the private sector.  This is not a response at all.  I challenge the Minister to show me in his reply exactly how he anticipates the private sector will actually respond and to tell me the areas the private sector might be interested in.  In case the Minister might say he does not wish to reveal commercial interests or breach confidentiality, and does not therefore want to release either names or venues, he could indicate whether we are talking about bridges or by-passes or stretches of inter-town dual carriageway or motorway.  These are the three basic modes, since ferries do not really worry us in this island of ours.  They are the three basic facilities&mdash;roads, bridges, by-passes and possibly tunnels, although tunnels and ferries are non-starters in my view.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister, in his summing up which presumably will be a little longer than his introduction, what is the basis of his assessment of the private sector's interest in the road system and their desire to invest in it&mdash;to meet which he has gone to the trouble of introducing this enabling legislation.  Or is this really based on the response to an after dinner speech?  Is Dáil Eireann reduced to debating legislation which is drafted by a Government Department and circulated to 14 other Departments on the basis of an after dinner expression of interest in participating in improving our roads?  Because, if it is, the Minister should make it very clear&mdash;not just to Deputies but to the public&mdash;that that is the way this Government are drafting legislation.  I am constrained to make that rather sarcastic observation because of the total absence of any assessment by the Minister last week when he introduced this Bill.  I was being sarcastic, because I do not believe it was drafted in such a form&mdash;I think the Minister takes his job far more seriously than that.  But we would like to see the figures.  Does having 84 seats in Dáil Éireann now remove from any Minister any kind of responsibility for arguing the case?  Are the remaining Fianna Fáil Deputies taken so much for granted that they do not even <Col N="238" /> have to be persuaded in public to say nothing about persuading us?</P>
    <P>Before I turn to the Bill itself I would like to look at what the Government have said on a number of other occasions about roads and the road system. Let us start with the Book of Genesis, which in this instance is the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  On the question of roads it states, at page 27, item 10:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will prepare a major Road Development Plan designed to anticipate the demands of the 80s.</P>
    <P>Item 11 goes on to local authority structures:</P>
    <P>We have a commitment to produce a road development plan.</P>
    <P>The first White Paper reiterated that commitment and confirmed the Government's, as distinct from the party's, commitment to it.  The Green Paper published on 16 June stated at paragraph 510, page 56:</P>
    <P>An accelerated investment programme in road improvement would not only provide welcome extra employment both directly and indirectly but would also lead to the up-grading of deficient parts of the road system.  An allocation of up to twice the 1978 provision of £23 million for road improvement could be put to good use by 1980.  If these funds were made available the works undertaken would be chosen from those to be programmed in the Road Development Plan promised in the Government's preelection Manifesto.  Work is well advanced on the preparation of the Plan which will give high priority to the improvement of the main access routes to Dublin and to the development of the major route networks linking cities and larger towns.  It will also be concerned with the construction of major bridges and relief roads in a number of cities and towns, the need for which has been established by studies already undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper was followed by another document, which was published in January of this year, despite the fact that it had been indicated on the <Col N="239" /> previous occasion that a number of studies existed already which would serve as the basis for road improvements around the country and that the areas for major improvements had self-evidently been identified by referencing to Dublin and to other major cities.  We know that the Custom House is besieged with road proposals from Dublin city and Dublin county local authorities.  The officials in the Custom House concerned with these matters are well aware of the explicit proposals for road development in the Dublin region but we can only wonder why the road plan is not before the House.  It was not available before the publication of the last White Paper, paragraph 5.24 of which reads:</P>
    <P>Present indications are that the bulk of increased traffic arising from economic development will fall on the roads.  In terms of kilometres of road per head of population and per vehicle registered, Ireland has one of the most extensive road networks in Europe.</P>
    <P>That is attributable more to the benign concern of the famine landlords than to any advantageous programme of Government planning.  The paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>It is recognised that there are seriously defective elements in the road network and a substantial programme of investment is essential to improve, in particular, the principal urban and inter-urban routes.</P>
    <P>Again, this is focusing on the areas of need but this time there is a change of phraseology.  I suppose the Government had to change something.  The paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>The importance of these routes can be gauged from the fact that the National Primary Routes alone, which comprise only 3 per cent of the road network, carry 25 per cent of the traffic.</P>
    <P>Another paragraph in this White Paper is the first official indication, apart from the Government's announcement in August or September last, that toll roads legislation would be introduced.  I quote from paragraph 5.28:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> Legislation has been introduced under which road authorities (subject to the approval of the Minister for the Environment) would be empowered to enter into an agreement with other persons or bodies to provide roads and bridges and to defray costs through toll charges.  The Government hope that the private sector will respond to this opportunity to participate in the improvement of the roads system.</P>
    <P>That is an explicit statement of hope from a Government who, by constitutional definition, have collective responsibility and it is backed up by a Minister with explicit responsibility in this area.  Again we have the Government saying that the legislation is in response to the private sector, but it is a piece of legislation which, if my reading of the Bill is correct, excludes port authorities by virtue of its definition of &ldquo;road authority&rdquo;.  Consequently it must lead effectively to the discreet killing of the only explicit response to the private sector on the question of the building of roads.  Who is trying to cod whom?</P>
    <P>I suggest that we are wasting much time having regard to the definition of, for instance, &ldquo;public road&rdquo; in the definition section.  I shall not bore the House by reading out the long list but shall move on to the definition of &ldquo;road authority&rdquo; which is the council of a county, the corporation of a county or other borough or the council of an urban district.  On the surface that appears to be a reasonable definition of a road authority.  In respect of 99.9 per cent of activities in relation to roads it is an accurate definition.  However, if we talk in terms of a public road meaning, among other things, any bridge, viaduct, underpass, subway, tunnel, overbridge, flyover and so on, we are talking in the context of toll road legislation which has the explicit purpose of responding to the private sector's interest in participating positively in development.  In this case we must be talking about major urban areas where bridges might be built.  In such areas there are usually substantial harbour facilities.  To exclude harbour authorities specifically is to put a discreet but sharp trapdoor under any <Col N="241" /> proposals which may be before the Government.</P>
    <P>I can only regret that the Minister has seen fit to bring in first this piece of legislation rather than legislation dealing with the roads development plan.  I should be happy to sit here on Saturdays and Sundays debating such a plan and to support the Minister on the corresponding legislation, because it is something we have been lacking for many years and is needed badly.  I assure the Minister that in principle he will have every support from this side of the House for a properly-balanced national roads development plan.  The Labour Party recognise fully the importance of such a plan for commerce and industry with the consequent effect on employment throughout the country.  We recognise also that the cost of fully implementing such a plan would be enormous and that, regardless of what kind of shuffling one might try to engage in either in terms of the Regional Fund or in terms of EMS money, the shortfall in terms of actual capital required would be large.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party, who have a creative approach to the State sector, would welcome a recognition on the part of the Minister for the Environment that one of the interests expressed by the private sector in participating in the improvement and development of our road system is an interest expressed by the managers of long-term finance who wish to seek some kind of gilt-edged return on their investments.  The managers of such long-term finance in many cases are the managers of the pension funds of the employees of the State sector.  They are the managers of the pension funds of such bodies as Bord na Móna, Aer Lingus, the ESB and other State agencies. Those managers must ensure that over a period of time there will be an adequate return to ensure the payment of such pensions.  The pension fund manager of the blue chip fund of Irish Life&mdash;I have a personal interest in that&mdash;is guided by the same concerns and interests.</P>
    <P>If the State constructed some kind of framework which would enable investment in a national roads improvement <Col N="242" /> system the State would provide for such pension fund managers and managers of long-term cash a safe and gilt-edged return.  Some of the difficulties in relation to capital needed for a national road programme could thus be overcome. There would then be the possibility, within the context of enabling legislation, for a positive role for tolls in that regard. If the Minister told us that we drastically needed roads and that irrespective of how we raised money there would be a shortfall which would impede economic development and our job creation programme and for this reason it was his intention to try to attract capital that otherwise would not have gone into the road building sector then we would be involved in serious legislative business. The Minister could expect from the Members of the Labour Party constructive legislative participation in relation to such business.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a disservice to himself in introducing this legislation because he has not put forward any supporting arguments.  A case can be made in a variety of ways, and there is a case for this legislation.  The only case that has been made is that which is contained in the White Paper, a hope that the private sector will respond.  Can anybody on the Government side give any indication of how they anticipate a pension fund manager or private developer deciding to get going on this. The Minister's party like to say that they are the party of reality, among other things, and they have enough contacts in the construction industry to test privately how the private sector is likely to respond to this enabling legislation.  It would be interesting to hear the results of such soundings on Committee Stage to find out whether the private sector has any role in an entrepreneurial sense to play in the improvement or provision of public roads.  I doubt if the private sector is interested.  I am not party to the details of the national road development plan but I have a reasonable cursory knowledge of the work done to date and the areas needing improvement.</P>
    <P>One objective in relation to improving our road system certainly concerns time saving.  A lot of time could <Col N="243" /> be dramatically saved on the journey from Dublin to Cork or Dublin to Shannon by the provision of a number of urban by-passes.  It is conceivable that these could be partially financed through a system of tolls but, other than making the capital available, what would the entrepreneur contribute?  The scheme would be prepared by local authority engineers or consultants and the local authority would be the managing authority on completion of the scheme. Local authorities are the only bodies in a position to acquire land for such work and in most cases have already attempted to do so.  In most cases local authorities have plans prepared, irrespective of the merits of them.  Local authorities have the technical staff, the experience of building roads and the accumulative responsibility of maintaining our roads system.  Cash is needed, not for pump-priming, but for long-term capital.  A national roads plan should not impose on every local authority the responsibility of setting up their own terms of participation, of coming to their own conclusions as to how the balance and the mixture should be but should point out the defects in the national primary routes to be financed partly by way of tolls.</P>
    <P>Such a proposal not only makes sense but, if adopted, would suggest that the Right wing drift within Fianna Fáil was stopped or turned around partially.  Sadly that is not the case.  How does the Minister envisage private sector participation? Does he anticipate that somebody would put a proposal, for example, to the Kildare County Manager for a by-pass or put a proposal to the Westmeath County Manager for an Athlone by-pass?  All entrepreneurs can do is provide cash and then they are into the realm of total speculation as to how the thing will develop.  They would have to get from the manager an idea of the rate of toll and conditions of contract.  If the manager is interested he must prepare his scheme and then get the permission of the Minister.  The Minister did not give us any indication as to what his attitude is likely to be.  There is no indication that he would propose, as part <Col N="244" /> of the legislation but separate from it, a draft of the ideal form of participation by the private sector.</P>
    <P>Local authorities do not get any assistance. Some local authorities are not adequately staffed at the best of times and they are certainly not staffed to do the complex exercise this would entail. They no longer have the financial autonomy to hire consultants to do it for them.  It is not as if they were not a precedent in this area.  In terms of drafting national building by-laws and by-laws under the 1966 Housing Act for rented accommodation, the Custom House were not slow to produce a draft model local authorities could adopt. No indication is given that such a draft model would be provided by the Custom House in this instance.</P>
    <P>Again I am drawn to the reluctant conclusion that this Bill is not what it appears. I do not believe it will enable anything to happen but I do believe&mdash;perhaps sinisterly this may be part of its motivation, and I do not make that charge lightly&mdash;that it is designed to prevent some things from happening.  If that is the case, it is time for a bit of political honesty in this House.  If that is the case, why try to cod us by referring to the private sector?  I qualify all my remarks by saying that this is a party judgment, a personal judgment, which is put on the floor of this House by way of argument and if it can be refuted I will accept it.  From my analysis it appears that it will not effectively respond to the private sector.  I can only marvel at the amount of time that has been spent drafting this legislation and the time spent debating it here, all regrettably, in my view, to no avail.</P>
    <P>The January White Paper alluded to the fact that we had probably more kilometres per person in terms of roads than any other population in western Europe, and the concentration of traffic is confined to a number of areas.  The Minister could have given some indication of how he envisaged his Department facilitating the operation of a toll system, because other than simply referring to the agreements or the explanatory statement there is no indication from the Custom House as to how they would be <Col N="245" /> responding to any action or any draft explanatory statement that would come from Clare, Cork, Kildare or anywhere else for the Minister's approval.  It would have been interesting to have heard the Minister's response to the fairly substantial volume of documentation on toll roads that now exist.</P>
    <P>Do the Department share the view of the British Ministry of Transport which reviewed the question of toll roads and the extensive motorways system and decided that the cost of collection would be too high to justify it?  The figure given stated that 25 per cent of all revenue collected would be required to service the cost of collection.  Have the Department, in preparing this legislation done any specific research here as to the minimum level of vehicles per day for any route which would be required before a toll road could be operative?  The figures I am aware of would suggest that a minimum flow of something like 10,000 vehicles per day would be the basic threshold a road would normally have to carry before a toll would begin to make sense.  Have the Department carried out this kind of study?  If so, are they in a position to identify the routes and demands in terms more explicit than those set out in paragraphs 5.24 in the Green Paper and 5.28 in the January White Paper? If they have not carried out such a study, why is this legislation being introduced? What technical study was drafted beforehand?  What kind of interaction in terms of transportation plans took place between the Departments of the Environment and Tourism and Transport?  Had the latter any observations to make in relation to the transportation impact of such toll roads generally as indicated in this enabling legislation?</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House unduly but every section of this legislation, other than those sections which are self-evidently consequential, raises questions to which one can only suggest speculative answers&mdash;obviously from this side of the House they can only be speculative.  We have heard nothing from the Minister about what the answers to those questions could be. <Col N="246" /> One point to which we must return over and over again is the primary motivation of this Bill, which is to respond to the private sector.  It is not clear to this party how that sector might be likely to respond. The other sections, which govern such things as the system of public inquiries and so on, are reasonable and we do not have a great deal of opposition to them.  On the contrary, while one might look for streamlining of the possibility of separate inquiries under the CPO legislation, the Motorways 1974 Act and this Bill, it would be conceivable to roll the three inquiries into one.  That would be my intention because the prospect of three separate inquiries would exhaust even the most enthusiastic supporter or opponent of motorways.</P>
    <P>One must look at this legislation in the context of road legislation generally, but specifically in the context of CPO legislation and the Motorways Act.  Officials in the Department of the Environment, devoted themselves to drafting four or five pages of legislation.  That energy would have been put to better use if they had proposed to amend the compulsory purchase legislation which is very ancient.</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned this legislation is unacceptable and badly drafted.  As far as we can judge, it cannot meet the objectives for which it was introduced.  The Minister has not only failed to convince this side of the House of the merits of the legislation by the way in which it might respond to the private sector but has simply avoided doing so.  In principle, the way in which it is proposed to operate is such that it would not really enable local authorities to take on the role laid down for them in this legislation for the simple reason that the framework within which the local authorities would be asked to draft the explanatory statement is not indicated in the Bill, which is understandable, and there is no suggestion that the Minister would attempt to assist on a national basis any local authority which wished to finance part of their road system directly from a toll.  My reading of this may be inaccurate and if it is I will welcome a correction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="247" /> For those reasons we will be opposing this legislation on Second Stage but in anticipating that the Bill will reach Committee Stage we will be putting down a number of specific amendments which will be based on my comments.  At that stage, and if the Minister gets his enabling legislation, we hope he will be open to constructive amendments which will attempt to give effect to some of the measures he is trying to introduce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be very long. This Bill is very interesting and simple to read and digest.  The idea of tolls is not new but most countries are reverting to the principle of tolls.  It is a fact that any country which charge road tolls have a very good road system.  I do not know if that is entirely due to the fact that they have toll roads.  However, the people in those countries know that when they pay tolls on some of those roads they have good roads for pleasant private motoring or road haulage.  I hope that the private sector will respond to this Bill by a good input of finance so that we can improve the road pattern of the country in general.</P>
      <P>Roads are very much in our minds at the moment, especially those within the city area, because we are very much aware of the shortcomings of our road system, the traffic jams and the chaotic traffic conditions there are.  The general public are always asking us to do something about the roads because Dublin is being choked to death by traffic. There is an application for planning permission for a toll bridge before An Bord Pleanála at the moment.  While I cannot say what their decision will be I hope they will give permission for the erection of this toll bridge because it will be a contributory factor towards the improvement of our road system.  It is not, as some Deputies suggest, a swing to the right by allowing private enterprise to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last summer I visited a socialist dominated country where they were charging tolls on some of their very fine roads.  Everybody using those roads pays a toll except members of the diplomatic corps who are exempt.  There is nothing new in the participation of <Col N="248" /> private enterprise in the erection of a toll bridge.  In the UK after the last war, when many of their cities were destroyed by bombings, local authorities found they could not rebuild them.  They brought in private enterprise and told them they would give them certain plots of ground which they would develop according to the specifications of the local authorities.  This enabled the UK to rebuild their cities very quickly.  No doubt this happened in other countries as well.</P>
    <P>In this city, on a smaller scale, we have brought in the entrepreneurs who are developing open spaces according to the plans of Dublin Corporation.  People may ask why do the local authorities not do all of this.  They have not got the money to do it.  We are seeing the development of an area because of the contribution of the private sector.  I do not know what the future of toll roads is and I do not know how successful they will be.  The private enterprise group erecting this toll bridge have to take the risk.  This Bill will enable this type of thing to happen.  It will also enable a local authority to do the same thing.</P>
    <P>When the Government removed rates from private dwellings some people said that the Government were taking away the fiscal power of local authorities.  This is not true because rates are still charged on commercial properties.  This Bill gives power to local authorities to enter into agreement with the entrepreneurs to build new roads, bridges or tunnels.  I campaigned for many years for a tunnel under the River Liffey rather than have a bridge across it.  I urged the firm who are erecting the toll bridge to erect a tunnel but I was told that the cost was so great the private sector could not stand it.  That may be peculiar to our country but I am sure that on the Continent we will find places where there are toll tunnels. Up to now we did not have the power to facilitate any private sector entrepreneur or a local authority to undertake this kind of work.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Opposition parties intend to oppose the Bill.  I can understand them trying to amend the Bill.  Every Bill brought in here can be improved by amendments, but it is a <Col N="249" /> pity that the Opposition feel they have to oppose this Bill.  Neither of the two speakers from the Opposition I heard speaking today have convinced me that they have any real grounds for opposing the Bill.  In fact, it seemed to me that when Deputy Quinn spoke he was in favour of the Bill.  His reference to the local authorities was not very convincing.</P>
    <P>We should try to encourage local authorities to get involved in this type of enterprise.  We should not have to look to the State to do everything.  We have to show that in the private sector there are some people who are quite willing to get involved in the construction of a toll bridge.  Such bridges are only attractive when there is a heavy flow of traffic.  I am sure many local authorities could devise schemes where they could have a toll charge on bridges or roads to finance some other worthy objectives.  I hope that when this Bill becomes law many firms will be attracted towards providing roads, bridges, tunnels and any of the other items mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is a very short Bill but it is a very important one.  I hope when it is enacted that it will be used extensively for the improvement of our road system.  In this city we have again adopted a road proposal.  I have lost count of the number of times we have done this, but so far we have not come up with a real road pattern.  When the previous Government were in power, the Minister said there would not be any motorways in Dublin because the money for them was not available.  The fact that this money was not available emphasises the point that we must attract finance from sources other than the Central Fund, not only for motorways but for main roads and toll roads.</P>
    <P>We are saying to the private sector that there is an opportunity for investment. They will have to test the market themselves.  I would urge local authorities to consider the powers being given to them under this Bill.  This Government abolished rates on houses and they now give local authorities a sub to run their areas.  This Bill gives them the opportunity <Col N="250" /> to show some initiative, instead of saying that they cannot carry out roadworks because they have not the money.  They must examine the possibility of raising funds by the method provided here, especially in view of the ever-increasing cost of road maintenance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick of Cavan-Monaghan criticised some of the roads along which he travelled this morning and we must accept his word that the roads needed some improvement. Perhaps the local authority have already spent the money.  I am not in a position to know whether they spent it wisely or not.  Local authorities must assume a new role by becoming entrepreneurs in initiatives like this.  Why should they not avail of the powers being given under this Bill, not just criticising the alleged defects in it?  There is great merit in this Bill and it is very straightforward.  Above all, it shows initiative.  We cannot continue to depend for everything on the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>A toll is a very just tax in that the person using the road pays for it.  It is very hard on the old age pensioner to have to pay tax to the Road Fund when he may do no more than go for an afternoon walk.  With the toll road the user would pay.  I do not know whether pedestrians are allowed on toll roads but it does not matter very much.  The driver of the truck, car or juggernaut will have to pay.  It often seems unjust that people who do not own cars must pay tax towards the Road Fund.  This is the case under the financial system in most countries.  Here is an opportunity of making the person benefiting from the service pay for it.</P>
    <P>The people who build the road will maintain it in good order.  In one instance in this city, they will add a very valuable road to the network.  When the Bill becomes law, I hope private firms and local authorities will examine it and see how they can use the powers it contains to help in providing a better road system for the country in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker from this side of the House indicated <Col N="251" /> that he would oppose this Bill and he gave his reasons.  I will be saying much the same thing.  The Bill states that up to the present we have not had toll charges and this is enabling legislation which will allow such charges to be imposed.  The Bill does not go much beyond that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore made the point that this would appear to be a new way to finance our roads.  Whether or not it is a good idea is open to debate and discussion. Before a Bill is passed, I believe this side of the House should be aware of its full implications.  The idea of the toll was put forward during the past few years when a particular individual and company decided they would go into this business by building a bridge.  People asked why local authorities did not think along the same lines.  If local authorities had suggested charging tolls on roads and bridges there might have been a hue and cry and they saw their role as providing roads for use and not for fund raising.  No doubt the private entrepreneur will be selective in deciding where he wants to build.  Someone has said that this type of operation is a licence to print money.  If so, we should be very slow indeed to allow the private entrepreneur into a selective part of the market.  It should be the responsibility of the local authorities to deal with our roads.  I would be opposed to the entrepreneur coming into this area unless he is prepared to provide a full and comprehensive road service.  If he is not prepared to do so I am not prepared to support this idea.  It is easy to go into the market place and pick up the best side of the market and that is exactly what would be happening here.  Local authorities would be providing road structures in areas where the private sector would not be interested because there would not be enough profit.</P>
      <P>I am surprised at some of the views expressed by Members of the Labour Party.  I am in favour of private enterprise but entrepreneurs should not be allowed to come in and cream off the profits, not putting very much back.  If the local authorities charged tolls we could be assured that the money would be ploughed back into road structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> This idea should be fully debated.  In what areas do we charge tolls and for what reasons?  They are generally charged on roads by-passing towns to enable people to get through quickly. That is reasonable.  If expensive by-passes are built somebody must pay for them.  What I am concerned about is where do we stop?  Do we put a toll charge on all our major roads?  Deputy Moore seemed to be implying this and I wonder if this is Fianna Fáil policy.  In their manifesto and in the Green and White Papers they talked about the need for comprehensive road plans.  Are these to be financed by building roads and putting expensive tolls on them?  If that is what they mean they should say so rather than bringing in legislation which does not say very much.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not being opposed for the sake of opposition.  It is being opposed because there is a lack of information.  It is important that the Minister in his reply spells out clearly his idea of road tolls. Are they being introduced as a bonus for people in private enterprise?  If that is what they are for I oppose them.  I am opposed to the entrepreneur coming into this area at all.  If the local authorities have not been as efficient as they should have been it was because of lack of finance.  If we introduce tolls, they will be self-financing.  They will inject finance which will come back into the whole road system.  That is the only way I see any merit in having tolls.</P>
    <P>This is like most things that have been introduced.  We introduced turnover tax at 2½ per cent and then we had VAT. Everybody knows the structures we are now hitting at.  It will be the same with tolls.  We will start with X road and then they will be put on Y road and so on.  It will be a new form of revenue spinner.  It will be a further imposition on people in the transport business who are already paying high taxes and heavy excise revenue on petrol.  It will be an additional cost to the consumer because costs are always passed on no matter what.  This will also be the case in relation to the infamous 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am suspicious about this Bill.  It is a document of less than one-and-a-half pages.  It is not what it says that worries me, it is what it does not say.  If we are to <Col N="253" /> have tolls they should be confined to specific areas and should be operated only by the local authorities.  They can do the job well and they have the personnel. We should be very wary about handing it over to private enterprise.  It is not specifically stated in the Bill that it has to be done by private enterprise but it is implied.  I believe that we should exclude private enterprise.  I am not against private enterprise where it is useful and necessary but this is an area where local authorities have been involved.  It would not have been popular for local authorities to introduce tolls.  If they had done so, there would have been pressure on elected representatives to play it down.  Now that this measure is before us, it will give local authorities an opportunity of examining the whole concept of tolls.  As Deputy Quinn said, the sooner we have comprehensive road proposals before us the better.  In relation to the overall need, this is a mickey mouse exercise.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about developing we must have comprehensive road proposals.  We can then make decisions and see where toll roads should be, if they should be, and who should operate them.  If we proceed along these lines we will get some place.</P>
    <P>This measure is an exercise in semantics. It is stated in the manifesto that it is intended to have comprehensive road proposals and that will solve the problem.  It will not solve anything. Private enterprise will come into the areas where the gravy is, take it all and leave the other areas out.  The local authorities will then have to redesign the whole scheme.  We should be very slow to let this out of the hands of the local authorities.  They should have a say in how this operates and should become involved in profit-making.  Profit is not a dirty word.  Without it and without generating wealth we cannot expand. Now that rates have been removed from private houses, local authorities are restricted in their expansion.  If they are allowed to operate the toll system it would be a first step towards enabling them to generate finance.  The profit would be going back into the community. <Col N="254" /> I do not blame private enterprise making their own calculations with regard to traffic flow and the money that will be generated.  An undertaking is right to do that kind of exercise.  They will not have to put up any enormous amount of finance because they will go to the merchant banks and sell them the idea.  There is no great risk involved.  I have heard it said that it is a licence to print money.  The local authority should cash in on this money.</P>
    <P>I am rather sceptical about this Bill.  It says very little and there are forebodings that we will have toll roads all over the place.  This legislation should be suspended until proper road proposals are before us.  This Bill was introduced because the other matter is before An Bord Pleanála and the two have to be taken together.  The whole matter is unsatisfactory in that we are building something but we do not know what will be the end product.  If this legislation was deferred until the House had an opportunity to look at the road proposals there might be general agreement on this Bill. The House should not be asked to write a blank cheque.  The Opposition are not opposing just for the sake of doing so.  It is our duty to examine the facts and in this case they do not stand up.  This is a cause of worry to this side of the House and we have to reject the Bill.  We are rejecting it because of the lack of information and proper proposals.  These are valid reasons why we should hasten slowly on this legislation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would shelve the Bill for a while until we look at the overall proposals, subsequently we might get general agreement.  This House should try to get agreement rather than bulldoze legislation through the Chamber. Members were elected by the people and we should try to get a consensus.  We should be able to get this consensus but the Government side, knowing that they have the numbers, want to proceed in their own way.  Because they have the numbers they can do this but it is wrong. This Bill should be shelved until the House sees the overall proposals and then we can make the right decision.  If we go ahead now the decisions taken may be wrong and it will be too late to <Col N="255" /> undo them.  That is one of the reasons I am opposing this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We must question the principle of people paying directly and on the double for the privilege of moving around their own country.  The provision of roads and the way in which the taxpayer pays for them is indirect by way of income tax and other taxes.  The concept of people paying directly must be looked at very closely.  It will not find a sympathetic response in many people and, therefore, it could be unworkable. The worry and fear of that situation will mean that only the most lucrative avenues for exploitation by the toll road merchants will be the ones that will succeed. By definition these are probably the ones where the local authorities or Government agencies should be already active in providing.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the only relevant proposal <i>vis-á-vis</i> toll roads or the toll concept that we shall see for a considerable time is the matter of the bridge spanning East Wall and Ringsend.  That proposal has acted as a major catalyst to the production of this legislation and I wonder why that should be the case. There has been extraordinary haste in facilitating a specific proposal for which there has been no public demand&mdash;the common excuse that Ministers give for inactivity if not inertia on various issues. I have not heard one single voice looking for a toll road but yet, almost overnight and while not even one live application was before the Department, a Bill was presented to us.  I only wish that the same sense of urgency and concern could be extended to many other areas of social activity and concern which are much more pressing, for example, the housing sector.  There is no movement there.  With a certain degree of cynicism and a certain element of suspicion I question why this legislation was introduced so rapidly and in such a manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the Minister could not be faulted for thinking that he cannot win in this case; if he does not produce legislation he is blamed and if he does introduce legislation he is blamed also.  I <Col N="256" /> should like him to tell us why this Bill was considered essential at this stage when other legislation which he and his colleagues have in the pipeline and which is admitted to be extraordinarily pressing is logjammed somewhere along the line.  I do not believe that this Bill was the most crucial and important to come from his Department at this time and the ratíonale behind its introduction needs to be explained.</P>
    <P>Another major concern of mine in relation to tolls and the toll road concept is its presentation to us in total isolation from any kind of transportation thinking or policy.  Time and time again the Minister and his junior colleagues have told us in the House in effect that there is not a transport policy.  The Government now have a commission of some kind inquiring into transportation, and no doubt sometime in the future we will get a report from this worthy body and will find, probably, that many of their conclusions were reached many years ago by other people.</P>
    <P>The Bill presents the idea of toll roads or bridges in isolation from other matters of transportation.  Of course, Dublin city's road pattern could not come into it because the Department do not have a transportation policy and the Minister is not inclined to commit even one pound because of his lack of a road transport policy.  However, this does not inhibit him from setting up a system of tolls throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I believe motorists are paying enough already and, though I have reservations about their perambulations around my constituency and the city generally, I have no hesitation in saying that the suggestion of toll roads and bridges will be massively unpopular and that the average motorist will go miles out of his way to avoid toll bridges. Therefore, we could have saved time and the use of finance and expertise in processing the type of Bill we now have because it may be useless in the ultimate.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand why, if this is such a good project, we should not have direct control of such schemes by local authorities, why the Revenue should not benefit as well as private interests. The only interest Tom Roche or anybody else will have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The only interest any of those people will have is to make a profit.  I do not say there is anything wrong with that, but if this is such a good proposal, if it is so essential&mdash;from the Minister's introductory speech and from its brevity one doubts his enthusiasm about this&mdash;why should the local authorities not be concerned directly in it?  I do not see any such power in the Bill.  In reply to a question in the Dáil last year to Deputy Quinn the Minister said that if private entrepreneurs and business people committed capital to the building of such roads they should benefit from it.  That is simplistic and naïve.  I believe that it would be a very good investment for the Government to raise the money, as they have done for much more wanton projects, rather than have these things done in a way that will be of no value to Government funding, to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in the Bill in regard to the kind of controls we would have over the tolls concept if a number of bridges are being operated by tolls. There could be an understandable decline in maintenance.  What would happen in the case of an industrial dispute occurring overnight on the toll bridge, say, linking Ringsend with the East Wall?  This could quite easily happen considering the deteriorating industrial relations situation.  I do not think that we will have any less industrial trouble unless there is a massive change of heart on the part of the Government. The idea that motorists could find themselves confronted with closed toll bridges here and throughout the country is, therefore, not an impossible proposition. In such a situation what would the Minister do?  He could take the example of his colleagues and not do anything but blow his whistle and not take any action. The whole transportation system of a city could be thrown into virtual chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has to be a great lot of consideration given to the introduction of a <Col N="258" /> general piece of legislation of this kind without any parameters built into it in regard to analogous situations which could arise because of dependence on the particular interests of entrepreneurs, because we might see less commitment, we might find that these people would discover a new toy after the novelty of the toll bridge concept had worn off. There would be less interest in maintaining these toll bridges.  The operators, for instance, could decide to close them down daily from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.  All these problems are involved and they have not been answered in the Bill or in the explanatory memorandum.  They have not been answered here and I have not had adequate answers outside.</P>
    <P>The concept of a toll as a feature of Government policy generally is analogous to the handing over of the public service sector, or parts of it, to private enterprise.  Whether one has a rooted objection to this idea is not important. What is important is that this type of precedent should be set for saying that other areas of the public service, areas where the public have certain rights, should be handed over to people who may not share the same concern as the Government for the provision of these services.  Free access to roads and bridges in towns and cities throughout the country is a public right.  It needs to be safeguarded, maintained and improved if we are to ensure that communities in our cities and towns are to improve their general environment, if they are to be integrated socially and so on.  I do not believe that will be helped by the introduction of a massive private enterprise dimension in the form of tolls. Once again, in line with the pervasive thinking of Fianna Fáil, the concept of tolls allows the guy with the money to have access but the fellow without the money not to.  The latter may very well not have a car, but this creates a situation which caters only for a certain sector of the community, a sector for which this Government so far have shown an overriding concern since they came into office.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the problem of pedestrians and cyclists crossing these bridges, the matter of the right of people <Col N="259" /> who do not have cars to have access across the Liffey, or the Shannon, or any other river.  Nowhere is that type of thinking in the Bill.  I would not expect it because all we have had from this Government is a series of measures and decisions designed to put money into the pockets of their supporters.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the caution and will do my best to do as you say, Sir.  In this Bill there is no interest shown in, no concern with and no reference to people who do not have cars.  The question of access to roads and bridges is as important to the man who has no car as it is to the man who has a car.  I want to know what the Minister's thinking is on that point or whether he will guarantee certain rights in the context of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another major deficiency in the Bill is that it is wrong, despite the temptation that some Governments have to do things quickly, for a measure such as this, which is mainly a transport issue, to be introduced in isolation.  It is clear, the <Col N="260" /> Minister must agree, that the various elements which make up the shattered pattern of transport badly need to be knit together.  If they do, it is conceivable that the capacity of a transportation authority to handle transportation issues may make the question of toll roads redundant.  We should demand that the Government apply the same haste to the introduction of a responsible integrated transportation policy as they applied to this slim measure, which will be used once and then forgotten, unless it pleases some future Minister for Finance, when scratching around for a few shillings to fulfill irresponsible election promises, to screw some section of our society.</P>
    <P>I can see a situation emerging where the power in this Bill could be abused, where the toll road concept could be handed out freely to people whose overriding concern was with making money. I do not find comfort in the fact that the Minister has the power to sanction specific proposals.  If the Minister was acting responsibly he would give prior attention to the introduction of a Transport Bill which would have the power to set up a transportation authority.  This would mean that toll roads might well be a feature of it.  If it was, we would at least know that it was meaningful in relation to the overall transportation pattern. Introduced as it is, how can we know that it will be relevant?  I know it is an enabling measure.  I worry about enabling measures because they are used for political expediency.  I am not aware of the falling into disuse of these measures.  We should not put legislation on the Statute Book unless there is a genuine need for it.  The Bill is not necessary at this time.  It is necessary to facilitate one or two enterprises at the heart of which there is little concern for the public good.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, we find ourselves debating a piecemeal measure, totally new in recent times and outside the wider, more important issues of transport. I do not see any concern with the problem of funding public transport or with any other issues relating to transport. Why the concern with toll roads? The toll road concept is nothing but taxation in another form.  The Government would be able to convince the public of <Col N="261" /> the wisdom of such a measure if it were seen as part of an integrated whole which represented a genuine policy on transport instead of representing the incipient beginnings of the handing over of the Government's responsibility to the private sector because the Government have not the will or the wit to carry it. In either case, this response is less than wholesome.  If it comes to a choice between profit and public good, all of us know which one will win.  I regret that the Minister has chosen to introduce this measure at this time.  It will not help to solve our transportation and traffic problems.  If the Minister applied the same urgency to transportation policy as he has done to this Bill, we might be better off.</P>
    <P>Various local authorities are still awaiting a scintilla of response from the Minister and his Department to requests for funding in relation to future road building.  Instead of a commitment, they get an enabling measure which will allow some responsible people and some fly-by-nights to become involved in the provision of a service which is seen as a public service.  The question of handing over a public service to the private sector is a big debate and should not be discussed in the context of this Bill.  I worry about the possibility of this Bill being used as a precedent in relation to other areas of the public service.  Accordingly, I reject this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the lack of clarity of the scope of the Bill.  It is difficult to give the Minister and his colleagues an enabling measure without being able to understand the limitations of its power. How extensive is this toll road concept to be?  Could we envisage a situation where the now defunct road tax would eventually be replaced by a toll road tax all over the country?  Is that too far-fetched? The Bill does not suggest that it is.  Theoretically the Bill provides that every road in the country that has any traffic on it could have a toll if it gives promise of being profitable to somebody.  That is not the way to operate access to public roads.  It is going to have a major effect on social issues because of its concern with people who have the vehicles and the money at <Col N="262" /> the possible expense of those who do not.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the effects that this Bill could have on the commercial sector.  Are we to understand that a firm like Roadstone, for example, plying across this bridge ten, 20, 30, 40 times a day, would have to pay a road toll every time they go across the Liffey? Roadstone or any other company would be horrified at that thought.  I do not see in the Bill an exclusion clause, and therefore, the only conclusion must be that they would not use the road.  They would use the labyrinthine streets in the East Wall area which are already suffering from the ravages of Government policy in a variety of ways&mdash;on which I will be happy to elaborate if anyone wants me to&mdash;and the small streets would be clogged with large lorries even more than they are at present.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, a toll is payable by these various lorries, juggernauts and so on, what is going to happen?  It will be passed on to the consumer and the public.  For example, in the case of the company I have mentioned previously, who are involved in house construction and the provision of materials for building, housing and construction costs will be even higher than at present, because the toll for commercial vehicles will inevitably be passed on.  The private motorist who has not an expense account or some means of passing on the toll is going to pay.  In other words, this is a Bill which is going to hit at the very small sections of society.  What is the financial and transportation wisdom behind that?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to be good enough to refer to the inflationary impact of tolls on businesses, job creation and so on.  I am mindful that the Government recently, somewhat belatedly, expressed interest in creating a small industrial enclave in the East Wall area.  I would like to think that no action by the Government in the Department of Industry and Commerce would be circumvented and the fruits of that Bill limited by virtue of a toll on people travelling to and from that enterprise.  If that is the situation, people will find it more attractive to operate out of reach <Col N="263" /> of these tolls.  This is not as far-fetched as it might seem.  For example, if a toll bridge is provided across a river, it is perfectly clear that the local authority statutorily responsible for public transport and for the provision of roads, bridges and motorways in that area will conveniently decide, perhaps rightly in some cases, that there is no longer any need for them to be overly concerned about access across that bridge or through those roads because the need has already been filled by the toll bridge or road.</P>
    <P>If that is the case we will get a contraction of the local authority's responsibility and their executive function in this area wherever a toll operates.  That must be a legitimate fear on the part of people who would be concerned about ensuring maximum standards of public service in this regard.  The presence in the vicinity or environment of a toll road or bridge will make it a great deal easier for the local authority who have statutory responsibility in that area to evade their responsibilities and would bring about decreasing standards of public service in this way.  I would not like to be construed as envisaging a toll road 30 yards from a local authority road.  If major tracts of public transportation and access roads, bridges and so forth are to be handed over without condition to the private sector the inevitable result will be that the profit motive will dominate and the interests of the commuter, the local resident and the healthy life of living communities will take second or third place, and if prevailing economic winds dictate, those roads or bridges will close.  They may close for reasons of industrial dispute or non-viability, and in that case the people involved will not have access along these routes.  Let no one tell me then that that will be time enough for the local authority to step in.</P>
    <P>All kinds of fears are involved, and the Minister in his introduction did very little to deal as sensitively as I and many others would like to see him dealing with these issues.  He introduced this with an extraordinarily brief speech which amounted to a declaration that we can <Col N="264" /> either take this Bill or leave it.  That does not make for the best cross-House cooperation. We all want to see better standards of public transport, and indeed better standards of parliamentary cooperation, and many of us would be happy to facilite that.  However, it needs some greater dialogue than the short, relatively snappy speech with which the Bill was thrown to us. Presumably, we are allowed to chaw on it for a certain length of time and the Government eventually will muster their large majority and the Bill will be approved anyway.</P>
    <P>Those are my main objections to the Bill and I hope the Minister will be good enough to refer to them when he is summing up.  This Bill was introduced with extraordinary haste despite no public demand for it and despite the more pressing legislation in the pipeline in the Minister's Department.  It is being taken in isolation from a public transportation policy, which is essential.  We see transport daily deteriorating around us, with the local authorities divided among themselves as to what to do about it.  Yet we have a Toll Roads Bill which could be made redundant, depending on what a public transportation authority would undertake.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the major freedoms which this Bill seems to allow without any concern about safety and guarantees for public access.  There are questions relating to the implementation of the toll.  How can we be sure how it will operate?  If industrial disputes come about are we expected to assume that one half of a town will be separated from the other half?  This is quite a reasonable proposition if the toll road or bridge is what links them.  It is quite reasonable too in view of the present industrial relations chaos which is growing and being incited to grow by virtue of the provocative policy of this Government.</P>
    <P>The toll road is of concern primarily to the motorist.  We do not see reference to other types of transport, and I include here everything ranging from the pedestrian to, in some rural areas, the horse and cart.  There is the cyclist and the woman with the pram.  All of these people have a right to know whether <Col N="265" /> they can cross this bridge and if they are going to be levied.</P>
    <P>Is this a tax in another form?  Is it designed to replace road tax? Theoretically the possibility exists that on every road in this country, or at any rate on the major roads where the traffic is most dense, we are going to be paying tolls.  How is it going to operate?  Are we going to find a whole new alien idea imposed on us in a society which is small demographically in an economy which does not need this concept?  All it needs is a courageous Government willing to make certain decisions and to do what is right.  These issues are very germane to the Bill.  The Minister, by his dismissive introduction of this legislation and by the brevity of the Bill, merely gives cause for concern about the sincerity of his approach to public transport.  Unfortunately, therefore, we are unable to be our normal co-operative selves in this matter and we must reject the legislation before us as having no transportation impact, as having a questionable economic impact, as being a tax in another form.  It is certainly open to the accusation of being specifically designed to cater for one or two particular applicants, and of being irrelevant to transportation policy which is what the Minister should be talking about and of being geared specifically with concern for a small sector of the community with no social comprehension or concern for the people who might not have cars. Finally, tolls will have an undoubted impact on commerce and industry if they are obliged to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not against the principle of toll bridges and toll roads.  I oppose the Bill because of its obvious inference that private enterprise will have the right to erect such bridges or provide such roads.  The Minister said that it is the Government's policy that subject to certain considerations on which the provisions of this Bill are based private enterprise should be facilitated in participating with road authorities in the financing, construction, maintenance and operation of suitable projects.  The Minister's introductory speech was very short and gave the impression that the <Col N="266" /> Bill is partly if not totally framed for the benefit of private enterprise.  Private enterprise should not be allowed to become involved in profiteering at the expense of the public.</P>
      <P>A case can be made for toll roads and bridges.  They are not without precedent even here, and they have been operated with great success in recent years in Britain and perhaps in other countries.  The Government should solve the problems that exist off their own bat and should not allow the situation to be dealt with by private enterprise.  Fianna Fáil told us in their manifesto that if they were returned to power they would prepare a major road development plan designed to anticipate the demands of the eighties. As far as I am aware, we have not had any such development plan.  The manifesto also says that if returned to power</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will establish a <i>Transport Authority</i> to investigate and report on the measures necessary to achieve the most efficient and economic transport system for goods and passengers having regard to the need to maintain a flexible competitive transport system&mdash;thereby ensuring the facilities necessary for industrial development through the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>We have not seen any sign of that transport authority.  We would all welcome the setting up of such an authority because there is a great need to improve our road structures generally.  The cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford are constantly snarled up with heavy traffic jams and there is obviously a need for a number of extra bridges plus an improved road system.  On a wet miserable evening such as this it would not be unusual in Cork city for traffic to move only one hundred yards in an hour.  The provision of three or four bridges in each city would probably assist greatly in solving the problems but the Government should not hand it over to private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We as a party feel that the Government are abdicating their responsibility by handing it over to private enterprise. We also feel that if this is operated by <Col N="267" /> the Government or the local authorities it will be a new form of road tax and I would ask the Minister to allay our fears in this regard in his reply.  The Minister's opening address for this important Bill was extremely short and that is one of the reasons why we are suspicious of the motives behind the Bill.  Toll roads and bridges should only be provided in exceptional circumstances, in cases where motorists would be saved travelling a considerable distance.  For instance, if one were to build a bridge 30 miles downstream from Limerick it would be a tremendous saving for motorists travelling from Kerry to Clare and <i>vice versa.</i> This is the reasoning behind the toll bridge erected on the Severn estuary in the south of England.  That bridge probably cost hundreds of millions of pounds but it has been a great success as it saves 50 to 60 miles for people travelling from the south of Wales to London. If the Minister told us that his proposals were along those lines he would get the backing of this party.  The Minister seems to be opting out in favour of private enterprise and we certainly do not agree to that.</P>
    <P>We have one toll bridge in Fiddown. It spans the river Suir joining Kilkenny and Waterford.  It is run by semi-private enterprise.  It is the responsibility of CIE. Our experience has been that while the bridge was making money CIE were quite happy but when the condition of the bridge deteriorated they wanted to get rid of it because it was a liability.  For years they have been attempting to hand the toll bridge over to the Kilkenny or Waterford county council.  The same thing could happen with private enterprise.  While money was to be made they would maintain it but if it deteriorated or became structurally unsound would they opt out like CIE are attempting to do at the moment.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate that the Government may be financially embarrassed and are not in a position to build the number of bridges required.  Nearly every town has a bridge which needs to be replaced but the four major cities I refer to need additional bridges immediately.  The <Col N="268" /> Government should not hand it over to private enterprise to supply the need. Surely the Regional Fund was set up with a view to providing this type of infrastructure. Why can this type of roads and bridges envisaged in this Bill not be financed from the Regional Fund?  That is surely one of the natural places to seek the finance.</P>
    <P>We feel that there is sufficient tax on road users, the tax on petrol, insurance premiums and so on, and it is a bit much to expect motorists to bear this further form of taxation which is what tolls are. I am in favour of handing back much of semi-State property and semi-State companies to private enterprise.  The Posts and Telegraphs services, for instance, do not bear mentioning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE is another company which is a liability and would obviously be run much better in private hands.  It is costing the country a stack and is highly inefficient.  The ESB is probably the one semi-State body which is providing a reasonably satisfactory service.  However, private enterprise should not be entertained in this area.  We do not expect to pay for something which the local authority or the Government should provide.  If the Minister could point out that the type of bridges and roads which would be provided under this Bill would be for the benefit of the public and would be a saving to the public, such as the Severn Bridge which cuts off a vast roundabout trip, we would all be with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us if such figures are available: what it costs the State at present for our very inadequate road system?  What amount do we lose each year due to traffic jams, the type of chaos we meet daily at Naas, in Dublin and Cork at every rush hour? Places like Naas should have been bypassed years ago.  I do not blame the Minister; it is probably the fault of all Governments in the past 20 or 30 years; they are a headache for motorists. Perhaps the Minister intends when the <Col N="269" /> Naas by-pass is built that it should be a toll road.  I would like to know if any study has been carried out by An Foras Forbartha or some such group showing what has been lost in man-hours or what assessment can be made of the losses incurred due to traffic snarl-ups.  Naas is an obvious place; one could name many other towns near Dublin but bad as these places are and badly as we need by-passes I do not regard them as the type of project that should be liable to tolls.  Such roads are a necessity, not a saving to anybody.  The public have a right to such facilities and should not have to put up with the nerve-racking experiences they must endure at present.  I wish we had some study that would set out the cost to the State at present because it is obvious that it would be money well spent if the State were to remedy the present inadequate structures. I should like the Minister to state what practical proposals he has to present if this Bill is passed.</P>

      <P>An Act to provide for the charging of tolls in respect of the use of public roads, to enable road authorities, with the consent of the Minister for the Environment, both to makes schemes for the establishment of systems of such tolls and to enter into agreements under which persons do one or more of the following, that is to say, provide, maintain, improve, manage and operate roads the subject of such tolls for, with or on behalf of those authorities upon such terms and conditions as may be specified in the agreements (including the payment to, or retention by, them of all or part of the proceeds of the tolls) and to provide for matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Title worried me to a certain extent because it includes making &ldquo;schemes for <Col N="270" /> the establishment of a system of such tolls and to enter into agreements . . . that is to say, provide, maintain, improve, manage and operate roads the subject of such tolls. . . . &rdquo;  I should like the Minister to elaborate as to what exactly he means by this.  I presume that we shall have bridges provided at certain river crossings, as he said near the end of the speech.  He said it was an enabling measure which would provide an additional option to road authorities for the financing and operation of particular road facilities such as major river crossings which are necessary in the general traffic and transportation interests.</P>
    <P>My reason for concern is that at the time of the general election I had heard that Fianna Fáil promised to abolish road tax and I was curious as to how finance would be made available later on to provide future roads.  It was at the back of my mind that at some stage we would have toll roads.  When I ventured to suggest this at different meetings I addressed, some people believed that we might have toll roads while others did not.  I suggest that people who are using roads at present are paying enough.  I honestly believe that our road network leaves much to be desired, but while that is so, I do not think toll roads are the answer.  No doubt the Minister will say that we will have beautiful motorways provided and excellent bridges and so on and that all of these when provided will save motorists many miles.  This is probably true, but I would ask: Is there not a possibility, if not a probability, that over the years some of our roads will be allowed to deteriorate and people will have little option but to use toll roads? There are toll roads in Europe and in America, but in Ireland people should not have to pay for the privilege of using a road provided by the local authority.  It is wrong and unfair, and it is another form of taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably say people will not have to use toll roads but they will because the present roads will not be kept up to present standards.  A public road is defined in the Bill.  How will the people in rural Ireland be affected by this Bill?  The short statement made by the Minister does not answer any of the <Col N="271" /> questions I have to ask.  Will there be toll roads and bridges in Laois-Offaly, Galway, Westmeath, Longford, Kerry and Donegal?  I see dangers in this. There are many bridges across the River Shannon.  Will we have to pay tolls to cross that river?  When will these roads and bridges be built?  Where will they be built?  Who will have to pay for building them?</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement is less than frank.  He had a duty and an obligation to go into far more detail in his opening remarks to the House.  It is all very well to speak about objections people may lodge, and notices and statements that will be published.  It is all very well to talk about statutory objections.  The Minister emphasised that it will continue to be the responsibility of the road authorities to decide whatever projects might be undertaken under the terms of this Bill.  The Minister had an obligation to give some examples of the type of toll roads he has in mind.</P>
    <P>Will we have a toll road in the vicinity of Naas?  There is a bottleneck in Naas. Will people have to pay for the privilege of taking a short cut around Naas?  I do not think they should.  That work could have been done out of moneys from the Road Fund.  One of the main reasons why this Bill is before the House is the loss of revenue suffered by all the local authorities.  I can appreciate the difficulties of local authorities.  We are dealing here with the duties of local authorities who are responsible for building roads.  Motor taxation was a simple system of collecting money and providing roads.  As far as I can see, people are still working in motor taxation offices and dealing with the £5 car disc. This Bill is a device to make up for the revenue lost by the abolition of motor taxation.  It may prove very unfair to many people who will be obliged to use toll roads regularly.  It will militate against them.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous amount of work to be done on our roads system.  No matter how you approach the city of Dublin there are difficulties.  The method the Minister is considering is not the answer to the problems.  He should let the people know exactly what he has in <Col N="272" /> mind for the erection of toll roads and bridges.  What proposals has the Minister in mind in regard to a road system for the country?  Will the future situation be one in which the reconstruction of major roads will mean that they will become toll roads?  How many of the people travelling into Dublin from all other parts of the country will be faced with toll roads?  What will be the situation in regard to people who have to use bridge across the River Shannon? Indeed some of those bridges at present are in need of maintenance, improvement and perhaps replacement.  Will any of those bridge across the River Shannon be toll bridges?</P>
    <P>Taxation can be applied in many ways.  I said some considerable time ago that our people would be faced with having to pay for the privilege of using our roads in the future.  When I made that forecast I did not realise it would materialise so soon.  When people fully recognise what the Minister is setting out to do here they will be opposed to the changes he has in mind.  The whole system before us this evening is something to which our people will be opposed.  Our people are entitled to travel along our public roads as of right without having to pay for the privilege of so doing, be it to a local authority, the Department of the Environment or any private person who might take over their administration at some future date. There will be a lot of people very sad, upset and annoyed at the realisation that they will have to pay for the privilege of using some of our public roadways.  The principle involved is something over which I could not stand and I am totally opposed to it.  It is the duty of local authorities to build and provide these roadways and the system obtains already for that purpose.  It is now proposed to change all of that and to charge people for using those roads, which is something the Minister must reconsider.</P>
    <P>The most important task of the Minister here this evening is to explain to us in detail what roadways and bridges he had in mind that will be affected by the provisions of this Bill.  He should set out clearly for us the areas that will be <Col N="273" /> affected.  He should inform us whether it will be throughout the whole country or in Dublin only.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of controversy in regard to the Dublin road system.  In regard to the proposals discussed last evening by Dublin Corporation, I believe that the new motorway envisaged will in some way improve the traffic system in and around Dublin.  Something will have to be done in regard to Dublin because the city is slowly grinding to a halt.  It is bad for business, for industry, for tourism and, most important of all, for the people living in the city.</P>
    <P>The whole system of roadways in rural areas must be looked at also.  People who are living, not on national primary or secondary route, but on the smaller roads require these to be improved enormously, which in turn brings the requirement of further financing from the Department of the Environment, because the moneys available already have proved insufficient.  A lot of our smaller roads are becoming dog tracks and bog roads.  The Department of the Environment will have to face up to the responsibility of providing the necessary funds for their improvement because many of these roads are in a serious condition at present.  This is a task that must be undertaken because there is grave dissatisfaction with the present condition of roads.</P>
    <P>Those are the comments I wish to make on this Bill.  I cannot see my way to supporting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very short, enabling Bill.  Even though it is a short Bill, it is amazing to note the two conflicting interpretations of it.  On the one hand, Deputy Quinn maintained that the Bill was designed to exclude the only proposal afoot at present&mdash;a proposal by a certain individual&mdash;or his company. On the other hand Deputy Keating maintained that the Bill was designed to facilitate that specific proposal and that was its only purpose.  Both interpretations are quite wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody said they were against toll roads even though they said they would vote against the Bill.  We are all agreed that more money is needed to <Col N="274" /> create a proper roads structure for the country.  These funds are still badly needed to bring our roads up to the desired standard.  Even though a few Deputies referred to the fact that not sufficient money was being made available by the Government at present for road structure, I should like to point out that the 1979 allocation is 80 per cent higher than the 1977 allocation of moneys by the National Coalition&mdash;not a bad performance by this Government in a little over 18 months in regard to our roads.  It is an example of their serious intent to improve the roads.  At the moment there is no way anyone could set up a toll scheme here.  Without this enabling legislation one could not attempt to do it because the Bill is necessary to permit it.</P>
    <P>The criticism has been made that in this Bill we are handing the roads over to the private sector.  This is not true.  Not only will this Bill permit a local authority to join with the private sector to create a toll scheme, but without this Bill the local authority could not contemplate a toll scheme even on their own. This Bill now permits a local authority to set up their own toll scheme if they wish to do so and to benefit from that scheme on their own.  It also facilitates their entry into agreement with the private sector to set up such a scheme if they think it is worth while.</P>
    <P>In regard to this Bill there is absolutely no question of compulsion or pressure on any local authority to set up tolls for public roads.  In addition, the Bill is so drafted as to preserve in full the existing statutory responsibilities and the power of decision of the road authorities in relation to the provision of public roads in their own administrative areas.  All the important decisions of road authorities, such as the making of toll schemes, the making of bye-laws for the operation of toll roads, bridges or whatever the scheme is and entering into agreements with private persons for financing, construction, maintenance and management of a toll project, and further, the making of agency arrangements with other road authorities, are reserved to the elected members of the local authority concerned. It is the elected members who make these decisions and, this Bill enables them to do so.  A very important <Col N="275" /> factor is that it allows the private sector to invest money in the building of roads, bridges, tunnels and so on.  They can invest money which they have already expressed an interest in investing.  That expression of interest is not solely confined to the one company which has been referred to here.  There are other interests which have expressed a desire to become involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn mentioned the question of pension funds.  There is nothing whatsoever to stop people operating pension schemes in the public sector or otherwise getting involved with any road authority in a scheme to attract the necessary funds to enable them to operate their pension scheme; the Bill permits them to get involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating was worried about the position of pedestrians and cyclists in relation to toll roads.  He wondered who would be excluded from the use of the bridge here in Dublin which he specifically referred to.  I would suggest that he read section 3 (3) (b) of the Bill. He will see that the road authority&mdash;in this case Dublin Corporation&mdash;will decide what classes of vehicles or other road users will be permitted to use the bridge he referred to.  He also said that the Bill was to facilitate a single proposal.  That is not so.  It is to facilitate any proposal where a local authority might wish to enter into an agreement with the private sector or to implement a proposal on their own.  Of course, we recognise that all areas of the country would not attract a toll scheme.  There would have to be a certain volume of traffic to make it economically feasible. There are certain areas which will attract toll proposals.  Deputy Moore was correct when he said that a local authority could introduce a toll scheme under the Bill.  They can also enter into an arrangement with the private sector to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to harbour authorities in relation to the Bill.  The harbour authority in question is not a roads authority.  Dublin Corporation is the roads authority in the area that Deputy Quinn referred to.  This Bill could not make the harbour authority a roads authority.  It would have to be <Col N="276" /> done under the Harbours Act and not under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick and others referred to the manifesto and whether or not a transport authority would be set up. As I said here at Question Time, my colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Transport, has already set up the Transport Consultative Commission and this commission has already produced a discussion document which has been very widely publicised.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has been referred to by many people here is the question of a roads plan.  In accordance with the commitment given in the manifesto a roads plan for the 1980s is at a very advanced stage of preparation and will be published in the near future.  Some people thought that should be published before bringing in this Bill.  Once this Bill becomes law it will only assist in the overall picture with regard to the planning of our roads and on where money should be spent initially in order to do something about the traffic jams which people are experiencing in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Naas and other places.  The plan, when published, will make it easier for people in the private sector who are interested in investing in our roads on a toll basis to identify the areas where it would be worth having consultations with a view to doing so.  The two are complementary to each other.  Without this Bill there would be no legislative standing for a toll roads programme in any area.  This Bill, having gone through the House, will surely have the desired effect on this country with regard to road structure.  To continue under the present system with the Exchequer making money available to build more roads would be slow despite increases from year to year so this Bill is introduced in an effort to speed up the development.  It will bring in moneys which otherwise we would not have access to for this purpose. The local authorities are the people who will be responsible for the arrangement for running any toll schemes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of charges being exorbitant for different types of vehicles these charges had to be agreed by the local authority and, in turn, have to be approved by me as Minister for the <Col N="277" /> Environment so the public interest is going to be protected under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating asked what inflationary effect toll charges would have on the products of firms, one or two of whose names he mentioned.  These firms, whether they are using articulated trucks or cars are being held up in traffic jams and, consequently, they are losing financially because in the business world it is important to be able to move quickly from point A to point B.  We must face the fact that this congestion must be relieved with the minimum of delay.  I have been accused of bringing this legislation in hastily, but 18 months ago we said clearly that we were prepared to consider toll schemes for different parts of the country.  We made it clear also that any decision in this regard would require legislation.  What I am doing here is providing for an intake of money for the toll systems.  All the evidence to date indicates that many groups in the private sector are waiting for this legislation and are willing to invest money in the various areas.  The Bill will enable them to put forward their proposals and to identify the areas that will be of interest to them. The Bill is not a question of putting the cart before the horse.  It is a question of putting everything in the proper order of priority.</P>
    <P>As I have said the roads plan for the eighties will make it easier to identify the areas where it would be feasible to have toll schemes and to identify the areas in <Col N="278" /> which it would be attractive to have these schemes.  This plan will be published shortly and we should hope that coupled with the legislation it will enable us to achieve a better road structure and to eliminate the traffic jams and long delays that we experience on the roads now.  The quicker we advance our roads structure, the more development we will have.</P>
    <P>This Bill is short and simple.  It is an enabling Bill whereby the proposals can be considered.  Nobody should be confused by them.  Responsibility for our roads will not be handed over to anyone. The final decision will remain with each local authority concerned.  In other words, the decisions will rest with the elected members of local authorities and surely that is a guarantee that the interests of the public will be protected in relation to any road toll scheme.</P>
    <P>In setting up toll schemes we shall be assisting the public and ensuring that business people will be able to reach their destinations much faster.  If there are people who wish to vote against the Bill, that is their right but I emphasise again that the legislation is merely enabling the setting up of toll road schemes and that this is in accordance with the wishes of most of the people.  I trust that the Bill will be enacted within a reasonable time so that we may achieve our aims in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the brutal increase in house mortgage interest rates, particularly having regard to the steep increase in house purchase prices, and calls on the Government to take immediate action to alleviate its effects on house purchasers.</P>
      <P>This motion deals with the situation that prevails at present with regard to house mortgage rates.  The Government came to office on a number of pledges, one of which was that it would be easier to buy a house and cheaper to keep it, or cheaper to buy a house and easier to keep it if Fianna Fáil were returned to power.  This evening I want to throw that lie back in the face of those who made that promise because of the hardship the Government's policy is having in relation to house mortgages and because of the brutal increases which have occurred in house prices since Fianna Fáil took office.  The simple incontrovertible facts are: house prices have never been higher, the rate of increase has never been greater and the interest rate on mortgages has never been higher.  That is a shameful record for a Government who pledged themselves to pay special attention to the housing needs of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the facts and I do not care what argument the Minister produces this evening.  I have no doubt he will tell us about the increasing cash injection in <Col N="281" /> the housing area.  I want him to look at the percentage of the total capital budget expended on housing and explain why it is lower now than it was three years ago. That is the situation in the local authority housing sector too.  Despite all the gimmickry and the promises, it is almost impossible for a young couple to save an adequate deposit to buy a house of their own, which is a constitutional entitlement and a natural right.  The position obtaining at the present time is that a couple need £3,000 or £4,000 deposit to buy an average semi-detached three-bedroomed house.  I do not know how they can do that.  People who are unable to get the deposit to buy their own houses may avail of the local authority scheme.  The maximum loan is £9,000 and the income limits are so restricted as to make buying a home meaningless because if one gets sufficient money for the deposit, one is almost certainly in a salary bracket where one is not entitled to the loan.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware of the enormous and traumatic difficulties which the present house finance picture is placing in the way of many couples?  I know of young men and women who are undergoing extreme pressure of a psychological and financial nature because of the hardship being imposed on them, hardship which is epitomised by the fact that starting off in life they are expected to save over £3,000 or £4,000 as a deposit for a house.  That picture is incontrovertible and regrettable.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the increasing pressure being put on these couples is contributing in no small measure to the difficulties of the commencement of their married life.  I would not be reluctant to say that in many cases this new pressure is adding in no small measure to the conflict and the tension of these newly married couples and in some cases is destroying their chances of having a happy and harmonious married life.  In other words, the lack of a house finance policy by the Government is actively eroding the stability of married life for these young couples.  That is very serious.</P>
    <P>If the Minister consults with experts in <Col N="282" /> this area&mdash;psychologists, social scientists, some doctors and so on&mdash;I believe that picture will come across.  I am not sure if he is aware of the extreme position which obtains at present.  If he believes the present position is satisfactory, I would like him to explain why the waiting list in the local authority housing sector, especially in the larger urban areas, is the longest ever.  The rational and reasonable explanation for that is that more people have to go on that list because fewer people can buy a home of their own.  We must analyse the reasons for that and I would appeal to the Government to ensure that there is a change of heart about the way in which house finance is presently administered and to ensure a change of direction in legislative reform if it is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Government, in their Green and White Papers, have paid lip service to all the good they are going to do in relation to housing and home ownership but when one analyses the soft words of the chameleon-like changes of hue, depending on which Minister one is talking to, one gets a situation in the local authority where there has been a constant decline in the number of completions of homes, in the private sector a constant, rapid, inordinate, unexplained increase in the price of houses totally unrelated to any other economic index, housebuilding or otherwise.  Since this Government came into power the kind of increase we are talking about is of the order of 40 or 50 per cent in the private house sector.  That cannot be explained except by the racketeering and profiteering which has been allowed to go on under this Government.  I want to know if the reason that this has been allowed to go on is that some members in Government have a vested interest in it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask a question. Why have we this inertia in relation to controlling the cost of private houses?  I think I am entitled to an explanation. Why have this Government sat idly by while the price of new houses has soared to an all-time record, while the cost of a mortgage for decent people who are starting life has soared to an all-time record?  What causes that basic lack of resolute action so badly needed, action to control speculation in the cost of land for private housing, action to curb speculation in the buying and selling of houses . . .  How can the Minister explain the increase of 40 or 50 per cent in the cost of houses since this Government came into power?  If the cap fits let them wear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister shares my view in this.  I am aware of the inordinate degree <Col N="285" /> of hardship being visited on the heads of a growing number of people and the facts are there to bear that out&mdash;growing local authority lists, falling commitments to local authority housing completions and finance and increasing difficulties by building societies in relation to the giving of loans&mdash;a difficulty the Minister tried to do something about but which effort was too little and too late. The first time we had a situation in this city when people looking for a start in life had to queue outside the offices of building societies at 3 o'clock in the morning to get application forms for loans was less than a year ago.  This has happened during the term of office of a Government who said they would make it easier for people to buy their houses and cheaper for them to keep them.  That statement by the Government has not been borne out by the facts, and the Minister should admit that pledge has been smashed to pieces.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government now to make the finance available to allow people to get 99 per cent mortgages.  The Government have a statutory obligation to house people.  It will cost a lot more in the end if they are put on waiting lists than giving them the 100 per cent mortgages which I believe could be given by the Government.  This would give the massive boost, which we all hear regularly is so necessary, to the construction industry.  If the Government did this we could be seen to be sincere in our efforts to treat all the children of the nation equally and to give an opportunity of housing to everybody instead of just the decreasing few who are in sufficiently strong employment positions to be able to amass the small fortune which now constitutes the deposit on a house. It is not so long ago since £300, £400 or £500 was sufficient for a deposit on a house.  Now we are talking about £3,000, £4,000 or £5,000 as a deposit in the city of Dublin.  It is even more in some parts of the country.  Galway, for some mysterious reason, has the highest priced houses in the country.  The Government have done nothing about this.</P>
    <P>I want to know why the Government have done nothing about this.  I do not <Col N="286" /> want vague references to White Paper or Green Paper commitments or figures picked out of the clouds about cash investment. Those mean nothing unless they are taken as a percentage of the total capital expenditure on housing as an ongoing feature of economic activity. If that is done we see a picture of declining interest and declining commitment by the Government.</P>
    <P>Apart from the possibility of giving 99 per cent mortgages to people to make it possible for them to live and to start off in life with a house of their own, I believe some other measures should also be taken.  The building societies have carried the responsibility of the State in funding private house purchases for generations.  We should commend their good work in that area.  However, this imposes a growing burden on them. There is no guarantee that with the ebb and flow of national finance at the present time that the essential role of the building societies in this sector may continue as the stable element it has been up to this.</P>
    <P>The secretary of the Irish Building Society Association in a recent article in <i>Business and Finance</i> said:</P>
    <P>At present more than 70,000 families are buying their homes with the aid of a building society loan but the continued inflationary trend means that a given amount of savings will each year service a smaller number of loans.  However, monetary history shows that nothing is permanent, not even inflation, and there are clear indications that the rate of inflation may be tackled.</P>
    <P>He said that the Irish Building Society Association welcomed the recent approvals and he went on to develop certain measures that were taken.  The general tenor of the article will cause people to be concerned that there could be need to assist the building societies in their financing role in relation to private housing more than is done at the moment.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider, in view of the record level of house mortgage interest rates, the subsidisation of those interest <Col N="287" /> rates.  I believe the building societies should be helped to ensure that housing is available for all our people.  It is not adequate that a person's stated right to a home of his or her own should be subject to monetary speculation on the stock market, the international whim of financiers and subject, ultimately, to the ebb and flow of finance which is invested where the profit is.  That is a legitimate ploy and it is reasonable to expect that it can go on in areas where there is not such a fundamental issue at stake.</P>
    <P>When it comes to people's homes I believe that the Minister should have a constant monitoring process which ensures that the repayments on loans are such as to make it possible for people to establish homes of their own without having to force their wives to go out to work and possibly causing some neglect of their families.  It is a fact of life that people are now being forced to look around for several ways to finance homes of their own.  It is a little easier before they have families, but the burden of repayments at 14½ per cent means that the income which a husband and wife generate must remain a basic feature if they are to sustain repayments. We are now getting a situation where the burden of home ownership is making inroads into the quality of marriage and having some unfortunate effects on the children.  This is the impression I get from the people I meet daily.  The traumatic effect on people of even buying houses nowadays is so enormous that more and more people are becoming fearful of the whole situation.</P>
    <P>People should certainly have to work hard to get their homes but it should be an exciting thing when they get them. They should not have to spend sleepless nights worrying about how they are going to make their repayments.  They should not have to pay vast sums out of their incomes to repay loans.  Some of them cannot furnish their houses properly and cannot give their children the kind of domestic environment we should all like to see them being able to give them.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for all parties in the House to do their best to ensure that this most basic and fundamental issue is <Col N="288" /> dealt with in a more responsible and honest way than is being done at the moment. I am sure I do not have to remind the Minister that the question of home ownership is germane to the quality of life and that it has all kinds of social implications. I am mindful of the fact that many families and their offspring have social problems caused by their home environment.  The more we repress the desire for people to own their homes and the more difficult we make it for them, the more we create social problems. That costs us a lot more in the end. There are parts of our city at the moment where the quality of home life and the actual home structure is very bad. We would all agree with that and it is not the responsibility of any particular Government.  However, the problem should be tackled.</P>
    <P>I should like to see every effort being made to get people out of squalor, overcrowded rooms and so on and I do not see any real effort being made.  On the contrary, the percentage of the public capital programme being spent on local authority housing is decreasing all the time.  The number of completions has dropped and is continuing to drop.  At the same time we find that house costs are going up.  In 1977, 6,333 local authority dwellings were completed and 18,215 other dwellings were completed. In 1976, 7,263 local authority dwellings were completed and 16,737 other dwellings. This shows a net gain over the years.  Taking the figures for the previous seven years as an indication of our approach to housing, we find that our efforts are only managing to hold at bay the need which existed in the early seventies.  Taking account of the increasing population and the increasing number of people seeking to buy houses, we see that this need is not being adequately dealt with.</P>
    <P>I believe we are building up an enormous problem.  We have the longest ever local authority housing lists and more people than ever living as subtenants with their parents or in-laws.  A courageous attempt to tackle housing finance would help to meet this challenge. There is no justification for the enormous increase in mortgage interest <Col N="289" /> rates being allowed to go unchecked by the Government.  If it is simply a question of the Government directing that action be taken to keep mortgage interest rates down, the net effect is most unhelpful.  I am talking about the commitment of finance which the Green Paper and the White Paper envision and which is referred to as a feature of the kind of policy which the Government intend to introduce.  Instead of that honest approach to the matter, we had newspaper headlines about nine months ago announcing a 20 per cent shock for buyers.  The increase was forecast as being the same this year, with no attempt being made to tackle the basic issue.</P>
    <P>The Government should consider the disgraceful situation in relation to building land and the scandal which exists in that area.  Why are we unable to respond to that need?  The inertia in this area is in direct contrast to the rapidity with which the Bill we were discussing earlier was introduced.  Why is something not being done about the need outlined in the Kenny Report?  I do not want to be told that the Government has not done anything about this problem during the past few years.  I want to know why action is not being taken now when it is clearly necessary.</P>
    <P>We find there is no commitment to any housing philosophy, whether people should live in cities or in county areas. At Question Time last week the Minister failed to convince me that he had a very sensitive grasp of the county/city relationship and the need to retain, in so far as it is possible, the concept of a living city.  We should encourage people to live in the city.  Instead, the financial policy of the Government in relation to housing directly discriminates against that through the £1,000 grant scheme which applies only in the case of new houses.  Most houses in city areas are not new and, therefore, they do not qualify.  A couple able to buy a small house costing between £9,000 and £12,000 are deprived of this £1,000 grant.  They may want to exercise their right to live in the area in which they were brought up.  If the grant were extended to all first-time purchasers of new <Col N="290" /> and secondhand houses, it would create more housing mobility.  The small inner city house which would be suitable for many young couples is now more difficult to sell than it used to be.  More young couples are going off to clinical suburbs with wall-to-wall housing and no facilities, as is the case in one of the new estates on the periphery of Dublin where there are 1,000 houses and not one shop, school or church.  There was not even a pedestrian crossing until the residents blocked the road.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is certainly broadening the scope of the motion.  The only two items in the motion are mortgage interest rates and the steep increase in the price of houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be a comprehensive Government philosophy in relation to housing finance and construction and this would involve the elements to which I have referred.  Control of land prices is essential.  In some cases sites are now more expensive than the cost of house construction.  It is a ludicrous situation.  Sometimes sites are made more expensive overnight because some operator manages to get the local authority to give planning permission, a gesture which reflects absolutely no intrinsic work or effort by the applicant. The effect in terms of housing finance is that it puts up the price of land and we have seen the inflationary effects of this. The Minister should consider the possibility of making planning permission non-transferable or open to expiration after a certain period of time.  He should at least ensure that someone who applies for planning permission will not be able to profit at the expense of people on the housing list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people on the housing lists and some in the subtenant situation who will never be housed.  In Dublin we have about 4,500 applicants who want to live in the city and we have the paltry figure of 670 dwellings under construction or at site completion stage.  The clear indication is that more and more people will be channelled out of the city to new estates.  Why is this so?  There are at least 200 acres of derelict sites in the city and Dublin Corporation find that their <Col N="291" /> land bank is only 70 acres.  Why do the Government not tackle this situation? Why do they not take over without apology sites which speculators are using for their own purposes?  The Government should build houses on these sites. The Minister expressed himself as being satisfied with the procedures available, despite the fact that anyone driving through Dublin must see it as one of the shabbiest capitals in Europe.  This is increasingly so because we have not done anything about sites while land prices soar.  The cost of a serviced site is now higher than it has ever been in the history of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about house purchase prices, and the cost of a serviced site is germane to that.  In relation to house purchase prices, the finance available for upkeep and maintenance is very weak.  I admit that the Minister made some moves in the right direction in this regard and I think he would consider a major input in this area.  In many cases, the demand for new houses is being created simply because of the appalling conditions in which people who live in private rented accommodation find themselves.  There are 300,000 tenants in that situation.</P>
      <P>It is possible that not everyone wants to own their house.  The burden is now so enormous that I would not blame couples for deciding that rented accommodation might be a less weighty problem.  It is their choice and we should encourage it and allow it as an option.  In our cities at least 20 per cent of the housing is overcrowded and at least one-seventh of it has not got basic hygiene facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>All this is creating a growing burden on the housing list.  If we contrast Government action in this area. <Col N="292" /> what will we find?  Despite the appalling and growing crisis, which is there for anyone to see, the Government's steps have been to make tentative suggestions to the building societies that they should only give loans in certain areas.  The building societies decided in some cases not to bother listening to the Government and, in any case, it has had no net effect on the position obtaining.  The mortgage interest rate is at its highest ever.  There is not one scintilla of response from the Government which gave a promise to make it easier to buy a house and cheaper to keep it.  What do we get?  Nothing but silence.</P>
      <P>I am entitled to call that and the other increases we have had brutal in relation to the house mortgage interest rate and house purchase prices.  We want the Government to take immediate action to alleviate the effects of the mortgage rate on house purchase.  A number of lines of action could be taken.  The previous Government had the courage to initiate one suggestion and that was to directly subsidise the building societies at a time when it was clear that, if that subsidy was not available, the whole role of building societies in this particular field could come into question.  That is one proposal.  Another one is that the Government should make a special finance fund available to allow people to get 99 or 100 per cent mortgages.  What is wrong with that?  They will still have to work to provide furnishing for the house.  It would take them off the housing list and out of the social degeneration that some of them are now living in.  It would give them the home they are entitled to.  They will be paying back anyway for the rest of their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there has been the concept of the mortgage repayment going into the second family.  It is a new concept on the horizon but it is one we must look at.  It would be very sad if the traditional headline which this country has set in relation to home ownership, having as it does one of the highest home ownership rates in Europe, was jeopardised by reckless and irresponsible action which did nothing but fuel inflation and house prices.  When it comes to controls or curbs, the Government either do <Col N="293" /> not have, for some reason that I do not understand, the will or the tenacity to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>The cost of serviced sites is unchecked. At the same time we have derelict sites everywhere.  It must be a marvellous challenge to the Minister and the Government to say &ldquo;We will solve the housing crisis in our time and ensure, instead of just holding the housing lists and the completion of housing at the rates, give or take a few hundred, at which they were a few years ago, that anybody who wants a home will get it.&rdquo; That is the target the Government should have.  They should spell it out in another Green or White Paper, not for national development&mdash;a concept so vague and nebulous as to be all things to all people and usually nothing to anybody in the end&mdash;but for housing policy.  If the Government decide to do this they will get everyone's co-operation.</P>
    <P>The biggest and most basic crisis facing people at present is the cost of buying a home of their own.  Despite the Government's undoubted goodwill and minor efforts in this area, the situation is getting worse for more people.  We all have an obligation to do something about this.  I would like the Minister to explain what he is going to do with regard to house mortgage interest rates and the unprecedented and record increases in the cost of housing.  They are two very basic issues.</P>

    <P>Last week a motion was tabled by four Fine Gael Members in the Seanad on similar lines with regard to this problem. The terms of the motion and the standard of the debate in that House, in which representatives of the three main parties participated, reflected the responsible approach of the Members who drafted the motion and those who spoke in the course of the debate.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely commenting on the responsible approach in that House to this situation, for which I commend that House.</P>
      <P>The present motion criticises first the increase in the rate of interest on house purchase mortgages, secondly the increase in house purchase prices and, thirdly, it asks the Government to alleviate the effects of these developments on house purchasers.  I will deal briefly with each of these three matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion deplores &ldquo;the brutal increase in house mortgage interest rates&rdquo;.  Those responsible for drafting this assertion obviously overlooked the fact that while their party shared power in the Coalition Government the interest rates on building society mortgages jumped from 10 per cent in 1973 to 13.95 per cent in 1976, an overall increase of 39.5 per cent, and this over a period in which the average prices of new houses increased by a staggering 113.5 per cent.  There was then no demand from the Fine Gael back benches for the Government of the <Col N="295" /> day, the National Coalition, to take immediate action to alleviate the effects of these increases on house purchasers. What, I may ask, makes the present position so very much different&mdash;apart from the fact that this Government have rescued the national housing programme from the decline which had set in before the Coalition Government were removed from office a year-and-a-half ago, with housing output dropping by nearly 3,000 units as between 1975 and 1976? This typifies the double standards or each way bet of the Deputies sponsoring this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government made a promise that it would be easier to buy a house and cheaper to keep it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As those Deputies are of course aware, there were obvious reasons for the increase about three months ago in mortgage interest rates. Like all Deputies who are sincere about the matter, I regret the fact that building societies were forced by international market conditions to increase to 9 per cent the interest rate they had to offer to depositors, thus necessitating a consequential increase in their mortgage interest rates from 11.5 per cent to 14.15 per cent with effect from 1 December last.  As the Minister with special responsibility for housing, I am naturally concerned at the effects of these interest rates increases on existing and intending borrowers and purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the tone of the motion before the Dáil, I feel it is necessary to place clearly on record the cause of the action on interest rates last December by building societies.  We in this Government, as with our predecessors in office, cannot stabilise interest rates here while we continue to be aligned with the monetary system of the United Kingdom.  The action of the British Government in raising their minimum lending rate in the hope of easing thereby their inflation problems, started the usual chain reaction of higher bank rates in the United Kingdom, thus forcing our banks to follow suit or else to face the outflow of deposits to British banks.  The building societies could not escape involvement <Col N="296" /> in these arrangements.  If they did not offer higher rates to investors not alone would their net inflows dry up but existing investors could decide to avail of the higher rate of return offered by other lending agencies and start withdrawals.</P>
    <P>Building societies are independent financial institutions which offer savers, both large and small, an opportunity to invest their money.  They are essentially mutual institutions in which many members invest their savings with a view to getting a loan from the particular society with whom they have invested at some future date for the purpose of purchasing a house.  However, it is also a fact that much of the funds invested with the societies comes from people who are interested in the rate of return they will get on their money.  Societies do not make profits in the accepted commercial sense.  As mutual institutions, their aim is to provide a margin between the rate of interest they pay to the investor and the rate they charge the borrower, which, after expenses and taxation, is sufficient to leave a small surplus to maintain adequate reserves for the protection of their investors.</P>
    <P>Building societies are unusual financial institutions in that they manage to borrow short and lend in the long-term. Investors can withdraw on demand or at short notice, but mortgage loans are advanced for periods of 20 to 25 years.  As independent financial institutions, societies are obliged to compete with other such institutions, in particular the banks, both to retain the funds already invested with them and to attract further new funds.  To do so they must offer an investment rate at least as attractive, and preferably more attractive than the other institutions.</P>
    <P>Any substantial withdrawal of funds would have disastrous effects on the operation of the societies and the private housing programme of which they are the major support.  In 1977 societies supplied £119 million or 70 per cent of the total amount lent by all lending agencies, £171 million for private housing.  In 1978 they lent over £147 million, or 66 per cent of the £223 million advanced by all lending agencies to finance the <Col N="297" /> purchase of private houses.  Between 1971 and 1976 building societies contributed nearly £600 million to private house purchase financing in Ireland &mdash;nearly 50 per cent of the total amount provided by all lending agencies in that period.</P>
    <P>After consideration of the situation the societies who are members of the Irish Building Societies Association decided to increase the interest rate paid to investors from 7 per cent to 9 per cent as from 1 December 1978.  This gave rise to a consequent need to increase the mortgage rate to 14.15 per cent.  I want to emphasise that the increase in the investment rate does not restore the differential over that offered by the banks to anything like it has been.</P>
    <P>The societies have nearly always enjoyed an advantage of anything from ½ per cent to 2½ per cent over the minimum bank deposit interest rates. Bank deposit rates were increased by 2 per cent on 16 May 1978, but building societies increased their investment rate by 1½ per cent as from 1 June.  Bank deposit rates were further increased by 1 per cent with effect from 27 June but building societies did not then increase their rates.  Banks increased their deposit rates by a further 2½ per cent with effect from 15 November last.  As from 1 December 1978, the societies' differential over the banks' deposits under £5,000 has been only ½ per cent while for deposits of between £5,000 and £25,000 the societies' rate is ½ per cent below the bank rate.  For deposits over £25,000 there is now a margin of 1 per cent in favour of the banks as against the societies.</P>
    <P>I must make it clear that there is no power available to me in the Building Societies Act, 1976, to interfere in the setting by societies of their interest rates. This is so for the very good reason that it was decided when the Act was being drafted that societies themselves are the best judges of the appropriate interest rates necessary to generate sufficient inflow of moneys to enable them to meet their mortgage commitments.  I agree that this is the right approach.  They have always acted capably and responsibly <Col N="298" /> in the matter and I am satisfied that they acted responsibly in this instance.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been voiced about the fact that the societies have increased their mortgage rate by considerably more than 2 per cent.  The consequential increase has to be higher in order to compensate the societies for the additional amount they must pay as tax on behalf of investors who receive their interest payments free of tax.  I am aware also that societies have been criticised on the grounds that their operating costs are too high in comparison with their counterparts in the United Kingdom and also because they are alleged to be making big profits here.  In this regard I would point out that Professor Cleary who carried out an in-depth investigation of building societies in this country for the National Prices Commission was satisfied that operating costs were not unreasonably high.  The societies themselves are well aware of the need to keep their costs at a reasonable level and indeed their management expenses are low in comparison with those of other fiancial institutions in the State.  This is particularly laudable in view of the rapid growth and expansion of the societies, particularly in recent years.  Assets have increased from £87 million in 1970 to £600 million now, a sevenfold increase. They are now paying nearly three times the number of loans they paid in 1970.</P>
    <P>In so far as the profit criticism of the societies is concerned, I have already said that building societies are not profit-making institutions in the commercial sense, as are other institutions.  Their objective is to achieve a surplus sufficient to maintain an adequate reserve.  In the context of their rapid growth in the past decade, the societies' reserves have had to be considerably increased in order to be adequate.  It is well to place on record the fact that out of the interest of £14.15 paid on each £100 of mortgage finance borrowed, it is calculated that £9 is payable to investors, £2.92 is paid as income tax on behalf of investors, management expenses account for £1.28, leaving an undistributed surplus of 95p which, after tax, leaves only 66p for reserves.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer back to May <Col N="299" /> 1973 when the National Coalition Government introduced a subsidy for building societies.  At that time the inflow into societies was low and falling rapidly.  The building societies decided to increase the interest rate offered to investors by 1 per cent.  This would have necessitated an increase of at least 1¼ per cent in the mortgage rate.  The Government at that time decided to give a temporary 1 per cent subsidy to societies to enable them to pay investors an extra 1 per cent and hold the existing mortgage rate of that time.</P>
    <P>The subsidy was subsequently reduced to ¾ per cent in August 1975 and was abolished in February 1976. That subsidy, and this should be emphasised, was to encourage investment with the societies and while it indirectly had the effect of reducing the mortgage rate, its primary purpose was to attract more money into building societies.  This inflow of funds to societies had been falling dramatically at that time.  The situation now is different in that inflows into building societies are at an exceptionally high level.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the question of interest rates payable on house purchase loans, I want to refer to the recovery which has been taking place in the case of the SDA loans schemes operated by local authorities.  This scheme had been practically eliminated under the National Coalition Government which, between September 1973 and June 1977 had made no increase in the loan and income limits.  Only £17 million was provided for SDA loans under that Government's last budget in 1977.  The present Government increased the income limit by 50 per cent and have doubled the previous maximum loan available to SDA applicants.</P>
    <P>Loan payments increased to £26 million last year and provision has been made for an expenditure of £43.5 million this year.  The proportion of the mortgage market served by this loan scheme rose from 10 per cent in 1977 to 14.4 per cent last year.  The interest rate on money payable by local authorities on money borrowed from the Local Loans Fund to finance the scheme rose <Col N="300" /> from 11 per cent to 12 per cent as from 1 December last, hardly what one could justifiably term a &ldquo;brutal&rdquo; increase, as the motion indicates.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion refers to &ldquo;the steep increase in house purchase prices&rdquo;.  As I mentioned earlier, this topic was dealt with very fully in the Seanad last week and I do not intend to cover the same ground again at any great length on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite tend to base their assessment of trends in house prices on an unqualified use of statistics set out in Tables 19a and 19b of my Department's quarterly bulletin.  I have had occasion to warn the House previously about the danger of this approach.  The bulletin itself states quite explicitly that though the statistics of house prices are useful as indicators of general trends in average house prices over a given period, they cannot be accepted as completely accurate records of housing costs at any given time.</P>
    <P>For example, the houses concerned are not necessarily comparable from quarter to quarter or from area to area throughout the country.  Furthermore, the average prices recorded can be influenced from quarter to quarter by changes in the distribution of loan approvals amongst lending agencies.</P>
    <P>Subject to that reservation, over the four quarters of 1978 the rate of new house price increases recorded in the bulletin fell from 11.7 per cent in the three months to 31 March 1978 to 8.4 per cent in the June quarter, to 3.4 per cent in the September quarter of 1978 and I am glad to say that the bulletin for the quarter ended 31 December 1978 which will be published shortly, will record a slight reduction in average prices during that period.  It means that over the full year 1978, average new house prices, as set out in the bulletin, rose by 24.8 per cent&mdash;undoubtedly a substantial increase but one which was well below the staggering increase of 36 per cent which occurred during the Coalition's Government's first year of office in 1973-74.</P>
    <P>House prices have been rising constantly&mdash;not just over the past year or two, but for decades past.  They have increased <Col N="301" /> more steeply over the past year in other European countries than in Ireland.  The fact that we have managed to bring the rate of increase under control is due to the awareness by the Government of the trend in prices and because we were concerned about the difficulties to which, if allowed to continue, it would give rise in the case of persons of modest means.  The Government have kept the situation under review and took the necessary initiatives to deal with it.  This process of control was not an emergency operation begun early last year.  Measures to control the escalation in house prices were put in hands soon after we resumed office in mid-1977 as part of a wide-ranging package of actions in relation to housing.</P>
    <P>When we took over Government again in July 1977 we soon discovered that the controls on new house prices, as operated by the certificates of reasonable value system, which the previous Fianna Fáil Government had introduced in 1973, had not been strengthened, contrary to what should have been expected after a period of rapid price escalation.  Indeed, the controls had been weakened by the drastic curtailment in 1976 of eligibility for new house grants.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances the certificate of reasonable value system was immediately extended to all grant-type new houses provided for sale and also to flats.  Previously houses in schemes of three or fewer and all flats were exempt from the controls.  The effect of this move, combined with the liberalisation of the schemes of new house grants, was to increase from approximately 40 per cent to 70 per cent the proportion of new private houses brought within the scope of house price control.</P>
    <P>Further positive action was taken by the Government last year.  Evidence was becoming available that the rise in house prices was being influenced by builders moving out of the construction of modestly priced houses eligible for grants, and for which certificates of reasonable value, were therefore required, and into the higher priced market <Col N="302" /> where profits were greater and where they would not be subject to the system of house price control, as in the more modest house market.</P>
    <P>To deal with this situation the Government decided that for a trial period at least 60 per cent of the total funds available to building societies for mortgages should be allocated in providing loans not exceeding £13,000 each and that at least a further 20 per cent of their available funds should be allocated in providing loans of between £13,000 and £16,000.</P>
    <P>The societies were also informed that certificates of reasonable value should be furnished by all applicants for loans not exceeding £16,000 for the purchase of new houses.  The Government's decision was intended to ensure that the money available should finance the purchase of the greatest feasible number of reasonable priced houses and that all purchasers of new houses with loans under £16,000 would be assured of getting reasonable value for their investment. Since we introduced them, these moves have already produced significant results in so far as the trend in average gross house prices is concerned.</P>
    <P>In the case of previously occupied houses the average price of houses for which loans were approved by the main lending agencies increased by 17.8 per cent as between the last quarter of 1977 and the end of 1978.  I am particularly pleased to mention that over the last three months of 1978 the average prices of previously occupied houses dropped by 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>The motion calls on the Government to take steps to alleviate the difficulties being experienced by house purchasers. May I say that in regard to supports to housing the Government need no prompting by the Opposition.  We did more to promote the national housing programme and provided more practical aid to individual house purchasers in our first year in office than the Coalition Government did in the preceding four-and-a-half years.  Rates on dwelling houses were abolished.  The £1,000 new house grant and a far more generous scheme of house improvement grants were introduced.  The SDA loan and income limits were greatly increased.  The <Col N="303" /> maximum low-rise mortgage loan was also increased and eligibility for the loans has been recently liberalised.  Subsidy on private housing sites provided by local authorities was increased by 66 per cent.  Contrast our commitment to encouraging housing activity with the record of the previous Government, which introduced such severe restrictions on eligibility for new house and reconstruction grants that these schemes were, in effect, being phased out, with only £4½ million being spent on grants in 1977 against a provision of £30 million this year.  The SDA scheme was, as I have already remarked, also effectively being wound down.  In the light of their own dismal record when in power, one must question the good faith of the Deputies opposite in now calling for special aids for house purchasers.  May I say, however, that if the Government were satisfied that the present position justified special measures, then the necessary action would be taken.  Our track record over the past year-and-a half can leave no doubt that we would take action if we felt it was needed.</P>
    <P>The measures we have put in hands to curb the escalation of house prices, the unprecedented amount of money now available to finance mortgages and the temporary controls on the amounts of individual loans advanced by building societies make it easier to purchase a modestly priced house.  Last year a total of £280 million in mortgages were approved by all the major lending agencies. This was over £60 million more than the total amount approved in 1977.</P>
    <P>Our record can be put beside the record of the National Coalition.  We achieved more in one year than they achieved in four-and-a-half years when the grants system was being wound down because of the restrictions imposed by them and when the SDA loans were practically phased out.  We can at last lay claim to the fact that our policies and the action we took got the housing programme moving again.  People can now look forward to owning their own houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Minister for the Environment <Col N="304" /> has put down an amendment to our motion in which he notes the fact that building societies were obliged to increase their mortgage interest rates from 11.5 per cent to 14.15 per cent with effect from 1 December 1978 in consequence of the increased interest rate on deposits adopted by other commercial lending institutions, particularly associated banks, and shares the general hope that money market conditions will soon enable the high rate to be reduced.</P>
      <P>The Minister's contribution to the appalling high rate of interest and the appallingly steep increase in house prices is to express the pious hope that money market conditions will soon enable high interest rates to be reduced.  That is the contribution of the Government and of the Minister to the high rate of interest and the appalling increase in the cost of houses.  That would be bad coming from any Government or from any Minister for the Environment, but when it comes from a Government who got into power on a solemn pledge to make it easier for young people to own a house and cheaper to keep it, it is nothing but a cynical disregard for their promises and a cynical disregard for those who are looking for houses.  It is a fact that when Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1977 the price of houses jumped immediately and dramatically.  The truth is that since then the price of new houses has increased by about 40 per cent.  That is the reality of the situation.  The £1,000 grant they talked so much about before the election had the effect of increasing the price of houses instead of making it easier for people to get houses.  We know by now that the £1,000 grant which some people got&mdash;many more who thought they would get it did not&mdash;has been gobbled up about four times over. The people who are now seeking to buy new houses or to build houses of their own are infinitely worse off than they were before Fianna Fáil came into power and before they promised the £1,000 grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in that situation that we put down this resolution deploring the brutal&mdash;I make no apology for using that word&mdash; increase in interest rates and call on the Government to do something about it. <Col N="305" /> The Minister has dealt with many things but the one thing he did not deal with was what proposals he had to alleviate the effect of it on house purchasers and to cushion them against this increase in the mortgage interest rates and the increase in the price of houses.  The mortgage interest rate at present stands at 14.15 per cent which is an all-time record.  The Minister talks about difficulties that arose during the international recession in 1974 and 1975, but when the National Coalition were in power the interest rates were lower&mdash;under 14 per cent as the Minister concedes, although in this House the other day when I said that interest rates were now at an all-time record he contradicted me to say that one time when we were in office they were something higher.  He now concedes indirectly that he was wrong then and that he is in the unenviable position of presiding over the building industry when interest rates have now reached an all-time record.</P>
    <P>The same Minister conceded that when we were in office we subsidised interest rates.  He says that of course we were not subsidising interest rates, that what we were doing was enabling the building societies to pay more so that they could attract more money into their funds.  However, he does concede that the effect of what we did was to keep down the rate of interest by 1 per cent, and we did that at a time of international recession and international difficulties, because we felt that the rate of interest, which was lower then than it is now, was too high and we subsidised it to the extent of 1 per cent.  I call on the Minister now to do that or something like it. When he and his colleagues were in Opposition they were not against subsidies in other directions.  They said that food subsidies were not nearly high enough and if they got back into power they would increase the £63 million which was being paid in food subsidies to a much greater sum, but of course they have reduced that by £22 million or one-third. When they refused to subsidise the interest rates they are at least being consistent in office where they are not prepared to subsidise anything or to <Col N="306" /> relieve people from the brutal&mdash;I repeat the word&mdash;effect of these high interest rates.</P>
    <P>When they were in Opposition no subsidies could be too high.  They wanted more food subsidies, they wanted more subsidies for interest rates. Their performance is disgraceful for a Government who got into power on the solemn undertaking in their manifesto to make it easier to buy a house and cheaper to keep it.  They have not done anything to relieve the people of these interest rates.  Not alone that, they are coercing&mdash;and that is not too strong a term&mdash;people who can ill afford to do so to build or buy their own houses, they are doing that by shoving people off the local authority housing list and they are investigating with a fine comb the incomes of the people who seek local authority houses.  They are striking them off the housing list and forcing them into the private sector.  They cannot deny that they are doing that because the whole trend of their Green Paper and White Paper is to the effect that there would be a lesser demand for public authority houses.  At the same time, when house prices are continuing to rocket, as hopefully I will prove with figures tomorrow evening, the Minister dealt in his speech with the steadying off of house prices during the end of last year.  I concede that there was a steadying off, but he did not give us the figures for December or for January and February of this year.  The January and February figures are out because they come out about the first fortnight in each month, and those figures show that inflation in housing is on again, that the indications for 1979 are that housing costs will increase and that the 5 per cent figure given by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech has no hope of being met in regard to housing.</P>
    <P>Those are the reasons which compelled this party to put down this motion. The Minister seems to be indignant because we refer to a record rate of interest as brutal.  What is it only brutal? The Minister has talked about the SDA. The SDA loans which he has increased up to £9,000 are of no use because the threshold of income to qualify for one of <Col N="307" /> those loans is about £65 or £67 per week and people who want to borrow £9,000 simply cannot afford to service that amount.  Of course if they borrow £9,000 for their local authority to build a house and shoulder the enormous responsibility of that house they find that the £9,000 is of no use to them because, due to the drastic increase in the price of houses, they either have to have saved a good amount of money or they have to borrow elsewhere to meet the very substantial gap between the £9,000 that they may get from the local authority if they are fit to repay it. That is really what it amounts to.  A person able to repay a loan of £9,000 would not qualify for the loan from the local authority.  Even if he did, and could by some magic service the £9,000 loan, he would find that it would not be nearly sufficient to build a house in the private sector and he would have to go elsewhere to get another few thousand pounds, to build the house before he could put a stick of furniture into it.  It is alarming.</P>
    <P>I have stated that the price of houses has increased alarmingly since Fianna Fáil resumed office.  They have done nothing to control building contractors, and building contractors in the private sector have run amok since this Government came back to power and they got the green light, or the blind eye was turned on them, to run amok.  The Minister, while disowning his own bulletin which is issued quarterly by his Department and which gives house prices in great detail, went on to say that for 1978 that bulletin showed an increase of 24.8 per cent in housing costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked for this to be raised this evening because of the extreme urgency of seeking the Minister's assistance and the assistance of the various agencies of Government at his disposal to try to safeguard an industry which is basically viable so as to safeguard the interests of the workers who number approximately 80 the loss of whose employment would be a severe blow not only to them but to the immediate surrounding area and the economy of Donegal town.  Of all places that might lose an industry and jobs Donegal can least afford to lose them. As was shown recently in figures given here as a result of a question I put down, our percentage unemployment is the highest and is not far short of being double the national average.</P>
      <P>Irish Picture Mouldings Limited has been in existence in Donegal for several years and it provided much needed employment.  It seemed to be going exceedingly well and had extended its operations to Glenties, where a further factory premises was provided, and to Dunkineely.  All three of these centres were delighted with the additional employment in a high unemployment area.  However, difficulties eventually overtook the operations of Irish Picture Mouldings Limited and the Glenties operations came to a standstill as did the Dunkineely operations.  In 1977 the difficulties appeared to be of an extreme nature and threatened the existence of Irish Picture Mouldings Limited, now confined to Donegal.  Due to last minute efforts by all concerned in the Department and in the State agencies in dealing with such crises in any industry, Irish Picture Mouldings Limited did not fold at that time but was brought under a new company known as Murvagh Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite clear as to where Irish Picture Mouldings Limited ceased and where Murvagh began nor am I particularly concerned about the name applied to this factory.  However, I am fully satisfied from personal knowledge of the industry that the basic operations that have been going on in Donegal for a number of years are sound and that this industry given the right method of <Col N="309" /> operation can be salvaged and can be a viable proposition.  Others better qualified that I also hold that view. While providing jobs for the 80 now threatened with the loss of employment Irish Picture Moulding Limited could be capable of employing more people.  On this basis I appeal to the Minister, in view of the fact that the workers got notice which terminates on 16 March. That does not give them very much time. If the operations cease and the work force are dispersed we may well have lost this very valuable work-giving industry for ever.  I appeal to the Minister to try, by utilising all the agencies at his disposal, to bring about a quick examination of the possibilities for the future of this industry, to come to their aid fast rather than when it is too late and to let the workers and their jobs take precedence over all other considerations. I would appeal for action to ensure that this factory continues.  It is firmly held that this export and home industry is viable.</P>
    <P>In these days when it is difficult to obtain work, when such efforts have to be made at such a high price by our State agencies to create new industries, it would be a sad thing to see a viable factory being lost because of the difficulties being encountered in the recent past. Basically it is a viable proposition with export potential and a work force that know their jobs.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this urgently with all others interested in the salvaging and the creation of industry, to see how this factory can be salvaged rather than allowing the work to be dispersed and then trying to re-create it.  Undoubtedly, if this could be done with the least possible break, this would be the best way to do it.  We have spent much more per job in many other places with less success that would be obtainable in Donegal town.</P>
    <P>My persistence in trying to get this heard in the House is because of the urgency of the matter and the immediate prospect of the loss of 80 jobs.  Notice expires on 16 March which is very close. I am happy that the House and the Ceann Comhairle found it possible to allow <Col N="310" /> this question this week although for various reasons it could not be heard last week.  Nevertheless there is time for the Minister and the agencies at his disposal to act.  If the Minister acts his efforts will be worth while and there will be a happy outcome not only for the workers but from the national point of view.  The factory is potentially viable and has export potential, and the Minister is the man who holds the key that can salvage the factory.</P>

      <P>I had a question down last week but withdrew it because of a bereavement in the family.  I also am very concerned about Irish Picture Mouldings.  This is a male-orientated factory, as Deputy Blaney said, with over 80 maies working in Murvagh Limited. Throughout the entire county of Donegal jobs are very scarce, as the Minister probably knows, and we have the highest unemployment rate in Ireland at present.  The national average is 9.9 and in Donegal we have an average of 16 per cent.  As regards this factory I understand the work force have been put on two weeks' notice and it is very disturbing to hear of the difficulties they have run into.</P>
      <P>Briefly I should like to give the Minister a history of the causes, as I see them, for the problems now facing Murvagh Limited.  A family group began in a small way manufacturing picture frames&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt, but this firm is in receivership and we cannot discuss the internal affairs of the firm.  We may deal with the employment it is giving and so on, as Deputy Blaney has done, but I have a feeling the Deputy is going into the internal affairs of the concern and that we cannot do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  I want to talk about Irish Picture Mouldings and Murvagh Limited, the two are married intricately together.  There were four factories&mdash;two in Donegal, one in Glenties and one in Dunkineely.  The two in Donegal were going very well and the IDA then decided to give a grant to another factory in Glenties and to <Col N="311" /> another in Dunkineely.  The factory in Dunkineely never got off the ground really.  At that time I asked the general manager in Donegal and the IDA the position regarding the Dunkineely branch of Irish Picture Mouldings.  That is a few years ago.  I was told at that time that in no length of time a full work force would be employed in that factory.</P>
      <P>The IDA had problems getting back the Glenties and Dunkineely factories when Irish Picture Mouldings wound it up.  That brought us to over a year ago when this new company, Murvagh Limited, was formed.  The problem then was that three groups of directors&mdash;we can call them the Dublin group, the Donegal group and the IDA themselves&mdash;took a 10 per cent interest in this factory, Murvagh Limited.  The IDA agreed with the others that they would start this very viable industry which was in receivership.  As I understand it, Irish Picture Mouldings Limited was put into a receivership and the new company, Murvagh Limited, was then formed.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister why was Murvagh Limited at that time saddled with the tremendously high overheads of the old company, Irish Picture Mouldings?  Surely the IDA and the Department should have seen that if the company were to be viable it was given a fair chance.  My information is that it was saddled with extremely high overheads as far as the bank and other creditors were concerned.  I understand that the Donegal group who are shareholders were appointed directors and that they in turn had some family connections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is now doing what he was asked not to do, getting into the affairs of the company.  This is not done when a company is in receivership.  It is in order to deal with the employment and the loss of jobs and what it means to Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand.  It seems very wrong that these people should have been appointed shareholders in the new company.  I understand the bank did put in an extra £20,000 recently and that <Col N="312" /> the management of the new company has approached or will shortly approach the Minister to discuss the future of Murvagh.  The present situation is a severe blow, particularly to Donegal Town and I appeal to the Minister to consider this viable industry and the needs of the area.  When the IDA gave grants originally they were satisfied it was a viable industry and even yet there is little doubt that it could be a viable industry. I suggest that perhaps the IDA should take a greater shareholding in the new company without being saddled with very high overheads.  There is very high unemployment in the area and it is difficult to get a viable male-orientated industry anywhere.  The one we have in Donegal should be kept going.</P>

Substantial support has been given to the enterprise by the appropriate State agencies, the IDA and Fóir Teoranta, in the past few years, including a substantial contribution to a rescue package formulated in 1977 when the enterprise was previously in receivership.  Further assistance was offered recently by Fóir Teoranta subject to conditions which were not accepted by the company.  If proposals should now be formulated for the re-structuring or takeover of the company, the State agencies would be prepared to consider whether there is any further assistance they could give. Failing that, the IDA would seek to promote a replacement industry in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount paid out to the company over the past few years by the State agencies I referred to comes to approximately £650,000, an extremely high level of support for a relatively small enterprise like this.  Fóir Teoranta recently offered further assistance subject to a condition which regrettably the company did not accept.  There was an unfortunate <Col N="313" /> development in the past week, just about the time the receiver was appointed, when unhappily one of the people prominently identified with this company died suddenly.  This may have some effect on the future of the company. The remaining directors perhaps have not yet had an opportunity to reassess the situation arising out of that unfortunate happening.  I believe that one of them was abroad when it happened.</P>
    <P>I would be hopeful that the receiver, in conjunction with the existing directors, would be able to talk to the IDA and Fóir Teoranta at a very early date with a view to trying to put forward a further rescue package for this enterprise.  Of course it will have to be subject to certain conditions.  I would hope that those who remain in the company would see fit at this juncture to agree to a particular condition which I consider not to be unreasonable.  The prospects of maintaining the company in production would be reasonably good if that condition were acceded to.</P>
    <P>I should have mentioned that, in addition to the moneys put up by the IDA and Fóir Teoranta amounting, as I said, to about £650,000, which is a very heavy level of support, the Department of Labour made payments to the company recently under the employment maintenance scheme.  I met some people connected with this firm in the recent past and I had a useful discussion with them.  Various other people connected with the firm have also been seen in my Department in the recent past.  My Department are both willing and anxious to assist in what way they can, as are the State agencies concerned.  The condition they have put forward is not unreasonable and is regarded as such by nearly everybody connected with this company.</P>
    <P>If the persons on whom compliance with that condition rests were able to see their way to comply with it I would be <Col N="314" /> reasonably optimistic about the future. Deputies were right when they said this is a potentially viable undertaking. Unhappily, the management it received in the past&mdash;I am not talking about the very recent past but in the less recent past&mdash;was such that it got into difficulties before.  With co-operation from all involved, which I hope will be forthcoming, it should be possible to overcome these difficulties now and to get what I agree is a potentially viable industry back into a reasonably strong position where its future and the future of its employees will be assured.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further I can say or I need say at the moment, except once again to express the hope that the co-operation which has been sought will be forthcoming.  If it is, in spite of the exceptionally heavy support they have already given, the State agencies in all the circumstances will not fail to give such further support as is necessary.</P>

    <P>(1)  The area on agricultural holdings is derived from the five-yearly Census of Agriculture conducted by the Central Statistics Office.  The latest census was undertaken in June 1975.  This area comprises all land forming part of agricultural holdings including any roads, farmyards, bog, marsh, rough grazing, woods etc. which may be on holdings.</P>
    <P>(2)  The area of State-owned forest properties, which was obtained from data published by the Forest and Wildlife Service of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, relates to the position at the end of each year.</P>
    <P>(3)  Other land is derived as a residual and is the difference between the total area of the State and the sum of the areas on holdings and on State-owned forest properties.  Further details of the use of this land are not available.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>The total number of persons registering as unemployed in County Meath in 1977 and 1978 were as follows: 29 December 1978, 1,065; 30 December 1977, 1,377.</P>
      <P>During the years 1977 and 1978 the Industrial Development Authority approved a total of 58 projects in County Meath for grant assistance which have a combined job potential in excess of 700 at full production.  The new IDA Industrial Plan, which will be published shortly, will contain targets for the creation of further jobs in the county in the period to 1982.</P>
      <P>The IDA will continue to actively promote County Meath for new industry and are prepared to assist, with their full range of incentives, any suitable industrial project proposed for location there.</P>
      <P>The authority own industrial land in Kells, Oldcastle, Trim and Ashbourne and has recently announced plans to build a 40,000 sq. ft. advance factory in Navan.  These developments will undoubtedly contribute to accelerated industrial development in the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a person is subject to the controls provided in the Aliens Act, 1935 and in the Aliens Orders, 1946 and 1975. Whether he or she is permitted to remain indefinitely here depends on the facts of the case.  Thus if the person is unable to maintain himself (herself) and his (her) spouse without taking up employment, a relevant consideration would be whether or not a permit authorising his (her) taking up a particular job had been granted by the Minister for Labour.  The sex of the person is a factor to the extent that in practice where such a couple have to support themselves by working it is the husband who is the breadwinner and to the extent that the law permits a woman who is married to an Irish citizen to acquire <Col N="204" /> Irish citizenship simply by registering with the Department of Justice. Where permission is granted for a short stay only, it may be possible to have the permission extended.</P>
      <P>The question of visas is really irrelevant since a visa relates to entry to the State as distinct from residence here. However, it may be of interest to know that the countries whose citizens do not require to have a visa before entering the State are listed in the sixth Schedule to the 1946 order as amended by the 1975 order.  A visa may be for a single journey or may authorise a number of journeys within a specified period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not made specific representations in this respect.  As I said in my reply to the Deputy's questions concerning related issues on 15 February 1979, there are limits to the extent to which a country such as ours can make effective representations to other countries with different social systems to our own and where Irish citizens are not involved.  However, the Deputy will be aware that Ireland, together with her partners in the Nine, is actively pursuing the process initiated at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe which, in my view, affords the most favourable opportunities for successfully influencing other countries in these matters.</P>
      <P>I fully share the Deputy's concern on the issues which he has raised and, in this regard I hope that all Governments will seek to realise the considerable potential afforded by the International Year of the Child for benefiting the economic, social and human conditions of the world's children and for positively reaffirming those fundamental rights and freedoms which every child, without exception, should enjoy.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 and 208 together.</P>
      <P>Contract documents for the Sligo and environs water supply and Ballymote sewerage schemes were received in my Department in June and August 1978 respectively.</P>
      <P>The local authority's proposals for these two schemes must be considered in the context of the overall amount of capital available for water and sewerage schemes and the number of such projects either in or getting to construction at the present time.  I cannot say at this stage when I will be in a position to approve the schemes, contract documents for which are under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>The question of finance for the schemes will not arise until they have been approved and tenders recommended for their construction.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the water supply to the areas in question is inadequate for the demand and that shortages have been experienced.  I have approved Waterford County Council's preliminary proposals and the preparation of contract documents for the augmentation of the supply.  The further planning of this scheme is now a matter for the local authority.  I understand that the local authority also propose to carry out improvements to the existing treatment works as part of their small schemes programme for 1979.</P>
