    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 32, to delete &ldquo;0.5&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;0.2&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to reduce the amount of the levy.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are related to one another.  They are both intended to reduce the levy by approximately half the amount specified in the legislation.  This amendment to reduce the levy in no way suggests that we agree with the principle of the levy.  In fact, we are resolutely opposed to the entire concept of raising money from the farming community in the form of taxation by levies on production.  We are against it because it discourages production. It is indiscriminate in that people pay those levies regardless of whether or not they have made a profit or whether or not they have an income sufficient to put them within the tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also oppose the concept of levies because there is no control over who will actually pay them in a given market situation.  In some circumstances, where supply exceeds demand, the farmer will certainly pay the levy.  In other circumstances, where demand exceeds supply, the tendency will be for the levy to be passed on to the person who has a greater demand than the supply is there to meet, that is the consumer.  In certain circumstances there is no doubt that this bovine disease levy will be paid by the consumer.  In other circumstances it will be paid by the farmer.  In all circumstances it will be paid by people without regard to their ability to pay.  In all circumstances it will be paid by people without regard to whether or not they <Col N="2151" /> have an income that would in normal circumstances put them within the income tax net.  This levy form of taxation is highly objectionable on all those grounds.  We do not in any sense accept the principle of those levies by putting in this amendment, which is merely intended to reduce them.  We will be opposing the principle of the levy when we come to the discussion on section 2.</P>
    <P>We are endeavouring, in introducing this amendment, to mitigate in some small way the obnoxious effect of the levies by reducing them by half.  Amendment No. 1 is intended to reduce the levy on milk from .5p per gallon to .2p per gallon and amendment No. 2 reduces the levy from £3 per head to £1.50 per head.  We have put down those amendments in the belief that we will at least reduce the obnoxious effect of what is a fundamentally objectionable form of taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. This year has been a particularly bad year for the small dairy farmer.  It is a well-known fact, particularly in my county, that a number of those small farmers are in debt to the co-ops.  They have not received any cheque in profit this year.  If they receive cheques they are told that they owe more money to the co-ops.  It has been a harsh, long winter.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider the position of those people who have not made any profit so far this year out of their dairy produce.  This can be verified by any of the Minister's officials if they contact the co-ops, particularly in Kerry.  I appeal to the Minister at this late stage, seeing that those farmers have not got one decent cheque yet, and they still owe money to the co-ops for meal and other products, because there was no grass due to the harsh winter, to help those people.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the position in Kerry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of these amendments is to reduce the rate of levies by half.  The rates as laid down in the Bill&mdash;0.5p per gallon on milk and £3 per animal slaughtered or <Col N="2152" /> exported&mdash;are expected to yield about £10 million in a full year towards disease eradication.  This is less than half the amount provided in this year's Estimate for the disease eradication scheme.</P>
      <P>Expenditure will be showing an upward trend for the next couple of years. This is because full compulsory measures for brucellosis eradication will be extended during that time in those counties not already within the full compulsory programme.  In the longer term, as the incidence of disease falls and fewer reactors have to be removed, the cost of eradication should stabilise and then start to go down.  However, that is a long way off at this stage.</P>
      <P>So long as total expenditure remains at its present level or higher, a contribution of £10 million per year from farmers is, in the view of the Government, a reasonable one.  The rates proposed in the amendments would cut the total contribution to less than £5 million and this would be a very minor contribution relative to the expected total cost in the next few years.  On that account I am afraid the amendments cannot be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In his contribution the Minister made no effort to justify the principle of the levy.  He referred to the cost of disease eradication.  We are all aware of the cost of disease eradication, as we are aware of the cost of the entire range of Government services which are being financed by various forms of taxation, but to say that it costs money to run the State's services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The principle of the levy is not involved in the amendment. The amendment deals with a reduction of the levy.  The Deputy will have an opportunity to deal with the principle on the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not endeavoured at any stage to justify the principle.  Having regard to the fact that this has been a very bad year for farmers, this is the wrong time to look for this money.  In fact, in the recent history of agriculture it is the most inappropriate time to impose the levy.  The confidence of people in the dairying and <Col N="2153" /> beef sectors has been severely shaken. The dairying section has been affected seriously by rapidly increasing costs combined with a price freeze.  There is considerable disquite among dairy farmers regarding the medium-term prospects for income for them in this area of production which is the only one in which small farmers can obtain a fulltime living.</P>
      <P>The same situation applies in the beef sector.  There has been a huge increase in costs and in interest rates.  It has been particularly hard on the beef section because of the high capital investment needed to carry a large number of cattle from the time they are bought to the time they are sold.</P>
      <P>A number of levies have been introduced at the same time when the confidence of farmers has been shaken.  The effect on investment will be severe because of this lack of confidence.  The Minister should give consideration to this amendment.</P>
      <P>Question: &ldquo;That the figures proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 36, to delete &ldquo;£3&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£1.50&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is intended to reduce the amount in respect of animals.  The arguments that I put forward on the previous amendment are of equal merit so far as this amendment is concerned. In the cattle industry there are serious fears in the minds of farmers whether the summer fattening of cattle will be profitable this year.  There is every reason to believe that farmers dealing in the bullock trade as distinct from the heifer trade will lose money this summer. It is very unfair that a person losing money should have to pay a levy on top of his loss.  The result will be that farmers will not invest for next year as much as we would like.  In turn, that will mean fewer cattle going to the factories to be killed with consequent redundancies in the meat processing industry. Even with existing levels of supply that <Col N="2154" /> industry is working with costly overheads.  Any reduction in the present level of supply resulting from a loss-making situation in the cattle industry brought about by direct Government action will lead to further redundancies in the meat industry.  If this happens the responsibility can be laid at the door of the Government because by the levies they are introducing they are sapping the confidence of farmers and they are reducing and even eliminating the profit that farmers are getting from cattle production, thus making it unprofitable to produce the raw materials necessary for meat processing.  As a result they are causing a decline in the industry and redundancies.</P>
    <P>The Government should consider this levy in that context.  If they do this they will see they are making a foolish decision from their own point of view and from the point of view of the country. They should not persist in using the levy system to raise revenue.  If they thought about it in the overall economic context they would see that levies are not the way to raise taxation.  They should find some other way that does not have the damaging effect of levies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Bruton on this issue.  As we said on Second Stage, the levy system is objectionable because it bears no relation to the income of the person to pay it.  Deputy Bruton has rightly made the case about the need for investment in agriculture. There is no doubt in my mind that the levy system has shaken the confidence of those in the agricultural community. The results of this system will be seen before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation regarding cattle is serious.  Most of the factories are operating at half capacity because they are not getting the supply of beef.  Since the levy system was talked about first in March last redundancies have been occurring in the factories.  To make matters worse this levy is only one of five.  It will hit the milk producers very hard.  The cattle producers have been in a non-profit making situation since March last because cattle that were bought in January and February, for grass in particular, were bought too dear.  The <Col N="2155" /> Minister may say that that was not his fault, but it is his job to ensure a steady flow of cattle to the factories and to have confidence in the beef side of the industry. The situation in regard to milk is every bit as serious.  After a very difficult winter and a late start to the summer as a result of the bad weather in April and part of May there will be a slight increase this year in production, but these levies will affect milk production in no small way in 1980.  Two very big factories that had been making arrangements for expansion have shelved these arrangements and do not intend acting further on them until such time as confidence is restored among the milk producers.  I would appeal to the Minister to give a sympathetic hearing to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Bruton and D'Arcy have highlighted the problems facing the farmers and the meat industry, but we must realise that if we do not eradicate disease the prospects for the meat industry will be much worse than anything visualised now.  Our meat would be suspect on the export market and could be excluded from that market, a thought too horrifying to contemplate.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, after line 5, to add a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) The amount of the levy prescribed by the Minister under subsection (2) of this section shall not exceed the amount necessary to pay for costs incurred and necessary to be incurred for the purpose of the eradication of bovine brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to impose an upper limit on this levy.  As proposed the levy would amount to approximately half the cost of disease eradication this year.  Therefore, this amendment would not be operable at this stage, but it is possible within the terms of the Bill for the Government to increase the levy by order to any amount <Col N="2156" /> they might wish.  Indeed, they could increase it to a figure far in excess of the amount necessary for the eradication of these two diseases.  For instance, in the event of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis being reduced and perhaps eradicated eventually, it would still be possible within the terms of the Bill to continue to charge the levy.  There is no limit on the amount that may be raised by way of this levy.  It is not related directly or otherwise to the amount actually being spent by the Government on disease eradication.  I am anticipating the Minister's reply to the effect that the levy may be used only for the purpose of animal disease eradication but there is no such provision in the Bill.  There is nothing in the Bill that would prevent the levy being used for other purposes or being increased to three or four times the amount necessary to finance disease eradication.  The Government like so much the concept of levies as a means of taxation that one might not be surprised if, later, they would use these levies as a means of raising even more taxation than is necessary for disease eradication. The attraction of the levy from the Government's point of view is that it is an easy tax to collect.  There is nothing in the Bill to protect the farmers and the rest of the community against the levy being increased to any figure the Government may wish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill envisages a farmer contribution for the purpose of facilitating the eradication, the prevention or the spread of bovine diseases. This provision is in the Long Title of the Bill.  &ldquo;Disease&rdquo; for this purpose is confined by definition to bovine TB and brucellosis.  Therefore, receipts from the levy must be used for the eradication of these two diseases.  To use the levy for any other purpose would be outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention is that farmers should contribute to the cost of disease eradication, that they should pay a certain proportion of the cost but the Deputy's amendment would suggest clearly that the total cost of eradication could be met from the levy payment.  The amount of the expenditure on disease eradication will always appear in the annual estimates <Col N="2157" /> as will appear also the expected receipts from the levy, so that the relationship between the two will be there for all to see.  It would be immediately evident if the receipts were even approaching, not to mention exceeding, the total expenditure.  For these reasons I consider the amendment to be unnecessary and, consequently, I cannot accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that disease is defined as bovine TB and brucellosis but there is nothing in section 2, which relates to the amount of the levy, to the effect that the levy may not be in excess of the amount being spent on disease eradication.  If there were such a limit envisaged it would be stipulated in section 2.  Consequently, I do not believe that there is any such safeguard as the Minister claims.  Could he refer me to any subsection in the Bill which provides for such a safeguard?  If the Minister says, as he does, that it is not intended that it would exceed that amount, I cannot see why he will not accept the amendment which would give statutory form to the word of honour he has given.  I cannot reconcile what the Minister is doing.  Either he does not intend to increase the levy beyond the amount necessary to finance disease eradication, in which case he should accept the amendment, or he does, in which case he should say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will accept that the possibility of the receipts from the levy exceeding the charge for disease eradication is highly unlikely and will remain so for a long time.  Over the years we have seen the high cost of disease eradication.  The amount taken in this levy is only a small proportion of the overall cost.  Expenditure on disease eradication will always be shown in the annual estimate, and also the receipts from the levy.  At that stage the relationship between the two will be there for everybody to see.  I do not think there is any need to go any further than we are going here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it is a small proportion of the total cost but I <Col N="2158" /> understand it is approximately 50 per cent of the total cost in one year.  I am subject to correction, but I think it is £22 million for disease eradication and the Minister expects to get between £10 million and £11 million from the levy. Therefore, it is wrong to say it is a small proportion of the cost.  One would expect that in a couple of years' time we will have a reducing cost instead of an increasing cost.  The Government have scaled down the level of compensation for reactors.  I would expect production to keep increasing, so the levy will increase while the compensation side is being scaled down.  Next year by order the Government could double this figure which would give them the entire cost of disease eradication.  The amendment will not do the Bill any harm.  It just gives a guarantee that, if there is money over, it will not be spent on some other enterprise.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's dilemma.  Obviously he has to consult the Minister for Agriculture before he accepts an amendment of this sort.  I accept his good faith and that he does not intend that the levy should be used to raise more money than is necessary for disease eradication.  I cannot see any reason why he should not accept the amendment if that is the case.  It does not preclude the Government from increasing the levy to any amount necessary to pay for disease eradication.  It just puts an upper limit on it and prevents the Government from using the levy as a device for raising general taxation.  It is a safeguard against increasing the levy to an unreasonable extent.</P>
      <P>If the Minister would guarantee that between now and Report Stage&mdash; presumably next Tuesday&mdash;he will consider this amendment, I would be prepared to accept that and to withdraw the amendment.  If he cannot give that guarantee we will have to press the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The receipts must be accounted for annually and the Oireachtas retains control and supervision at all times.  Any proposed increase in the levy is subject to the control of this House.  If at any time it is proposed to increase this levy the Minister will have to come back to the House.  That safeguard is there and I do not think there is any need to accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the receipts will be shown is no guarantee.  That is only information.  It is no guarantee that, if the amount of the levy is increased by 50 per cent next year and there is money left over from the disease eradication programme, it will not be spent on something else.  Surely the farmers are entitled to know that if they are being charged for a specific purpose that money will be spent for that purpose only.  That guarantee should be given in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, after line 5, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) The amount prescribed for the purposes of subsection (2) of this section shall not exceed 0.5 new pence per gallon in the case of milk and £3 per animal in the case of animals slaughtered or exported live.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a simple amendment.  It provides that the levy shall not be increased <Col N="2160" /> beyond the figures specified in the Bill.  It prevents the Minister from increasing the levy beyond the figures specified.  I fear, as I believe the farming community fear, that this levy is the thin end of the wedge and that it will be increased to any unlimited amount in subsequent years.  There must be a statutory guarantee against that happening.  This amendment gives that guarantee.  It provides that the levy shall not be increased beyond .5 new pence per gallon in the case of milk and £3 per animal in the case of animals without new legislation being enacted.  That is a necessary assurance to the farming community with regard to the Government's intentions, that they will not use this levy as a means of collecting general taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the levy is general taxation.  Heretofore this expenditure was met out of the national purse.  It has been described as the thin end of the wedge, but it is a fairly thick lump of the wedge because it goes 50 per cent of the distance.  We put down this amendment in the hope that it would stay at that figure.  I hope the disease eradication programme will make good progress and that the amount of money required will be reduced.  After all, £10 million is a sizeable sum.  We regard this amendment as a safeguard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be that no increase in the rates of levy above those now proposed could be made in the future except by way of a full amending Bill.  As the Bill stands, the Oireachtas is left in control of any future changes in the rates of levy.  This is so because any order to change the rates must be laid in draft form before each House of the Oireachtas and each House must then pass a positive motion approving of the draft before any such order can be put into effect.  That procedure is very specific and leaves the Oireachtas in full control.  It would not make sense in these circumstances that if at any time the rate of payments were to be increased the full panoply of an amending Act should be necessary.  For that reason I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 contains the principle of the levy and the provision whereby this levy may be increased to an unlimited figure by means of regulations. We in the Fine Gael Party object strongly to the principle of money, for disease eradication or any other such purpose, being raised by means of a levy on production.  This levy is a wrong form of taxation because it is unrelated to ability to pay.  It would be charged whether or not a person had a taxable income and whether or not the product being sold was one on which the seller had made a loss.  This levy is also potentially a consumer tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to answer this in a proper fashion.  As far as I am <Col N="2163" /> aware this question has not been answered properly by any Minister yet. In circumstances where the demand for meat exceeds supply this levy in common with other levies will be paid by the consumer.  In the case of meat the animals bought by butchers for the domestic trade are usually heifers and are smaller animals than those sold for slaughter for export, so that a butcher buying an animal for sale to the Irish consumer competes with the farmer buying similar animals for further fattening. A farmer buying an animal for further fattening does not have to pay the levy on that transaction but the butcher must pay the levy and pass it on to the farmer selling the animal.  Inevitably, the fattener has a market advantage over the butcher who in that situation has no option but to pay the going price dictated by the fattener.  In other words the butcher must bear the levy and must then pass it on to the consumer.  There is no way in which the Government can stop this happening because there is no retail price control on meat and no way in which the retail price can be controlled. It would be technically impossible because of the varieties of cuts and qualities that exist in the case of meat.  In the supply and demand situation in the market place because of the fact that a given animal can be used for further fattening or by butchers in the domestic meat trade, and the fact that the retail price cannot be controlled there is no way in which the Government can prevent the levy being passed to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Government or the Minister may attempt to argue that this can be prevented because the price for cattle generally is related to European prices, that Irish farmers cannot get any more than the general European price for animals, that in that situation any levy imposed here must be borne by the farmer, and that the Irish farmer cannot add to his price in order to compensate himself for the levy he has to pay.  That is not a valid argument because when we talk about meat for the domestic consumer we are talking about an intrinsically different commodity than meat for export, the type of meat determined <Col N="2164" /> by European prices.  The type of animal used in the domestic butchers trade is a smaller animal, usually a heifer, which itself is usually a smaller animal than a bullock, a different animal with a different system of pricing.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is a generalised system of pricing operating for bullocks at European level does not in any sense prevent this levy in relation to heifer meat, which is the type of meat used on the domestic market, being passed on to the Irish consumer.  The small heifer animal is used for the provision of meat on the domestic Irish market.  In a market where demand exceeds supply and where there is no control on retail prices there is no way any Government can prevent the levy being passed on to the consumer.  I would say further that, given the present situation in which supplies are falling and the number of cattle being slaughtered, generally speaking, is less than this time last year, inevitably demand exceeds supply.  I contend that this levy, immediately it takes effect in the market situation to be anticipated over the next four or five months, will be a consumer tax.</P>
    <P>At some future date, when supply exceeds demand, it will become a farmers' tax; but in the immediate future this bovine diseases levy will be paid by the consumer and it is very important to recognise that fact.  We are all perhaps in this discussion, as spokesmen on agriculture, tending to be concerned more with the problems of the farming community and losing sight of that fact. I assert that, in the market situation obtaining and liable to obtain at the time this levy takes effect, this levy will be paid by the consumer of Irish meat on the Irish market.  The Minister must either take steps to prevent that happening or admit that this is not a form of farmer taxation but will be a form of consumer taxation in the immediate future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The section we are discussing proposes to impose a levy on milk, on all cattle slaughtered in the country and on all live animals exported.  I shall not detain the House very long, but I want to make a point or two regarding <Col N="2165" /> the difficulties cattle exporters are experiencing in exporting their animals through some ports here.  The levy will be collected on all animals exported.  The purpose of the levy is said to be to pay for eradication of animal disease.  There is a feeling abroad that the Government are determined to kill the live cattle export trade.  I quite appreciate that it is in the national interest that a fair percentage of our animals be slaughtered at home and, as far as possible, processed at home in the interests of employment.  I think also, in the interest of the producers of animals and farmers in general, it is essential that the live trade be permitted to continue.  Otherwise these people will not get a fair price for their cattle.  The feeling is that the Government seem to be determined to kill the live cattle export trade.</P>
      <P>Some people are of the opinion that exporters are being harrassed at ports, such as the North Wall, when exporting cattle.  As we know there is a 30-day test, and I shall not go into the merits or demerits of that.  The point I want to make is I am told that when cattle are brought to the North Wall on the 29th or 30th day after the test, while still qualifying for export, through no fault of the exporters, a boat may not be going out for a day or two and those cattle are not permitted to be exported.  They have to be taken away and slaughtered at home at a loss or retained for another test.  That seems to me to be quite unreasonable because they are virtually in quarantine at the North Wall when they arrive there on the 29th or 30th day.  If a boat is held up for a day or two they should be allowed to be exported provided they arrive at the point of export within the specified time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there was a change of staff at the North Wall not so long ago, when the position seems to have become more difficult.  Veterinary surgeons certify animals for export or certify them as having passed the test on a form prescribed by the Department of Agriculture.  My information is that these forms ran out of print last year, when some inspectors accepted certificates on informal forms of the veterinary surgeons as evidence that the animals had passed the test.  After some <Col N="2166" /> time, notwithstanding the fact that these forms were not available to veterinary surgeons and had run out of print, the inspectors refused to accept a certificate on any other form.  That created great difficulty for exporters, veterinary surgeons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I could perhaps make these points on another Bill.  The levy is actually being collected for animal disease eradication and that it what I am talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): That is what the levy will be used for.  It was quite unreasonable not to accept these certificates on veterinary surgeons' printed notepaper when the other forms were out of stock. These informal forms are accepted in Northern Ireland but not here.  This unreasonable harassment of exporters is not justified.  The matter should be examined and a reasonable approach adopted.  I do not condone abuse of animal disease eradication, I am all for it, but it should be applied reasonably. The scheme should not be used for purposes for which it was never intended.  I think that has been done at the North Wall, certainly towards the end of last year and perhaps also into this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The one thing we should all realise when speaking on a Bill of this kind is that disease eradication is for the benefit of the farmers.  They are the people we are concerned with and are trying to help because the eradication of disease will guarantee the future development <Col N="2167" /> of the dairy and livestock industries. It is important that we do everything possible to come to grips with this problem which has been with us for so long and which has cost the taxpayer so much money already.</P>
      <P>I understand that competitive conditions normally apply in the meat industry. Where the bulk of our production is destined for export, the factory trade determines the market price.  The butcher already has specific overheads which determine costs and so on.  He will now have to include the levy which is a known and specific amount and will pitch his price on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Which price will he pitch on that basis?  The price he pays or the price at which he sells?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be allowed to make his case without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The levy will be included in the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing new for the butcher in this.  He will have to take the levy into consideration when he is buying the animal at the mart.  He already has overheads and he will add the levy at this stage and fix his price accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said there was a feeling abroad that the Government were determined to kill the live export trade.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Minister and I believe it is important that there be an element of competition there all the time.  The one thing that will kill our live export trade is disease. <Col N="2168" /> Time is running out on us.  If we do not come to grips with the problem of disease eradication we are putting the live export trade in serious danger.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer the point I made about this levy being passed on to the consumer.  He said it can be related by the butcher to the price.  One accepts that the butcher will ensure that he recoups the cost of the levy in the price, but will it be included in the price he pays or the price at which he sells?  It is easier for the butcher to include it in his selling price because he has complete control over that price.  He can mark up that price every day.  On the other hand if he goes into a mart he does not have control over the price he has to pay, which is determined by the going market price at that time.  He cannot say they are charging too much, that the price is too high and that he will not buy the meat.  He has to buy cattle or close his shop.  He has to pay the price in the mart.  His opportunities of passing the levy on in the mart are very limited, if they exist.  On the other hand, he has a free opportunity of passing it on in his shop because he marks up the prices but he does not determine the price in the mart.  Unless there is a grave situation where supply exceeds demand, this levy will be paid by the consumer.  This is a consumer tax and the Minister has not answered that case at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>We made this case on Second Stage and the Minister did not answer it then either.  The majority of butchers have land close to the towns in which they live and buy their cattle half fattened in the marts.  When they decide to slaughter and sell those cattle they are responsible for them.  They have to charge the levy to the consumer or else bear the cost of the levy themselves, which they will not do.  There is no such thing as charging the levy in the marts; it can only be charged at slaughter, either in the factories or on the butcher's premises.  When the butcher buys two, three or four heifers in the mart he will automatically include the levy in the price he charges his consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State stated that disease <Col N="2169" /> eradication benefits the farmers, and I want to add the nation, but in the process of eradication the Minister should not harass people to the degree that the industry will be damaged.  Since Deputy Gibbons became Minister for Agriculture many issues have been raised.  He is harassing the agricultural community to the extent that they are slowing up.  This is only one more nail in the farmers' coffin.  I object to the 30-day tests&mdash;I slightly disagree with Deputy Bruton on this issue&mdash;because if the tests had been for 60 days there might have been some hope&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The 30-day tests do not arise under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another levy on farmers, a further harassment by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have no intention of harassing the farmers.  It is in the farmers' and the national interests that we are doing this.  As I said before, it is important that we come to grips with disease eradication.  Farmers realise this and want a determined effort made on their behalf to get rid of this problem because if our meat trade is in danger the consequences will be too serious to contemplate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has completely ignored the point I made that this levy will be paid by the consumer.  It is only where supply greatly exceeds demand that it will not be paid by the consumer. Because the butcher can mark up the price in his own shop more easily than he can determine the price he pays in the mart, it will be easier for him to recoup the levy from the consumer than from the producer.  In the case of meat this levy will be a consumer tax.  The Minister of State, like the Minister, has ignored this case and refused to answer it.  Unless he does answer it the attention of the House should be drawn to the fact that the Minister has chosen to ignore the obvious case, that this levy in the case of meat is a consumer tax and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said that this is not a consumer tax, and a situation <Col N="2170" /> where demand exceeds supply is the exception.  The reverse position is more normal.  There is no reason for Deputy Bruton to say I did not answer his point. I have said already that what determines the price a butcher pays is competition with other butchers, overheads to be met and costs generally.  The butcher knows beforehand what these are and they will now include the levy which is a known and specific amount and he will fix his prices on that basis.  There is no question of passing this on as a consumer tax. The butcher will have to take it into consideration when he is purchasing the animals.  That is the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, it is not the answer.  The butchers themselves have said quite clearly, through their representative body, that it will be a consumer tax.  If the Minister wants any better authority than the butchers themselves through their representative organisation, he will not find it.  They have said that this levy will be paid by the consumer and not by the producer. Who is in a better position to tell the truth about this issue than the butchers?</P>
      <P>Question put and declared carried.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 11 and 12, to delete &ldquo;in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 says that the exportation live from the State of an animal shall be prohibited unless, before exportation and subject to such conditions as the Revenue Commissioners may impose, the amount of the levy is paid to the Revenue Commissioners or such security as is, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, adequate for its payment is given to the Revenue Commissioners.  We want to delete the freedom that the Revenue Commissioners have to determine what is adequate security.  This should be determined statutorily.  The Revenue Commissioners should not have the freedom to determine any old security they like that an exporter would be required to <Col N="2171" /> give in respect of, for instance, a small consignment.  The determination of what is reasonable security should be based on an objective and impartial test laid down in law rather than on merely the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners who could conceivably require an unreasonable security.  In the terms of section 3 there is nothing to stop them requiring an unreasonable security.  The deletion of the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo; leaves the Bill to read, &ldquo;such security as is adequate for its payment is given&rdquo;.  That is an adequate safeguard.  There is no need to give the Revenue Commissioners the freedom which this section appears to give them to set any security they like, even when it is more than adequate to secure that in the case of an animal exported before payment of the levy the levy will in fact be paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>To delete the phrase as suggested in amendment No. 5 would still make it necessary for somebody to decide what security is or might be adequate. The only body who can effectively so decide are the revenue authority.  It cannot be maintained that the exporter, for example, should himself decide what is adequate nor, indeed, would it be proper that the Minister for Agriculture or his Department should get involved in an area which is proper exclusively to the Revenue Commissioners.  The commissioners operate their controls already in relation to MCAs and any other export charges that arise and they have the experience and knowledge to decide what security is reasonable.  It is only right that they would have a say in this area also.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 20 and 21, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(c)  The Revenue Commissioners shall not unreasonably refuse to accept security for the payment of the levy proffered in accordance <Col N="2172" /> with paragraph (a) of this subsection.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I concede the point made by the Minister in respect of the last amendment. Probably I was trying in two ways to achieve the same objective which was to prevent the Revenue Commissioners from acting unreasonably in refusing to accept security.  Perhaps the method contained in amendment No. 5 was not the best way because somebody certainly has to determine the matter.  However, there is a strong case to be made for amendment No. 6 which provides that where the Revenue Commissioners do refuse security offered they shall not do so unreasonably.  This does not say that they do not determine it but in determining it they must act reasonably.  That is a fair compromise.  The Minister in an amendment which he has introduced to section 6 and which has just been circulated accepts that in the case of a notice of inspection being issued it shall be issued only on reasonable grounds. Equally in the case of security not being accepted the Minister can see the principle of allowing the Revenue Commissioners to determine the matter but saying statutorily that they must act reasonably.  If the Chair will forgive my repetition, this is a reasonable proposition and I ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 6.  It does not affect the Bill appreciably in its enforcement.  It is a useful protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no need for the amendment.  The Revenue Commissioners have long experience of handling situations where export charges arise and to my knowledge there has been no suggestion that they acted in an unreasonable way.  They must decide in individual cases, on the basis of their knowledge and experience, what is reasonable or unreasonable.  If Deputies have any concrete reason for being uneasy on the basis of specific cases about the situation I will undertake to convey their views to the proper quarter.  In practice the exporter has two options. Either he pays the appropriate amount of levy in cash or he proffers security. Both are covered legally in the Bill.  I believe we can rely on the Revenue <Col N="2173" /> Commissioners to apply the terms of the Bill in a responsible and reasonable manner. For that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  The original test would allow the Minister to prescribe the manner in which returns would be submitted.  In this context &ldquo;manner&rdquo; would cover only such things as the person who should sign the returns and the way they should be sent, whether by post or otherwise.  It is necessary to lay down also the contents of the returns, in other words, the form in which they should be made up.  This would include in particular the quantities of milk received and the number of animals slaughtered.  The returns required will be kept extremely simple and in the vast majority of cases will be the same as returns made for other purposes.</P>

I note that the levy period is <Col N="2175" /> one month&mdash;in other words, that payments of the levy will have to be made every month and there will be 12 payments in the year.  Would it not be better to allow the levy period to be, say, three months because this would reduce the amount of paper work necessary by accountable persons?  While they would have to keep records of all transactions, they would have to make returns only every three months.  We would all like to reduce the amount of paper work, particularly for unpaid tax collectors such as the butchers and processors will become under this Bill.</P>

Will the money still be paid to the Minister?  If so, for what purpose will it be used?  Will it be used solely for disease eradication or will it be regarded as an overall saving on all agricultural services?  My experience is that where there have been savings they are not retained for the same purpose but are used for a general balancing of accounts over the entire Vote for the Department.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;(1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in any order made under the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Acts, 1936 to 1967, any milk pasteuriser or milk bottler shall be entitled to withhold from the amount to be paid by him to the seller of milk in respect of which levy is payable a sum equal to the amount of levy.</P>
      <P>(2)  The amount paid to a seller after the withholding of levy under this section shall be a good discharge of the amount due to him.</P>
      <P>(3)  Any sum which a person is entitled to withhold from a seller under this section may be recovered as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This new section is necessary because of the position governing milk prices in the Dublin and Cork Milk Board areas.  In these areas the minimum prices payable to producers of milk for liquid consumption are fixed by orders made under the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act.  Because of this it is necessary to provide that pasteurisers and others buying milk from producers will be able to withhold the amount of the levy without conflicting with the minimum prices laid down.  Subsection (1) of the new section provides for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second subsection is a consequence of subsection (1).  It provides that, where a purchaser of milk&mdash;for example, a pasteuriser&mdash;withholds the <Col N="2177" /> levy, the amount paid by him to the producer after withholding it will be a valid discharge of his debt to the producer.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) is designed to meet particular situations.  One might be where the producer owes more money to the pasteuriser than is owed to him.  He might, for example, have bought materials or equipment in excess of the value of his milk or the pasteuriser might have forgotten to withhold the levy.  In such cases it is right that there should be provision for recovery of the levy from the producer.</P>

I could envisage a case such as this arising in the manufacturing area but not in the liquid milk area.  In the former case the farmers are attached to co-ops.  I could not envisage such a case arising in regard to liquid milk sales either in Dublin or Cork. Does the section apply only to liquid milk?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 5, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;There shall be established a fund to be known as the Disease Eradication Fund.  The expenditure of all moneys in the fund shall be as authorised by the trustees of the fund for the purpose of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and bovine brucellosis and for no other purpose. The trustees of the fund shall be appointed by the Minister on the following basis:</P>
      <P>(a)  two persons appointed by the Minister one of whom shall be an officer of the Minister;</P>
      <P>(b)  three persons who shall represent the producers of bovine animals shall be appointed by the Minister on the nomination of such organisations as the Minister considers to be representative of such producers and</P>
      <P>(c)  one person who shall represent the members of the veterinary profession on the nomination of such organisation as the Minister considers to be representative of such profession.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of these two amendments is to set up a fund to be known as the Disease Eradication Fund to be managed by a group of trustees&mdash;three <Col N="2179" /> farmers, one veterinary surgeon and two nominated by the Minister, one of whom shall be an officer of the Minister.  We want to make sure that this money is only used for disease eradication and that the farmers, who will be paying this money in all cases except in certain circumstances which I have outlined&mdash;meat on the domestic market, where it is a consumer tax&mdash;will have a say in the way it is used.  By setting up this Disease Eradication Fund with strong farmer representation in the control of it&mdash;three out of the six people on the board of trustees will be farmers&mdash;the farmers will have a direct say in how the money collected from them is used.</P>
    <P>This money can only be used for disease eradication, so there is no question of the Minister saying that once the farmers got control of it they would use it for some unrelated purposes.  If the Government are sincere in saying that this is for disease eradication only and that the farmers see the need for disease eradication, they should be prepared to accept this amendment which makes sure that it is paid into a fund for disease eradication, used only for that purpose and that the farmers have a say in the way it is used.</P>

It is a very reasonable request asking that this board be set up to supervise the spending of this money.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposed by the Deputies would place control of expenditure on disease eradication in the hands of a body of trustees over whom there would in effect be no control, legislative or otherwise. This body of trustees would be left in a position where they could frustrate the working of the eradication programme. They could decide not to provide the funds for necessary activities or decide to use them on areas of lesser priority or spend them in a wasteful manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disease eradication is a national problem.  There are clear and cogent reasons why it has to be controlled by the Government of the day.  Apart from the use of State funds involved there must be uniformity of operation.  There must be official control of procedures and tests.  Nowadays there are also, in the context of the EEC as well as in terms of trading requirements, international obligations to be discharged. The overall policy must rest with the Government.  The State must have control of the funds involved and must be answerable to the Oireachtas for use of the funds in a proper way.  Receipts and expenditure are voted annually.  It will be <Col N="2181" /> clearly evident at all times what is being spent, what is being received from levies and whether those receipts are being used to defray the cost of eradication. The Animal Health Council already advise the Minister on disease eradication and the council have a strong representation of farming interests as well as the veterinary profession.  In the light of those considerations I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's concern about responsibility to the Oireachtas on the part of the trustees of the Disease Eradication Fund could be easily met by putting in certain requirements, one of which would be to have the accounts passed through the Comptroller and Auditor General and a copy of them laid before the House.  I have no objection to that addition being made to the amendment if the Minister is worried about accountability to the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister felt that the fund would not be used in the best way possible.  He seemed to presume that he as Minister would at all times know what the best way was but I do not believe that follows. There is no reason to believe that the Minister for Agriculture is the only man who knows what is right.  The fact that there is a body with control of money, consisting of three farmers, two persons appointed by the Minister and one veterinary surgeon, is indicative that those people will know what is necessary. They will also have an interest in disease eradication.  Those people will be joined with the Minister in the fight against disease eradication and the farmers through this fund will have a say in the way disease eradication is carried out.  This would ensure that the Minister would have access to a wider range of advice than he now has on a continuing basis.  That advice would carry real weight because the people giving it control some of the money.  The farmers, because they were paying a levy being administered by their own representatives, would have a much greater commitment to disease eradication than they have at the moment, where the levy is simply being taken from them by the Government and spent as the Government think fit, and not as farmers or <Col N="2182" /> anybody representing them think it should be spent.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the best way to get farmer confidence in disease eradication is to take money from them and tell them that they do not know how it should be spent but that the Government know how it should be spent.  The Government are then telling them that they will spend the money as they think fit.  That requires a degree of confidence on the part of farmers in the Minister for Agriculture which I do not think they can be expected to have any time no matter who is Minister.  I believe that the involvement of farmers, through the Disease Eradication Fund proposed in this amendment, in the spending of the money would be a good thing and would contribute to disease eradication.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister should reconsider his attitude on this matter. Therefore, I propose to withdraw the amendment with a view to reintroducing it on Report Stage where I can meet any of the difficulties the Minister mentioned about accountability to the Oireachtas. Having consulted with the Minister for Agriculture and his officials, I hope the Minister of State will be in a position to accept this amendment or, alternatively, that he will introduce another one along the same lines.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 20, to delete &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;other adequate and reasonable veterinary grounds&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the amendment in the name of the Minister.  It shows that in some way he accepts the case we were making <Col N="2183" /> in our amendment.  Basically what we are talking about here is a notice of infection. The position is that where as a result of a test or otherwise an inspector believes a herd to be infected he may issue a notice of infection which can subsequently, by virtue of the provisions in section 8, lead to a reduction in the price for milk.</P>
    <P>We object strongly to the idea that the price for milk should be reduced by an arbitrary act of the Minister for a particular producer just because his herd is infected without regard to the fact as to whether the herd became infected through his fault or through no fault of his.  It is quite possible that a herd can become infected for reasons totally outside the control of the farmer but once a notice of infection is issued under section 6 the price may be reduced without regard as to whether the farmer was at fault.  I understand that the notice of infection is related solely to section 8.</P>
    <P>We object to section 6 strongly on the grounds of its connection with section 8 but we object doubly to it where it is possible for a notice of infection to be issued as a result of a test or otherwise. Obviously a test is objective and if an animal fails the test that is that. However, where an inspector, for reasons other than the result of the test, can decide to issue a notice of infection there is the possibility of such notice being issued in a discriminatory and unfair fashion resulting in the reduction in the milk price without any relationship to any objective test as to whether disease even exists in the herd.  We want to say that where as a result of a test or other adequate and reasonable veterinary grounds&mdash;they would have to be veterinary grounds related to specific evidence that infection existed&mdash;the notice of infection could be issued.  We are trying to improve the legislation even though we object to the principle.</P>
    <P>I believe our amendment is a better one because it restricts the circumstances in which an inspector may issue a notice of infection which will have the consequences of a price reduction either to the results of tests or other adequate and reasonable veterinary grounds.  The Minister's amendment is welcome so far <Col N="2184" /> as it goes but it merely refers to &ldquo;other reasonable grounds&rdquo;.  They could be reasonable grounds but unrelated to the veterinary situation.  They could be related to something entirely different. As the notice of infection relates to infection with a veterinary disease, it should be issued only on veterinary grounds and it should not be open to an inspector to issue a notice on grounds other than veterinary grounds.  We abhor the principle contained in section 8 because it is unrelated to whether disease arose through the fault or not through the fault of the herdowner but we believe our amendment is better than the Minister's amendment because it is more to the point.</P>

      <P>We discussed this on Second Stage.  An inspector from the Department may not be qualified to say whether a herd is infected but a veterinary surgeon is so qualified.  While we welcome the insertion of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; in the Minister's amendment, it is not sufficient so far as identification of the disease is concerned. Section 8 provides that there will be a significant reduction in milk prices in respect of a diseased herd.  The Minister should not accept the situation where an unqualified person is allowed to say that a herd is infected.  It should be a veterinary officer from his own Department or an ordinary veterinary surgeon who carries out tests every day.  We cannot accept that an unqualified officer should make such decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the intention behind the amendment. There is nothing sinister about the phrase &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;.  It is used in other legislation relating to disease and it can be seen that in some cases it would be necessary to have authority to act without waiting for a test.  An example would be where TB lesions are found in a carcase and it would be necessary to <Col N="2185" /> restrict the herd from which the animal came.</P>
      <P>Where a veterinary surgeon finds an abortion, in the interests of containing disease he would want to restrict the herd pending the result of a test to confirm whether there was brucellosis in the herd.  The word &ldquo;inspector&rdquo; in this context means a veterinary inspector of the Department and, therefore, there would be veterinary grounds for any action taken.</P>
      <P>The section involved refers to serving a notice requiring the price of milk to be reduced.  I accept that there should be reasonable grounds present before the notice is served.  The Deputy's amendment would still mean that somebody somewhere would have to decide on what was adequate and reasonable on veterinary grounds.  The only person who can decide this is the veterinary inspector and he, in accordance with amendment 12a, would have to act reasonably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not really met the case.  The fact that a man is a veterinary surgeon and is acting reasonably does not mean necessarily that he is acting solely on veterinary grounds.  He could be acting reasonably on other grounds.  The issue of a notice of inspection should be confined to adequate veterinary grounds.  It is better to use the words &ldquo;on veterinary grounds&rdquo; from the point of view of legal interpretation because the interpretation of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in law is loose and vague and can encompass all sorts of circumstances that are unforeseen.  Therefore, the Minister's amendment would not provide the kind of protection that is needed.  It would lead to interminable argument in court as to whether any notice was reasonable or was issued reasonably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister studied the legal interpretation of &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo; he would realise that it is not something that is precise.  Our amendment is precise in confining the matter to reasonable veterinary grounds.  This would be much more easily tested in court.  It is much more definite.  I know that it is the intention of the Minister that notices of inspection be issued only <Col N="2186" /> on veterinary grounds but our amendment would be more in line with that intention.</P>

      <P>In response to Deputy D'Arcy, the Minister adduced an argument that the inspector would always be a veterinary inspector but in the definition section we read that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;inspector&rdquo; means an officer of the Minister appointed under section 13 (1) of this Act to be an inspector for the purposes of this Act.</P>
      <P>There is nothing either in section 1 or in section 13 to the effect that the inspector must be a veterinary inspector.  Therefore, it is possible that the Minister could appoint people under this section who are not veterinary inspectors and these people could issue certificates on any grounds that seemed reasonable to them. By reason of their not being veterinary surgeons what might seem reasonable to them might be unreasonable to veterinary surgeons or to anybody else. Our amendment proposes a better way of achieving what the Minister is trying to provide for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 7, after line 16, to add a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) the rate per gallon prescribed in accordance with the terms of paragraph (a) of this section shall not exceed a rate equivalent to one penny per gallon unless the order prescribing the rate per gallon has been laid in draft before each House of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving of the terms of the order passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment places a limit on the amount of the reduction in milk prices which may be brought about by the Minister in the case of a herd which is infected. We made two basic objections to the provision in this Bill for a reduction in milk prices in the case of an infected herd.  One is that there is no limit whatever on the amount of the reduction in price which could be brought about by the Minister.  It could be an excessive and oppressive amount.  This amendment is intended to place a limit of 1p per gallon, which some would argue is too much, on the reduction which the Minister can bring about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this amendment does not meet our major objection to the provision <Col N="2190" /> in section 8 which is that a reduction in milk prices can be brought about where infection exists, regardless of whether that infection was in any sense the fault of the farmer who will suffer by it.  A farmer whose herd is infected with brucellosis will suffer anyway in that he will lose income if reactors are slaughtered and, if he is a dairy man, he could be out of production for quite some time.  To load on top of that man a reduction in his price as well is piling on hardship where it is not really necessary and where there does not seem to be any great purpose being served by so doing.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that in moving amendment No. 14 we are not in any sense meeting our major objection.  We are merely meeting our lesser objection which is that there is no limit whatever to the amount of the reduction.  We will be coming back in the discussion on the section to the more general objections to the whole principle of the thing.  A limit should be placed on what the Minister can do in terms of a reduction in milk prices.  The Minister should avail of this opportunity to state clearly what his intentions are in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that section 8 is very objectionable, and so do the farmers.  I should like to bring to the Minister's attention a paragraph from the speech by the Minister introducing the Bill on Second Stage.  He said:</P>
      <P>A significant reduction in the price of milk supplied from herds with either TB or brucellosis infection could also prove to be a most effective way of bringing home to the herd owners concerned that we cannot afford to tolerate continuing delay in getting rid of these diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take strong exception to the words &ldquo;significant reduction&rdquo;.  I also take strong objection to the fact that at no time during the Second Reading debate could we extract from the Minister one word about his actual intentions in section 8 or what he meant by a significant reduction.  Neither would he tell us at whose discretion a significant reduction could be brought about.  These are very important issues to farmers.  No doubt the Minister is aware of the number of <Col N="2191" /> innocent victims there could be as a result of section 8.  He knows how highly contagious brucellosis is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment because it would be undesirable to set any limit to the amount of the price differential to be prescribed initially.  In the first place, this would suggest that any such amount stated specifically in the Bill would be introduced right away.  It must be repeated that the provisions in the Bill are purely of an enabling nature.</P>
      <P>In the course of the Second Stage of the Bill, Deputies opposite mentioned alarming possibilities.  A differential of 5p per gallon was mentioned, and even more alarming possibilities.  I am sure they were not intended to alarm the producers, but they could have that effect. There is no intention on the Minister's part to bring in a price differential without full consultations with all concerned as to the appropriate extent and timing of it.  Secondly, if the limit of 1p per gallon were to be written into the Bill, it could create problems for creameries who may be already operating price differentials higher than that under voluntary arrangements of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that does not follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Conferring a status on the 1p figure would leave them open to pressures to conform and to limit their systems to that amount.  Thirdly, it must be asked if a sum of 1p would be a sufficient amount to make the producer who is dilatory about getting rid of disease get down to the job of clearing up <Col N="2192" /> his problem.  It is very doubtful that it would.  Finally, the Bill already provides that any order prescribing the amount of a milk price reduction must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and can be annulled in the usual manner. This is the normal, over-riding authority given to the Houses of the Oireachtas. What is involved here is different from what is involved in relation to the levy. In the latter case provision is being made for payment of moneys to the Exchequer, but this does not apply at all in relation to the milk price differential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned alarming statements.  I say quite seriously that there is nothing more alarming to the farming community than what he has just said.  He has clearly indicated that he is not prepared to accept this limit of 1p.  His failure to accept the limit of 1p suggests to me that he intends to impose a reduction in milk prices much larger than 1p.  It is wrong of the Minister to try to take the power to reduce the price by more than 1p without saying by how much he intends to reduce it or in what circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister is taking unreasonable power in not giving us any information on how he intends to use this power. Since the Minister refuses to accept our amendment, which would limit him to one penny, it is clear that he must intend to reduce it by more than one penny. The Minister seemed to imply that this would interfere with the voluntary arrangements between the creameries and the suppliers.  It would not interfere with those arrangements because we are talking about statutory reductions in price introduced by the Minister and not by individual creameries.  The Minister in introducing that argument introduced no argument at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister raised the possibility that one penny would not be sufficient. In what circumstances would one penny not be sufficient and what would be sufficient as a penalty on producers who have been dilatory in dealing with disease eradication?  I would remind the Minister that this levy, if introduced, will be indiscriminate.  It will apply to all farmers whose herds are infected whether or not they were dilatory or <Col N="2193" /> whether or not they made every possible effort to eradicate disease.  Once a notice of infection has been issued they will suffer the reduction in price whether they were dilatory or not.  There is no discrimination in the section between one category of farmer and another.  It is clearly the intention that the same reduction in price will apply to all infected herds.  It is possible for disease to spread from one herd to another even if the farmer has made every possible effort to eradicate disease from his herd.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that in the event of the Minister indiscriminately introducing a statutory enforced reduction in price, it can be annulled.  If it can be annulled why did the Minister not say that it must in the first place be approved by the Dail?  It is possible that a greater reduction in income will be brought about by this power in the case of dairy producers than would have been brought about by the levy.  If the increases in the levy have to be approved by this House in the form of a new order introduced and approved here, why is the Minister not prepared to ensure that any reductions in milk prices introduced under the powers of section 8 also go through the same procedure?</P>
    <P>I would make it clear to the farming community that the fact that the Minister has refused to accept our amendment, which would limit the reduction in milk prices to one penny per gallon, is evidence, in the absence of his giving any indications as to what he intends to do, that the reduction will be in excess of one penny although we do not know by how much per gallon.  The Minister's attitude is highly regrettable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Wexford representative I must resist section 8 to the bitter end.  The Minister's line of argument on this issue has no foundation.  The only thing this enables the Minister to do is to reduce the price of milk by approximately 2 per cent.  What does that amount to in relation to profit?  That is what is important to the farmer.  This will only enable the Minister to guarantee that he can put the farmers out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's argument that it would upset the price differential now operated by the creameries is not valid because it <Col N="2194" /> will not interfere with that at all.  I regret that this power has been given to the Minister, who has not informed us how it will operate and who will have the discretion to operate it.  We asked about that on Second Stage and the Minister chose to ignore it.  We accept that the Minister of State has not the full authority on this issue but I would ask the Minister what 1p per gallon represents in relation to the profit on milk production today?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the arguments put forward by Deputies Bruton and D'Arcy.  If we were to accept their arguments we would go ahead with the imposition of this stated price reduction without any consultation with the interests involved.  There is no intention on the Minister's part to bring in a price differential without full consultation with all those concerned as to its appropriate extent and timing.  If the powers are availed of at all, any price reduction will have to take account of the views of the industry.  We know that milk is already coming under question in the EEC and milk from diseased herds may eventually be excluded from the market altogether. A price reduction might do something that will save some farmers from a worse fate.  It is not correct to say that all farmers will suffer, because those who achieve eradication and stay clear could eventually get price increases under this section.  I cannot accept what Deputies Bruton and D'Arcy are trying to imply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no foundation for what the Minister has said and his suggestion that this amendment in some way prevents the Minister from consulting with the farming community.  It does no such thing.  It merely says that in the event of the Minister introducing a reduction, to which we strongly object in the light of the lack of information from the Minister as to how it might be used, it should only be up to 1p and no more. That is not to say that the Minister should not consult with the farming community before he does it.  The Minister should not introduce that dishonest argument which has no relation to the case we are making.  The Minister <Col N="2195" /> has not given us any indication as to how he intends using this or how much of a levy he intends.  He is taking power to do something without giving the House&mdash;it is the House which ultimately suffers in these matters&mdash;information as to how he intends to use the powers he is seeking.  That is objectionable.</P>
      <P>Our amendment does not go far enough, and it is my view that the section must be thrown out in its entirety because the Minister is looking for powers to reduce farmers' milk prices without any indication of the circumstances in which he intends to do that and without any regard as to whether a disease has arisen in a herd through the fault of a farmer or not.  There is no suggestion that, if a farmer makes every effort to prevent disease breaking out in his herd and, through no fault of his, disease breaks out, he will suffer any less than the farmer who allows disease to arise in his herd entirely through his negligence.  It is clear from the section that the farmer in whose herd a disease breaks out through no fault of his will pay just as much of a levy as the other farmer.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2) This section shall not come into effect until such time as an order to bring it into effect has been approved by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to prevent the powers contained in section 8 being used until such time as the Oireachtas had approved an order designed to bring them into effect.  The Minister has said that he is not prepared to disclose how he intends to use the powers he is taking under the section and that he must undertake consultations with the farming community first. If that is so he should accept our amendment, because it proposes that the powers will not take effect until such time as they are approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We want to delay the taking of such powers until a later date, by which time the Minister will have undertaken the consultations he has mentioned. Presumably, after those consultations the Minister will have agreed or disagreed with the farming organisations, but it will not be until that happens that he will be able to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas seeking the introduction of the powers contained in the section.  Our amendment is reasonable.  If the Minister is sincere in what he said about consulting with the farming community before he does anything under the section he will not be anxious to take such powers on until he has completed those consultations.

This Bill, having gone through the due legislative process, will be enacted in due course whether in its present form or amended.

In other words, certain sections would have to go through the legislative process twice.  Such a procedure would be entirely unacceptable.  If that procedure was accepted, even once, it would be a most unfortunate precedent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to direct the Minister's attention to section 25 which states:</P>
      <P>(2) This Act, other than sections 17, 21, 22, 23, 24 and this section shall come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed therefore by order or orders of the Minister, either generally or with reference to any particular such provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is already contained in the Bill that large parts of the Bill will not come into operation until the Minister makes an order bringing them into effect.  This amendment requires that in the case of section 8 the powers contained in it should be approved by the House.  There is nothing unusual about that, and our amendment is justified in view of the fact that the Minister has not given us an indication as to how the powers will be used.  He has not told us of the circumstances under which he will introduce the reduction in milk price or whether it will be introduced for all producers.  He has not given us any indication of the amount of the reduction.  It is unreasonable of the Minister to expect the House to give him powers to reduce milk prices to an unlimited extent without the House getting the information it requires. The amendment asks that the section shall not be operable until such time as another order is made here, by which time the Minister will know a little <Col N="2198" /> more about his intentions than he does now.  It is an eminently reasonable amendment which should be accepted.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I object strongly to section 8.  Our worst fears were realised here this morning&mdash;fair dues to the Minister; at least he stood up and gave us some indication of what was actually in the mind of the Minister for Agriculture when he spoke about a significant reduction in the price of milk supplied from herds with either tuberculosis or brucellosis and which could also prove to be the most effective way of bringing home to the herdowners concerned that we cannot afford to tolerate continued delay in the eradication of these diseases.</P>
      <P>We are all prepared to accept that it is vitally important to the nation that we get rid of both those diseases, but it is the manner in which the Minister has gone about their elimination to which we object.  The powers sought in this section must be described as beyond the thinking of any ordinary human being, particularly cow herdowners, in view of the fact that in this year the Minister has introduced already a string of levies.  The Minister also went to Brussels but brought back no increase in price while overheads are up approximately 14 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seeks powers in this Bill to have a significant reduction put into force, to be used as a penalty in a certain number of cases, if not in 99 per cent of them.  As far as brucellosis is concerned the people to whom this penalty may apply could be described as innocent victims.  The highly contagious disease of brucellosis can spread through an area <Col N="2199" /> like wildfire.  There may be one negligent farmer in a district whose herd can contaminate another ten or 20 herds.  The Minister and the Department know this. Yet he seeks powers under this Bill to penalise these people.  It is now quite clear since he will not accept our limit of 1p per gallon, that he intends penalising them severely.  One penny per gallon represents approximately 2 per cent of the gross price or 6 to 7 per cent of the actual profit on milk production.  Does the Minister realise that these types of penalties could put people out of business overnight?  Does he realise that a huge percentage of our cow herds already have brucellosis and that there is no problem identifying the disease? Does he realise further that brucellosis can hang around an area for up to three years before it can be eliminated under good, hygienic conditions?  These are all facts well known to the Minister.  If the Minister is thinking of anything over 1p a gallon, he should realise that he is then cutting into perhaps 10 per cent of the profit.  These penalties are unbelievable. It is incredible that some morning, if a farmer realises he has brucellosis in his herd which is identified by the Department of Agriculture, he must now pay these penalties.  There is one thing only for him to do: let the first loss be his worst and get out of his herd.  There is nothing else left to him to do because his profit has been so reduced in the past year.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attitude in ignoring the Second Reading speeches and warnings of the Opposition must be described as objectionable.  We could get no reaction from him on anything.  I am glad the Minister of State came in here this morning and gave us some indication&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of what is in the Minister's mind.  We and the farmers now have a rough idea of where we stand.  I have said that disease eradication must be a three-way process.  There are three sets of people involved&mdash;firstly, the farmers; secondly, the veterinary surgeons; and thirdly the Department.  It appears now that the people to be <Col N="2200" /> blamed for the spread of these diseases are the farmers.  I maintain that all three parties are equally to blame for failure to eradicate these diseases.  I could cite cases here, and some have been mentioned, in which the Department were at fault, others where the veterinary surgeons were at fault, and I am prepared to accept that the farmers can be at fault.  It appears now that the farmers are those who will be blamed and who will be made pay through the nose.</P>
      <P>What we have been unable to extract here this morning is at whose discretion these penalties will apply or at what level.  It appears that people with clear herds may have an advantage here, as was implied in the Minister's remarks earlier this morning.  It is unbelievable that such statements can be made.  I could be an innocent victim yet I will be penalised.  Let us suppose that Deputy Bruton is luckier, that there is no disease in his area; he will be paid at my expense. The Minister of State made that statement.  I presume the same is in the mind of the Minister, Deputy Gibbons. They are going to tackle the situation by turning on those unfortunate people &mdash;and anybody with disease in their herd is unfortunate and will have a massive loss as a result&mdash;penalising them, taking money from them, not to clear up the disease but to give it to the other fellow who is lucky enough to be free of it. If the Minister had stated that he would utilise that money to compensate a farmer who had the disease in his herd if he did certain things, or perhaps even to increase the efforts being made in the Department to eradicate the disease, I would understand.  But he did not; he is going to give the advantage to the other fellow lucky enough not to have the disease. These statements are unbelievable to people with large herds trying to maintain them in good condition.  They are unbelievable even to people who have the disease in their herds&mdash;that the thinking of the Department should be so warped in a direction that can do only maximum damage to the people who have the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Goodwill is a very important thing. What goodwill can the Department expect from people when they discover an official of the Department coming into <Col N="2201" /> their yard one morning saying: &ldquo;I have identified brucellosis in your herd.  You are paying for the eradication of the disease itself.  Under this Bill you are paying 50 per cent of the actual costs, but I must penalise you further.  We shall have to take X pence per gallon off your milk.&rdquo;  As everybody knows, brucellosis is not an easy disease to get rid of.  It is possible that such a farmer may have to face those penalties for up to three years no matter what precautions are taken.  If a farmer finds that, on the one hand, he must face penalties for three years and, on the other, pay for the eradication of the disease, he might as well opt for the first loss and get out of his herd altogether.</P>
    <P>I oppose this section as being indiscriminate in the first place, as was mentioned by Deputy Bruton, and as being very damaging.  It will certainly damage any remaining goodwill and will do very little to reduce the incidence of disease throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should add that we on this side of the House totally oppose this section in the absence of any indication from the Minister how he intends to use this power, in view of the fact that it is indiscriminate and that it will be applied to all farmers whether or not through their fault disease has broken out in their herds and in view of the fact that the reduction in price could be quite unreasonable in extent as evidenced by the fact that the Minister refused to accept an amendment which would have limited him to a reduction of 1p per gallon.  Has the Minister anything to say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already replied to most of the points raised by the Deputies and there is no point in dragging it out further.  No matter what reply I give, the Deputies opposite will oppose it.  The best way to decide this is through the lobbies.  It is because we realise the dangers to our national herds and the economy that we are introducing these measures.  Unpalatable though they may be, I am sure both Deputies will agree that it is better for the farming community and the industry that these measures be introduced rather than that they should have to face something <Col N="2202" /> worse in the future.  Time is running out on us and we have to take action to reduce the incidence of disease.  I am sure the Deputies understand the implications involved in this for all of us. Nobody understands that better than the farming community, even though I accept they possible do not want to pay additional levies for it.  In my opinion this is very necessary.  Nothing I can say will convince Opposition Deputies that these measures are the right ones.  I have nothing further to add.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be able to answer these three questions. Does he envisage that the reduction in price would be in excess of 1p per gallon? Will he confirm that the reductions will apply to all infected herds, regardless of whether the infection arose through the herdowners fault?  Will he indicate when he expects the reductions possible under section 8 to be introduced, this year or next year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give any undertaking as regards the limitation to 1p because I have already said this will be a subject of consultations between the Minister and the interested parties.  They will decide on the differential and the timing of its introduction.  As far as I am aware, this reduction in price will apply to all infected herds.</P>

This differential will be nothing new to many creameries because they are already operating it on a voluntary basis.  Perhaps the amount of differential operating there will be even greater that what the Minister is contemplating.  I cannot go further than that.</P>

      <P>Can I take it that the Minister will have certain proposals to put to the interested groups?  Is it possible they will have the discretion to <Col N="2204" /> decide how much the reduction will be? Is the Minister reserving the right to himself?  This is one thing he never told us.  Who will make that decision?  The consultations with interested groups seem to be occupying the Minister of State's mind, but how far will they be consultative?  Does the Minister accept that disease eradication is a three-way process&mdash;farmers, veterinary surgeons and the Department?</P>
      <P>It seems that all the blame is being laid at the farmers' door.  I am prepared to accept that 10 or 12 per cent of our farmers are not prepared to carry our the regulations laid down by the Department, but I do not accept that all the blame lies with the farmers.</P>
      <P>The differential operated by the creameries is based on bacteria count, nothing else.  It is up to every farmer to eliminate this, but it should not be confused with something over which the farmer has very little control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the farmers are to blame for this situation, and I do not think anybody said that. We all accept that there are farmers who are genuinely concerned about the eradication of these two dreadful diseases and who have been working very hard to ensure that their herds remain free from these diseases.  We all know some farmers and cattle dealers can be careless and because of their carelessness are a threat not alone to their own herds but to their neighbour's herds.  It is to those people that we want to bring home the seriousness of the situation.</P>
      <P>We are all talking about a differential, but it must be accepted that no decision has been taken to introduce a price differential at this stage, and we have no proposals to do that.  If discussions are to take place with the farming organisations, the co-operatives, or whoever is interested, they would have to be of a general nature.  Arising out of those discussions, the proper thing would be for the Minister to fix the differential, if there is a need for a differential at that stage.</P>

There are serious problems involved in the possible spread of disease to human beings through the consumption of unpasteurised milk from infected herds or in situations where the pasteurisation is not as effective as it should be.  I understand the process is not always fully efficient and nominally pasteurised milk will still retain traces of disease which could lead to humans being infected.  This section should require that this information be given not just to dairy produce manufacturers but to all consumers of unpasteurised milk from infected herds.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health will not be able to take action unless he has the information.  The only people who at present have this information are the herdowners and the inspectors of the Department of Agriculture who have issued notices of infection.  Clearly there should be a legal requirement on these people to inform any human being consuming milk from a diseased herd that they are at risk unless the milk has been pasteurised.  There is no better vehicle for ensuring this than this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Health have been seriously inactive in the matter of the spread of bovine disease to human beings. The Department of Agriculture have been active, but their brief is confined to dealing with disease in animals and officially they are not concerned with the consequences for humans. There has not been adequate liaison between the Department of Agriculture, <Col N="2209" /> the Department of Health and the health boards.  The section should be amended to require, at least, that this information be furnished to health boards as a matter of course.  It should also be required that information of the issue of a notice of infection be communicated to the health boards.</P>

      <P>The Minister says there are on going discussions.  As far back as 1972 reports were made to the Minister for Health on matters requiring action in this area and little or nothing has happened during the intervening period, during which two Governments have held office.  It is not a party matter.  I have not much confidence in the ongoing discussions to which the Minister referred.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that brucellosis in humans is an increasingly prevalent problem and tuberculosis is again on the increase, having been almost eliminated some years ago.  I am not a medical man but I have reason to believe that the increase in the incidence of tuberculosis in humans is not unrelated to the continued prevalence of the disease among animals and the fact that there are not adequate safeguards in relation to the possible spread of the disease from animals to humans.  I can see the Minister is not perhaps the man most concerned with this and that the Minister for Health is more concerned than he is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hoped the Minister would be a little bit stronger than saying that my observations would be conveyed to the responsible people when this discussion <Col N="2210" /> takes place.  I raised this matter on Second Stage and I hoped that as a result of doing so something more definite than what the Minister has referred to would by now have happened. This is not a party matter.  It is a very serious matter and I would like to see some definite action taken within a definite time to prevent the spread of brucellosis and TB from animals&mdash;this is endemic in many parts of the country&mdash;to human beings.  I hope the Minister will take an interest in this matter with a view to having something done about it.  If he does he will be doing a very good day's work.

      <P>This section empowers the Minister to obtain information with regard to land used for or in connection with the grazing or retention of animals. This is a general provision to enable information to be obtained about land used for grazing or retention of cattle. Where lands are let or rented it is often difficult to establish the identity of either the owner or the user of the lands not to speak of the ownership and health status of the cattle kept on the lands.  Difficulties in tracing the origin and ownership of animals can impede the operation of disease control measures. Existing legislation does not enable the relevant information to be got quickly. This provision is merely designed to fill that gap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why six years is stipulated in the Bill for the keeping of records is that that is the period provided for in the Companies Act 1963.  Section 147 of that Act relates to the retention of records.  It is obviously better to have a consistent approach to these matters and, in the circumstances, I feel it desirable to let the six years stand.  Obviously, even if it should be reduced below six years, this would not help those who have to comply with the Companies Act.  It is generally better that all concerned should be subject to the same regime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am worried about the requirement that every butcher, even a small butcher slaughtering perhaps one animal a week, will be required to keep records of every transaction he has entered into for six years afterwards so that the Department of Agriculture can be satisfied that he paid the full amount of the levy that was due by him on those animals.  I feel, for all reasonable purposes, that it is enough to require him to keep them for three years.  If the Department have not discovered something wrong in three years they will not discover it at all.  It is not reasonable to require him to keep a mass of records for six years.  The Minister referred to the Companies Act but most of those people that I am worried about having to keep records for six years will not be incorporated under the Companies Act.  It is all right to say that that applies to a big concern like a co-op but it does not apply to those people.  I consider that the three years is more reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 29, to delete &ldquo;he reasonably considers to be&rdquo; and substitue &ldquo;is&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This concerns the powers that inspectors are to have under the Bill to enter premises and search for documents at any time they like to see if the person concerned is charged the right amount of levy.  I believe that the powers of search being given here are far too wide. It says in the section that an inspector, for the purpose of making an inquiry which he reasonably considers to be necessary either in relation to liability to levy or an obligation to make reductions under section 8 of this Act, may enter premises at any reasonable time and so forth.  I believe it should not be up to the inspector to decide whether or not he can enter premises.  There should be an objective test as to whether or not it is reasonable for him to have entered a premises at a particular time.  I do not think it is enough that he should just think it is a good idea that he should be able to enter the premises.  We propose to delete the words &ldquo;he reasonably considers to be&rdquo; and leave it that any inspector may for the purpose of making an inquiry enter at any reasonable time any premises and so forth and not leave it up to him to decide whether or not it is reasonable for him to enter the premises. We want it to be that it must be reasonably necessary and not just a matter that he thinks it reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The section says that an inspector must have reasonable grounds for believing it to be necessary before he can enter premises.  He is precluded from acting unreasonably and any person who deems him to have acted in an unreasonable manner can have recourse to redress.  The amendment says that it must be established that it is necessary <Col N="2213" /> for the purposes of making an inquiry and so forth before the inspector may enter premises.</P>
      <P>There are two points about this.  The first is that the amendment would remove the constraint imposed by the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; in the text of the Bill. Secondly, if that were to be removed who then would decide that something is necessary?  The most likely person to do it in the normal course is the inspector on the spot anyway and he will always have to stand over his actions in the event of complaint.  The inspectors and authorised officers involved here, are, of course, officers of the Minister for Agriculture.  They have constant and, invariably, an extremely co-operative relationship with factories, creameries and other firms that they deal with regularly.  There has never been a suggestion that they act unreasonably.  For that reason, I must reject the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 39, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is to remove an anomaly which exists in the Bill whereby the search powers of inspectors seem to be capable of being used for almost any purpose. The section states that he may remove documents &ldquo;for such period as may be reasonable for their examination or for the purpose of any proceedings for the recovery of levy payable under or by virtue of this Act or for an offence under this Act&rdquo;.  It seems to me that it is possible to interpret this section as enabling an inspector to remove documents from a registered premises for any purpose, indeed for a purpose quite unrelated to the levy.  Will the Minister state if my understanding of the section is incorrect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would limit the facility to remove records for examination to cases where proceedings are being taken for recovery of levy. <Col N="2214" /> This does not make good sense.  It suggests that one will know beforehand that a decision to take proceedings will already be taken before the records are examined and this is not a practical proposition.  It is necessary to have the facility to examine records so that the statutory obligation to collect the full and proper amount can be discharged.  It is only as a result of routine examination that some question of non-payment or underpayment will arise.  Even in the majority of those cases it is most unlikely that any question of proceedings would ever arise, but clearly it can only be after the records are examined in detail that the question of proceedings can be even considered never mind actually decided upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection is to the possibility that they could be removed, at least in theory, for purposes quite unrelated even to liability for levy.  I can see the Minister's point that the records would have to be first examined before proceedings were undertaken.  If the Minister were to insert after &ldquo;examination&rdquo; in line 39 the following words, &ldquo;for their examination in relation to liability to levy or for the purpose of any proceedings for the recovery of levy&rdquo; it might make it clearer that the records are not to be removed for examination just for any purpose.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(5) No inspector may enter any premises unless he has been issued with a search warrant specifying the <Col N="2215" /> premises to be inspected and the purpose of the inspection by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners. Such warrant shall be introducted by the inspector to any person affected by it on request.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This requires that where an inspector is going to exercise these search powers he must have a search warrant specifying where he will inspect and it must be signed by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.  The search warrant must be produced.  At present, once a man is appointed an inspector, it seems under this Bill he will be entitled to go into any premises at any time without getting any specific warrant in relation to the premises he is entering.  If the Garda Siochana want to search in relation to a criminal offence they must get a specific warrant in relation to a premises, and they are pursuing potential criminals whereas in this case the people concerned are not criminals&mdash;in fact, they may have paid too much levy or not enough levy.  The Revenue Commissioners are being given powers to enter premises that the Garda Siochána do not have.  I should like to see the amendment accepted in order to restrain inspectors from going anywhere they like without getting specific clearance from the Revenue Commissioners that entering a particular premises is necessary.</P>

      <P>What we have here is retrospective legislation.  Subsection (1) reads that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2219" /> Anything done pursuant to an order made by the Minister in exercise of the powers conferred on him ... shall not be questioned in any legal proceedings on the grounds that there was not made by the Minister in relation to an area to which the order applies a declaration by him either declaring the area to be an attested area or declaring the area to be an attested or disease-free area.</P>
    <P>In a court case not very long ago there were challenged certain penalties sought to be imposed by the Minister on a herd owner.  The penalties were challenged on the grounds that the Minister had not made, in relation to a particular area, a declaration that he was required by law to make.  What the Minister is saying now in effect is, &ldquo;It does not matter.  I need not have made the order and any prosecution that I might like to bring about something that happened, though I had not made the order at the time and though legally at the time those offences were not capable of being prosecuted because the order had not been made, shall be capable of being prosecuted.&rdquo; now after the event I am saying that they shall be capable of being prosecuted.&rdquo; This is retroactive legislation.  It is rendering criminal after the event something which technically at least at the time was not a criminal offence because the order had not been made.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister referred to the section by saying that some vague doubts had been expressed about the validity of certain actions taken and that section 23 was designed to clear up those doubts.  However, the Minister did not specify what those doubts were and neither did he specify them when he was replying to the Bill though I had asked him specifically to state the grounds for introducing the section.  It is most unusual that retrospective legislation is introduced to render criminal something which at the time of the act was not technically criminal.  I trust that the Minister of State will be more frank than was his superior, that he will tell us why the section is necessary.  This is not the sort of legislation that should be brought before the House.  It indicates that there <Col N="2220" /> was bungling somewhere by somebody and that should not happen.</P>

These penalties were more severe than those prescribed for a first offence.  The penalties now provided for in section 22 of the Bill will apply in such cases.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 11, after line 39, to add a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 16 of this Act shall cease to have effect on such day as the Minister declares under section 19 (b) of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, that the entire area of the state is a disease free area in respect of the diseases of bovine brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that the levy shall no longer be collected or be capable of being collected once the two bovine diseases, TB and brucellosis have been eradicated and the Minister has made an order to that effect under section 19 (b) of the Diseases of Animals Act.  It would be completely unreasonable if it were possible, as it is now legally under the Bill, for the Minister to continue to collect this levy which is for the purpose of financing the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis if those two diseases had been eradicated.  I should like the Minister to accept this amendment. He seemed to imply that it is not intended to continue collecting it after the diseases have been eradicated.  If so, he should have no objection to accepting amendment No. 21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is based on a misleading assumption, namely, that State expenditure will cease whenever a declaration is made under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, that the country is a disease free area in respect of bovine TB and brucellosis. This would not be the case at all.  In fact, the country is already declared to be an <Col N="2223" /> attested or disease-free area.  That is the precise wording in the 1978 TB Order so far as bovine TB is concerned.  This does not mean we are absolutely and totally clear of bovine TB.  Far from it.  It means only that a particular stage has been reached in the progress towards its total eradication.  Of course, even long after it is possible to declare the country free of both diseases, which is still some time away, there will still have to be regular testing of the national herd and removal of reactors.  Care must be taken to ensure that any residue of disease does not get out of control and flare up again.  We know from past experience how easily that can happen.</P>
      <P>In Britain, for example, where the incidence of bovine TB is only a tiny fraction of ours, routine testing still goes on. Another aspect to be borne in mind is that in future we are almost certain to have to meet EEC standards of official freedom from disease, so that a purely domestic declaration will not carry a lot of weight.  I am afraid, therefore, the amendment is unrealistic and I must reject it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that even after the country has become officially disease-free expenditure will be necessary.  Will he give a guarantee that, in the event of the incidence falling significantly, and expenditure falling significantly and in real terms below its present level, the rate of the levy will be reduced in line with that reduced expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

I am not at liberty, for obvious reasons, to give details in respect of individual companies of what the precise percentage is but it is certainly above 80 per cent.

      <P>This allegation is fairly frequently made and has been looked into on several occasions by my Department. No evidence has been found to sustain it.  It may be that somebody could produce evidence that an individual filling station for some reason got more or less in a particular month, but taking one month with another there does not seem to be any evidence to support it.  I have looked at the figures for several years past and there is no evidence of undue growth in the through-put of company-owned stations as against independently-owned stations. There is some growth on both sides.  The number of company-owned stations has been decreasing in recent years and this is something I welcome.</P>

My present intention is to make the announcement about 28 or 29 July and to allow deliveries to commence on 1 August.  In the normal way I would not have wished deliveries to commence as quickly as I August, but, because of the logistics of the situation, it is necessary that they begin that early.

      <P>That seems to be a separate question, but the Deputy's speculation is not right.  There is not an inordinate amount.  Stocks of gas-diesel oil a week or two ago were about two-thirds of the corresponding figure for last year.  I do not have this week's figure yet but I believe it is a little higher.  The whole situation could be changed drastically in a matter of days by virtue of the fact that in the past 48 hours no oil products of any kind have come into Dublin port, the main port of entry.</P>

      <P>I have asked all Government Departments, State-sponsored bodies and local authorities to carry out energy saving programmes with a view to reducing oil consumption in accordance with the conclusions of the Council of the European Communities on 27 March 1979.</P>
      <P>The following are some of the measures which have been proposed or are being planned: limiting space heating to 18ºC, conservation in use of electricity, boiler servicing, proper maintenance and tuning of vehicles, Departments with large-vehicle fleets to switch to smaller vehicles, planning journeys for fleets of vehicles.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to estimate what reduction in oil consumption will result from these measures but I feel safe in saying that it will not be less than 5 per cent which is the target set by the Council.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Council decision stated that major energy reductions should be undertaken within the State sector in order not to impede economic growth?

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that is so.  Since the State is very much involved in the economy in many areas, I do not think it would work equitably that the State sector should reduce by a greater figure.  I would hope that all consumers could and would reduce their demand by 5 per cent.</P>

      <P>The first meeting of the inter-departmental committee referred to by the Deputy was held on 12 March 1979 and five meetings have been held to date.  The committee's broad terms of reference are to assess in detail all relevant aspects of the ESB's nuclear proposals.  These terms of reference would include assessment from the environmental, energy and financial viewpoints and investigation of energy demand forecasts and alternative means of meeting this demand.  I would hope to have the committee's report, which will be published, towards the end of this year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Nuclear Energy Board have advised me that the main source of radioactive liquid waste discharged into the Irish Sea is the fuel reprocessing plant at Windscale in Cumbria.  Other minor sources are the nuclear power stations on or near the UK's West coast&mdash;Wylfa (Anglesea), Hunterston (Ayrshire), Calder Hall (Windscale), Hinkley Point (Somerset), Oldbury (Somerset) and Berkeley (Gloucestershire),</P>
      <P>The different radioisotopes discharged decay at rates which vary from a few minutes to long periods of years.  To that extent the wastes are self-destructing.</P>
      <P>The Irish authorities are not informed in advance of or subsequent to the discharge of radioactive waste, nor are the British authorities.  This is because the discharge is normally continuous and under the UK licensing system the amount which may be discharged by each plant in a specified period of time is regulated.</P>
      <P>Radioactivity in the Irish Sea is closely monitored by the UK authorities and the Nuclear Energy Board.  The board have estimated that it is unlikely that anyone in Ireland could receive from that source a radiation exposure in excess of 1 per cent of the internationally recommended dose limits.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Minister for Education that his Department is considering the question of the feasibility of operating a form of flexible working hours for primary and national schools, though not exclusively in the context of energy saving.  I understand from the Minister for the Public Service that a flexible working hours system has been in operation for some time, on a pilot basis, in several Government Departments and Offices located throughout the country.  Negotiations are at present taking place with staff interests on the feasibility of introducing similar schemes in other Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board are completing a study of the likely demand pattern for electricity during the coming winter and I expect to receive their <Col N="2246" /> report shortly.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the peak demand each day normally occurs from 12 noon to 2 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. due, in the main, to increased domestic load. Although I would not wish to comment in any definitive way until the matter has been further studied in the light of the ESB's report, I think the suggestion that flexible working hours would have a major impact on peak demand is open to question.</P>

As I pointed out in reply to another question on 12 June 1979, amending legislation would be necessary if it were proposed to make any such alterations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When considering a price increase application from the Dublin Gas Company in April 1979 I took into account the poor profitability of the company and the fact that the company was being bolstered by the payment of an annual Exchequer subsidy in the region of £4.5 million.  I considered it to be fundamentally wrong that a company which, were it not for State assistance, would in effect be in a substantial loss-making situation should continue paying annual dividends to shareholders at the expense of the Exchequer subsidy, and therefore directed that no price increase could be granted until a commitment had been received by me from the board of the Dublin Gas Company not to distribute a final dividend for the financial year ended 31 December 1978.</P>
      <P>An interim dividend amounting to £87,000 had, in fact, already been paid by the company in September 1978.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is.  You cannot go around to every street in Dublin taking out £1 or £10.  Does the Minister not think that it is completely wrong that he should use the price mechanism in this way?  Is it fair that the shareholders in that company should be deprived of their dividends, which they are entitled to expect after investment, and that the company would not necessarily be in loss because of the State subsidy which is there for the consumers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that. The dividend is a small one.  The amount which each person would receive on average is very small.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the argument put forward is a circular one?  If the State intervenes to require that the price of gas be not increased and to subsidise it in order to keep the price down, to use that subsidy as an argument for depriving shareholders of their dividend is clearly unjust and the argument on which he has arrived at that is completely a circular one.</P>

      <P>The manufacturers' prices for the products mentioned by the Deputy, in so far as they are available for certain brands, are confidential to my Department as they are received in conjunction with price increase applications. Because of the number of different wholesalers and types of wholesale outlet through which these products might pass, and, in the case of the drink mixer and large size soft drink, the variety of brands available, it is not possible to give one specific wholesale delivered price for each of the products.</P>

    <P>I regret that in the time available it is not possible to give a definitive reply to these two questions.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the matters raised therein are receiving close attention and <Col N="2258" /> that inquiries will be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible.  Up to now I have assumed that responsibility for ensuring that houses have been properly wired would rest with those inspectors whose function it is to approve of the premises for the purposes of the Housing Acts.  However, it appears that there are certain legal and practical difficulties which could arise if their functions were extended in this way.  I am not satisfied that this argument is entirely convincing and the matter is still under discussion.

      <P>The Minister did not refer in his reply to Question No. 26.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he is aware of excess insurance loading in respect of disabled persons who have passed their driving test and who drive specially adapted cars and that companies are charging up to 50 per cent extra loading in such cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The imposition of motor insurance loadings in respect of disabled drivers reflects the higher level of risk for this category of driver.  The <Col N="2260" /> extent of the loading is determined by the additional risk involved in each particular case.</P>
      <P>In the interest of fairness to other road users, I am satisfied that insurers must be allowed some flexibility to apply loadings of this kind.  However, I have been in contact on several occasions with the insurers in this matter and they have undertaken to examine the merits of each case as sympathetically as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell the House how this higher level of risk is computed?  The driving test undergone by the disabled person is precisely the same as that for any normal driver.  The only difference is that the car has been specially modified, and there is no argument for saying there is a higher level of risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that a disabled driver has passed the driving test and drives specially adapted vehicles, motor insurers have always held that there is a higher element of risk than in the case of non-disabled drivers. This has been accepted over the years by the Department as reasonable, given the possibility that disabled drivers might react slowly to driving hazards.  It is considered that the amount of the loading should be related to the degree of risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he is aware that recent military incidents in the Lebanon suggest that the <i>de facto</i> forces there have changed their policy from shelling to shelling and firing at UNIFIL positions &ldquo;for effect&rdquo; and if he will make a statement on the matter in view of the threat posed by this new policy to the safety of Irish troops.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there have recently been some further incidents of serious harassment of UNIFIL positions by the <i>de facto</i> forces, including shelling and firing.  These are naturally a source of great concern to the Government and we have conveyed our views very strongly to Israel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the United Nations have protested to the <i>de facto</i> forces about those incidents and have taken them up with the Israeli authorities, in view of the great influence they exercise over the <i>de facto</i> forces.  However, from the information available to us from all sources <Col N="2262" /> there has not been any significant change in the pattern of harassment by the <i>de facto</i> forces when this occurs.</P>
    <P>The situation within the Irish battalion area had until recent events been relatively quiet for over a month.  Clearly, however, the overall situation remains somewhat unstable owing to the general conditions in the area, the activities of the <i>de facto</i> forces which Israel continues to support, and the limited progress made towards full implementation of UNIFIL's mandate.</P>
    <P>As I said previously, no peace-keeping operation can be without risk and UNIFIL confronts particular difficulties. I can assure the Deputy, however, that the Government will continue to monitor developments very closely and to use every diplomatic channel open to us to assist the Secretary General in reducing to a minimum the risks faced by the force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat amazed to hear the Minister imply that the situation there is just a continuing situation of <i>de facto</i> forces and possibly Israeli forces directly firing for harassment purposes. There is no doubt from my observations that the firing now is for effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with the statement made by the Secretary General of the United Nations when the mandate for the peace-keeping force in the Lebanon was being renewed, dated 8 June 1979&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with the statement made by the Secretary General of the United Nations that it was an essential prerequisite for the successful fulfilment of the mandate by Irish and other troops under UN control in the Lebanon that, first of all, harassment, as it was then described, by the <i>de facto</i> forces in the immediate vicinity of Naquara must cease?  That has not happened.  In fact, it has escalated. Would the Minister agree that <Col N="2263" /> firing for harassment, as at that time it was, on UN positions and on the local population must cease?  Not only has that prerequisite not been met but the situation has very dramatically and dangerously escalated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very important problem.  The situation has deteriorated considerably and there is no doubt that the firing now coming from the <i>de facto</i> forces or from Israeli forces is on and into camps occupied by Irish troops and that firing is for effect and not for harassment.  Would the Minister indicate, in those circumstances, if the Government feel that the diplomatic and political restraints and failures by the UN and by our Government have led to the present situation where it is practically impossible for any prospect of fulfilling the mandate by our troops in the Lebanon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to deal with most of the points, if not all, made by the Deputy in his statement. First of all, I do not accept that the Government's representations and protests have been a failure.  On the contrary, I want to assert here very clearly that the Government's representations and protests have been successful.  There has not been, since the highest level representations were made by me directly to the Foreign Minister Dayan and, subsequently, by the Taoiseach directly to the Prime Minister Begin, anything like a repetition of the events we protested about at that time.  So much for the failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to what Deputy Cluskey on his judgement decides is a change of policy on the part of the <i>de facto</i> forces now to shoot for effect, I can only tell the House that that is only Deputy Cluskey's assessment but does not accord with the assessment of the military or the United Nations.  I have said that very clearly in my reply.  I suggest to Deputy Cluskey, in the circumstances, that we could both best rely on the information provided to us by the <Col N="2264" /> people most professionally qualified to do it.  I appreciate that because Deputy Cluskey was in the region at the time of those events he might get the impression that what he saw was worse, a stepping up or a change of tactic than anything that happened previously.  As he will know, the Government, through the channels available to us and also through visits by the Minister for Defence and the Minister of State at my Department, have been very closely in contact at all levels.</P>
    <P>I do not accept, therefore, on the basis of the information available to me through all sources, United Nations and military, that there has been a change.  I certainly do not accept that the Government's representations and protests have been a failure.  I accept, because I have said it many times, that to implement this mandate effectively, all of the United Nations forces would be allowed to exert their authority over the whole area, including that portion which the Israeli forces handed over to the <i>de facto</i> forces.  I accept that even the harassment of the nature that I acknowledge exists and continues to exist, is a major problem for the forces and a very serious obstruction to the UN forces in implementing a very difficult mandate in a very sensitive area.</P>
    <P>We have conveyed our views at every level to that effect.  The service which our troops and other troops are giving in the cause of peace out there should be supported. I would not like to think that the people of Ireland or the relatives of those soldiers would, because of the observations of Deputy Cluskey, get grounds for concern which are not warranted from information available to us.</P>

I can assure the Minister and the House that any statement I am making here is made in the full consciousness of the very serious matter which is under discussion.

      <P>In view of the fact that between 28 June and 8 July artillery and mortar rounds fired were, 149; machine gun rounds, 6,010; white phosphorous rounds, five; and counted machine gun fire, two incidents, does the Minister seriously stand up in the House, in view of the fact that some of those have landed within the compounds of Irish held positions, and tell us that this is just harassment and that he is reasonably satisfied with the position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>I want to say, first of all, that the information and the details the Deputy now presents as being recorded fact might have been presented to us, if he presents it as fact, but it does not accord with the facts as presented to me through the information available to me from the United Nations and military sources.  I suggest to the Deputy that if, as his question implies, there has been a change of tactics to shoot for effect, namely, to shoot to kill, it does not square with the information that that level of attack either was very badly directed or that somebody did not have a very accurate aim&mdash;fortunately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the information available to me from the authorities whom I have consulted, I reject the statement that such is <Col N="2266" /> the case.  I want to emphasise again that at all times we have insisted as have the United Nations, in order that our troops, who are undertaking risks which we and they accepted, will be enabled to complete the mandate which has been implemented in part, that this harassment must stop, the Israelis must stop their infiltration and the <i>de facto</i> forces must withdraw.  That is the position as advised to me professionally from the sources available to me.  I want to say quite deliberately that the figures available to me do not correspond with what Deputy Cluskey mentioned.  I do not know what areas are involved.</P>

      <P>We are talking about one bomb as distinct from what the Deputy referred to in the last part of his question.  The Deputy must know from his visit that the Irish troops have taken every precaution.  They are bunkered in situations of this kind to protect them against shells of that nature.  I want to say there is no evidence that they were directed against the lives of any of the Irish troops.  There is shelling in the area and we have protested about this on many occasions.</P>

      <P>The matter raised is a very serious one and it is one that should not divide this House.  Would the Minister not agree that his attempt to whitewash what is happening and his attempt to suggest that the representations made to the Israeli Government have been effective, when in the last few days they have invaded the UN territory occupied by Irish forces and attacked buildings there, is an affront to this House?  This side of the House has no desire to divide the House on the issue. Would the Minister not agree that his <Col N="2267" /> function is to protect the lives of the Irish soldiers and the interests of the United Nations rather than to try to whitewash the situation and suggest that nothing serious is happening when the situation has got worse since he made his representations with the direct invasion by Israeli forces in the last few days?</P>

      <P>The Deputy sat in the seat that I occupy and of all people he should recognise that it is not the function of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to protect the forces in operation. Irrespective of what protests we make or what effective action we can take, it is not the function of the Minister.  If he knows the procedures under which the UN forces operate, he must know that it is the function of the UN and the Commander-in-Chief of the UN to take those steps.  Secondly, there has been no attempt on my part to whitewash and I reject any implication by the Deputy that I am trying to do that.  Far from it. What I did say, and I repeat it again, is that the incidents that have occurred recently are not of the same nature and extent as the incident in respect of which I made contact directly with Foreign Minister Dayan and the Taoiseach made contact with Prime Minister Begin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Hegarty</b> asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport, in view of the serious deterioration in the petrol supply situation for tourists and the confusion resulting from the inefficiency of the petrol voucher system, if he will take immediate steps to improve the system and to increase the number of distribution outlets for petrol vouchers.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the petrol voucher scheme is inefficient in any significant way nor have I heard any complaints that motoring tourists have been unable to obtain vouchers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Petrol vouchers for overseas tourists bringing own cars are available at seven car ferry terminals, and for Northern Ireland tourists at Belfast and Derry. Tourists hiring cars get their vouchers at <Col N="2270" /> 17 distribution outlets throughout the Republic.  In practice it is only tourists hiring cars who have to go to these outlets and I understand, in addition, that a full tank of petrol is normally part of the hiring contract.  In addition most tourists are able to obtain ample supplies without using the vouchers at all.  Bord Fáilte are continually monitoring the working of the scheme and are satisfied that there is no need for additional distribution outlets at the present moment.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the industrial action by oil company employees should not cause problems and undo the good results achieved by the scheme and hope that the intervention by the Minister for Labour will bring about a speedy end to the dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be assumed that the aim of the amendment is to prevent any increase in the rate of fee but as the <Col N="2339" /> Bill does not provide for an increase in the fee and if an increase became essential, an amending Act would have to be prepared.  It is sensible to provide for a variation in fee, either upwards or downwards as the circumstances warrant. Any fear that the fee may be increased without good reason can best be considered against the background that the fee proposed is to replace one that has been left unchanged since 1941. That was the butter fee as provided for in the Dairy Produce Act, 1941.  In the circumstances I must reject the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the provision as proposed in the Bill is not amended the Minister will be empowered to increase the fee by regulation at any time and without having to seek the approval of the House.  That is not correct procedure.  My amendment would ensure that a regulation to increase the fee would not come into effect until such time as the increase has been approved by way of regulation in this House.  That is the procedure being adopted in relation to any increase in the bovine diseases levy and it should be adopted in this instance also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is yet another levy being imposed on the farming community and it contains all the objectionable features that are inherent in any of the other levies being imposed.  The levy is payable regardless of ability to pay and regardless of whether one is a taxable person.  It will act as a disincentive so far as increased production is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition the levy can be increased at any time to whatever amount the Government may wish without having regard to the expenses in respect of which the levy is being imposed.  The Minister has just now refused to accept an amendment whereby the approval of this House would be sought in respect of any increase in these fees.  Consequently, <Col N="2340" /> there will not be the means whereby any abuse of powers in regard to increasing the fees could be checked here.  The Minister has chosen to change the fee at any time by way of regulation or, as one might say, to change it behind closed doors.  This is yet another objectionable feature of this section and of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I said that the fee already in operation was fixed under the Dairy Produce (Amendment) Act, 1941.  It has never been changed since then, although the services provided have been significantly increased in the meantime.  The current fee brings in approximately £14,000 per annum, whereas it is estimated that the cost of the inspection service in 1979 will amount to about £900,000.  It can be seen from that, that there is a need for an increase in this fee for the services being provided.  As I said, it has never been changed since 1941, and there cannot be any real grouse at the increase sought at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 8, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;Moneys paid to the Minister in pursuance of any provision of this Act shall be paid into a fund which shall be used solely for the purpose of promoting hygiene and efficiency in production for sale of milk and milk products.  A report of the use of this fund shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas each year.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this levy which is being charged is, broadly speaking, the purpose in my amendment.  In order to prevent the Minister raising more money than is necessary under this levy to fulfil those purposes, and using the surplus for other general revenue purposes, in other words, turning this levy into a means of collecting general taxation, we are proposing that the fees should be paid into a separate fund which could be used only to promote hygiene and efficiency in the production for sale of milk and milk products.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment on those grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment misinterprets the purpose of the fee.  That purpose is to recover the cost of an existing inspection service.  To make the validity of the demand for the fee dependent <Col N="2343" /> on an imprecise statement like &ldquo;promoting hygiene and efficiency&rdquo; would serve no purpose and would make collection impracticable.  As it is intended to keep the cost of inspection under review in the context of the amount collected by way of fees each year, the need for the setting up of a special fund as proposed in the amendment does not arise.  As drafted, the Bill enables the State to collect the cost of inspection. This is a straight-forward matter which I believe should not be complicated in the way recommended by Deputy Bruton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that &ldquo;livestock&rdquo; means bovine animals and sheep but sheepmeat in the EEC includes goats as well as sheep.  I should like to know whether livestock includes goats as well as bovine animals and sheep.  I understand that a small amount of goat production takes place here, some of which is located in my constituency. Why are goats not included in this legislation?  I am aware that in the legislation which governs slaughtering premises some premises are licensed for the slaughtering of goats.  In fact, a premises has been licensed specifically for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that this esoteric suggestion may give rise to a certain amount of mirth but I can assure the Minister that there are people involved <Col N="2345" /> fulltime in this industry.  I know one person in my constituency who lives on a small farm and is involved in producing a special breed of goat for their skins.  Goats should have been included within the terms of reference of CBF so that one statutory agency could be responsible.  The CBF may not do anything about goat production in the immediate future, unless they were requested to do so, but as we are preparing legislation which is supposed to have lasting effect, it is appropriate to include goats here if they are not included in the terms of reference of a similar promotional agency.  It would not cost anything to include goats in the definition section, and it could be of benefit in the future.  Will the Minister consider this matter between now and Report Stage?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2346" /> During the course of the debate on Second Stage Deputy Bruton made a point that while CBF was being given the power to export it was not being given specific power to buy and sell.  The amendment is intended to remove any doubt on this score and I trust it meets the point made by the Deputy on Second Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section establishes the functions of the board and there appears to be a tremendous amount of duplication in it.  The section states that the functions of the board shall be to develop, promote, facilitate, encourage, co-ordinate and assist in the export of livestock and meat.  It seems to be the desire of the draftsman to use three words where one will suffice.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (1) (g) the board may provide or arrange for the provision of publicity, advertising and promotional campaigns in the State to increase consumption but I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the consumption of meat here has fallen since 1974.  During that time the consumption of meat in other countries has gone up.  Therefore, there is a need for somebody to do something to encourage more people to consume meat.  On the other hand, I see a difficulty in funds being used by the State to encourage people to consume a number of alternative products because if they consume one they will not consume another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The levy is being used to finance the promotion of all such products.  There is potential waste there.  Will domestic promotion work be financed exclusively from the CBF levy or will it be financed by a grant from the State?  If the latter applies does the Minister see the possibility of taxpayers' money being used simultaneously to promote partially contradictory objects?  People cannot at one <Col N="2347" /> meal consume chicken, beef and pork which they are being encouraged to do by the State at the same time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The section sets out the functions of the board in detail.  It incorporates all the existing functions of the present CBF, market, promotion and development together with the provision of market intelligence.  In its new and enlarged role the board will be able to involve itself in a wider fashion in promotional work, including promotion on the home market and to engage to a limited extent in the trading of livestock and meat products, including trial shipments. A subsidiary body may be established for this purpose.  It is not intended that the CBF should compete with existing exporters and CBF will not have an exclusive marketing role in the export market.  It will, initially, confine its efforts to third country markets.  The limitations are contained in the phrase: &ldquo;to such extent and to such markets as the Minister may from time to time direct.&rdquo;  The levy is being collected from domestic butchers, and it is only fair that there should be some promotion in the home market as well as in the international market.  They would have a role to promote the sale of meat in the home market as well as in the export market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reservations about some aspects of this section.  Under this section the Minister shall direct CBF as to what markets they may or may not trade in.  This is giving the Minister a fair degree of discretion, and I feel it would be better to phrase that in some other way whereby the criteria on which the Minister would give this direction would be laid down.  A Minister could direct them to trade in one market where they would be in competition with a certain private exporter but not to trade in another market so as not to be in competition with an exporter who might be more friendly with the Minister.  I know the Minister would say that that is not the intention, but he will agree that it is technically possible.  There is no requirement on the Minister to publish the reasons for making a direction or to follow any statutory criteria in the exercise <Col N="2348" /> of his discretion, and that is objectionable.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (1) of subsection (1) says that the board may</P>
      <P>establish, with the consent of the Minister, such subsidiary body or bodies as may be necessary to engage in the export of livestock and meat.</P>
      <P>Do those subsidiary bodies have powers which the parent, the CBF, do not have? There seems to be a possibility that the functions of the House in laying down in great detail the functions of the board can be completely circumvented by the board simply with the consent of the Minister establishing a subsidiary body which would not be constrained in any way by the functions set out in paragraphs (a) to (k).  It should be stated in paragraph (1) that any subsidiary body so established must function within the terms of reference of the board.  It is highly anomalous and incorrect that a subsidiary body should be capable of functioning more broadly than its parent, and yet in the terms of the section as it is drawn that seems to be possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton questioned the decision to give the Minister power to promote.  The Minister will have to keep an eye on EEC aspects, and this will influence his decision about markets.  That is why the Minister needs some control.  The subsidiary bodies mentioned by Deputy Bruton will be subject to the overall control of the board and they will not have any greater influence than the board.</P>

Could this subsidiary body, albeit under the control of the board, perform functions which the board cannot perform because such functions were not delegated to the board in paragraphs (a) to (k) inclusive?

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Bruton.  We have gone to a lot of bother to get this Bill together.  To build in a section whereby we can change the functions of the board without reference to the Houses of the Oireachtas is a mistake.  I worked on a number of such boards and from my experience I feel that any major change of functions should be subject to the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas so as to give the <Col N="2350" /> democratically elected Members a say in relation to functions.  The Minister should amend this section so that only certain types of orders could be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing new in this.  The order must be laid before the House under subsection (3).  The Minister cannot give the board new functions, but only functions incidental to those they already have.  This power is already in the Dairy Produce Marketing Act, for instance.  There is nothing new to be afraid of in this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that if section 5(1) said that the Minister may from time to time, by order, assign to the board such additional functions in relation to livestock or meat as are incidental to or consequential on the functions assigned to the board by this Act, but the section says &ldquo;as he considers to be incidental to or consequential on&mdash;&rdquo;. The Minister may consider anything in defiance of reason but once he considers it he has the power under this section to add these functions to the board.  If the Minister is sustaining that argument he should remove the words &ldquo;as he considers to be&rdquo; and put in &ldquo;as are incidental&rdquo; instead.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately this is an area where political influence is inclined to take over.  I should like to ask the Minister in regard to subsection (3) (b) which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2351" /> three persons who shall represent the producers of bovine animals and sheep who shall be appointed by the Minister on the nomination of such organisations as the Minister considers to be representative of such producers,</P>
    <P>if he considers them not to be representative of these producers what is his next move?  Has the Minister authority then to say that this man is not representative of that area, and appoint a nominee himself?  No, I see it is the organisations who select the nominees whom the Minister then appoints.  However I am fearful of a situation in which the Minister might not accept an organisation representative, when he might select somebody himself.  I should like the Minister to say if that is possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will decide what organisations he would consider to be representative of the various interests to be covered by seven of the board members.  The organisations would then nominate their representatives.  I cannot think of any case in which a Minister would refuse to accept a nominee of a particular organisation unless there was something radically wrong.  If the organisation in question feel that the person nominated is the person who should represent them on the board, I do not think the Minister would have any objection, provided he was a person deemed fit to carry out the functions assigned to him as a member of the board.</P>

      <P>It is my belief that if one selects an organisation, the decision as to who they nominate should be left to their discretion without too much interference by the Minister.  The Minister is attempting to set up this board, giving these organisations a certain amount of say on it but he is still retaining the last word for himself as far as these members are concerned.  To a certain extent I do not see any sense in it: either the Minister accepts the nominees of the different organisations or he does not.</P>

      <P>It is my belief that the chairman of the board should be appointed for a five-year term and not three.  I say that in the knowledge that the first chairman of this new board probably will be appointed by Deputy Gibbons rather than by a member from this side of the House.  Neither do I believe there should be a staggering of the term of office whereby some people retire each year.  Rather I believe that the entire board should be appointed for five years, giving them that period in which to do a good job.  At the end of that period, if they have not done so, they can then be thrown out.  But the idea of some people coming in, others going out, some having to read themselves into the job for a year; then by the time they have done so somebody else has come in who is a novice who holds up meetings in order to have things explained to him; by the time he has read himself in somebody else has gone and another new person appeared who must be helped to learn the ropes is ridiculous. Anyway the meat business is fairly technical.  Anybody serving on such a board should be there sufficiently long to master the subject.  I shall not press the issue because, the shorter the term as far as we are concerned politically, the better.  But it is not in the interests of CBF that it should be a three-year term only.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton that a three-year term is very short.  People become useful only when they have learned the workings of the board itself, then their term of office may cease at the point at which they are becoming useful.  I would advocate, as did Deputy Bruton, a five-year term all round which would be more beneficial to the board in the long-term.  It takes anybody at least one year to learn anything about the work and, in a three-year period, that leaves them only two years in which to contribute.</P>
      <P>Am I correct in thinking that the staggering of the term of office of members of the board will apply initially only, or will it continue?  I note that subsection (2) (a) says:</P>
      <P>the persons who are first appointed by the Minister to be ordinary members of the Board shall hold office as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  three of such members shall hold office for the period of one year from the date of their appointment,</P>
      <P>Is this one year a once-off thing while the board is being established?  I should like to be clear on that point.  Certainly a one-year term for anybody is hopeless.  I think it is specified when the board is first established; is that correct?</P>

There is nothing to stop the board from reappointing that chairman after the third year if he is doing a good job.  Any member can be reappointed, including those who retire after the first year. Therefore the opportunity exists for them to reappoint a member or the chairman, if they so wish, after the third year.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 19, to delete &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;four months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to set a time limit within which the board must present their annual report.  I did a study of the presentation of reports by various subsidiary bodies to this House and found some truly horrendous cases of bodies which have been in receipt of very large amounts of public funds not presenting their reports literally for years afterwards.  I have in mind a health board which must have a budget in the region of £30 million or £40 million which still have not presented their accounts for 1974-75 to this House.  That is a disgraceful situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One body under the aegis of the Minister for Agriculture, An Foras Talúntais, presented their report for one year 18 months late.  Under the provisions of the Companies Act a private company must present their report to the Companies Office within 60 days of the annual general meeting which must take <Col N="2357" /> place each year.  If they do not, their officers will be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>We are talking about public companies which are spending large amounts of public funds.  Yet they can delay the presentation of their reports to this House.  That is a disgraceful situation. We must make it clear to the officers and members of boards in receipt of public funds that they are ultimately responsible to this House and that they would not exist were it not for the authority of this House.  They must not think they can delay presenting their accounts for six months, eight months or a year and adopt an easy-going attitude.</P>
    <P>I want to put it on record that if CBF are set up soon, I will be looking out to see that their reports are presented in time.  If they are not, I will be exposing the matter in this House as I have done in relation to other bodies which have not been presenting their reports.  If these companies do not present their reports to this House within a reasonable period in my view they are not showing due regard to the fact that their authority ultimately derives from this House and through this House from the people. They must report back to this House on how they are spending public money.</P>
    <P>My amendment which requires CBF to present their accounts to this House within four months is reasonable and gives them sufficient time to get their accounts together.  This amendment should be accepted and this could be used as a model for other companies in respect of future legislation governing them.  If a company cannot get their accounts together within four months there is something radically wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree that CBF should produce their annual report with the minimum of delay, I do not think we need tie them to a specific time limit.  The existing provision requiring the board to report as soon as may be seems adequate. We do not want the board to be in breach of the law if circumstances entirely beyond their control should hold up the production or printing of the report.  For that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>There seems to be a difficulty here in that there is an upper limit stated of £5 million in the amount that the board <Col N="2359" /> may borrow for capital purposes but no upper limit in what they may borrow for non-capital purposes.  That seems anomalous.  It should be the other way round.  There should be an upper limit on what they can borrow for non-capital purposes, because non-capital purposes by definition usually do not have a builtin rate of return whereas a capital purpose does.  The £5 million limit should have applied to all borrowings for both capital and non-capital purposes. Generally, regarding borrowing, I am in some doubt as to whether a board such as this should be borrowing for current purposes.  I am not too sure about it.</P>

I do not mean that CBF intend to use their borrowing powers to the full.  The extent to which CBF will avail of this facility will be guided by good business practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be able to give a better answer.  It seems ludicrous to go to the trouble of saying that they may not borrow more than £5 million for capital purposes&mdash;which seems reasonable because no body being financed by the State should have <i>carte blanche</i> to borrow as much as they like&mdash;and then come along and say that as long as it is for current purposes, which is not defined in this Bill anyway, they can borrow as much as they like. <Col N="2360" /> They can borrow £100 million so long as it is allegedly for current purposes. Once you have borrowed the money nobody knows what you are going to do with it.  Therefore it is very hard to say whether it is borrowed for current purposes or for capital purposes.  Once you borrow it you start spending it and it is only afterwards that you discuss the way it is to be used.  It seems odd to have a limit of £5 million for capital and no limit for current.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 9, before section 21, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;21.&mdash;No member of the Board or member of a committee of the Board shall have access to information which is or could be, in the opinion of the chief officer, of immediate commercial use in trade or business unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  it is being made simultaneously available generally or</P>
      <P>(b)  it is being made simultaneously available to all other members of the Board or committee of the Board either at or in association with a meeting of the Board or committee of the Board, as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A member of this board can be a person engaged in the meat trade and it is possible that he&mdash;particularly if he is chairman because then he would have closer relations with the chief executive and with what is going on in the board than if he were an ordinary member&mdash;has the possibility of obtaining information through his membership of CBF in advance of other competitors of his obtaining the same information, notwithstanding the fact that both of them may be paying a levy the operating costs of CBF.  It is wrong that a member of the board should have the possibility of obtaining this sort of information by virtue of his membership or chairmanship of that board.  As it stands at the moment, it is possible for him to do so.  The Minister may claim that the protection contained in section 20 meets the case.  It does not.  Section 20, which has just been approved, states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A member of the Board who has any interest in any contract which the Board proposes to make shall disclose to the Board the fact of the interest <Col N="2362" /> and the nature thereof, and shall take no part in any deliberation or decision of the Board relating to the contract, and the disclosure shall be recorded in the minutes of the Board.</P>
    <P>That only protects us from a member of the board getting a benefit in respect of a contract which is already in existence at the time the board are discussing it.  I object to the possibility that a member of the board might be able, by using information which comes to him in the course of the performance of his duties as a member of the board, to get information which he could use subsequently to make a contract to his advantage which other people in competition, with him would not be able to do because they had not the privileged access to the information that he had.  Section 20 only protects us from the abuse of position in respect of an existing contract, which is unlikely to be a common occurrence.  It does not protect us from the possibility that in the future the person might be able to make a contract to his advantage using information obtained from CBF, which is far more likely to happen.</P>
    <P>The whole function of CBF is to gather market information.  Every day of the week they will be getting in information about good deals that are possible for people in the trade.  They would be finding out through their agents in Paris, for example, that there is a possible means of disposing of certain kinds of beef in a certain part of the country if it can be produced to a certain specification and got there in a week or two weeks.  There is the possibility that, if a member of the board is in a position through his membership to get information about this possibility of making a contract before other people in the same business in Ireland, he will be able to get there first with his offer and grab the contract for himself, rather than allow it to be made available to other people in Ireland.  There was a discussion between Deputy Clinton and the Minister for Agriculture on this general matter and I do not wish to go back over that ground.</P>
    <P>I believe there must be a safeguard contained in this amendment to prevent the situation whereby a member or <Col N="2363" /> chairman of the board could get information to his advantage which is not available to other people.  I am not referring to general information about the state of markets but rather information of immediate commercial use.  Such information should either be available simultaneously to anybody who chooses to contact CBF or, if that is not possible, it should be made available to all other members of the board at the same time.  They would know exactly what information member A is getting which might be commercially to his or her advantage.  If that individual is enabled to use the information to the detriment of others, other members will be able to raise the matter at subsequent board meetings and make sure that there is no disadvantage to people involved in the trade who are not members of the board.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that this amendment is necessary.  If it is not accepted there will undoubtedly be a feeling among certain people in the trade that members of the board can get information which is not available to others and use it to their own advantage.  That would be a very regrettable situation in this as in any other trade.</P>

      <P>I agree with everything Deputy Bruton has said on this issue.  It is an essential measure in order to protect the board.  CBF may find themselves in a different position to enterprises such as Bord Báinne, who assemble produce in one area and sell it from there.  CBF carry out a certain amount of research and board members have access to information.  We are asking for a safeguard to ensure that the confidence of people is not broken as a result of particular information reaching board members.</P>

      <P>The safeguards provided in sections 20 and 21, relating respectively to the disclosure of interests by board members and to the constraints on board members about disclosure of information, are adequate and will ensure that no advantage will accrue to individuals. Acceptance of this amendment would introduce unnecessarily <Col N="2364" /> cumbersome procedures and restrict the operational effectiveness of the board.  I feel sure that the type of person nominated to the board will have the integrity to keep his personal interests quite separate from those of CBF.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not meeting the case in saying that these two sections adequately deal with the situation. Section 20 gives protection only against people making use of their position in respect of contracts which already exist.  I am not concerned about existing contracts but about the possibility of obtaining information to make new contracts subsequent to receipt of the information.  Section 21 merely gives protection against a member of the board or an officer giving information to outside people which he should not give.</P>
      <P>A member of the board who is also the chief executive of a meat factory does not have to give the information to a third party to make unfair and unethical use of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that there is no easy answer to this problem but I am still convinced that the restrictions imposed in sections 20 and 21 are as far as we can go.  We must accept that board members will get useful information. They will know what is happening in the meat trade and this will be useful to them if they have a particular interest. We have to assume that people nominated to the board have the integrity not to put this information to use for private profit.  An individual board member will not be exclusively entitled to information.  We cannot go any further in imposing restrictions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6a:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2365" /> In page 9, before section 22, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;22.&mdash;(1)  All contracts for the supply of goods, provision of services or carrying out of works entered into by the Board shall be awarded on the basis of open public tender except where another procedure is approved by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(2)  In any case where the Minister approves the entering into of a contract other than on the basis of open public tender he shall lay before the Dáil and publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> within fourteen days thereafter a statement indicating the fact that he has done so and the reasons for so doing.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment has a similar purpose in that it is designed to prevent the possibility of corruption.  In this case we are dealing with the giving of contracts by the board to outside bodies for the supply of goods, provision of services or carrying out of works entered into by the board.  We are requiring that any contracts of this nature should be awarded on the basis of open public tender. Everyone in the trade must have an opportunity of obtaining the job.  That is the reasonable procedure which the Government adopt in respect of contracts into which they enter and it should apply also within CBF.</P>
    <P>There may be circumstances in which this is impossible because a decision must be made very quickly and it would not be possible to adopt the necessarily long procedures entailed in a public tender system.  To meet that case we have provided for the possibility that another procedure may be approved by the Minister, in which case he shall lay before the Dáil and publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> within 14 days thereafter the reasons for so doing.  The amendment provides that as a general rule contracts will be open to public tender but that in exceptional cases the Minister may approve another procedure and lay that fact before the House.  This procedure would not prevent contracts being entered into quickly.  When a body of this nature is involved in the awarding of contracts we must ensure that it is not <Col N="2366" /> possible for favouritism, political or otherwise, to be shown.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Acceptance of the amendment would seriously inhibit the board's performance of one of their main functions as a commercial organisation.  It would be a departure from existing practice in the case of statutory bodies.  Even the present board of CBF are not shackled in this way. Regulation of procedures for contracts is a matter which can safely be left to the discretion of the board, who will in this, as in other areas, be guided by what makes good commercial sense.  The balance of interest represented on the board will ensure that all decisions about contracts will be arrived at in a fair and impartial manner for the good of the industry as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always raising this matter on this sort of Bill.  The chief executive officer's salary is controlled by the Minister for the Public Service whereas the salaries of people junior to him and who may be required to accept orders from him are not controlled.  I believe that in a particular board the chief executive was paid less than some of his subordinates.  I would like an assurance that that will not happen and that the Minister for the Public Service will ensure that the chief executive has a reasonable salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who is engaged in trading like this has a very responsible job.  The CBF will now be involved in trading. The chief executive should have a salary sufficient to enable him to remain in the job and also prevent him yielding to temptations to engage in outside activities or other activities which he should not be engaging in if he is to give his full time to his job.  One of the reasons for paying public servants in general&mdash;I am not talking about CBF people only&mdash;an adequate salary is to <Col N="2367" /> prevent them being tempted to engage in other activities which they should not be engaging in and which would be in conflict with their duties.</P>
    <P>It is very important that an adequate salary be paid to the chief executive and all other officers on this type of board to prevent them having this difficulty placed before them.  They will be dealing on equal terms with chief executives in private companies.  It is surely right that they should be paid an adequate salary.</P>

Is it possible to have the salary of the chief executive officer fixed by the Department of Agriculture rather than by the Minister for the Public Service?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether we like or dislike the language of the parliamentary <Col N="2372" /> draftsman, what it amounts to is that you can specify loans up to £20,000 to have a CRV.  It might be decided in six months' time that it should be £10,000 or £30,000 and this gives flexibility to vary the amount as necessary.  In the end that is what it amounts to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>When we are legislating the language should be clearly understood.  If parliamentarians cannot understand it, God help the unfortunate public and the people who have to operate the regulations.  Perhaps the Minister in the future would get the parliamentary draftsman to use language that can be understood and which is meaningful.  When a Bill is read through it should make sense.  I am not trying to argue this point but I am still as wise as when I stood up to ask the Minister about the matter.  I do not think that all of this is necessary.</P>
      <P>The reference to &ldquo;not less than&rdquo; confuses me.  If, for instance, the Minister is talking about a figure of £13,000 and if the builder produces a figure of £10,000, would he be refused a CRV because the £10,000 was less than the amount specified?  As I see it, in the unlikely event of a builder being able to build cheap houses he would be refused a CRV.  What is meant by the words &ldquo;less than specified?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Loans of up to £20,000. In respect of a loan of £20,000 it would be necessary to furnish a CRV.  I appreciate the difficulty regarding the parliamentary drafting but the wording used is not peculiar to this Bill.  The end result is that as well as specifying an amount there is provision for flexibility to vary that amount if experience should prove that necessary in, say, six months.</P>

We must accept that the phraseology used is such that it makes sense legally but there is an onus on all of us to ensure also that it makes sense to this House.  I agree with Deputy O'Brien because I cannot see the sense of this wording.  It appears to be merely a lot of verbiage.  Perhaps sometime some Minister will decide that Bills are <Col N="2373" /> to be framed in ordinary English or Irish.</P>
      <P>I can understand the necessity for an upper limit but I cannot understand the reason for a minimum limit because this means that if a house is too cheap in terms of the lower limit, a different set of conditions operate.  Can the Minister explain the reason for this in plain English?</P>

Within those bands all the houses to which the loans apply have to be subject to CRVs. The purpose of the limitation is not to limit merely the amount of the loan but it is to provide that for loans greater than a certain amount CRVs are necessary.</P>

There is reference then to loans that do not exceed a specified amount or which are less than a specified amount.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 23a:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (3), line 11, after &ldquo;certificate&rdquo; to add:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2375" />&ldquo;or,</P>
    <P>(d)  if the amount of the consideration for the site does not, in the opinion of the Minister, represent reasonable value&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 18 (3) provides:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall not grant a certificate in respect of the sale of a house&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if the amount of the consideration for the sale (in this section subsequently referred to as &ldquo;the price&rdquo;) is greater than the greatest amount for which, in the opinion of the Minister, the house represents reasonable value, or</P>
    <P>(b)  if the price is greater than an amount standing prescribed for the time being under subsection (7) (g) of this section, or</P>
    <P>(c)  if the sale is completed before the date of the receipt by the Minister of an application for the certificate.</P>
    <P>We propose to add in another paragraph providing that the Minister shall not grant a certificate in respect of the sale of a house if the amount of the consideration for the site does not, in the opinion of the Minister, represent reasonable value.  We are convinced that you cannot regulate the price of houses satisfactorily unless you regulate the price of sites for houses.  Just as you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs, you cannot build houses without providing sites.  Over the years no attempt has been made to regulate the price of sites or to control the cost of building land.  While that is not the sole cause of the escalation of house prices, it is a very important and relevant ingredient.</P>
    <P>This Bill, which has been introduced with a considerable amount of song and dance, and put forward as a remedy for the increase in the price of houses, does absolutely nothing about the price of land.  While in the short term this amendment might make it more difficult in a way for people who are buying housing, in the medium term it would reduce the <Col N="2376" /> price of housing sites because the Minister, in deciding whether or not he would give a certificate of reasonable value, would have to see what the site cost.  If it was bought by the developer or the builder he would know immediately whether it was a reasonable price to pay for a site, or whether it was an inflated price.  If he found the land was bought by a small builder from what I would call a site baron, who had bought the land some years ago and let it lie there and appreciate in value, he might come to the conclusion that it was not reasonable value for money.</P>
    <P>In the CRV system the Minister has taken upon himself the onerous task of deciding what is reasonable value for money.  Why not go the whole hog and decide whether the site is reasonable value for money?  If he did that, it would have some effect, and a very considerable effect in the medium term. When things settled down and people saw they would not get any price they held out for for building land, it would have a very important and stabilising effect on the price of building land and consequently on the price of houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to compel the Minister to refuse a CRV in any case where the cost of a site was not considered reasonable, even if the total price for the house including the site represented reasonable value.  It is somewhat akin to part of amendment No. 21 which we debated yesterday which would require the Minister to give particular reasons for refusing CRVs.  For that and other reasons I am not prepared to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, it would be against the concept of the house and site as one unit being considered reasonable value for a certain price.  Even though a builder may have paid more than might be considered reasonable for the site he could, through economies and efficiency in his building operations, still sell the house at a reasonable price.  This amendment would deprive him of a CRV because he paid too much for the site.  Secondly, it would seek to impose an indirect control on the price of housing land.  I do not regard the CRV system in itself as an <Col N="2377" /> appropriate means of controlling land prices.</P>
    <P>This is far too big and too complex a question to be dealt with in an amendment of this nature.  I informed the House recently that I am in the process of preparing a submission to the Government on the whole question of land prices.  Acceptance of the amendment could affect the amount of building land becoming available and, consequently, the whole housing programme could be interrupted or interfered with.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it would affect the builder rather than the developer or land speculator who may be making the really big profits and, therefore, would not be tackling the problem at source.  It would also add a new dimension to the operations of the CRV system in that all builders, irrespective of the prices proposed, would have to produce evidence of site cost.  At present the majority of applicants succeed without having to give such evidence of site cost.  On the whole it would complicate and slow up the whole process of getting CRVs.  I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that the Minister's argument has some validity, basically what we are talking about is trying to keep down the price of houses to as low a level as we can. Speculators are taking the cream off the market.  A few years ago 65 per cent of the cost of a house was labour and materials.  Now the figure is around 35 per cent.  The whole emphasis has shifted on to the price of the site.  I am glad to hear the Minister will be making some proposals about land.  All Governments seem to fight shy and run away from that matter on constitutional or other grounds.  It is a matter which has to be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister thinks this amendment might restrict land from coming onto the market.  Local authorities should play a more useful role in land acquisition: through the mechanism of CPOs, and so on, land can be made available providing the money is there.  I do not accept that. When I decided to table this amendment I did not expect the Minister to accept it but the reply he has given is not valid.  It is possible to measure the increased <Col N="2378" /> costs because cement, plastic piping, timber and other building materials rise in price almost daily while land is forced up in price by market forces.  Unless we are prepared to control the market forces and the way land should be disposed of we are only paying lip service to keeping the cost of houses down.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of many builders who purchased huge tracts of land some years ago and are now selling them off at exorbitant prices. Those people can make a lot more money by disposing of such land without taking on the responsibility of building houses.  If we are anxious to control the price of land we must start at the site acquisition stage.  If we are not prepared to impose some restrictions we are engaging in an exercise of political expediency rather than one of sincerity.  I hope the submission the Minister intends putting before the Government will contain something meaningful to control land prices.  We hear a lot about the Kenny report but various Governments were shy of it.  If it is not possible to implement that report in full I am sure it must be possible to adopt certain sections of it.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to seek to impose hardships on those anxious to acquire sites but I am anxious to see land prices controlled and, if possible, kept within the area of the price of agricultural land.  When a local authority develop land in an area all the land in the immediate vicinity rockets in price even though the owners do not carry out any work on it.  Those who are anxious to provide a home for themselves must carry the brunt of that increase.  It is an indictment of our society that we have allowed that terrible scandal to be perpetrated on home seekers.  The amendment is intended to highlight this problem because the question of the control of land prices is not dealt with in the Bill.  Once again it has been put on the long finger.  This section afforded the Minister an opportunity to do something about controlling the price of land and, therefore, reduce the cost of housing. The Minister should remember that this is the only area in which we can play a meaningful role in curbing house prices. The fact that he has not done so makes <Col N="2379" /> me suspicious of the reasons for the CRVs.  We must get at the source of the vast profits in house building, land.  The profit margins of builders can be cut back while those who own the land can reap bigger rewards without any effort or risk.  Unless we tackle the question of land prices we are paying humble lip-service to controlling housing prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not present when the amendment was moved and I did not hear everything Deputy Fitzpatrick had to say but I heard the Minister's reply.  I was amused but saddened by the contradictory arguments he put forward trying to justify the decision not to accept this enabling amendment.  The amendment does not ask the Minister to control the price of land.  We are realistic enough to know the true colours of Fianna Fáil and be aware of the shrieks of horror of the supporters of that party if we asked the Minister to do that much. The amendment asks the Minister, in the context of this enabling legislation, to add this to the other provisions he has seen fit to take upon himself if the amount of the consideration for the site does not, in the opinion of the Minister, represent reasonable value.  There are two perfect outs for the Minister in that. If the Minister is not prepared to do anything about the price of building land he should say so.  I accept that the moneys going into the Fianna Fáil Party are so enormous that the difficulties in that regard are fantastic, but if the Minister is seeking enabling legislation so that he can put the mortgage manager of a building society to jail or fine him up to £10,000 if he does not comply with the economic strategy of the Government surely he can accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael amendment is merely asking the Minister, in taking into consideration the factors for a CRV, to have regard to the amount of the consideration for the site.  He can exercise his opinion on that in terms of his opinion as to what is &ldquo;value&rdquo; and he can stretch the meaning of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  The amendment seeks to give the Minister some additional facility by way of enablement to operate this section.  It <Col N="2380" /> must be remembered that this is the longest section in the Bill.  It is total nonsense for the Minister to say that he is not going to do anything about land prices now because it is his intention to do something in the future.  There is no reason why he cannot accept the amendment and activate it in terms of the regulations of the Department until such time as the land legislation is through. The Minister has already reassured the House, in relation to other sections, that the fact that he is moving a section does not mean he is going to activate it immediately. We spent a lot of time trying to find out what was meant in certain sections although it is clear that the regulations relating to those sections will not be activated for some time.  For example, we dealt with a section that will enable a programme of inner city rehabilitation to take place.  Therefore, the Minister's argument in this regard does not hold up.  The amendment is an enabling one to take into account the cost of labour, materials, capital charges and the cost of the site.  The Minister is running away from it.</P>
    <P>I said last night that the building industry would be distorted if this legislation went through in its present form.  One of the ways in which the distortion is likely to take place is that the bigger property companies in the house-building industry who have land banks will simply get out of the business of house building and will sell off the developed sites to smaller house builders who cannot afford to be as generous, who have to act as a consumer after-sales service organisation as well as builders.  The small house builders will be squeezed between the understandable consumer demands for quality and value, and rising prices and costs and scarcity of labour in some areas.  They will also be forced to pay an exorbitant site charge because the developer acquired the land, developed it and sold it. As Deputy O'Brien said, the value of the site bears no relation to anything other than the market forces of supply and demand. A lot of the capital required by these people, ripped off the backs of young house purchasers, financed by the building societies and subsidised by the <Col N="2381" /> tax-payer, will find its way into the coffers of a minority of the private sector in the building industry.  This minority have shown in the past a marked capacity not to reinvest in this country.  The Minister's evasion in this instance is effecting a potential loophole for housing capital to go through the CRV system, to be taken out for an unreasonably high site charge over which the Minister refuses to take control by rejecting this amendment, to find its way out of the economy or into unproductive areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister yesterday morning refused to answer a simple question in relation to another matter and has demonstrated a great capacity for silence; he simply will not answer any questions which he finds difficult or embarrassing to answer, in the security that if we ring the bells, 84 Deputies will troop in and the matter will be resolved. It is not sufficient to justify this kind of legislation on the ground that it is down in black and white, and on the ground that if one is asked difficult questions one can call for a division and a section is passed.  There is sufficient evidence now to suggest that the Government do not want to build more than 25,000 houses a year.</P>

      <P>We should dispose of the amendment first and all these other matters can be raised on the section afterwards.  The amendment only deals with one specific matter: the question of bringing the site into the CRVs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Before this amendment is rejected by the numerical superiority in the House it should be made clear that the Government who professed to have an interest in securing a home for everybody, and to be concerned about the application of the system of certificates of reasonable value, who professed to understand the building and the house building industry in particular, did not avail of the opportunity to take within a miscellaneous housing Bill an enabling section which would enable any future Minister to draft regulations in relation to the administration of the CRV system whereby he or she could have regard to the <Col N="2382" /> amount that would be paid for a site and if it was found to be not within reason, could reject it.  The Minister argued that this amendment was not practicable because he was about to do something about land in the near future.  That is a dishonest argument which does not stand up.  The other reason that the Minister offered for rejecting this amendment was that this would require additional delays in processing CRVs, that that in turn would aggravate the situation and that the whole question of valuations is a difficult question.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Minister that there is a semi-redundant office, called the office of valuations, which since derating, have far less to do than usual, and they would be in a position to assist on the question of valuations.  This office employs qualified valuers who could do the job if the Department cannot do it. Certainly all the major local authorities employ valuers in a valuation section and they are in a position to offer an opinion in relation to what would be a reasonable value.  Having worked with compulsory purchase legislation for many years each local authority has not only the staff but the expertise to deal with land valuations.  The Minister is claiming despite this that resource facilities in administrative terms do not exist to implement this amendment, if it were accepted, and that this would aggravate the administration of the CRV and that because of that the amendment cannot be accepted.  The Minister's arguments do not stand up and his first argument is patently dishonest.</P>

      <P>The first argument was that because the Minister was going to bring in legislation to deal with the price of land there was no need to accept this.

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If the materials and labour amounted to 35 per cent that leaves 65 per cent.  Just to clarify this, let part of it be profit.  In 1978 the average new house price in Dublin was £20,276. In the same year the typical price of a site for a house in the Dublin suburbs was £3,800 and in the new town areas such as Tallaght and Blanchardstown it was much less but greater in the cases of smaller developments in other areas. That was the average in the Dublin suburbs&mdash;£3,800, based on an extensive survey of building site costs.</P>
      <P>The Kenny Report was mentioned on more than one occasion.  I should make it clear that the report has been lying around since March 1973; between that date and June 1977 it has merely been collecting dust; absolutely nothing has been done about it.  At least in the past two years something has happened in regard to it.  I have received the report I commissioned from An Foras Forbartha. I have said already I am preparing proposals for submission to the Government.  I have no intention of sitting around for four years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;like the previous Government without doing anything about Judge Kenny and his report. Perhaps I may pick out just two of the four reasons I gave for not accepting this amendment.  At present the price of a site does not have to be specified.  The builder may very well have paid too much money for the site; he may, through good management and by carrying out his operation very effectively, be able to balance the extra cost and, in the overall picture of his submission, be entitled to a CRV.  Another reason I gave is that if this amendment, as worded, were to be accepted it would affect <Col N="2384" /> the builder, particularly the small builder, not the big builder who may own a lot of land, or a speculator, who might sell small parcels to small builders, as has happened.  I am sure Dublin Deputies are aware of this.  People and firms who have had a lot of land over the past two years, instead of building houses on some of it, have been selling it off at enormous profit to small builders, very good people, who are prepared to build a small number of houses as they go along, not building in units of 500 or 600, but undertaking a nice little operation. They have been forced into paying big prices for these sites by the people who bought them previously and who were able to carry them because of their financial position and so on.  Therefore if the amendment, as worded, were accepted they are the people who would be directly affected and who would be refused CRVs, not the big speculator or the person with a large bank of land. Therefore, I have no intention of hurting the small builder by accepting this amendment, as worded; I reiterate &ldquo;as worded&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Quinn I could safely say that at least 12 times he used the phrase: &ldquo;this is enabling the Minister&rdquo;.  I regret to have to inform him that it is mandatory, not enabling, which he will find if he reads subsection (3) which commences with the words &ldquo;The Minister shall not grant...&rdquo; That is not enabling; that is mandatory and most of the Deputy's contribution revolved around that phrase he kept repeating. Perhaps he will now accept that it is mandatory.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I would be prepared to consider making it an enabling amendment.  If we are to do that I would point out also that I would have no intention of implementing it on the lines suggested in the original amendment, as worded, until such time as I have completed my undertaking with regard to making a submission to the Government and awaiting its outcome.  I am prepared to consider making it an enabling measure in the interests of being able to utilise it another day.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): One might say that is £4,000, which is approximately 20 per cent of the price of a house.  I take it that the Minister, in arriving at that average, was thinking of an estate where there are hundreds and hundreds of semidetached houses built, and averaging the whole thing up.  Without going into the more expensive type of house, I am told that frequently the site represents approximately 40 per cent of the purchase price of a house.  That is a very serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment would enable the Minister to influence the price of the site of a house without resorting to the Kenny report.  When the Kenny report is spoken about there is always a suggestion that to do what it advocates might not be constitutional.  I do not know whether or not that is correct.  But there is nothing unconstitutional about my amendment because it does not seek to control the price of land.  It gives the Minister the right to say that a house, the site of which costs too much should not be granted a loan.  That will influence <Col N="2386" /> the price of building land, which is what we want to do.

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): &mdash;&mdash;would hit the small man.  I do not agree with that.  I think it would be in ease of the small man, would get at the man who bought the land a few years ago, who does not now want to build houses on it, is leaving it to appreciate rather than selling it off to the small builder because he would not get them to buy it from him at exorbitant prices.  They and he would know that they would not get a CRV if he sold it to them at a fancy price.  He would have to come down to earth and sell it at a reasonable price or build houses on it himself.  Certainly that would be in the interests of people who want to buy houses and, in my opinion, also in the interests of the small builders.</P>
      <P>In this section as drafted, virtually no regard is being had to the price of land for a house.  The Minister gives as his reason that it would complicate matters, make things too difficult and lead to all sorts of problems.  The Minister is not prepared to grasp the nettle.  Yet his party are the people who spoke time and again about grasping the nettle.  If a party with a majority of nearly 20 is not prepared to deal with difficult matters such as these, take difficult decisions like these, what are they there for; why did the people give them that majority? They are well equipped to grasp the nettle, to take difficult decisions, and I admit that this is a difficult one.  Any section that deals with CRVs in connection with housebuilding and has no regard to the value of the site is only a sham, a cosmetic exercise, make-believe, because the site is a big part of the cost of a house and in many parts of the country outside Dublin it is a very serious element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amendments, as drafted, were written into the section the Minister would be obliged to take it into consideration, and if he came to the conclusion that the site did not represent value <Col N="2387" /> for money he could not give a certificate of reasonable value.  I would not be satisfied with the Minister's proposal to take it in as an enabling provision to be applied sometime in the distant future.  It would be an improvement if he were to put into the subsection a paragraph saying that in deciding whether to grant a certificate of reasonable value the Minister would have regard to the cost of the site.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why we should sit here as a parliament and do nothing about a situation in which people bought up land at low prices, some in doubtful circumstances, on the outskirts of this city some years ago, got planning permission but did nothing about it.  They are selling this land to small builders and young married couples looking for houses at prices that are quite unconscionable. That is a disgrace.  We would be doing much less than our duty if we did not give the Minister, and insist that he take power to have regard to the price paid by those people who knew the land would eventually be used for housebuilding.  They are the speculators we want to catch.  We do not have to violate the Constitution or the rights of private ownership.  We can tell them that they may not bleed white young married couples on modest incomes who are looking for houses by selling this land to them at exorbitant prices.</P>
    <P>This is a very worthwhile amendment. If the man in the street knew we were spending days discussing a Bill to control the price of houses, but that there was no mention of the cost of a site, he would think we were playing games.</P>
    <P>There was talk about who was responsible for putting the dust on or taking it off the Kenny report, or binding it in leather, but that does not matter very much.  We are here now and can do something about this, if we have the will to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words about site costs under the CRV. First we will take developed sites.  Where a builder supplies bona fide evidence of his actual site cost, it is normally accepted for CRV purposes.  This does not mean that we are committed to allowing actual costs in all cases because first, a builder may have paid an unreasonably high price for the sites, and secondly, it is difficult sometimes to prove the certain bogus transactions involving the sale of sites between inter-related companies are not genuine, or even to detect such deeds is difficult at times.  In either case only the reasonable cost is allowed.</P>
      <P>With regard to current value, builders building larger schemes on land which they held for quite some time tend to claim on the basis of the current value of the land since this would normally be much higher than what they paid, even if we allow for holding charges and profit. In these cases we allow a reasonable value per acre for the area in question. This reasonable value is based on advice from the Valuation Office and on other information available to the relevant section in my Department, from our knowledge of individual transactions and from local authorities.</P>
      <P>The third value is the replacement value.  Some builders take this to mean some kind of future value.  The CIF have been informed that replacement value cannot be allowed for CRV purposes, and rightly so, since it would be asking house purchasers to pay for future increases in land prices which would not be compatible with the concept of current reasonable value.</P>
      <P>That information might enlighten Deputies as to the sense of fairness that can be involved with regard to taking land costs into consideration for CRVs. With regard to the Kenny report, I do not know how Opposition Deputies can keep referring to the lack of action in this area.  This report has been lying around since March 1973 and nothing has been done about it.  It is difficult to listen to the Opposition criticising this Government about this report&mdash;</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): That is not accepted.  It is accepted if the applicant can convince the Minister that this was the best bargain he could make and that he could not get one cheaper.  Then he will get a CRV.  If something is written into this section in regard to the price of land it will provide a bargaining basis by the purchaser against the land buyer.  That is what we should be trying to do here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This section enables the Minister to administer the CRV system and requires him to do certain things, and he should be required to look at the price of land as a factor in the cost of housing in a way other than is being done at the moment.  The Minister clearly is outlining the way the present CRV system is operating.  We are talking about the way the new CRV scheme is to be operated under this legislation.  As the subsection stands without including the amendment either in its present form or in some substantial form similar to the way it is at the moment, the whole <Col N="2390" /> question of site values is not to be taken into account whether it is the Minister or Department who are making the decision. I accept the point that the Minister made that the section is a mandatory one and I was wrong to use it as an enabling section.  However, the words &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; enable him to decide whether he wants to let market forces operate as he does at the moment, having sorted out those sections which seem obviously evasive and which attempt to conceal the cost of housing.  The words allow him to decide either to allow the reasonable value as displayed by the market to prevail and therefore to grant the CRVs if the small builder to whom he refers simply produces the deeds of sale properly authorised and stamped, or alternatively, to refer to the new legislation to which he refers when it comes into effect.  To that extent the subsection enables any Minister in law to operate the CRV system and to make specific references to the cost of land and of sites.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why the Minister does not want to accept the amendment.  The formula that Deputy Fitzpatrick put forward in the sense that he may have regard to this perhaps would be a compromise that would be acceptable to the Minister.  I think that personally he is not opposed to this section and that his concern for the small builder is genuine. While his announcement would suggest that the small builder is going to suffer most as a result of this provision being put in, I would prefer to accept Deputy Fitzpatrick's assessment of it that the land barons will realise that there is an upward ceiling to the price and that they cannot go beyond a certain price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of the control of land is complex and does not really fall within the ambit of this section.  There is no simple way of dealing with it. Perhaps the Kenny approach was the most simplistic of all.  It concerned simply new land and agricultural land and did not deal with the fundamental question of existing built-up land, whereas there are land prices of astronomical figures.  However, we are not talking about Kenny, we are talking about this legislation and about obtaining CRVs for house purchases which I hope include <Col N="2391" /> the site.  All that the Department and the Minister are being asked to consider is to include in section 18(3) a clause which will give the Minister the legal right to have regard to the price of the site separate from the price of the house.</P>
    <P>We have made some progress in a number of these provisions in the last couple of days.  The Minister has, first of all, listened to the points we have made and has met us in so far as a meeting is possible, and I appreciate that.  In the context of what we discuss tonight there is a possible formula that could be found.  On the assumption that there is no fundamental opposition from the Minister or the Minister of State, and if the land legislation goes through&mdash;and I wish the Minister the best in that&mdash;in future the application of the CRV can have regard to the site value.  In subsection (3) we have (a), (b) and (c).  There should be another one, 3(d) which would ensure that no well-paid lawyer acting on behalf of a large property company could go in and appeal against the CRV on the ground that the Act did not make specific reference to the question of site cost.  We will not have this kind of housing Bill back in the House for about four or five years, the way that legislation is done in this House.  This is our only opportunity. The Minister said on an earlier section that a lot of matters in relation to housing administration can be dealt with.  That suspends all the arguments about the Constitution and the rights of private property and so on, and it introduces the elements of price control in the question of land.  This opportunity should not be missed.  I recognise that there are pressures on the Minister, but I suggest that if he can find a formula along the lines suggested it would be a good day's work in legislation in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that he cannot accept this amendment because it would be mandatory and would impose hardships on small builders.  Of course he can bring it in.  It is his Department who will decide what is good or bad value because they have the facts before them.  As he has said <Col N="2392" /> that he is going to bring in some form of control on land, it will be already copper-fastened in the Bill.  Then he can really act.  In the meantime he can operate the CRV system and still have control.  When the Minister says he cannot accept this it puts a little doubt in my mind about his overall sincerity about planning.  By accepting the amendment he would demonstrate his sincerity and when he brings in his proposals on land control he will have everything copper-fastened here and people will not be able to run away from it.  That is why I am a little worried as to why the Minister will not accept this amendment.  He issues the CRVs and he controls the criteria governing them and there should be no trouble at this stage.  His refusal to accept the amendment makes me a little suspicious.</P>
      <P>The amendment highlights one of the major problems in house development, namely land prices.  The Minister should see his way to accepting this amendment and having it enshrined in the legislation. When he brings in whatever ideas he has regarding land he will have his machinery built in hard and fast.  He should accept the amendment and therby make things easier for himself at the end of the day.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 11 and 12, after subsection (3), to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) (a) Where the Minister decides under subsection (3) (a) of this section <Col N="2393" /> not to grant a certificate, he shall notify in writing the person who applied for such grant of his decision and the person may, within a period of 21 days beginning on the date of receipt by him of the notification, appeal to the Circuit Court against the decision and that Court may, on the hearing of the appeal, as it thinks proper, affirm the decision or direct the Minister to grant the certificate.</P>
    <P>(b) Notice of an appeal under this section shall be given to the Minister and an officer of the Minister shall be entitled to appear and be heard on the hearing of the appeal.</P>
    <P>(c) No appeal shall lie from a decision of the Circuit Court on an appeal under this subsection.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to enable a person who is refused a CRV under subsection (3)(a) to appeal against the decision to the Circuit Court, which will be empowered either to confirm the refusal by the Minister or to direct him to grant the certificate.  Because of the substantial amount of money which could be involved in the grant or refusal of a certificate and in view of the technical nature of submissions likely to be made by expert advisers to the appellant and the Minister, an appeal to the District Court would be inappropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Bill as introduced did not contain any provision for an appeal against the decision of the Minister in refusing an application for a CRV.  Of course, that was entirely unacceptable to the building industry and to any fairminded person.  To the extent that the Minister has introduced this amendment making provision for an appeal, it is an improvement.  I would be one of the last people to say that an appeal to a court is not the best method of appealing against a decision with which the applicant is not satisfied.  However, in this particular case I am satisfied that an appeal to the Circuit Court or to any other court which has a lot of business to attend to is entirely unsuitable.  I will speak first about the machinery for bringing an appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2394" /> An appeal under this subsection would be an ordinary appeal to the Circuit Court.  The dissatisfied builder would consult his solicitor.  The solicitor, under present practice, would have to get the assistance of counsel, who would probably require an architect's or quantity surveyor's report in order to advise on the matter.  When all that information was assembled he would settle the grounds on which the appeal would be based.  We must bear in mind that the Minister, as the Bill stands, does not have to give reasons for the refusal of a certificate.  He resisted an amendment on this point.  The first thing any lawyer would tell his client would be to get the reasons for the refusal and, this being done, the matter would be considered and the appeal drawn up and lodged in the Circuit Court.  I do not know whether the Minister would be expected to put in a defence.  The appeal would be against his decision and he would be placed in the position of a respondent. Under present procedure the Minister would put in some sort of reply and then the appeal would be set down for hearing.</P>
    <P>I am being extremely conservative in saying that it would take at least two months to get to that stage and probably much longer.  At this time of year lawyers and architects might be on holiday and it could take until October or November to get the appeal set up.  If everything were to progress quickly it would take anything between two and six months to get the appeal to the Circuit Court office.</P>
    <P>In country areas the Circuit Court sits only two or three times a year and in many cases there are arrears.  In Dublin, with the exception of holidays, it sits all year round; but I understand there are arrears and it would probably take a year or more between the setting down of the appeal and the date of hearing. Court cases and appeals have a happy knack of being adjourned from time to time.  It will be seen that it might take anything up to two years to get the appeal heard and that is so unsatisfactory as to be useless and meaningless.  A builder who wants to get on with his work, keep his workers in employment <Col N="2395" /> and build houses for people getting married cannot have that sort of delay.</P>
    <P>I would be one of the last to object to an appeal to a judge.  It is one of the fairest systems of litigation there is.  That is not to say that all judges are infallible; they are quite fallible, but so is everybody else.  A judge engaged in hearing these appeals would have to act as an arbitrator while retaining his Circuit Court status and judicial status under the Constitution and would have to be relieved of all the other civil and criminal work which might come before him.  There are many precedents for this. Many years ago there were appeals under the Army Pensions Act by people who claimed they were entitled to an Old IRA pension.  The judge was relieved of other duties and devoted himself full-time to the hearing of those appeals.  He sat as an arbitrator in an informal way. In this case he would probably need the assistance of an assessor or two so that he could work expeditiously and informally. That is my suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment is unworkable because it simply provides for an appeal to the Circuit Court with all the necessary formal procedures and the long delays which pressure of business in the court would involve.  It is quite unacceptable to any sensible people. Anybody who is familiar with the working of courts knows that this would not work.  He knows that, for example, since 1977 to date the price of houses in this city has doubled, or, if the Minister disagrees with that that they have gone up by 75 per cent, and there would be no sense in having an appeal now against an application for a CRV which was refused in 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that arbitration hearings often take place <Col N="2396" /> three and four years after the land has been taken over by local authorities and built on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): That is because the arbitrator has a long way to travel and has a lot of things to do and might not get there for a long time.  If this appeal is to mean anything it will have to be done quickly.  I have received some suggestions that the appeal should not be to a court but to some other body.  The National Prices Commission has been suggested.  One submission made to me said:</P>
      <P>We suggest that the National Prices Commission is the most suitable organisation to deal with the people. The Minister's suggestion of a right of appeal to a court seems to be impracticable.</P>
      <P>It certainly is.  An appeal must be a meaningful one and it must be heard and disposed of quickly.</P>
      <P>There is another shortcoming which I see in the amendment.  It says: &ldquo;and that court may on the hearing of the appeal as it thinks proper affirm the decision or direct the Minister to grant the certificate&rdquo;. That is a bit like regulations coming into the Dáil.  The Dáil can either accept them or reject them, but cannot amend them.  If the appeal is to be meaningful the appeal tribunal must have the right either to affirm the decision of the Minister to grant the certificate for the sum applied for by the applicant or to make a decision in between as otherwise it will not be a rehearing.  If the subsection does not allow the appeal tribunal to do that it is not meaningful.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the Minister will convince anybody that an appeal to a court, as we understand it at the moment, is any use for the reasons I have given.  There are great delays and circumstances will change.  If circumstances did not change and even if prices did not vary between the date of the Minister's decision and the date of the hearing of the appeal so much time would be lost that the builders would be out of business, people would be unemployed and everybody would be frustrated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe Deputy Fitzpatrick described proceedings in the Circuit Court very accurately.  The House now realises that while a nominal appeal is being offered the effectiveness of it in real terms is far less than appears at first.  The Minister should think of something like the appeals board.  If a builder has a dispute with the Department on the question of the construction value and the cost of materials, labour or the site and it is a question relating principally to figures, the value of this and the value of that, I do not see why one has to go to the trouble, with all due respect to Deputy Fitzpatrick, of hiring a solicitor and hiring counsel, who in turn will have to hire a quantity surveyor. At the end of the day counsel will simply use the quantity surveyor's arguments to advance the case of his client in court.  He will charge quite a considerable sum of money for the privilege.</P>
      <P>We all know that the courts are overcrowded with legitimate legal cases. Now questions relating to certificates of reasonable value are being brought into the courts.  This is unfair in view of the cost and is not the best option the Minister has.  He has a far better model in the appeals board, who would be capable of dealing with this and have their own full-time staff.  The Minister could have appointed extra members to that board.  A High Court judge is the chairperson of the appeals board and the expertise on it could be reflected in the new appointees, ranging over the local authority people and technical people as well as representatives of the ordinary consumers.  They are in as good a position, in terms of judgment, as a judge in a Circuit Court.  They are more accessible because they are not confined to the sittings Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to. They have an independent secretariat so one has not to queue up in between all types of legal cases which have nothing to do with CRVs.  They would develop an expertise very rapidly to enable them to process appeals quickly and efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister's object is to grant an efficient and just appeals procedure, some formula based on the appeals board, as distinct from one based on what is suggested in the amendment, <Col N="2398" /> would be a more equitable, just and efficient one.  It would be less expensive, from the point of view of the builder and the house purchaser, for a person to exercise his or her option to appeal to the appeals board than to the Circuit Court. I expect that the Labour Party's response to this particular amendment comes late in the day and that there are implications in what I am suggesting which would need to be looked at.  The Minister is genuinely offering in his amendment some process of appeal and because of the factors described by Deputy Fitzpatrick, which are common knowledge to people who are aware of the legal process, perhaps the Department who have successfully established the appeals board could see that those CRV appeals are heard by the appeals board.  Everybody agrees, politicians as well as everybody else, that the appeals board is a success.  The success of that model should encourage the Minister to look at the possibility of using an extended version of the appeals board to process appeals under the CRV system. They are dealing already in an area that is not far removed from the whole question of building since they are handling planning permission applications and it would be logical and sensible to move the two together.</P>
    <P>However, the one great difference in relation to a planning appeal made to An Bord Pleanála as distinct from an appeal made in relation to a refusal for a CRV is that at least one knows what one is appealing against.  In a refusal for planning permission the reasons for refusal are given.  The normal process of lodging an appeal with An Bord Pleanála is to take the local authority's reasons for refusal, to attempt logically to refute them and to put them before the board.</P>
    <P>Last evening the Minister rejected the suggestion that the reasons for refusal of a CRV be given and we are as much in the dark about the matter.  We are engaged in a form of bureaucratic &ldquo;spot the ball&rdquo; where a person gets the refusal but he has to guess the reason.  As I understand it, making a case in a Circuit Court appealing against a refusal for a CRV one would have to try to prove the <Col N="2399" /> house was of reasonable value.  For argument's sake one would have to go through the 100 variable factors that constitute the cost of the house when the application may have been turned down because two out of the 100 factors were considered to be unreasonably valued or unreasonably priced.  There might be no dispute about the other 98 factors but yet the time of the court, the quantity surveyor and the builder will be wasted in arguing the reasonable value of items over which there is no dispute.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have an appeals procedure that actually functions there is even a greater reason to provide for the appellant some grounds on which an appeal can be constructed.  The small builder cannot afford to have a delay in the CRV process and the last thing he can afford is to go to the Circuit Court and attempt to prove the reasonable value of the property he is offering for sale.  Between the drafting of the Bill and the drafting of the amendment the Minister and the Government decided that some process of appeal was required. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten the House how the Government envisage the appeals procedure being implemented.  Does he accept the factual criticism put forward by Deputy Fitzpatrick and myself?</P>

      <P>We believe that where reasons for a refusal are not given a person should be entitled to appeal.  In the Bill there was no section under which someone could appeal and because of pressure or representations the Minister decided to do something about the matter. In my opinion it was done in a typically lazy way.</P>
      <P>It takes between a year and a year and a half to get a case to the Circuit Court.  What the Minister is saying in this Bill is that people have no right to appeal.  There is much lip service given to the right to appeal but nothing has been done about it.  The situation is very serious.  I do not know how the Minister can expect us to accept this kind of amendment.  It is not worthy of him and the House does not deserve that kind of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy <Col N="2400" /> Quinn pointed out the costs that would be involved.  If a builder is refused a CRV he has to calculate the costs involved in engaging counsel, an architect, a quantity surveyor and the other professional people who will get a reasonable fee for doing a job they should not have been asked to do.  The builder adds all the costs and the total is astronomical.  Therefore, he cuts back on the profit margin and sells the house at a loss rather than incur the expense and waste time.</P>
    <P>A building society may give a loan approval subject to a CRV and the bank will accept that for bridging finance pending receipt of the CRV.  If the builder's application is turned down there may be a wait of nine months to one year and all that time the person concerned is getting bridging finance from the bank.  The whole business is pathetic.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be honest about this matter.  He should tell us openly that he does not want appeals, that he is not interested in them, that he is interested only in the kind of dictatorship that gives a decision and that is the end of the story.  The person concerned is not given any explanation and is forced back to the Circuit Court.  We know that this court is working at full capacity and that the waiting period for cases to be heard is very long.  We are adding to the workload of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>We accept the principle of an appeal system but we must reject this amendment. Deputy Fitzpatrick said that the matter might be referred to the National Prices Commission.  I do not know if they would be capable of doing this work.  Personally I have my doubts that they would be the competent people to deal with the matter.  We should set up an appeals board consisting of people involved in the industry, the building societies and the Department with an independent chairperson.  That is the only way to do the job fairly.  Our amendment setting out the period of 21 days was rejected but we would expect the Minister to put forward something on similar lines.  The appeals board should do their business in a speedy way because people would be involved in the expenditure of vast sums of money and those on bridging <Col N="2401" /> finance would be paying high interest rates.  The Minister must reconsider this amendment.  He must treat this legislation seriously.</P>
    <P>An appeals board drawn from interested parties would have the confidence of interested parties and would perhaps keep down costs of counsel and so on because of the expertise that would be available on the board.  They would be in a position to make fair and reasonable decisions.  That is the only way that we will have a sense of fair play.  In the case of a builder who was considered to be charging too much it would be no harm that he be taught a lesson but we must ensure that there is a fair deal for those builders who are honest and who are trying to provide houses at reasonable cost.  In particular we must not put small builders out of business.  The big builder is usually well established enough to survive but the situation of the small builder is different and the small man is the backbone of any industry.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to withdraw this amendment and to table one for Report Stage on the lines we are suggesting.  Such amendment would be welcomed within the industry and would be of benefit also to those people about whom we are very concerned&mdash;the house purchasers.  If the Minister fails to comply with our request we must reject his amendment and put down one in our own names for Report Stage in the hope that in the meantime the Minister will have realised the sense of our proposal.  We are not acting here on behalf of any vested interest.  We are concerned that a sense of justice prevails for everyone concerned.  What the Minister is proposing is neither fair nor workable.  Perhaps it was never the intention that it would work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies can be assured that we gave much thought to the matter and we decided finally that the most impartial way of dealing with the situation would be through the Circuit Court.  I share Deputy Fitzpatrick's and other Deputies' concern about long delays.  Perhaps there is a big queue so far as appeals are concerned but the number of applications that were refused in the final analysis is only 5 per cent.  In some cases there were initial refusals but after further consideration and discussion a big percentage of those were allowed. The number of applications received in 1978, for example, was 1,356 and if the 5 per cent is consistent that would mean a total of only about 68 refusals in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that because of this legislation more people would find it necessary to apply for CRVs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  But I am giving the 1978 figure as an example.  It will be seen then that the percentage is not as great as Deputies might think.</P>
      <P>Having considered this matter carefully we regard what is proposed in the Bill as the best way of dealing with the situation, that is, by appointing a specific Circuit Court judge to deal with appeals. This point was raised, too, during the Second Reading debate.  There was the question of having to go through all this paraphernalia regarding legal advice, perhaps engaging counsel&mdash;junior counsel rather than senior counsel presumably&mdash;and technical advisers but even in respect of an ordinary arbitration hearing where a local authority were concerned that procedure would still be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the involvement of the planning board, because of the relationship of the board with my Department, I do not think their involvement would be the appropriate way to <Col N="2403" /> approach this matter.  Their main function is really planning.</P>
    <P>The NPC have been mentioned.  The question of their involvement was considered when the Prices Bill was being prepared in 1970 but the suggestion was rejected in favour of the CRV system. This decision was backed by the Coalition in the meantime.  It would not be possible to impose the same form of price control on new houses or flats as would be the case in respect of services or manufactured commodities with which the NPC are dealing every day. Any two houses are not necessarily identical in all respects.  Site or sub-site conditions can vary from one site to another even within the same scheme of houses. There are also such factors as the cost of roads, water supply, sewerage, planning conditions and so on, which vary from scheme to scheme.  The quantity and quality of fittings vary widely.  Flats are considerably more varied and complex.</P>
    <P>It was accepted by both sides that the National Prices Commission would not be the ideal way to approach it.  This is the most impartial way to deal with the problem, by setting up a system of appeal or a mechanism for appealing against a refusal.  I doubt that the delay will be as long as we might think, when we consider the small percentage which are finally refused.  It would be my intention, in consultation with my colleague the Minister for Justice, to make every endeavour to have the hearings brought forward as quickly as possible.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has more experience of courts than some of us, but it may be possible to help to speed them up.  This is the fairest and most impartial system we can come up with after long discussions.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I did not really think the Minister would seek to justify or defend the appeal procedure he offers.  I thought he put down the amendment in haste and under pressure from the building industry or others.  I am amazed that he tries to defend it, because it cannot be defended.  As an appeal procedure it is unworkable and useless.  The Minister said only 5 per cent of the applications <Col N="2404" /> were finally turned down last year, amounting to 68.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Only about 30 per cent of the houses built came within the CRV net last year.  Practically 100 per cent of them will now come within the net.  The Minister has strengthened his machinery for dealing with them, and it is likely that more will be refused.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not told us whether he will give reasons in the case of appeals. How can a person prepare his appeal successfully if he does not know what he is appealing against, if he does not know the grounds on which the Minister has refused his application for a CRV?  If the points in dispute were isolated between the Minister and the applicant that would shorten and simplify the hearing of the appeal.  If an applicant has to go into the appeal in blinkers, simply in the knowledge that his appeal was refused, he will have to start all over again from the very beginning and the appeal tribunal will have to scrutinise virtually every nail that goes into the house.</P>
      <P>The system of appeal offered is absolutely absurd.  Anyone will tell the Minister that it can take anything from six months to two years to have an appeal heard.  There could be a reserved judgment at the end of it which would prolong it for another while.  The Minister said that he will assign a judge to hear these appeals exclusively.  That will be an improvement.  There is nothing in the amendment about that and there is nothing in the section about it.  It just says you can appeal to the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied with it and I do not think anyone in the building industry will be satisfied with it, if he is refused and he knows he has to start again, with all the frustration of court proceedings.  He will have to go down to the Four Courts and hang around with people who are up for pinching things, people having domestic squabbles resolved, and so on.  That sort of approach does not appeal to a businessman.  There will have to be a <Col N="2405" /> proper appeal system stripped of red tape and formal court procedure.  The Minister says he has given this great consideration.  I doubt that.  When the Bill was introduced there was no provision for an appeal in it.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): At some stage after the publication of the Bill when the representations started to come in to the Minister from interested people, he started to think about it.  This appeal system is totally unacceptable.  The planning board would be acceptable, or the prices commission would be acceptable, or a judge sitting as an arbitrator.  That would take a great deal of formality out of it, and it would simplify it.  The hearing would probably take place away from the Circuit Court, or the Four Courts, or the courts down the country, and it would be a more informal hearing. This appeal is as good as no appeal.  It is the same as no appeal.</P>

If this CRV system which is now being extended to practically every house that will be built does not work, it will cause irreparable damage, a breakdown in the building trade, and unemployment.

I am told some people would be satisfied with the prices commission.  The Minister said that would not work but some people say it would not work.  Deputy Quinn suggested the planning board.</P>
      <P>The planning board have worked well since their establishment.  They have inspired confidence.  They act in a humane way and as a living tribunal, and not a bureaucratic institution.  I know someone who built a house in what appeared to be a ridiculous place because he was misled by somebody who should not have misled him.  The house was half built.  A planning board without a heart would have told him to take it down again, but the board found a way out, knowing all the circumstances.  In my view that board is working well.  For that reason a section of that board would be acceptable to me or the prices commission or a judge acting as an arbitrator and two assessors.</P>

      <P>In page 14, lines 12 to 14, to delete subsection (4) and to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) The Minister may, on the application in writing of a person to whom a certificate was granted under subsection (1) (a) of this section, or of any other person who appears to the Minister at the time of the application to be providing a house referred to in a certificate, revoke the certificate and grant another certificate in different terms from the first-mentioned certificate in respect of the sale to which the first-mentioned certificate related.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As drafted, section 18 (4) could be interpreted as giving the Minister wide discretionary powers to revoke certificates of reasonable value.  The power was designed mainly to facilitate applicants for CRVs who may, for example, wish to vary the price approved in an earlier certificate.  The purpose of the amendment is to limit the Minister's power under the new subsection to revoke a CRV to cases where a person who has obtained a certificate subsequently requests him to revoke it and grant another certificate. The amendment will also facilitate an application by any other person providing the house in question&mdash;for instance, a person who has in the meantime acquired the sites in question and is providing houses for sale.  Subsection (8) also provides for the revocation of CRVs where a person has supplied false or misleading information for or has otherwise contravened the terms of a CRV.</P>

Firstly, the Minister is legally advised that bridging loans could be excluded from the scope of subsection (2) having regard to the revised terms of subsection <Col N="2410" /> (2) (a) set out in amendment No. 23.

I would be unable to do that unless I got a certificate of reasonable value although I do not really need a loan but can-finance my own purchases when my assets are realised.

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): That is the point.  There is nothing to prevent me from buying the house if I win the prize bonds.  Instead of a prize bond, if I have 20 acres of land or a house that I know is worth £50,000 but I do not want to sell either of them until I have some place else to move into, and I enter a contract to buy a new house, I am in the very same position as the man with the £50,000 prize bond win, except that instead of a prize bond I have a house which I must convert into money.  If the Minister carries this amendment and the contractor tells me that unless I sign the contract now the house will be gone, I will not be able to go into the bank and borrow £25,000 for three or six months until I sell my land, I will first have to get a certificate of reasonable value.  That is an unreasonable intrusion into the activities of private people who are solvent and who do not want a loan in reality.  If the Minister is afraid that this will be used as a device to circumvent, he will have to get some other way of getting around it other than by blocking legitimate transactions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): One could make a speech lasting two hours on section 18 which is a very large section and is a complete innovation. In relation to CRVs in general, the Minister is taking power under this section to apply the CRV system to the entire building industry and the effect of that may be dramatic.  Prior to last August the CRV system applied to about 52 per cent of the houses built, but since the Minister related CRVs to borrowing the percentage dropped from 52 per cent to about 30 per cent.  That meant that a lot of builders moved out of building CRV type houses, and it also meant that many people forgot about the £1,000 grant, built their houses and borrowed money from building societies and other people for houses that were not affected by the CRV.  The big builders went out of that type of building and some of the small builders stayed in.</P>
      <P>It is feared that this new system, if not reasonably operated and delays eliminated, will make it impossible for small builders to remain in the trade because of financial constraints, delays and so on.  If the small builders are driven out and the big builders do not come back the housing industry will be in a sorry state, and there is every likelihood that that will happen. However, we shall talk about that when we come to section 20 which seems to take building societies and other institutions by the throat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possible effect of what we are now doing is mainly to nationalise the building trade.  If that works, it is all right but, if it does not, it will be all wrong.  After the intervention of the Minister last August we have seen the percentage of houses drop from 50 per <Col N="2414" /> cent to 30 per cent although private house building increased generally.  If that pattern continues, if instead of moving into the more expensive type of house building, builders stop building houses or are driven out of housebuilding, then we shall be in a very bad state.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the policy of this Government is to restrict housing. We know from various papers, the Green Paper and the White Paper, that, so far as local authority housing is concerned, their policy is to cut back on housebuilding.  Indeed, the Minister in this House in recent months has used such expressions as: we are building as many houses as the economy can afford, or as the industry can afford.  He used that expression several times.  I understand the Minister has said to the building societies that he proposes to confine housebuilding to not more than 25,000 a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am assured on reliable authority that either the Minister or his agents said to building societies that it was the policy of the Government to confine housebuilding to 25,000 per year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I believe this CRV system could be operated in such a way as to implement this Government policy of restricting housebuilding.  I do not think that should be done because it is antisocial and is not in the interests of the economy or the country generally.  I know from the White Paper that the Minister believes that local authority housing should be cut back but I did not know until recently that they had a similar policy in regard to the private sector.</P>
      <P>I tried my best, through an amendment here, to ensure that the Minister, in refusing a certificate of reasonable value, would give his reasons to the applicant. He has resisted that, and, as the Bill now stands, the Minister may refuse a certificate without giving any reason.  He can keep an application on his desk for six months or 12 months without dealing with it, and there is nothing anybody can do about it.  I am against that.  It is a great pity the Minister did not accept the amendment obliging him to give reasons for his refusal.  I say to him now, when he is considering a different form of appeal, that he should write into the Bill that he would give his reasons because, otherwise, it will be impossible to proceed with an appeal.</P>
      <P>We had a discussion today about sites, something about which the Minister will think between now and Report Stage.  I strongly urge on him that he take authority in the section to take into account the value of the site because that is basic to the building of a house.  I notice that in subsection (3) it is said that the Minister shall not grant a certificate in respect of the sale of a house if the sale is completed before the date of the receipt by the Minister of an application for the certificate.  I take it that means that the sale is not completed, the deeds handed over and the money paid; that it does not mean that a contract has not been signed.  I take it a person can enter into a contract and then apply for a certificate of reasonable value.  As a solicitor with some experience in conveyancing, I would take the expression &ldquo;sale completed&rdquo; to mean that the sale was completed, the house paid for and the deed handed over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2418" /> There are very heavy penalties provided in this measure for people who are guilty of offences under it.  A person may be fined up to £10,000.  Offences are created which apply to lenders and purchasers.  They could be very serious but on the other hand in certain circumstances they might not be so serious and I am sure the court will have regard to these matters when adjudicating on them.</P>
    <P>Section 18 (12) (b) states:</P>
    <P>If in any case the defence provided by paragraph (a)&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is, the defence of saying that the commission of the offence was due to a mistake or to the act or default of another person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;of this subsection involves the allegation that the commission of the offence was due to the act or default of another person or to reliance on information supplied by another person, the person charged shall not, without leave of the court, be entitled to rely on that defence unless, not less than seven clear days before the hearing, he has served on the prosecutor a notice in writing giving such information identifying or assisting in the identification of that other person as was then in his possession.</P>
    <P>As far as I know this is a complete departure from the established principle of criminal law.  There has been thinking abroad for quite a considerable time that when an accused person pleads an alibi he should give particulars of that alibi to the prosecutor a certain time before the case is heard, but that is not the law at the moment.  If the criminal law is to be changed, in my opinion, it should not be changed piecemeal.  It should not be changed in relation to one offence without creating it right across the board.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be able to tell me whether the criminal law has been changed but I do not think it has.  In criminal prosecutions at the moment the accused person can go into the witness box and his counsel can make an alibi on the hearing when his defence is open for the first time.  He need not have given <Col N="2419" /> any particulars of that alibi to the prosecution.  If this is going to be changed it should be changed right across the board because it is wrong to change fundamental principles of criminal law piecemeal.  If I am up to date with my criminal law, this is a new departure and an attempt to change a fundamental principle in criminal law piecemeal.  I am against that.  I will put down an amendment on Report Stage to delete paragraph (b).</P>
    <P>When I read this section I saw that the definition of &ldquo;loan&rdquo; provided a loophole in the Bill.  I wrote opposite it &ldquo;escape hatch&rdquo; because I thought it could be used to get outside the CRV system.  The Minister proposed to close the gap by simply removing the definition of &ldquo;loan&rdquo;.  By doing that he interfered with perfectly legitimate transactions of bridging loans, not from a bank or a building society, but where it was simply a temporary loan until a person could sell his house or his land or even have his money transferred from another country.  That is not the Minister's intention.  When he has another look at this he will find a way of closing that loophole without imposing hardship on perfectly legitimate transactions by individuals who are in no way concerned with the long-term loan properly so called.  What the Minister wants to do here is to ensure that all long-term loans, if they are for three years and extended to six and so on, will not be permitted.  If we accept the CRV system, which I do not as it is here, then the Minister is right, but in closing that loophole he cannot be allowed to intrude on the private transactions of individuals who are able to finance their own house purchasing or house building without resorting to lending agencies, other than for a very short, temporary period.</P>
    <P>As I said, one could make a very long speech about this section.  We have done our best to deal with this in Committee by way of amendment.  I have now given my views on the section, and we will have an opportunity of discussing the effects of CRVs as related to lending for houses when we come to section 20.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is to be commended on the progress made on this section.  The Minister proposes to be reasonable about some of the points and that is the way legislation could be carried out.  I am a great believer in discussing matters across the House and sensible views, no matter from which side of the House they come, should be accepted and an effort made to try to meet them.</P>
      <P>What I am not very happy about is the question of the CRVs.  I believe there will be the greatest difficulty in operating the new CRV proposals.  Staffing problems will be very great.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is quite correct when he talks about the fact that we have gone completely out of building normally priced houses.  The type of houses being built now are what were formerly referred to as luxury houses.  A large number of people have gone into luxury type houses.  One of the main reasons why the prices of houses has gone up is that the smaller type houses are not being built and the demand for them cannot be met.</P>
      <P>With regard to the CRVs, it was always difficult to get contractors to display their price on the site, as they are bound to do by law.  I harried the officials in an effort to get the builders to do that.  There are hundreds of sites throughout this country where a price may or may not be displayed, where the sale terms are advertised and where the CRV is ignored completely.  That is happening now.  What is likely to happen when this legislation goes into operation?  The Minister is piling up a lot of trouble for himself and for the building industry.  The net result of the passing of this Act will be that the situation in the building industry will be chaotic.  That is not the intention of the Minister or his officials who advised him.  I ask him to be careful about what he does before the next stage.  I hope he will consider the points raised in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has referred, rightly, to the question of the loan and the limits on loans because of the CRV being necessary for the purpose of getting a loan.  The fellow who has a farm which might possibly be sold and from <Col N="2421" /> which he could raise the £20,000 or £25,000 can therefore get a loan from a bank.  It is proposed to consider the covering of that situation so that it will not be interfered with.  Many people have not got farms or property but they need houses badly and their jobs will not enable them to pay for houses.  They cannot raise the necessary capital unless they borrow it.  Now further obstacles are being put in the way of these people by the Department because of the CRV regulation.  That is wrong.  It is a mistake to make it more and more difficult for people to build houses for themselves or to have houses built for them.  It is quite common for a scheme of houses to be prepared and then the houses are bespoke, as was done with other things long ago.  People come along and choose the house they want and the CRV may not be obtained.</P>
    <P>If that is done under the legislation as proposed there may be a legal difficulty. The Minister refers to the date on which a person bought a local authority house as the date on which the house was vested in him, not the day on which he paid the money.  This evening the Minister told Deputy Fitzpatrick that what he was talking about with regard to these houses is when the person becomes the owner of the house and, if ownership of the house is completed before the CRV is produced, then there is an offence. That sort of thing is a bit too tricky for the ordinary person.  If I am wrong I would like the Minister to point out where I am wrong.  However, if we go by what he said the other evening, a person becomes the owner of a house when he indicates that he is purchasing the house.  Now he does not become the owner until the last deed is signed and the documents and money are handed over.  Quite innocent people who have no intention of doing anything except purchasing a house for themselves and their family will find themselves committing an offence under this Bill.  I hope the Minister will indicate what he means about this.</P>

      <P>This section deals with CRVs, their implementation and the regulations for the operation of them.

      <P>While we are critical of this section, we are not critical of CRVs.  However, with the amount of legislation and regulation that the Minister is imposing on the industry, one would get the impression, not that he is building 25,000 houses, but that he is trying to have a stranglehold on building and development and that the more impediments he can put in the way the easier that will be for him.  This is the whole basis of this legislation.  We have argued out a number of the sections and the amendments which the Minister put down.  He is going to look at some of them again.  As Deputy Tully has said, I hope that he will look at the whole legislation between now and Report Stage and that he will be fully satisfied that nothing in this section will impede the building industry from playing the very important and useful role that it is playing, has played and we hope it will continue to play in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large number of builders, particularly those who are in the industry in a small way, are very fearful that they will not be able to stay in business if the type of restrictions being imposed are implemented fully.  This is regrettable. The small builder and developer is the backbone of the industry and without him we will not develop the housing programme.  The Government tend to talk about the market force prevailing and the free society.  This section would indicate the very opposite, that the Government now want to take, technically, complete control of the building industry without having to finance it or to carry the responsibility of it.  That is unjust and unfair.  The building industry has always been the backbone of employment in this country.  When that industry is going well, employment is going well.  That was the kind of criteria that we had. However, the builders&mdash;I am not talking about the big builders&mdash;are certainly <Col N="2423" /> fearful that they may have to go out of business if these measures are brought into force.  If they are brought into force and are seen not to work properly, then it is important that the Minister take the necessary action to annul the various measures which he feels are upsetting the orderly development of the industry.</P>
    <P>Both this section and section 20 are deliberate attempts by the Government to impose their will on the industry, to stragle it and to prevent it from developing.  That is quite obvious.  When they set a target for development, that is dangerous.  It should operate on a supply and demand basis.  If we put restrictions on development the law of supply and demand will bring about much higher prices.  A scarcity will cause prices to rise, and it seems that the Government want to control the number of houses which will be built in the future because of financial constraints.  I doubt if this is the policy of the Minister for the Environment; it is much more likely to be the policy laid down by the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, people who would not be aware of housing problems.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the building industry, particularly the housing sector, will run into trouble within a very short time because of the rigid conditions being imposed on both the building and lending areas.  There was nothing to curtail land prices until we put down an amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there was a shortage of trained staff to deal with applications for CRVs.  I believe the Minister refused to accept the amendment providing for a decision on these applications within 21 days because he knows that his Department will be unable to cope with the large number of applications. There will be chaos and builders will go bankrupt.  They will not be able to dispose of houses unless they have CRVs and undue delays will cause costs to rise in some way.  If a builder does not make a profit he very quickly goes to the wall.  The matter of CRVs could have been dealt with in a simpler way which would have had the effect of keeping prices down as much as possible. <Col N="2424" /> Instead, there are many constraints here which will have the effect of increasing prices.  Costs are increasing rapidly in the housing sector and delays will tend to increase them further, thus defeating the aim of giving people reasonable value.  That is why we are so critical of this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are trying to take hold of the building industry by a backdoor method.  If they want to nationalise the industry they should say so, though it seems they want control without responsibility.  These measures will have the effect of restricting the number of houses being built, and this appears to be Government policy.  Statements on housing policy in the White Paper and those made by Ministers clearly indicate that they are anxious for a cutback.  It is difficult to force such a cutback <i>per se</i> so they have brought in legislation which will make conditions so miserable that people will be driven out of the building industry. There is much validity in this point. Builders are to be strangled by red tape and threats of large fines, and that is not the way to encourage them.</P>
    <P>When this Government came into office one area of potential employment was the building industry and they stated their intention to expand and develop it.  Now it is quite clear that they wish to restrict the housing sector in a mean way by forcing people out of business.  Houses will become scarce and as a result prices will rise.  This is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Section 20 will also impose hardship on intending purchasers which should not be allowed.  The Minister is giving himself the right to tell building societies how much they can lend on a house.  The people who have to borrow money will not have the difference between the cost of the house and the loan and therefore will not be in a position to buy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot was said on section 18 when we were discussing the amendments. I appreciate that the Minister has seen fit in relation to two amendments to give an undertaking to the House, without prejudice, to look at those amendments and to come back to us on <Col N="2425" /> Report Stage.  That is a response to reasonable argument on Committee Stage and I welcome it.  One of those two amendments referred to the cost of the site as an element in the consideration of the CRV and the other relates to the system of appeal that is open to somebody who is denied a CRV.</P>
      <P>I would like, in putting forward my arguments against this section, to look at what the Minister said on 27 June last when he introduced this Bill.  He stated in Volume 315, column 1115:</P>
      <P>To sum up, I think that section 18 will provide a comprehensive statutory framework for the operation of a form of control on the price of new houses and flats which benefit from State funds or which are financed by mortgages available from limited resources.  The section attempts to strike a fair balance between the interest of the public authorities, the householder, the builder and lending agencies.</P>
      <P>I do not believe anybody on this side of the House, especially Members of the Labour Party, have any argument whatsoever with the objectives defined in that quotation I have given from the Minister's speech.  The reasonable objective of section 18 has been explicitly supported by us.  We have said that the principle of the CRV has not been or will not be in question as far as we are concerned but that, subject to the two amendments to which I referred, the method of administration and assessment as set out in the amended section will not reach the objectives which the Minister set out in the quotation I have just given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe it is the Minister's intention to screw up the building industry or to cause the kind of difficulties that have been represented to us.  The Minister can readily understand that the building industry do not come to the Labour Party to seek protection.  It is a mistake when talking about the building industry to think that it is a sectional interest within the community controlled by a minority of people.  There are vast numbers of craftsmen and their families who depend on the vitality of that industry for their livelihood.  The house <Col N="2426" /> building section is the largest part of that industry.  Those are people removed from this House, from administration and from other stages of consideration of those matters whether in the National Prices Commission or in the appeals board.  Those people are expressing concern in very real terms.  Their concern is that the CRV system, as administered, does not work satisfactorily.  It only applies to approximately 30 per cent of the total number of houses constructed.  It will now effectively extend to 100 per cent of the houses constructed.</P>
    <P>The system of administration has not been significantly modified by the Minister in his approach to the various amendments put down to section 18. The basic reservation expressed by the company whose submission I read out yesterday claimed among other things, that the refusal of the Department to give the reasons for their refusal of an application for a CRV made it almost impossible for a builder to calculate within reason in terms of time, programme and the rest of it what the prospects were and where he was in relation to organising his finance and sales and, consequently, organising his economic viability.</P>
    <P>I know that this section has been dealt with by the Minister, by Deputy Fitzpatrick and by my colleague, Deputy Tully.  I prefer to deal with what I consider is the major objection to section 18 as far, as the Labour Party are concerned. We have yet to get sufficient reassurance from the Minister that there is not a state of war between him and the CIF, that the industry is not concerned with the implementation of this section, that there will be no distortion in the housing market as a component of the building industry.  All of my comments are made in the context of a housing strategy with which the Labour Party fundamentally disagree.  We fundamentally disagree with the way the Government are pursuing housing objectives at the moment.  It is wrong, economically and socially; and in planning and environmental terms, to say nothing about the energy conservation content, it is wrong as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the majority to pursue <Col N="2427" /> a housing strategy.  While I disagree with that strategy I would argue that whatever strategy he elects to pursue should at least be pursued with professional and administrative expertise and competence.  The CIF cannot be described exactly as Marxist-Leninist at the best of times.  After the pronouncements which came from the Rotary Club in Bray last night they could hardly qualify for inclusion in the selected works of Left Wing thinking.  When I see the CIF, with their present leadership, expressing in a press statement major reservations about the applications of the CRV, when I hear the Minister refuting in the Second Stage debate that there are a number of misleading comments in that press statement, as he did on 27 June last, and when they in turn state they have nothing to add, when they place advertisements in the newspapers that they are calling meetings to discuss the implications of the Bill, I am fearful that the selected housing strategy, with which the Labour Party fundamentally disagree, is not going to be successful. Failure in housing is to the advantage of nobody, and certainly it is not to the advantage of people who are forced into trying to buy a house in the private sector because of a conscious political strategy on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>A claim was made by the building societies in a submission to me and which was also submitted to the Minister, according to the covering note I received from Mr. James Malone, secretary of the Irish Building Societies' Association.  It is a very serious claim and I should like to put it on the record of the House.  I understand that part of it has already been put on the record of the House, but in case there is any doubt about it I shall read it into the record now.  It is dated 27 June, the day the Minister spoke, and it reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Association was informed at a meeting on 17 May 1979 attended by officials of the Departments of the Environment, Finance and Economic Planning and Development that the societies had too much money and that the Government had decided, following <Col N="2428" /> an independent research, that the number of houses to be built each year should not exceed 25,000 houses.</P>
    <P>That is an extraordinarily serious charge for any organisation to make and I do not think that the Building Societies' Association made that charge lightly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to find reasons why the Minister refused to accede to a system of administering the CRVs that will allay some of the fears of the private sector building industry so that they can continue to pursue their objectives of building, in the words of their director, &ldquo;as much houses as could be possible in the private sector&rdquo; and, as we heard in the words of the director on the radio this morning, &ldquo;reduce State involvement to virtually zero if that were possible&rdquo;.  Therefore, one would naturally boost the private sector.  The parties to do this job in the construction industry will be the CIF and the private sector, but yet there is this state of war between the two of them.  The Minister has proved quite reasonable and amenable in this House and I am trying to understand why he insists on refusing to accept a reasonable amendment that would make the administration of the CRV system more in line with that of the planning permission procedure, that would make it more acceptable to the building industry in general and specifically to the organisation whose <Col N="2429" /> submission to me I read out in the House yesterday.  Among other things it called for itemisation in the case of refusals of CRVs.  When we discussed the section relating to appeals to the Circuit Court I made a point in relation to the implications of making an appeal when a person does not know the reasons for refusal.  I am pleased to note yet again that the Minister undertook to look at the whole matter.</P>
      <P>The reason I deliberately brought this statement into this debate is because it is a serious charge put into a formal submission to political representatives&mdash;I know the submission went to the three parties.  The Irish Building Societies' Association have assets in excess of £700 million and they do not make allegations lightly.  They do not go to a meeting with three Government Departments without at least two or three of their people there so that they know exactly what happened. I am not for a moment suggesting that anyone in the Custom House claims that 25,000 houses was enough, that there should be no more each year, that the building societies had too much money and that they should not get any more.  I do not for a moment suggest that that claim came from the Minister himself, from the Minister of State or from the Custom House.  But in the total madness of that claim I cannot help but recognise the dulcet tones either of the Minister for Finance or of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. I should like the Minister to take this opportunity at least to cover himself and his Department and, consequently, every Fianna Fáil councillor and to state, that under a Fianna Fáil administration nobody in the Department of the Environment claimed that 25,000 houses per annum were enough or that the building societies had too much money.  The European elections were bad enough but if the Government go into the next election with that around their neck, even a seasoned campaigner like Deputy Killilea will have more than enough to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The section is a long one and there have been a number of amendments to it.  To sum up, I cannot think of any reason for the Government to pursue <Col N="2431" /> this strategy and for not giving reasons for refusing CR Vs.  I have either listened to or read all the arguments put forward by the Minister in this regard but I remain unconvinced.  The Department, and the Minister who is the one responsible politically in this House, have sufficient understanding of the industry and have been subject to enough pressure to understand the points which have been made.  In the circumstances one is forced to look elsewhere for reasons for section 18 being pursued.  To that end I, as a political representative here, must bring to the attention of the House the very serious charge made in that submission of the Irish Building Societies' Association and ask the Minister to ensure that so far as he and his officials are concerned&mdash;and the officials were referred to specifically in the submission&mdash;the charge cannot justifiably be made.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, in the various Government Green Papers and White Papers in respect of housing achievements there was reference to a range of between 21,000 and 28,000 per annum, but it seems that that range is being reduced by 3,000.  Because of its length, if nothing else, this section merits more attention than any other but there may be some desire to shift housing funds from the house-building sector to other areas where the economic experts within the Government think these funds could be used more profitably.</P>
    <P>I am inviting the Minister to refute clearly, if possible, the submission made by the Irish Building Societies' Association in relation to that charge and also, now that he has an amended section before him and since he has rightly offered to consider a number of points for Report Stage, to reconsider the whole question of not giving reasons for the refusal of CRVs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> When dealing with section 18 I omitted to make the point in relation to section (2) that: a building society may not make a loan in respect of a new house unless the applicant furnishes either a certificate of reasonable value or a certificate of exemption.  The section <Col N="2432" /> provides that a building society shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £10,000. However, it is not clear from the section as to the time when the certificate must be handed over, whether, for instance, it must be furnished when the loan is approved or when the loan is paid.  I expect that that is a matter for the lender, who would not part with the money until the certificate is handed over; but there would be difficulty here because the lender may not know until the very last moment and when the transaction is being closed whether a certificate is to be available.  That would create practical problems for lenders in that they would not know whether the transaction would ever be completed.  There would be practical difficulties also for the borrower, because if he receives the certificate only at the last moment he will not know until then whether he will get the loan. Therefore, there is a need to clarify the position regarding the handing over either of a CRV or of a certificate of exemption.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested, and I have made this point before, that the CRV should be tied in some way to the planning permission.  I know that it would not be possible to get a CRV at the time of obtaining planning permission because the House might not be built for a long time afterwards, but the planning permission should be granted subject to a CRV being made available in respect of any house built on the site that was the subject of the planning permission. In this way everybody concerned would know where he stood from the moment planning permission was obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I clarified that point yesterday.  It is entirely a matter for the building societies as to when they decide to ask that a CRV be furnished.  There is nothing to prevent building societies from giving approval for loans subject to their being furnished with a CRV.  The important factor is that they do not make the loan available until such time as a CRV has been furnished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not my intention to make a Second Stage type speech now, but during the debate on this section we have heard about allegations made by the building <Col N="2433" /> societies.  The next section deals with the question of building societies and that will provide me with an opportunity to refute these allegations.  I shall have opportunities also to deal with this alleged war between myself and the CIF.  I am not aware that the weapons have been drawn but I am aware that advertisements have appeared in the public press that were inaccurate in many respects.  I shall clear these points up on the appropriate section.  What we are proposing here is a strengthening of the very worthwhile CRV system.  From the observations made by the Fine Gael Deputies during this debate one can only wonder whether they are for or against the CRV system.</P>

      <P>I will give the Deputies an instance of an effect that the CRV system has had.  During 1978 new applications for CRVs amounted to 1,356. At the end of the year the amount of money that house purchasers were saved by way of reductions in prices amounted to £1,173,000.  Is that an indictment of the system that I am merely strengthening for the benefit of house purchasers? That figure is one that we can be proud of.  We saved house purchasers from being the victims of those excessive profits.  I am not accusing all members of the CIF in this respect.  There are many builders who are not even in the confederation. There are decent, honourable, responsible builders but, as the elected Government, we have the right to protect the consumer, in this instance house purchasers, mainly young people, young couples, and we will continue to do that.  It is laughable to see the crocodile tears being shed for the building industry.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There is no doubt where the Fine Gael Party stand in regard to the control of house prices.  We are 100 per cent in favour of the protection of house purchasers.  That has been our attitude all along.  We believe it is the business of the Government to organise things in such a way that houses will be available for purchase at a reasonable price.  We want a worthwhile CRV system.  On this very section we tried to persuade and encourage the Minister to include land, but he resisted that.  We take the view that it is utterly impossible to control house prices without controlling the price of land on which houses are built&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 18, line 2, after &ldquo;made&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;,other than conditions in relation to the rate of interest chargeable on a loan&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide expressly that the question of the mortgage rate applicable to building society loans shall not come within the scope of regulations made under section 77 of the Building Societies Act, <Col N="2436" /> 1976, as amended by section 20 of the Bill.  The Irish Building Societies' Association have represented that the term &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; on page 18, line 2, would undoubtedly be interpreted to include the interest rate on mortgages which in turn dictates the rate which societies can offer to investors.  The Minister does not wish to have statutory control over mortgage rates.  It is considered that the Minister could not invoke section 77 of the 1976 Act, as amended, for the purpose of imposing specific controls over investment rates.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 20, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> We have given notice that we are opposing section 20 because we think that, instead of making more money available for house building, it will have the opposite effect.  Section 20 proposes to amend section 77 of the Building Societies Act, 1976, in a number of ways.  It proposes to give the Minister power to interfere in the working of the building societies by regulation having regard to the demand for loans for house purchase and having regard to the financial needs of the national housing programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was being enacted in 1976 it was proposed to put those words into section 77.  There was a long and learned debate in the Seanad.  Amongst other Senators, Senator Brian Lenihan and Senator Eoin Ryan strongly opposed the insertion of the words &ldquo;having regard to the financial needs of the national housing programme&rdquo;.  After a long discussion the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, agreed to withdraw those words and put down an amendment accordingly.  The Bill was amended.  The strongest, loudest and most persuasive arguments in favour of the amendment, and in favour of those words being excluded, came from Senator Brian Lenihan who is now Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, then Leader of the Seanad, supported strongly by Senator Eoin Ryan, the present Leader of the Seanad.  Those arguments <Col N="2437" /> are on record and I do not propose to take up the time of the House by going into them.</P>
    <P>Over the years, building societies have organised their business in a way which commands the respect and confidence of the investing public, particularly small investors.  The best evidence of that is that at present the funds available to building societies are something like £700 million.  The Minister is proposing to take control of the building societies and to direct them to order their business as he thinks fit.  The new subsection which it is proposed to insert in section 30 of the Building Societies Act, 1976 reads as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) If any officer, member or agent of the society refuses to produce to the inspector any book or document which it is his duty under this section to produce or refuses to answer any question put to him by the inspector with respect to the affairs of the society, he shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>He will be subject to the penalties provided.</P>
    <P>The amendment to section 77 of the Building Societies Act, 1976, is to be done by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Whenever the Minister considers it expedient, in the interests of the orderly and proper regulation of building society business and having regard to the demand for loans for house purchase and the financial needs of the national housing programme, he may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and after consultation with the Registrar, make regulations in relation to the purposes and amounts of loans by societies and the conditions subject to which such loans may be made.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In order to clarify the position the Minister found it necessary to introduce the last amendment by adding:</P>
    <P>other than conditions in relation to the rate of interest chargeable on a loan.</P>
    <P>As the section stood originally the <Col N="2438" /> Minister would have had authority to direct the building societies as to the amount of interest they should charge. As it stands now the section virtually amounts to the nationalising of the building societies, nothing more or less. It might be all right to take such action if the Minister or the Government were providing the capital being used by the building societies but that is not the case. Building societies rely for their cash flow on the investing public.  The Minister's amendment virtually hands over to him, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, the right to make regulations in relation to the purposes for which they shall grant loans and the amounts and conditions subject to which the loans shall be granted.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has that power he may regulate the amount of loans building societies shall give and the amount of money they shall lend in any year.  He is virtually taking over control of the building societies.  In my view the effect of that will be to slow down drastically, if not completely dry up, the inflow of investments into the societies.  If that happens it will be a bad day for those who are anxious to borrow money to build houses.  Building societies in the past carried out their business in a responsible way, even before the Minister gave directions to them in August last as to how they should lend money and the amounts of the loans they should give. For all practical purposes they complied with the criteria set out by the Minister. For example, one building society had advanced 1,880 loans not exceeding £10,000, 2,566 loans not exceeding £20,000 and only 115 loans exceeding £20,000.  That was virtually complying with the wishes of the Minister.  This all-embracing and controlling section 20 will have a bad effect on the inflow of investment money into the societies.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the phrase, &ldquo;Whenever the Minister considers it expedient, in the interests of the orderly and proper regulation of building society business and having regard to the demand for loans for house purchase and the financial needs of the national housing programme&rdquo;.  What does the Minister mean by that phrase because he <Col N="2439" /> did not mention, for example, local authority housing programmes?  According to my information the Government have a national housing programme which was established after extensive independent research they had carried out.  They decided that not more than 25,000 houses should be built.  When I made a similar statement during the debate on section 18 the Minister denied it.  I believe the Departments of Finance and Economic Planning and Development were involved in that research.  As a result of the adoption of that housing programme the Government feel that the building societies have too much money and believe that they should regulate the way that money is used.  They conveyed that information to the societies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>That research was carried out in 1976 but the Department of Economic Planning and Development had not been set up then.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> On May 17 1979 the building societies were informed by the Departments of the Environment, Finance and Economic Planning and Development that they had too much money and that the Government had decided, following an independent research, that the number of houses to be built each year should not exceed 20,000.  When one couples that with the phrase, &ldquo;and the financial needs of the national housing programme&rdquo;, one sees the sinister significance of the Minister taking power to control the number and the amount of loans and the purposes for which loans should be made by the building societies.  It is obvious that for some reason, known to themselves, the Government believe that people are too well housed.  They obviously believe that the working classes are too well housed, because they set out in one paper after another that there will be less need for local authority building.  That cannot be denied.  It started away back in the 1960s in a publication of theirs and has been carried forward in their publications on social and economic programmes since they came into power.  They <Col N="2440" /> are now going a step further.  They think too much money is being spent on housing in the private sector and they are going to take power to control the activities of the building societies to see that no more than a given number of houses are built.  That comes very badly from a Government that can find money for a variety of things, such as abolishing the wealth tax and other extravagant manifesto objects.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I oppose the section because it will undermine confidence in building societies.  I congratulate the Minister on the fact that in recent years there has been a big inflow of money into building societies.  Some of that came from across the water following our entry into the EMS system.  The money is there and we should do nothing to frighten it away from the building societies who are doing a good job.  Our giving authority to the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make regulations to direct building societies as to how much money they should lend and as to their conditions is the best way to undermine the confidence of the investing public in the building societies.  The results of that will be disastrous for the housing construction industry and for young people who wish to buy houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions I am now objecting to were written into the Bill in 1976, but on reconsideration the then Minister belatedly introduced an amendment which had the full support of the Fianna Fáil Party, who at that time were loud in their advice to the Minister as to the damage that would be done by interference from him or the bureaucracy into the working of the building societies. I could go on and on and remain in order.  I am totally against the section and have been from the minute I saw it. The reference to the financial needs of the national housing programme, when related to the information given to the building societies on 17 May 1979 that the Government thought that they had too much money and had decided that not more than 25,000 houses a year should be built, and by implication that the Government would make regulations to ensure that less houses would be built, is a disgraceful approach to a problem <Col N="2442" /> that has blistered this country for centuries&mdash;bad housing and lack of housing. Just when the people are emerging from their hovels the Government take this view.  What they will do with the money I do not know, but the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will rule me out of order if I attempt to tell them what they should not do with the money which would be much better spent on housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to limiting houses, anyone who looks at the Government Green and White Papers will see that the target is for between 23,000 and 27,000 houses a year.  In relation to the reference made to a circular from the secretary of the Building Societies Association to 25,000 houses, it was also mentioned to the building societies that the Government target was between 23,000 and 27,000 houses per year and that it would be better in the interests of the house building trade to have a steady flow of houses each year in the region of 25,000 rather than to build many more houses as a result of the extra deposits made to the building societies this year, which amount to £100 million more than last year.  If all this money was suddenly poured into the housing business it would lead to a terrible over-heating.  To some extent there is already over-heating.  It is common knowledge that it is very difficult to find blocklayers, for instance, in most parts of the country.  They are not there and are becoming more expensive to hire. The real reason for the scarcity is because in the last four or five years many young people do not get involved in apprenticeships to learn the trade.  In 1978 there was a 14 per cent increase in production by the building industry and 7,000 new jobs were created.  In this year alone it seems that there will be a further 7 per cent increase and a further 2,000 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the accusations that have been made against me and the Government for putting the building industry at risk, very few in the building industry would agree with that allegation. The industry was in a sorry state between 1974 and 1977, and anybody who wishes to be fair will readily agree with me in that.  The industry was badly <Col N="2443" /> run down, but because of the action taken by this Government on returning to power we virtually lifted the building industry, which was coming to a halt, out of the gutter.  The facts are that there was a 14 per cent increase in output last year and 7,000 new jobs and that there will be a further 7 per cent increase on that this year plus 2,000 new jobs.</P>
    <P>With regard to what has been said about what happened in 1976 and the conditions prevailing at that time, it can be argued that circumstances have changed quite a lot since that time.  At that time the building societing were co-operating with the Government's wishes in relation to lending policies.  Even when societies did not agree with the policies pursued by the Government they were always willing to operate them on an experimental basis until the effects of those policies could be determined.</P>
    <P>In addition, an interest subsidy was payable in respect of shares and deposits in building societies during the period from May 1973 to February 1976.  The Government were able to influence the lending policies of the societies during that period by way of attaching conditions to the payment of the subsidy. Conditions attaching to the subsidy included, from time to time, a maximum limit on the amount of all building society loans and conditions requiring societies to devote a specified proportion of their lending for the purchase of new houses.  Since then the subsidy payable on the shares and deposits of building societies has been terminated.  From an administrative point of view it is no longer possible to enforce conditions relating to lending policy.  This situation of itself, would be acceptable if an adequate degree of co-operation was forthcoming from societies in relation to the Government's priorities in the field of housing finance.  The situation now is that the Government are resolved to take action to protect house purchasers from unnecessarily high prices by extending the scope of the CRV system, ensuring that the maximum benefit is derived from the total supply of mortgage finance available.</P>
    <P>In August 1978 I asked the societies <Col N="2444" /> to operate for a trial period certain arrangements in relation to the apportionment of their loans.  I asked them also to require a CRV to be furnished by all applicants for loans not exceeding £16,000 for the purchase of new houses.  The majority of societies undertook&mdash;although reluctantly in some cases&mdash;to operate these arrangements for a trial period. But three societies including one major one, failed to do so.  This produced a situation in which the societies that were complying with the Government's request were put at a serious disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> those that were not.  Such a situation is not very acceptable from a building society point of view and certainly not acceptable to the Government.</P>
    <P>Some doubts were expressed about the scope of section 77 (1) of the Building Societies Act 1976 in that it enables regulations to be made only in relation to the amounts and purposes of loans.  In order to remove any doubts as to the validity of making regulations which contained the requirement in relation to CRVs, for example, or any other matters considered appropriate, it is now proposed that section 77 (1) be amended and extended to the effect that regulations made under that section could relate not alone to the amounts and purposes of building society loans but also to the conditions under which such loans may be made.  The purpose of this is to close that loophole.  What the building societies were asked to do last August was in the interests of house purchasers. It did not mean a very big change for the societies.  Three societies were not prepared to co-operate and one of them was a major society.  Let me say that the major building societies that did cooperate&mdash;here I might express my appreciation of their co-operation&mdash;were very perturbed, annoyed and concerned at the action being taken by the other major societies because, as they saw it, it was placing them in an unfair situation. If there is anything wrong with tightening up or closing that loophole, in the interest of house purchasers and indeed the societies themselves&mdash;in the event of a similar situation recurring&mdash;giving me, or whatever Minister might be in office power to make the regulations which hopefully would be beyond dispute legally, <Col N="2445" /> and as we see it anyway they would be beyond legal dispute, I fail to see it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the contributions of the Minister and of Deputy Fitzpatrick on this section.  I am interested to note that the Minister did not define specifically the phrase which appears to give the Building Societies' Association a certain degree of concern, and which gave his colleague, Senator Eoin Ryan, a lot of concern in the Seanad in 1976, that is, the definition of the national housing programme.  The Bill states that &ldquo;Having regard to... and then the financial needs of the national programme.&rdquo;  I have an idea of what I would mean by that statement. But it would be very useful if the Minister could define what he and the Government have in mind when they refer to that, because he used the phrase in his Second Stage speech when he talked about it.  That is one point warranting clarification.</P>
      <P>The first part of section 20 does not cause me any trouble whatsoever; it seems to me to be logical and correct that if one is to make the CRV system work at all&mdash;and we have no argument in principle against it&mdash;if one is to make it a condition of the lending agencies to implement it, then one must have access to the societies making this money available.  Let us not forget that the societies making this money available are doing so in the context of substantial tax benefits by way of mortgage relief to taxpayers, or tax relief to depositors.  It should be remembered also that the people who get a loan from a building society&mdash;although frequently they do not realise it at the time of signing the mortgage deed&mdash;get a considerable mortgage subsidy from the community at large to enable them house themselves.  It is right and proper that the Minister should have this power to inspect the books, to ensure that the administration of the law in regard to section 20 is properly carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is much more serious and ominous about the manner in which the financial capital resources of this country are managed is the implication of the amendment of section 77 of the <Col N="2446" /> principal Building Societies Act of 1976. Quite frankly, the Minister's statement in the House this evening does not allay the fears of the Building Societies' Association to which we have referred before.  The Chair and the rest of us would be saved a lot of time if the Minister could concentrate specifically on this point in his reply.  The implications&mdash;within the context of the Right Wing strategy the Government have opted to pursue&mdash;of getting this part of the strategy wrong in terms of managerial competence are frightening for people who seek to house themselves. One must be wary of a housing strategy which curtails local authority housing, in the interests of reducing public expenditure, suggesting that people endeavour to house themselves in the private sector by means of private loans principally through the building societies, because insurance companies, of which some members of the other House and members of another Party are common members have simply refused to become involved in house loans.  Building societies by and large are the only serious lending agencies in the private sector who, in turn, depend on depositors putting money into the societies so that their managers can make funds available for house purchase.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if in the mixed economy at present being operated by Fianna Fáil, they interfere with the credit institutions, appear to interfere or give the impression that they are taking upon themselves power to interfere, then they are seriously putting at risk the confidence of the people who would move in the financial market.</P>
    <P>The volatility of the fiscal market depends as much on the atmosphere of competence in the investment climate as it does on anything else.  It is quite irrational. It is quite crazy in many ways. There is no better example of the total irrationality of capitalism than the response of the British and Irish stock exchanges to the success or failure of horses in the grand national or the health of prime ministers, the collapse of the weather or where Skylab hits the ground, but we are stuck with it.  We are <Col N="2447" /> stuck with the building societies depending on thousands of small investors making investment decisions on the basis of where they see their deposits being secure.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a real obligation in this regard.  I am sure it is not his intention to screw the building societies.  If his actions result in the building societies becoming scared and communicating that fear to the public to the extent that the funds invested in the societies and made available for house purchase might be diverted, then we have a very serious situation on our hands.  I am not confident in this Government's capacity to manage our financial affairs in macro fiscal terms.  I can see reasons for trying to relate the flow of funds to the building societies and to a national housing programme.</P>
    <P>An article in the Business Section of the <i>Sunday Observer</i> correlates conclusively the rise in house prices to the availability of funds as much as to the actual demand for houses.  The Minister should specifically define what is meant by the phraseology in the second part of this amendment.  That is the hinge on which turns a lot of the fear expressed in the building societies submission.  If that cannot be adequately explained, I fear for the people who have been pushed over the edge into the private sector, seeking houses in a very cold climate, at a time when building society interest rates are rising and where the capacity of the building societies to make funds available depends on deposits.  If people do not invest, house purchasers will be cold in every sense of the word.</P>
    <P>The Minister blithely stepped over the fact that the co-operation of the building societies from May 1973 to 1976 was obtained without any difficulty and that the building societies, even though they may not necessarily have agreed with the housing strategy of the Government of the day, sought to implement it and to co-operate.  Because that Government attempted to reduce the cost of interest to the mortgagees by subsidising part of it, they got the best of both worlds by, first, reducing the cost of housing and therefore reducing the CPI, and second, <Col N="2448" /> by giving a direct subsidy to the building societies who were able to attach certain conditions which, in turn, made this kind of condition unnecessary.  I would like the Minister to explain precisely what is meant by the phrase used in the Bill and in his Second Stage speech.  How does he see it in operation?  What assessment, if any, has been made to the likely flow of funds into or out of the building societies as a consequence of the expressed fears of the Building Societies' Association?</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to say that, because there has been a massive flood of funds into the building societies in the past year, it is evidence of a marked confidence by the societies and by depositors in the Government's attitude. We do not intend turning this debate into a financial debate, but we all know why much of this money was invested in building societies today.  If investors had a second chance and did not believe the economic nonsense put forward by the Minister for Finance at that time&mdash;and which is superbly documented in today's edition of <i>Hibernia</i>&mdash;they would be better off.  They would be far wealthier if they had kept their money in sterling. Let us leave the flow of money into the building societies before and after our entry into EMS aside from the normal performance of the building societies as repositories for small depositors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The second part of this section is very worrying.  Building societies have always been responsible bodies and even now they are still acting responsibly.  In 1976 the Government tried to introduce the same legislation. The Minister said times were different then and that it was not necessary.  In the Seanad the Minister of the day made the necessary amendments to meet requests from the Fianna Fáil Party who were very concerned that &ldquo;meddling&rdquo; from various Departments would have an adverse effect on building societies. This legislation is not new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1976 good sense prevailed and the Bill was withdrawn, the Minister obviously being his own man.  I believe the Department of Finance are responsible for this because they like to get their tentacles into everything that is financial <Col N="2449" /> and to control everything.  The Minister said that because one major building society did not accede to his request in August, he was forced to take this action. I do not accept that explanation.  If one looks at the record of that society, not just for last year but for the first quarter of this year, one will see that they have kept within the Minister's parameters.  That should be his main concern.  For the first quarter of this year there were 924 loans under £13,000 and the average loan granted was £10,584, 42 per cent; £13,000 to £16,000, 458 and the average was £14,293; £16,000 to £20,000, 272, and the average £18,331; over £20,000, 71, and the average was £24,000.  The average loan across the board was £13,375.  In one's wildest imagination one could not say that that building society flouted the Minister's wishes.  We are talking about the first quarter of this year, and the Minister says that the average house price in Dublin is £20,000 and they are talking about an average loan in the first quarter of £13,000.  This is what worries me.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he is introducing this legislation to deal basically with this building society.  If I thought that this building society were acting against the wishes of the Minister from the point of view of lending money for the upper end of the housing area then I would agree with him.  However, when one examines the facts they fall down miserably and we have to look elsewhere for the reasons why this legislation is introduced. The section says:</P>
    <P>...having regard to the demand for loans for house purchase and the financial needs of the national housing programme,...</P>
    <P>The national housing programme is the pertinent point here and on foot of this legislation the Minister can now instruct building societies to strike certain figures.  As I said earlier with regard to the CRV's, this is another way to restrict building.  Restriction of the amount of loans can cut down demand.  Any undue interference from Government into financial agencies such as the building societies is dangerous.  People may become suspicious and afraid that the <Col N="2450" /> building society are not their own masters, that the members have not really any great say and that on the whim of a Minister at any time serious changes can be made by order which can affect a building society adversely.  That interference would not necessarily lead to money not being invested but there could be a serious outflow of funds which would be a disaster.</P>
    <P>Where a Minister instructs people to co-operate with him and one out of a number of major groups do not co-operate he should not then rush before this House with legislation.  The Minister said that the other building societies were at a disadvantage because this building society could operate in its own way.  What is he doing now?  Because of one building society he is bringing in legislation that is going to impede the building societies who are co-operating with him.  It is very unfair that the building societies who are prepared to co-operate are now being penalised because of one building society.  Surely the way to have done it would have been to send for this building society and lay it on the line in another way.  But no, we introduce rather insidious legislation that can have serious consequences for the building societies.</P>
    <P>Nobody can point a finger at the building societies in this country.  They have always been responsible and forthcoming and they have played a major role in the private housing sector. Now, when they have done a good job, the Minister is introducing bad legislation and his reasons are not good.  One could say that his reasons are vindictive because one major group who kicked are going to be brought to heel.  We are going to teach these people not to disobey the wishes of a Minister or a Government.  We will bring them into line and we will bring everybody else into line too.  That is not the way to act in the area of finance.  People are free to place their money anywhere they like.  If we are to have this undue and unnecessary interference it will be to the detriment of the national housing programme. I say that regretfully.</P>
    <P>It does not make sense that the Minister wants to take this power on <Col N="2451" /> himself.  In his speech he was not convincing, because there is no reasonable argument for bringing in this legislation. I ask him to do what was done by the previous Minister who introduced this but saw the folly of it when a colleague, who is now a Minister and was a Senator and was very much opposed to it, was loud in his condemnation of this part of the section which is now being inserted. I cannot understand the rationale of the Minister in doing this except that it is purely vindictiveness because one society did not toe the line.  I would agree with the Minister if I saw this building society operating at the upper end generally, but the situation is the very opposite.  They are operating at the lower end.  Their average loan for the first quarter of this year was £13,375. That was prudent and moderate and the Minister can have no cavil there. However, apparently he has.  They were not good boys.</P>
    <P>The Minister should exercise good sense here.  This Bill was brought in at an inopportune time towards the end of a session.  There was an attempt to rush it through this House with the threat that if it did not go through we would not be in recess by a certain time.  It is not easy to recall this House to validate amendments in the Seanad.  The time to make changes is now and on Report Stage.  As that Stage will not be taken until Tuesday next it behoves the Minister to look at this again and to consider the body whom he wishes to restrict, to examine his conscience and to ask himself whether this group of building societies have been irresponsible.  In the light of the figures of the society who have kicked, even they have been more than responsible. I am at a loss to know why the Minister will not now withdraw this and have the goodwill of the building societies and show confidence in them. There is a registrar who, surely, at all times can keep his eye on them to ensure that the wishes of the Minister are being met.</P>
    <P>This type of co-operation is required, not draconian legislation which can lead only to disaster.  Basically we are <Col N="2452" /> taking away from building societies the responsibility of regulating what is required for the market.  They have not failed throughout the years and have been responsible and effective.  It is because of the inflow of cash that the Department of Finance want to get their tentacles into this area?  I am disappointed the Minister did not indicate that he would withdraw this legislation to amend section 77.  Hopefully between now and Report Stage he will have second thoughts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Brien has been saying that the Department of Finance want these new controls under section 20.  It is I and the Government who want this section, not just the Minister for Finance or his Department.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Quinn's point about the inflow of money and its effects, the agreed measures which we brought in last August did not have a detrimental effect on the inflow of cash. Admittedly deposits grew rapidly in November, December and early January and a percentage of this would undoubtedly have been EMS money.  The total figure of investment for the first six months of this year was £113 million, while in the corresponding months last year the figure was £42 million.  There was some EMS investment in the early part of the year but this came to an end, perhaps before February.  Taking the months March, April, May and June, the inflow for each month was at least double the figure for the corresponding months of last year.  The bands which were set by agreement last August were in existence during that time and have not had any detrimental effect on inflow.</P>
      <P>I repeat that I got the co-operation of all the major societies, with the exception of one and two smaller societies.  All the others co-operated.  There was found to be a doubt about the 1976 Act with regard to extending the requirement for the CRV.  This copperfastens the making of regulations.  If I get the co-operation of societies with regard to any measures which will be proposed to them in the interests of borrowers, I have no intention of making regulations.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It is our desire to give the Minister Committee Stage tonight so that we may have a proper but short Report Stage on Tuesday, and I do not want to hold up the House.  However, I am fearful of the effects of this amendment on the activities of building societies.  Some people invest in building societies because they know they will qualify for a housing loan.  That right of expectation will be taken away by this enactment because they will qualify for a loan only if the Minister so decides by some regulations over which they have no control.  Other people invest in building societies because they regard such an investment as sound and believe the societies manage their business well. They will be frightened away when they see the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance interfering with the work of the building societies.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service are an admirable body of people who serve the country very well to the best of their expertise, but their training does not qualify them to act as bankers or to run building societies.  They suffer from the one failing of being very careful and conservative. On the other hand, they know they will never run short of money because John Taxpayer is always there to come to the rescue.  The training of the bureaucracy does not qualify them to run co-operative societies.  Building societies are in the nature of co-operative or mutual societies.  I salute civil servants for their loyalty and impartiality in the way they serve successive Governments, but they only act within their training and to the extent of their expertise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People put money in the Post Office and they are not taking any risk because there is a fixed rate of interest and capital is always secure.  The same can be said of investment in other State enterprises such as the ACC or the ESB. If building societies are profitable and well run their capital will be safe and they will get a good return.  If the societies are badly run people could lose their capital.  Any tinkering with such bodies is playing with fire as far as the investing public are concerned.  I am satisfied that shrewd investors will think <Col N="2454" /> twice about putting their money in building societies when they realise that they are at the whim of the Minister and his advisers.</P>
    <P>I could not help but be impressed by the last contribution from Deputy O'Brien.  He completely demolished the Minister's case for bringing in this measure.  One building Society may have broken but it was only marginally out of line to the tune of something like 7 per cent.  This particular building society in 1978, before the Minister's regulations were brought in, approved of loans to the tune of £52.5 million, of which 1,080 were for sums not exceeding £10,000, 2,566 were for sums not exceeding £20,000 and 115 were for sums exceeding £20,000.  That is one of the major building societies who have influenced the Minister in bringing in this measure.  As Deputy O'Brien pointed out, the same building society, for the first quarter of this year, advanced approximately £10 million in loans under £13,000 or 42.4 per cent of their lendings.  In the same quarter they advanced loans of £6½ million in loans between £13,000 and £16,000 or an average of £14,000 per loan.  If my figures are correct, they have, therefore, advanced 70 per cent of their lendings within the Minister's criteria and may be out of line to the tune of less than 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>That building society cannot be said to be openly and flagrantly defying the wishes of the Minister.  They are behaving in a reasonable way.  It is bad policy, bad management and is not in the best interests of building societies, the investing public and house builders in general, to take the big stick to all building societies and damage their reputation.  If that is the only case the Minister has for bringing in this, he was foolish to bring it in.  It is literally taking a sledge hammer to kill a fly and could not be described as anything else.</P>

I make a last appeal to him to send for the particular building society and tell them to put their house in order.  If they again refuse I would accept that this legislation should go on but that if they agree to put their house in order he should drop it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  As the <Col N="2458" /> House is well aware the problem of remedial education is a constant one and one in which I know the Minister of State takes a personal interest and it is one in which all teachers, whether remedial teachers or not, also take a special interest.  There is more interest in it perforce in some sections of the educational system than in others and this is particularly true at second-level where the vocational system has been statistically shown to have a higher incidence of pupils with remedial needs than the secondary arm of the post-primary system.  The need for remedial teachers to cope with this problem and the deployment of remedial teachers to deal with this matter is a perennial political issue as between Members of this House and whoever happens to be Minister for Education and between the teacher unions and the Minister.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it was with considerable interest that members of the Irish Vocational Education Association at their recent meeting heard a pronouncement by the Minister for Education on this controversial matter.  It is not controversial as between the parties but it is controversial in the sense that everybody is always looking for more money for remedial teachers and no Minister for Education has been able to supply enough of them to meet the demand.</P>
      <P>The Minister addressed the Irish Vocational Education Association on Wednesday, 2 May 1979 and his speech was reported the following day in at least three papers that I have been able to trace&mdash;<i>The Irish Times, Irish Independent</i> and <i>Cork Examiner.</i> Unfortunately none of the reports gave very much detail about what the Minister proposed to do.  Not only did they not give much detail but, as far as I can make out, they did not give any direct quotations from the Minister's address on this issue.  I should like to furnish the House with the relevant quotations.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 3 May 1979 John Walshe in Dundalk reported, under the headline &ldquo;Major boost for remedial and career education&rdquo;, the following paragraphs:</P>

    <P>A major breakthrough for remedial education and career guidance <Col N="2459" /> counselling was announced last night by the Minister for Education, Mr. Wilson.</P>
    <P>He said that from the next school year remedial teachers will be appointed to vocational and other post-primary schools on an &ldquo;ex-quota&rdquo; basis that is, outside the normal allocation of teachers per school.</P>
    <P>It is understood that up to 100 remedial teachers to help slow learning pupils will be appointed this year and the number will be added to in the future.</P>
    <P>That is the sum total of the <i>Irish Independent's</i> reference to the Minister's statement.  In the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of the same date Maurice Gubbins, under the headline &ldquo;Move means jobs for teachers&rdquo;, reported:</P>
    <P>About 100 new teaching posts will result this year from a decision announced by the Minister for Education, Mr. Wilson, in Dundalk last night.  Eventually 400 jobs will be created, it is believed.</P>
    <P>Mr. Wilson informed the Irish Vocational Education Association annual conference that the appointment of remedial teachers in vocational and other post-primary schools would be ex-quota from the commencement of the school year 1979-80.</P>
    <P>The Minister told the delegates from all over the country that this move was in pursuance of his policy of giving all possible assistance to disadvantaged pupils.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i>, Christina Murphy in Dundalk, under the headline &ldquo;Remedial teachers to be freed from other duties&rdquo;, noted:</P>
    <P>In a major breakthrough in remedial education the Minister for Education, Mr. Wilson, last night announced that remedial teachers in second-level schools would be regarded as &ldquo;ex-quota&rdquo; from September next.</P>
    <P>The decision will allow remedial teachers to be freed from the normal quota of subject teaching to concentrate exclusively on remedial work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2460" /> The move should have a profound effect on remedial education.  It will mean about 100 new teaching jobs in the immediate future and could lead to 500 new jobs eventually.  Mr. Wilson announced his decision at the annual dinner of The Irish Vocational Education Association in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>All of these reports have the merit of consistency and clarity so far as they go. They all indicate that the Minister was going to release remedial teachers from subject teaching.  They all indicate that the number of teachers he had in mind to release from subject teaching in the current year was about 100.  They all indicate that the total number of teachers to be so released in some unspecified period would be about 500.</P>
    <P>However, the reports were considerably short on detail.  Since the Minister made his announcement two months ago there has been a growing concern and curiosity among the teaching staffs and the management bodies of all post-primary schools to know precisely how the scheme was going to work.  With all due respect to the Minister he is not slow to announce good news when he has it, but we have not been told precisely how many remedial teachers are to be regarded as &ldquo;ex-quota&rdquo; in this way.  For example, we have not been told whether the remedial teachers who will be regarded as &ldquo;ex-quota&rdquo; will be comprised solely of those who are at present teaching and who are undertaking subject teaching as well as their remedial duties or whether the 100 will include whatever intake there is this year from last year's remedial course. Even more importantly, we have not been told how these teachers will be allocated or how the schools will be chosen in which remedial teachers can be regarded as &ldquo;ex-quota&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have no information about the number of remedial teachers currently teaching in post-primary schools but I would hope it is more than 100.  If that is so and if the Minister is only going to allocate 100 &ldquo;ex-quota&rdquo; positions this year and allow the schools concerned to empty 100 new subject teachers to do the work previously done by the remedial teachers, he will have to decide <Col N="2461" /> that some schools will have their remedial teachers allowed &ldquo;ex-quota&rdquo; and some schools will not be so allowed.</P>
    <P>The schools want to know the position. This side of the House want to know the precise number of teachers involved, the precise timetable and the precise arrangements the Minister has in mind for the implementation of the scheme.  There is no doubt that when it was announced to the Irish Vocational Education Association&mdash;and no more appreciative audience could have been found for that kind of announcement&mdash;it was seen as a fairly substantial advance. One hundred post-primary teachers represent a fairly substantial involvement on current account, and however much we may criticise the Minister we would have to give him credit for having provided an extra 100 post-primary teachers, especially if the effect was to put 100 remedial teachers on a &ldquo;ex-quota&rdquo; basis.</P>
    <P>Now is the time for the Minister to let us know exactly how the scheme stands. If possible, he should tell us what schools can expect this largesse in the autumn and he should tell us when the final decision will be made on details of the implementation of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Tunney) Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Tunney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that Deputy Horgan welcomes the announcement made by the Minister in respect of the appointment of remedial teachers because this is a step that will bring us nearer the stage of genuine equality of opportunity in education, an aspiration about which we have been hearing so much for quite a long time. Deputy Horgan has not indulged in any narrow party approach to this question during his contribution and I should hope that he would accept what has been announced by the Minister as something to which he as spokesman for Labour has been a party.  Hopefully, in his approach to the scheme he would apply the benefit of his genuine interest and avoid any attempt at unjustified criticism or at knocking what has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will accept that, in respect of all advances made during <Col N="2462" /> the terms of office of successive Ministers, the attitude traditionally has been that there is an expression of a plan or policy prior to the announcement of the precise details of implementation. Bearing in mind that in this case the good news was announced only in May of this year, the Deputy will appreciate why the details have not been available. It is understandable that the Deputy should share with teachers and with school authorities the favourable reaction to the good news and that all concerned are now anxious that the details be announced.  However, I regret that I am not in a position to announce the precise details, but perhaps what I have to say will help to better the vision of what will happen in September of the coming school year.</P>
    <P>Consideration has been given generally to the circumstances and conditions on which remedial teachers may be appointed in schools under the new scheme.  It is my view that if the scheme is to be successful the services of these teachers should be made available for those pupils who are most in need of assistance. There is a general tendency to talk in rather loose terms of remedial education and the steps to be taken in relation to it.  But it should not be confused with the existence of the normal varying grades of intelligence or aptitudes among children comparable with the situation that exists among adults and neither should we exclude from our considerations that the normal duties of a teacher requires of him or her that the curriculum be applied and interpreted in a way that will allow those students, who by their very nature are not of equal intellectual ability, to benefit from the presentation of the various exercises. Therefore, one would hope that every teacher would regard himself as in some way a remedial teacher.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to issue within the next week or so a circular outlining the conditions of the scheme for the appointment of remedial teachers, teachers who will be in addition to the normal quota of a school.  I am sure that here again Deputy Horgan will share with me the joy of our having reached the point where remedial teachers are now ex-quota.  It is not my <Col N="2463" /> wish to anticipate the issue of the circular concerned but I am happy to give the Deputy the following information.</P>
    <P>I must be satisfied that there is a real need for remedial education in any school, a need which could not be met satisfactorily by the prevailing normal means.  In general the sanction for an appointment would be related to the availability of a teacher who not only satisfied the appropriate qualification requirements of a post-primary teacher but who also possessed either an acceptable qualification in remedial education or who would be accepted for the Department's course in remedial education for post-primary teachers in the year in question.  It may be that in very exceptional circumstances the appointment of a teacher may be approved where this condition in relation to the availability of a teacher with remedial education qualifications was not available.</P>
    <P>I would expect that teachers appointed to posts authorised in accordance with the terms of the circular to which I have referred would be required to devote at least 12 to 15 hours per week to remedial education work, work which would involve them with class groups of not more than 16 pupils and which would require of them also to devote attention to individual pupils.  I would expect also that the teachers would be available for a period of approximately three hours per week for the purpose of consultation with parents on matters to which the whole operation is pertinent and that, above all, they would be available for normal teaching duties in the school.  In brief that is a breakdown of the teacher's work.  After fulfilling these duties any teaching hours remaining would be used in teaching general classroom subjects among the normal student population of the schools.</P>
    <P>The additional posts would be intended to provide an extra teaching resource for the school as a whole.  I would emphasise again the need for all staff members to assume responsibility for weaker pupils.  Deputy Horgan knows that those of us who are teachers <Col N="2464" /> find it difficult to resist the natural temptation of being attracted to the student who is easiest to manage and who is most receptive to what is being taught. Hopefully, teachers in general would accept the greater challenge there is in helping the weaker students, those students who are not as well endowed as the generality of students.</P>
    <P>I have always been loath to make any distinction between what has been classified traditionally as vocational schools and secondary schools.  Both schools deal with post-primary students.  I hope Deputy Horgan would not contribute to a view which was prevalent some years ago and which put an unwarranted emphasis on academic subjects.</P>
    <P>The management authorities of schools seeking approval for such a post will be invited to make an application to the Department on a date to be shortly specified.  The application should be accompanied by evidence as to the need for the additional post or posts in the school.  Ideally this evidence should take the form of the results of tests carried out in recent years in areas such as language skills.  Information should also be provided about the type of test used as well as on the current arrangements for the meeting of the remedial education needs of the school.  An indication should also be sought as to the availability of a suitable teacher who might be appointed as a remedial teacher, his or her experience, and a statement of aptitude for the work.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I have said will bring Deputy Horgan a little forward in his interpretation of what the Minister said on May 2.  There is a need to continue to research and develop this area which brings us nearer to the realisation of the great hope we all aspire, namely, equality of education in all our schools.</P>

      <P>The Meteorological Service of my Department maintain a programme of measuring radioactivity in water (rainfall) and air at a number of locations throughout the country. Radioactivity in rainfall and air is measured daily in Dublin city (O'Connell Street) and at Cahirciveen.  In addition, measurements of radioactivity of accumulated rainfall over each month are made for sites at Dublin Airport, Belmullet, Rosslare, Roche's Point and Mullingar as well as at Cahirciveen and Dublin city (O'Connell Street).  Measurements of radioactivity in samples of tapwater are made once a week at Dublin city and Cahirciveen.</P>
      <P>In all cases, the beta-activity of the samples is measured, using lead-shielded geiger-muller tubes.  In addition, for the Dublin city site, Strontium-ninety (Sr90) activity in the cumulative monthly samples of rainfall is determined.  The reports of the measurements are distributed quarterly to about 70 interested institutes in Ireland and abroad.</P>

The capital allocation made to the council for this purpose in <Col N="2330" /> 1979 amounted to £40,000.  To date no claim for a further allocation has been received in my Department from the council.</P>
      <P>A general review of expenditure on the local authority housing programme is in progress at present.
