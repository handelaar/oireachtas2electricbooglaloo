      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Last week in the absence of the Taoiseach I raised with the Tánaiste the question of giving public time for discussion of item No. 78 on the Order Paper in my name.  It is a motion to annul the Public Bodies (Amendment) (No. 2) Order, 1979 which proposes to put back the estimates meetings of local authorities from November-December to February-March.  It is very important that this be debated because if it stands it will have far-reaching consequences.</P>

      <P>We were half way through discussing this section the last day when business concluded.  The Minister had made a number of statements and I should like to refer to some of them.  In reply to a Dáil question about a year or 18 months ago the Minister stated that he would not prohibit the sale of monofilament nets because, despite the fact that they were <Col N="752" /> used on a wide scale for illegal salmon driftnetting, they could legitimately be used for other types of fishing.  I should like the Minister now to state why his attitude has changed in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to have a full day debate on this Bill.  If ever anything proved to me that Bills should be taken in Committee this Bill does because it is ridiculous that we have been talking about this Bill for the last few weeks. When the Minister was speaking about the acquisition of fisheries I asked him would all fisheries be taken over by the new central board.  I take it that the Galway fishery which is now under the jurisdiction of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry automatically comes under the central board.</P>

      <P>It is hoped that this Bill will pass within the next week and that being so we can take it that the new boards nominated by the Minister will sit in March or April of next year?  The Minister has not given a definite commitment as to when they will sit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Treacy raised the question of unclaimed stretches of water and Members on both sides of the House contributed to this.  The Minister said that he had considered it but he was afraid to bring in a section in this Bill in case he would find it hard to claim unclaimed waters.  I suggest that there should be a section to state that the new central board could take over or could claim unclaimed stretches of water not being used at present.  By that I mean the vast areas of rivers that nobody seems to have any legal title to and where weeds are growing could be developed by the new central and regional boards.  There are also many lakes in the country.  In the north-west there are lakes where weeds are growing.  These lakes are not being utilised at all and the farmers have no claim on them and do not wish to claim them.  We would be missing a very important part of this Bill if the Minister does not include some section to deal with that.  I am asking him to include a section to provide that the central board could take over unclaimed stretches of water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to have Report Stage next week and I will look into the possibility of putting in an enabling section of the kind suggested by the Deputy. But there are practical difficulties in implementing such a section&mdash;for example, constitutional and legal aspects of title, property rights and so on.  If the House will bear with me I will devise some form of enabling section between now and Report Stage and have it here next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, when we were half way through this discussion on <Col N="754" /> section 36 the House adjourned and we were left with a lot of unanswered questions, so I am going to go over some of the ground again.</P>
      <P>It was pointed out to the Minister that in the Inland Fisheries report, which is the basis of this Bill, it is asserted that 50 per cent of the best salmon rivers and estuarine salmon fisheries here are still in private ownership and that a great proportion of these private landlords are absentee landlords.  Have the Minister's Department made any assessment of the percentage of these privately owned fisheries which are not being maintained to the required standard?  Have the Department made any assessment of what it will cost to acquire these fisheries by compulsory purchase order?  That right is given in this Bill and the Minister has often referred to it.  It is extremely important that we have some assessment of these figures.  Of course, the key point of the whole Bill is not worth the paper it is written on unless the finance is made available and unless the Minister can give us some guarantee that the finance will be available to acquire the fisheries in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have shown evidence of my bona fides in this matter by already taking over the Galway salmon, trout and eel fisheries.  As I mentioned here on the last day, I propose to take a similar attitude with the powers here in section 36 in regard to other commercial fisheries.  But it is not appropriate to start bandying prices about here.  This will depend on hard-headed negotiation and bargaining.  We will try to purchase voluntarily and, if we fail to do that, we will purchase by way of compulsory acquisition. Therefore, I do not think I should mention compensation prices here in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister made an assessment of what proportion of the 50 per cent is not being properly utilised at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that they are all being utilised on a commercial basis is not desirable.  It is a natural resource. <Col N="755" /> We have made a success of the Galway fisheries, which will be paid for next year.  But it is not the commercial element that would primarily motivate me as Minister for Fisheries.  Research and development are the important aspects in regard to these fisheries and they are not really utilised in that respect at present. They are purely private enterprise commercial ventures and I would like to see them move towards the developmental aspect in the national interest.  That is the way we are approaching the Galway fisheries without taking from the legitimate element of commercial development for the State as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be missing the point.  I am not speaking about that.  The Minister continuously refers to compulsory purchase orders included in this Bill and how he is going to make use of them.  Has the Department made any assessment of what proportion of these private fisheries are not being utilised in the national interest at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole purpose of this section.  It gives me, or whoever is Minister, power to deal with this matter.  In the case of the Galway <Col N="756" /> fisheries I was able to do it on the basis of research and scientific investigation and, to be candid, I was stretching my powers at the time.  It was not quite clear whether I was really fully entitled to do this or not.  But this section makes it quite clear that whoever is here as Minister for Fisheries can acquire any fishing rights here for the State either voluntarily or compulsorily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I would prefer to hand them over to the central board.

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his commitment in relation to unclaimed waters.  Following on what Deputy Deasy has said, I think what the Minister is really saying is that the intention behind this Bill is gradually to take over all these estuary fisheries that are not being utilised and that if landlords want to sell any of their fisheries to the <Col N="757" /> central board, these will be bought up. Certain landlords have approached me about this and quite a few of them would prefer to sell to the central board so that the central board could run them.  There are also some fisheries here that are being managed and utilised very well and I take it that there will be no such thing as compulsion in relation to these.  But we should try to take over any of the estuary fisheries that are not being utilised properly and, of course, we should take over in any case where there is a willingness to sell.  I agree with the Minister that money could be a very big matter here and that it will be during a period of three to four years that we will take over the fisheries, but eventually we should have a situation in which most of the estuary fisheries would belong to the central board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Deputy.  Each case will stand on its merits in relation to its necessity from the national point of view.  We will not go willy-nilly into the purchase of fisheries but where after an economic assessment a fisheries is considered valuable from a national point of view we will take it over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would let us have a list of the privately-owned estuary and salmon fisheries so that as time passes we may take note of the fisheries that have been acquired.  I am a pessimist by nature and, consequently, I suspect that the rate of acquisition will be very slow, much slower than we would wish.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied with the commitment given by the Minister regarding the ESB.  The Minister has told <Col N="758" /> us he is satisfied with the work being done by the ESB in regard to fisheries in respect of the waters controlled by the board but I do not think that they are doing enough or that what they are doing will be sufficient when this legislation comes into operation.  The whole essence of this Bill is to stop illegal fishing in bays, but we have heard repeatedly from the ESB that there is no point in their developing a hatchery policy if the young stocks are to be fished illegally. Hopefully, this Bill will eliminate illegal fishing, but I have not had an assurance from the Minister to the effect that the ESB will devise a proper hatcheries policy in regard to the rivers under their control.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to assure us, too, that the Department and the central board would welcome at any time the handing over to them of any fisheries controlled by the ESB.  I shall not be happy until such time as everything in relation to fisheries is under the control of the Department of Fisheries.  The Minister has told us that last year the fisheries division of the ESB lost £250,000 but this amount is very small in terms of the fishing industry as a whole. I am not satisfied that the ESB are the proper body to operate these fisheries. We could do a much better job if all aspects of fisheries were under the control of the Minister.</P>

      <P>My advice is that the <Col N="759" /> provision is constitutional.  It is on all fours with the Land Commission procedure <i>vis-à-vis</i> the acquisition of land.  We have gone into this matter very thoroughly and have not found anything unconstitutional in it.  It contains proper compensation provisions and a provision in respect of tribunal assessment.  There is nothing more unconstitutional about it than there is about the exercise of acquisition powers by the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern in this area is not allayed by the assurances of the Minister in regard to the analogy of the Land Commission because under this Bill the arbitrator is somebody appointed by the Minister whereas in the Land Commission situation there are the lay commissioners who are appointed statutorily.  In addition, there is provision for an appeal from a decision of the lay commissioners on a point of law to the High Court and, if necessary, to the Supreme Court.  While I agree fully with the intentions of the Minister in regard to acquisition&mdash;if possible by agreement but otherwise by order&mdash;of private fisheries, it would be regrettable if this power were to fail on the grounds of its not being constitutional.  Is the Minister totally happy on the constitutional point?</P>

      <P>I am not here for the purpose <Col N="760" /> of engaging in a personal vendetta with the Minister, but I wish to refer back to a reply which he gave on the last occasion to a point raised on section 36, when he told the House about the huge amount of illegal nets that had been seized, especially off the Shannon estuary. The figure mentioned in terms of value was of the order of £500,000, but I replied sharply that it was a pity there had not been more concentration on the west coast during the last salmon fishing season than there had been in my part of the country, in the Lismore and Waterford fishing areas.  I am concerned and also very annoyed because of the concentration of fishery protection forces in an area where, traditionally, the law has been adhered to while seemingly scant attention has been paid to the west coast where this damage is being done to our salmon fisheries.  The Minister in his reply mentioned the Shannon Estuary.  I know of people with trawlers who for seven or eight seasons past, and in particular for the last season when the Minister had vowed that he was going to eliminate illegal drift netting at sea, have boasted and have proved by their landings of fish and their financial gain that they have fished ten miles of illegal drift net much of which was monofilamant net and they have fished not 40 meshes but as much as 60 or 90 meshes deep.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made this speech when he concluded on the last occasion and we did not get an ample opportunity to reply.  It is a disgrace that these people have got away with it scot free again this year.  Every fisherman on the coast knows who these people are and surely the Minister must be aware of who they are.  Why was it allowed happen again?  The landings of salmon on the west coast this year were a record. They were higher than ever before.  The national landings were not a record because the fishermen in west Cork, east Cork, Waterford and Wexford made <Col N="761" /> catches which were extremely low.  How could it be otherwise when the fish never got to that part of the coast?  The fish run in an anti-clockwise direction around the coast, from Donegal, around Kerry and up towards Wexford.  The landings in my part of the country were so low because that illegal fishing seemingly is being condoned and not merely allowed. I cannot understand how the Minister can strut in here like a peacock and boast of the considerable work he has done in this field.  It is not funny.  I know a man who could not meet his repayments on his boat, nets or gear and he has been in a mental home for the last four months.  That might sound funny to the Minister, but it is a fact.</P>
      <P>I know dozens of traditional salmon fishermen who could not make a living this year and have had to have recourse to the local relief officer for social welfare in order to make ends meet and to feed their families because the illegal fishing on the west coast has not been eliminated.  The Minister has not even attempted to eliminate it.  He says that he has but there is no visible sign that it has been reduced.  There is not a decent income to be earned on the south coast because of the restrictions introduced by the Minister and the continued wholesale poaching on the west coast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We could talk all day about this because this is connected with enforcement and its importance.  These measures which I have taken for the first time are to try to make the fishery protection laws and regulations of this country real, creditable and genuine.  I have gone to the extent of bringing in stronger regulations to ensure this and I have invoked the help of the Naval Service to assist the Garda and the staffs of <Col N="762" /> the boards around the country in efforts to stamp out illegal fishing.  I have made a complete policy commitment for the first time to stamping out illegal fishing as a prerequisite to any national inland fisheries development in this country. Unless we have the resource we cannot develop the resource.  That is elementary and it is not necessary for me to spell out the fact that I have made this commitment over the past two-and-a-half years and have done something about it for the first time.  We have not by any means succeeded to the extent that I would like to succeed.  We have made only a start, but at least there is now the commitment by the fisheries administration in this country to this objective.  We now have the disciplinary forces of the State available to help us achieve this objective. We have the law under this legislation and under the Fisheries Act, 1978. For the first time we have the penalties to help the courts in dealing with the situation.</P>
      <P>However, over so many years and generations illegal fishing, unfortunately, has been treated in a tolerant manner by the Irish public, the Irish courts and Irish law enforcement agencies.  There has been a nod and a wink type of attitude towards it.  Really it is the attitude of mind that we need to change and no amount of legislation or regulation can deal with this situation unless it is taken really seriously by everybody in the community.  Not only salmon but all species of fish are in danger of disappearing unless there is management of the resources, unless we commit ourselves to that management in the way of legislation and regulation and their enforcement and, above all else, unless we educate public opinion which is the most important aspect of all.  We must get the people themselves conditioned to the point of view that this is too important and far too fundamental to be treated on a nod and a wink, casual basis.</P>

The ESB stand in the same position as any owner of a fishery right.  I want to make that clear.  What I did say was that the ESB record to date had been excellent.

For example, if the trout farm needed a JCB digger to clear an estuary for his new farm factory, would that fisherman have the right to bring machinery across the three or four farms?

Subsection 1 is the nub of the matter. The central board or a regional board may apply to the Minister for an order effecting the compulsory acquisition of a right of way by a particular <Col N="767" /> route over any land.  After considering the application under subsection 3 I have to be satisfied that the right is required to enable fishermen to gain access to fishing waters and that it is reasonable.

To take the point a little further, in a situation where there is no access except through crops, would the board be prepared to purchase a corridor sufficient to give proper access?

My suggestion regarding the purchase of a corridor of land which could be fenced and where stiles could be provided seems to be worthwhile.</P>

      <P>A major point arises with regard to the section.  Do the Land Commission even know the fisheries they own?  I raise this question in the context of having attempted to investigate the ownership of a fishery in my area in south-east Cork.  It was almost impossible to ascertain who was entitled to the ownership of the fisheries on certain sections of the river in question. I should like to know the Minister's answer to my question whether the Land Commission really know what fisheries they own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission have a schedule of fisheries&mdash;a printed list which I can get for the Deputy if he wishes.  They advertise fisheries for letting on a regular basis.  I am informed there are about 100 such fisheries in the possession of the Land Commission. They are managed by the commission and are let to angling bodies, hotels and others.  The income from the lettings is in the region of £5,000 per year.  We are taking power in this Bill to get the fisheries from the Land Commission. This section will enable the commission to transfer the fisheries and related rights to me or to the central board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the point I am raising is not quite clear.  I appreciate that in cases where the ownership is clear the Land Commission will transfer the fisheries to the new board.  What concerns me is where the ownership is not clear, where the Land Commission may be the owner but do not know it.  Will the Minister consider the situation that applies in some parts of the country where fishery rights were exercised by some landlord 100 years ago, where there was <Col N="772" /> acquisition of certain lands in the area by the Land Commission and where there is confusion as to whether the fishery rights were transferred to the commission or are owned by the adjoining occupier.  Is there any way of getting such matters resolved?  I am referring to cases where the ownership of the fisheries is unclear.  Has the Minister any power in the Bill to have such a situation resolved by way of acquisition by the central board, with some form of public advertisement and an entitlement to a claimant to claim compensation if he can prove title?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised an important point.  I have here the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission and they refer to this aspect under section 2.8.2.  It is under section 45 of the Land Act, 1923 and provides that on the vesting of any lands in the Land Commission under that Act all fisheries appurtenant to the lands vest in the Land Commission subject to any existing lease.  Section 4 of the Land Act, 1929, provides that the Land Commission should make a declaration as to whether fisheries did or did not vest in them. There is a provision under the land legislation for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Deputy White and other speakers raised the question of unclaimed waters to which there is no title.  I have said that between now and Report Stage next week I shall bring in an enabling section on that aspect.  It is a legal tangle and it could also be a constitutional tangle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is getting to the core of the problem.  It is important for the Minister to remember that these appurtenant rights will probably not be listed in many cases by the Land Commission because they will not even know they have them.  To a certain degree those rights may fall into the area of unclaimed rights.  There must be some general power to acquire these with compensation powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate a worry I referred to earlier in regard to the constitutionality of this procedure.  It would be a pity if the purpose of the Bill were to be negatived because the procedure adopted was not constitutional. I observe that the arbitrator is to be a barrister of not less than seven year's standing.  He will be without judicial standing.  He is appointed by the Minister and there does not appear to be any right of appeal to any judicial body from the findings of the arbitrator.  Bearing in mind that we are dealing with rights to property which are protected under the Constitution.  I wonder whether the procedure envisaged in the Bill will stand up.  Would it be wiser to have some sort of appeal from the decision of the arbitrator to the courts?  Normally that is sufficient to ensure the constitutionality of any measure which gives powers to a non-judicial person or body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a similar type of provision to the requirements for a judicial appointment.  These are specified for a District Court, or Circuit Court, or High Court appointment.  The person must be a lawyer of a number of years' standing.  A specified legal person can hear the appeal.  When the Minister <Col N="775" /> receives the notice of appeal under the section, he may appoint a person who shall be a barrister of not less than seven years' standing.  That person is then referred to as the arbtirator.  It is separate from the compensation aspect. I am quite satisfied that we cannot go any further on the legal and constitutional aspects than that.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the point raised by Deputy O'Keeffe that this is an important matter.  We are talking about property rights, the acquisition of property rights, and the transfer of property rights.  I do not see how I can go any further than to appoint a person with that type of qualification to hear the appeal.  On balance I am satisfied.  As the House is aware, there is residual right of appeal to the courts, the basic right of anybody to go against any order made.

      <P>If a person fishes illegally and is caught more than three times he certainly deserves to lose his licence.  A person could be caught three times for not having a number on his boat and under this section that man would automatically lose his licence.  He could lose his licence if he had been caught three times without a tag attached to his nets.  If a person is disqualified for three minor parking offences he does not automatically lose his driving licence. <Col N="778" /> There is a difference here between the drunken driver and the parking offence. We will have to define exactly the cases in which fishermen may lose their licences.  If somebody has a court case pending, what happens?  Is it the Minister's intention that all fishermen will start with a clear sheet on 1 March when the new central and regional boards will come into operation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Begley has facts and figures to back it up.  The bulk of the licensed drift salmon fishermen are on the south coast, in the Waterford area, the Lismore fishery area, the west Cork fishery area or in the Donegal fishery area in the extreme north-west.  In between there are very few drift net salmon licences, for various reasons.  In Kerry there is blatant discrimination by the law as it stands against a traditional fisherman getting a licence.  There are only about eight or nine licence holders in County Kerry.  In the areas where the traditional fishermen have licences they have to put up with undue surveillance. There is no need for that because they are fishing within the law.  They are no more law abiding fishermen than those on the south coast.  The list of fishery offences <Col N="780" /> proves that.  There are no cases of fishermen in that area being fired at from patrol boats.  They feel, with justification, that they are being harassed to an undue degree.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the salmon is caught off the west coast and this is being caught illegally. What does the Minister intend to do about this?  We have been told since the Minister came into office that he would eliminate this illegal drift net fishing off the west coast.  More salmon were caught illegally off the west coast this year than ever before.  They were caught by trawlers with miles of net and none of those boats has a salmon licence.  Will the Minister concentrate on this area in future?  The salmon stocks in the country are being decimated because of this illegal fishing.  It is not because of any over-fishing by the drift net men off the south coast.  What they caught this year would not give them a decent living.  Many of them are depending on social welfare payments to make ends meet because they had such a bad season.  In spite of that I believe more salmon were caught around our coast last year than in recent years. There was not a decline as has been stated so often.  The bulk of the salmon caught was caught illegally.  If it was caught by those who sold the salmon some of them could be correctly labelled as millionaires.  Obviously, they were funnelled from the illegal fishermen through the limited number of licences in the area thereby escaping detection. What is the Minister doing to eliminate illegal drift net fishing?  What is he doing to stop the sale of such salmon which are being sold illegally?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what Deputy Deasy has said.  The Minister is aware that the Lismore-Youghal area consists of the most law abiding people along our coast.  That was accepted by officials of the Department who are well known to those fishermen.  There was no need for surveillance.  The local fishermen made their own laws and rules and superimposed them on the existing regulations.  If the Minister insisted on the same type of surveillance on the west coast one would <Col N="781" /> have a clearer picture of salmon catches and the so-called disappearance of salmon.  If illegal salmon fishing was stopped life could be a lot easier for those who have been stocking the Blackwater at their own expense for a number of years.  In fact, they stocked it so well that they were able to sell surplus stocks this year.  Those responsible people put their own money into stocking that river but they are now on the dole and unable to meet repayments on their boats.  That has occurred because of the tough and unfair regulations which were brought in.  They were not necessary. Fishermen in that area could lawfully fish a full season in a responsible manner and without any damage to the fish stocks but because there was chaos on the west coast and breaches of the regulations the fishermen in that area are the victims.  If this Bill corrects that situation the Minister, in the new year, can have another look at the problems of the Youghal people and offer them a decent season's fishing.</P>

      <P>If the Minister wants the Bill to be effective he will have to see to it that justice is done and seen to be done.  It is clear that there is a strong feeling of discrimination amongst fishermen on the south coast, from Lismore to west Cork and into Kerry.  The Minister will have to make it clear that selective surveillance and particular harassment of those areas will cease and that there will be an even-handed distribution of justice along the coast.  It is not sufficient to say that some of the people in the Naval Service are doing this.  Those people are carrying out instructions; they are going where they are told to go and it is no answer to attempt to pass the buck to the Naval Service.  The whole purpose of the fishery legislation would be lost unless all fishermen see that justice is done.  It is clear to me that justice is not being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though the penalties look good on paper they will not have any effect once the fishing becomes a bread and butter issue of a family.  I appeal to the Minister to recognise that if he has not the goodwill of the genuine fishermen who are earning their living from the sea, like their fathers before them, these sections will be treated with contempt.  In a part of Kerry we have a minimum number of licences but if we look up or down the coast we can see hundreds of licences held by people who are not genuine fishermen.  This is the crux of the matter.  For years fishermen have had respect for the Naval Service, the Garda and so on and there is no point in having open conflict between the fishermen and law enforcement officers. That conflict can be avoided if there is good consultation with the fishermen and a genuine compromise reached.  It must be remembered that those who will see to it that these regulations are enforced are the fishermen because it is a bread and butter issue with them.  Last year I asked the Minister for Defence the number of nets seized by the Naval Service around our coast and the reply I received was alarming because one section of our coast was not touched.  Of course, we all know the Minister for Defence is from that area.</P>

      <P>The protection staff have the power to enforce the law.  In addition, as a result of our policy decision, they have the aid of the Navy in the estuarine and sea waters adjacent to our coasts.  The combined effort of all concerned&mdash;the Navy, the Garda Síochána and the protection staff&mdash;has led to the intensification of law enforcement in this area in the past two years, an area which was neglected for many years.  The legislation was not being enforced because of an attitude to the protection of fisheries.  This attitude affected the courts and the various law enforcement agencies, and the public tended to look upon fisheries in an indulgent manner. Only in the past few years have people realised that this natural resource could disappear.  We have not yet improved the situation to my satisfaction, but I am firmly convinced that we have strong penalties under this section and under last year's legislation.  The policy decision stands in relation to the intensification of enforcement and will continue in the season ahead.</P>

There is no point in the Minister saying we are looking after our own little corner; he should do something about that illegal drift netting off the west coast.</P>

      <P>Finally, on this section, the Minister has mentioned the £2,000 fines which we welcome.  However, there is a difference between £2,000 fines and the will to prosecute, particularly as far as the north Kerry fishermen were concerned, who were fishing illegally, over and above their time.</P>

There is no point in bringing in these big fines, unless the Minister has the will.  The Minister has said that the Navy is a separate body, but it works in conjunction with the Department of Fisheries.  Unless the Minister has a strong will to put the new Act into force, we are wasting our time discussing this.  It is for the Minister to see that anyone caught fishing illegally will be prosecuted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 39, before section 47, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" />&ldquo;47.&mdash; (1)  Where in any proceedings for an offence under Chapter II of Part XIII of the Principal Act there is evidence from which it appears to the court that the sea-fishing boat to which the alleged offence relates, or on board which such offence is alleged to have been committed, is either of a foreign character or of foreign origin or that at or about the time of the alleged offence such boat&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  wore no flag or wore a flag other than the national flag, or</P>
    <P>(b)  had marked on her stern the name of any place other than a port mentioned in the Second Schedule to the Merchantile Marine Act, 1955, or</P>
    <P>(c)  had on board any books, papers or other documents from which it so appears that the boat was not an Irish ship,  </P>
    <P>then, until the contrary is shown, such evidence shall be sufficient to prove that such boat is a foreign sea-fishing boat.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where in proceedings for an offence under Chapter II of Part XIII of the Principal Act it is proved that the sea-fishing boat to which the alleged offence relates, or on board which such offence is alleged to have been committed, wore at or about the time of the alleged offence a flag other than the national flag, the presumption raised by subsection (1) of this section, in so far as it depends on that proof, may be rebutted by the defendant proving that the flag so worn was not a flag distinctive of nationality.</P>
    <P>(3)  The provisions of this section are in addition to, and not in substitution for, those of section 19 (3) of the Act of 1962 (as amended by section 67 of this Act).&rdquo;.   </P>
    <P>Under existing legislation it is necessary, when a foreign sea-fishing boat is being charged with an infringement of fishery legislation, to obtain certificates from each of the 12 registrars of ships around <Col N="794" /> our coast to the effect that the vessel in question is not registered as an Irish sea fishing boat.  This procedure, involving compliance with the requirement, is often difficult and the resultant delay often causes problems for the State in regard to effectively prosecuting the people concerned. This amendment will eliminate the need for such certificates except in the unlikely event of the defence insisting on their production.</P>
    <P>Briefly what I am doing is making it easier to prosecute foreign boats.  This will eliminate the need to produce a particular form of proof which, added to the confusion in bringing prosecutions, places an undue burden on the State in securing convictions against foreign boats.  It makes it easier for us to successfully prosecute foreign boats.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 39, line 54, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any other person&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This amendment seeks the addition of simply four words to the section, words that are of the utmost importance: &ldquo;or any other person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment, an offence under any provision of the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 1979, other than a section specified in Table I to section 2 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1978, may be heard and determined in a summary way by a District Justice upon the complaint, verbal or otherwise, of a member of the Garda Síochána, the Central Board, a regional board, an officer or servant of a board or a private watchkeeper within the meaning of Part XVIII of this Act.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment seeks to add to that the words: &ldquo;or any other person&rdquo;.  I want the House to realise that those words were contained in the Act of 1959.  It is an extraordinary <Col N="795" /> state of affairs that they should be deliberately removed now.  The exclusion of those words clearly is a diminution of an individual's rights, precluding him from taking legal proceedings in a district court.  On that basis many important persons would be precluded from taking appropriate action in the courts, for instance, our angling clubs, conservative bodies, indeed such important national bodies as An Taisce, bodies concerned with the environment, the preservation of our fisheries and so on.</P>
    <P>Here clearly citizens' rights are involved, individual rights are involved and persons who would have a genuine grievance are precluded from taking the proceedings outlined in the section.  I am not concerned with &ldquo;do gooders&rdquo;, as such.  I am concerned with all those well meaning people associated with our fisheries who are debarred from taking such proceedings by the deliberate removal of the words &ldquo;or any other person&rdquo;. I want these words reinserted. Their exclusion will impede all those people who can and wish to play a role in the preservation of our fisheries.  An individual member of an angling club who feels he has a legitimate complaint to make should have the same right before the courts as anyone else.  The conservation bodies should have access to the courts.  There are a few categories of persons only mentioned in the section&mdash;the Garda Síochána, the Central Board, a regional board, an officer or servant of a board or a private waterkeeper.  That is not sufficient.  I want the Minister to say why it was thought fit to remove the words &ldquo;or any other person&rdquo; which were contained in the 1959 Act.  Their exclusion leaves this Bill less democratic than the old Act, and we are all concerned about democracy.  I want those words reinserted so that all those people genuinely concerned about our fisheries and their preservation will have the same access to the courts as they had in the past.</P>
    <P>The section as it stands is too restrictive, should be broadened, made more <Col N="796" /> democratic and reinstated as it was in the 1959 Act.  The people who drew up that Act were wise, far-seeing and democratically-minded and were as much concerned with fisheries as we are today.  I know of no good reason why those words should be deleted from the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Treacy on this amendment.  If the Minister is agreeable to the amendment, there is no point in our debating it.  I think it is good that the words &ldquo;or any other person&rdquo; be added because they widen the scope of the section.</P>

My advice is that the words do not have to be there, that the right is there basically anyway, the right of any person to prosecute under the Bill.

    <P>The section as drafted contains provision for disqualification for three years of a person holding a commercial licence on conviction for a third fishery offence of a prescribed character.

I am making it tougher to provide for a second offence of a prescribed character rather than a third one.  A lot of representation on this aspect of the matter was made to me by angling bodies.  They were very strongly of the view that we should toughen up the penalties.  I am making it two offences instead of three.</P>

Deputy White was concerned that some sort of casual offence, like not having a licence number on a boat or something like that, would be included in those sections.

Is there a right of appeal under this section to the central board if, for instance, somebody feels he is entitled to a salmon licence and has not been given it?  If I have an uncle who has a licence, he has stopped fishing, he hands in his licence and I intend to take over his boat and gear and to fish and I apply to the regional board for that licence and I am not granted that particular licence, it means that I have no licence even though I have my nets and my boat. Does the Minister envisage that there is a right of appeal available to a fisherman applying for that type of licence?  I suggest that on Report Stage an amendment <Col N="801" /> could be brought in to ensure that there is a right of appeal in a case like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 43, before section 50, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;50.&mdash;(1) (a)  Where a court imposes a fine or affirms or varies a fine imposed by another court for an offence mentioned in subsection (4) of this section of which a person <Col N="802" /> was convicted, it may, at its discretion, on the application (made before the time of such imposition, affirmation or variation) of any person who was summoned as a witness on behalf of the prosecution in the proceedings in which the fine was imposed and who suffered loss or damage resulting, wholly or partly, from the offence, provide by order for the payment of the amount of the fine or of a specified part of it as compensation in respect of the loss or damage to the person making the application.</P>
    <P>(b)  An application shall not lie under paragraph (a) of this subsection in respect of any loss or damage if proceedings claiming damages for the loss or damage have been instituted in any court.  </P>
    <P>(2)  If a person is convicted of an offence under section 51 (16) of this Act or section 253 of the Principal Act by reason of his having taken away oysters or other fish from an oyster bed or other place, if the oysters (or any of them) or the other fish in respect of which the offence was committed have or has not then been sold, they or it, as may be appropriate, shall, as a statutory consequence of conviction, stand forfeited, and the court may direct their or its delivery to the owner or occupier of the oyster bed or other place from which they or it were or was taken or the person to whom the relevant licence was granted or who is entitled to the benefit of such licence.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where pursuant to this section the whole or part of a fine is paid to a person and the person is awarded damages by a court in respect of the loss or damage to which the payment relates, the payment shall be deemed to be in satisfaction of so much of the damages as is equal to the amount of the payment.</P>
    <P>(4)  The offences referred to in subsection (1) of this section are offences under section 51 (16) of this Act or section 253 or 265 of the Principal Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> This is a new section.  Section 50 (1) (a) provides for the payment of part of fines imposed by a court as compensation in respect of loss or damage suffered by witnesses for the prosecution in connection with interference with or trespass on a fish farm.  Paragraph (b) provides that payments under (a) are not allowable if proceedings claiming loss or damage are being instituted in any court.  It goes on to provide in subsection (2) that as a statutory consequence of conviction, for the return to the owners or occupiers of fisheries of unsold oysters or other fish that have been taken illegally.  Subsection (3) provides that a portion of a fine imposed under subsection (1) of this section is allocated as compensation for damage.  The amount recovered from damages awarded in any subsequent civil action should be the sum awarded for damages, less the amount allocated for a fine.  Subsection (4) lists the sections of the Bill and of the Principal Act which are covered by section 50 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This amendment was brought in after I received representations from aquaculture people who are very keen that a compensation element be introduced in regard to any interference, trespass or damage caused to their fish farm.  This would be a stronger form of deterrent than the fine provision.  Having listened to what they had to say, I was convinced that anybody with a fish farm is in a very vulnerable position.</P>

    <P>We are now dealing with the original section 50, an amendment of section 301 <Col N="804" /> of the Principal Act which sets out the various powers of authorised officers. This section gives additional powers to authorised officers.  Section 301 of the Principal Act refers in all cases to fish. The extra section indirectly refers to salmon.  This should be fish.  This is a technicality to include fish rather than salmon and to make the wording more global.  The power given in the section will be utilised primarily for the protection of salmon stock but it may be used in relation to other species.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very strong reservations on this section, especially as there is a question of loss of life involved. Subsection (a) (db) reads:</P>
      <P>he may for the purpose of exercising the power conferred on him by paragraph (da) of this subsection use such force as he may consider necessary and in particular, if an order given by him to such boat to stop is disobeyed or disregarded, he may, after first causing a gun to be fired as a signal, fire at or into the boat;&rdquo;, </P>
      <P>That is a drastic power to give to the Naval Service or to anybody.  It means we can have loss of life at sea for the sake of a few fish.  In no circumstances should that power be given.  There are more ways of killing a cat than by choking it.  To give unlimited power to the Naval Service to fire at an Irish fisherman and sink his boat because they are suspicious and he does not stop, is very wrong.  The Minister should reconsider this because he is putting into this legislation a provision which could lead to loss of life.  This is the first time in the history of this State that such almighty powers are being given to the Naval Service. Again I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this because no fish is worth a life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to talk about the power of authorised officers&mdash;I am talking now about the officers under the old board of conservators in the last few years&mdash;many officers were not equipped to deal adequately with the situation. The illegal fishermen had faster boats and many of them were armed.  With the best will in the world, these officers were not equipped to deal with poachers.  I want the Minister to assure the House that money will be spent to ensure that these people have the right kind of gear and boats&mdash;they might need a speedboat or a power boat.  We must face the fact that in 1979 the old methods of trying to discourage poachers will have to be reconsidered.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Begley on this. As regards firing into or at a boat, there are two categories involved.  The Minister brought in something about foreign fishing trawlers but they do not really come under this Bill.  We are talking here about Irish fishermen, and their boats are usually between 20 feet and 40 feet.  They are small boats.  The position is that, if a naval corvette is in that vicinity, it might be able to fire across the bow of a boat but it should not fire into or at an Irish boat, whatever about foreign vessels.</P>
      <P>The Minister might say he is only putting this in in case it might ever have to be acted on but that the instructions are that it will not be acted on.  In the last year we had a few ugly scenes.  If somebody lost his head he could quote this Bill and it would be legal for him to fire into or at the boat.  I am not running down the Navy in any way.  Our naval protection vessels have a difficult task.  They are working in conjunction with the Department of Fisheries and it is wrong for the Minister to say that he has nothing to do with protection.  I was Shadow Minister for Defence before taking up this portfolio and I know that the Minister's Department and the Navy work in conjunction with each other. The Minister might say that he has no direct authority but they do work in conjunction with each other and that is as it should be.</P>

      <Col N="807" /> I asked before for heavier fines and asked that the three years should be cut to two years, but when we are considering firing on or at one of our own fishing vessels we are going too far.  The crack officers are given money to have the right equipment and the naval authorities are also given money to have proper equipment but to allow them to fire at or on a boat is going too far.</P>

      <P>We are talking of situations where the boats are numbered and their destination is just around the corner. It is very easy to talk to them in a civilised manner when they come into the pier.  There is no need for firing across the bows.  With the best will in the world they might intend to fire across the bows but in the high seas their accuracy might not be what it should be and somebody could be killed.  I seriously request to the Minister to remove that.</P>

      <P>I join with my colleagues in appealing to the Minister to delete the highly dangerous reference &ldquo;fire at or into the boat&rdquo;.  That is the ultimate.  I hope the kind of situation would never arise where it would be found necessary to fire at the boat and conceivably sink it and all therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is full of penalties and this side of the House have supported the Minister in regard to them in order to eliminate unfair practices in fishing in the inland waters and around our coasts. The penalties prescribed are sufficient in respect of fines and jail sentences rather than going so far as to invite gun-boat war around our coasts.  We would have an estrangement between the Minister of the day and the fishermen.  We would have grievances to contend with and sometimes angry scenes.  Tensions would be high.  The mind boggles at what could happen in an angry scene as a result of investing such power in the captain or officers of any boat.  Such scenes can occur and indeed have occurred in recent times.  It is too severe a stipulation.  It is fraught with the most serious and dangerous repercussions.  It is not <Col N="808" /> necessary to empower any of our protection boats and crews to fire on or at a boat and conceivably sink it.  There is sufficient scope in the Bill to deal with such a situation.</P>
    <P>My colleagues who are closer to the area of fishing would know better than I, but I cannot conceive of a situation where the skipper of any fishing boat or the crew would flaunt the law to such an extent that, when they are ordered to stop and a demand is made to search them, they would deliberately disobey and place themselves in a position that they must be fired on.  The stipulation is unnecessary in Irish circumstances and I hope that that type of contingency will never arise.  If it does arise there are sufficient powers invested in the Navy, the protection service, the Garda and so on to deal with it.</P>

Following consultation with a number of fish farmers I am satisfied that provision should be made for a jail sentence as well as a fine in both summary and indictable cases.  The Bill already provides for jail sentences on conviction for other fishery offences. This is a type of offence that unfortunately is likely to arise in future because of the increasing number of licences we are now giving for aquaculture and it is important that the holder be fully protected.

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>This is surely one of the most important new sections to come before the House.  We are dealing with the salmon levy and with aquaculture. At this time there are tremendously exciting possibilities for aquaculture or fish farms whether oyster, mussel, scallop, salmon or trout farming.  So good are the possibilities that I am beginning to worry.  Should we not have some legislation to provide for watching very carefully some of the multinationals to ensure that they do not walk away with the largest share of the national cake, so to speak?  There is talk of oil and gas fields but this is a field where there are tremendous possibilities.  Perhaps I should first deal with what the Minister has in mind regarding a salmon levy.  I take it that for every salmon caught in this country there will be a levy on that salmon's head.  That being so we must have a tagging system.  If we are to collect money we must have some means of collecting it and knowing on what it has been collected.  That can only be done by a tagging system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two kinds of tagging systems.  One could give so many tags to the fishermen involved and you could tie that in with a quota whereby fishermen could catch so many fish against so many tags given by the regional board. The regional board in turn can check in the Dublin market; they can go into hotels, restaurants and so on to see that the salmon are properly tagged.  Alternatively, the Minister could consider a tagging system to be operated by fish merchants.  I think this would be the best system and the easiest for the Department to check.  Say we have at the maximum 500 fish merchants.  One could have a system whereby they keep registers in their offices.  When anybody sells salmon to a fish merchant he must enter it in the register and put a tag on <Col N="813" /> each salmon.  If a fisherman, for instance, brings in 30 salmon, his numbers might go from 230 to 260.  When the merchant sells to a hotelier or to a fish market or a fish buyer, those people in turn must have tags on their salmon. Otherwise, they, as well as the fish merchant, could be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>Against this system is the fact that the inspector could go to a restaurant and look into the deep freeze or the refrigerator and the restaurant might not have any tags on their salmon.  He could ask the owner where they got the salmon.  The inspector should have authority to check with the salmon boat that caught the fish or go back to the fish merchant.  Before we get on to aquaculture perhaps the Minister would give his views on the salmon levy.  I think the best way would be to operate the scheme with the least number of check points and we suggest that would be through the fish merchants.  Perhaps we could deal first with the salmon levy and then go on to aquaculture.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on the salmon levy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  We will take it the other way around.  The Minister has my views on the salmon levy and can reply to me on that.  As regards aquaculture I began by saying I was rather worried on this score.  I understand that a very big national group are taking a share in an aquaculture set-up in west Cork and that they intend to have a yearly turn-out of 650 tons of salmon per year, about half the national catch of salmon.  We reckon the national catch as about 1,300 tons of salmon a year.  This new multi-national firm, which I will call a property firm, are at present setting up an aquaculture farm or salmon farm in west Cork to produce about half of the total number of salmon produced here over the last two years.  I <Col N="814" /> am sure the Minister knows who I am talking about.  I am very worried about this.</P>
      <P>In Mulroy Bay in Donegal there is another firm, which I will call a drink firm, starting an intensive trout rearing farm.  The problem is that the people rearing mussels, oysters and scallops there are very worried because, as I understand it and as they understand it, if there is intensive trout farming or salmon farming the waters could be contaminated for the shellfish; it is the same thing as having pig pollution on the land. These farms are fed intensively and the waste from the meal seeps into the lakes and contaminates the shellfish industry in the bays here.  Perhaps the Minister would let me know what definite technical knowledge he has.  It has been proved beyond doubt in other countries that this is so.  In that event we will have to make up our minds whether to promote shellfish farming in our bays or not.  If we decide to promote shellfish farming we cannot promote salmon and trout farming in the same bays.  There is no doubt about it at this stage.  I am convinced of that.  I come from an intensive farming area and I know the harm pollution can do, whether it is because of pigs or poultry.  It is the same type of thing now in regard to salmon and trout.  It would be a national crime if we allowed licences to be handed out to these very big profitable firms who now see a new gold mine in the bays here.  This would interfere with one of the most traditional types of fishing, namely, for scallops, oysters and mussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Mulroy Bay it has been found recently that it is probably one of the best scallop areas in the entire country, if not the best.  This was discovered only by accident.  The procedure adopted on the aquaculture scene is to set out a raft and lines are put down from it so that sperms of mussels will cling to the lines.  Instead scallop sperms clung to the lines.  At present in Mulroy Bay a quarter of a million young scallops are being reared.  Suddenly, in the last three months, this national drink firm&mdash;which I presume did not do so <Col N="815" /> without being granted a licence&mdash;set up a trout farm and this is going to contaminate the waters here.  My information is that no technical man here is capable of saying how much of the waters around this trout farm will be contaminated.  I have asked experts outside the Department of Fisheries and Forestry if it would be 100 yards or a mile or three miles and the answer I got was that certainly within that perimeter of these trout farms the water would be contaminated.  I stress all this because I am afraid the Minister does not realise what is involved in issuing licences to everybody who applies for them.  I am not against issuing licences; I am all for this industry.  But it must be watched very carefully because there is so much money to be made out of it if everything goes right.  I would like the Minister to consider what I have said about the conflicts of interests between the two types of fish farming existing here.  Now is the time to do it.  If what I am saying is correct&mdash;and I have reason to think I am 100 per cent correct&mdash;I suggest that all the bays here be zoned; if there are no shellfish in the bay it should be used for salmon and trout farming but if there are shellfish they should have priority.</P>
    <P>This is a chancy business.  All intensive farming is chancy.  What technical data have we here regarding the red tide action? I suggest that not enough money has been spent on the technical side of our fishing industry and particularly on aquaculture to determine where this red tide is coming from and how it is coming to our shores.  I understand that the red tide is off only the north coast of Scotland and off the east and west coasts of Ireland.  It is peculiar that there is no red tide in Brittany where the major portion of shellfish farming in Europe is carried on.  Perhaps the Minister could give us some information on the technical know-how of the Department and what they intend to do to find out where this red tide is coming from.  We are talking about a multi-million pound industry within the next ten years.</P>
    <P>We have dealt with important sections <Col N="816" /> up to this but this is one of the most important developments ever to take place here.  I hope the Minister is Minister for Fisheries and Forestry long enough to look after this important aspect and to bring in the right legislation for it.  I would also like to mention a worry I have about oil spillages.  The red tide and oil spillages are the main things that can really interfere with our aquaculture.  The Department of the Environment and other relevant Departments must ensure that there is proper legislation to make sure that none of these big tankers will come near our shores.  Other things that interfere with our aquaculture, of course, are storms and vandals.  These are the four main things which interfere with shellfish farming and with salmon or trout farming.</P>
    <P>How much of the sea bed does the Minister intend to allocate to somebody who applies for a licence?  Earlier today we talked about rights of way and, if ever rights of way were needed, they are needed in intensive fish farming.  If somebody applies to the Minister to produce a million mussels in a year, has the Minister some rule of thumb for allocating a certain acreage of the sea bed?  Has the Minister some idea that he will allocate 100 square metres or five square miles?  Does he allocate to that man five by five square miles of bed of estuary for that?  We must have some rule of thumb so that somebody applying for a licence does not state that he wants, for example, the entire Mulroy Bay but that he wants an area one mile by one mile to pursue 100,000 salmon or whatever the case may be.  This also must be tied into the section.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing about which I am not at all happy.  I understand that at a lecture delivered recently in Dublin by a senior official from the Department of Fisheries and Forestry one of the questions asked was whether the new central board had the power to prosecute a county council for polluting water.  We are talking about aquaculture but we can also talk about polluting streams, estuaries and bays.  If we have not that power in the central board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy with the Minister's reply that we have the power, because my information is that we did not have it.  We have found that the Department of the Environment and local authorities can be the greatest polluters.  In the future I can see that under the Department of the Environment effluent will be going into Cork Harbour, for instance, a large proportion of which will be untreated industrial effluent.  The central board will have to move quickly before damage is done in areas like Cork Harbour.  I am very pleased to hear that we have the power to take local authorities to task because up to now we have had a unique situation where the Department literally took themselves to court.  That was a crazy situation.  I have always believed that that power should be in the Department of Fisheries and Forestry or some such Department, but certainly not with the Department of the Environment who are among the major offenders.  That Department are very quick to take a small operator to court on a charge of minor pollution of a stream but they themselves seem to have a total disregard for these rules.  I am very pleased at the Minister's reply in that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section deals primarily with aquaculture.  Salmon was <Col N="818" /> referred to but that is really for section 52.  Section 51 has 18 subsections setting out a whole new licensing and designation regime in regard to aquaculture.  It is precisely for the reasons raised by Deputy White, with which I agree, that we are introducing this.  At the moment the situation is largely uncontrollable. We have that very dangerous situation where we do not have an administrative regime properly organised to licence, designate and control this whole area of aquaculture.  The reasons advocated here by Deputy White and the dangers that he spelled out have motivated me in introducing this section under which we now have a procedure by which this whole area can be organised and controlled properly.  I agree with the views expressed here of the need to have a system that can be organised on the basis of scientific criteria so that we do not have a sort of haphazard development of an area of fisheries that could do harm unless properly organised and controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, Deputy White mentioned one aspect with regard to salmon farming and the possible conflict between it and other forms of shellfish farming, and he is right in that.  The compatibility of various types of aquaculture farming has to be examined very closely and will be so examined by the scientists in my Department.  In recent years we have done a very big build-up in this whole area in terms of research and investigation. There is the provision in the Fisheries Research Centre at Abbotstown to deal with this whole area. We have recruited expert scientists and have a whole scientific division concentrating on fish farming and all its implications. One important implication is the necessity to ensure that any such developments are done on a compatible basis.  That is why, whenever an area will be designated under subsection (2) and when licences are being issued under subsection (9), particular attention will be paid by me, on the basis of scientific evidence which I will have available to me, to the compatibility of the species proposed in the application for the farm. Another very important aspect that obviously <Col N="819" /> will have to be borne in mind is the question of the wild forms of natural fish life in an area and the compatibility between a fish farm and existing natural fish habitats and spawning grounds.  As well as protecting established fish farming interests and making sure that there is no incompatibility between those interests and new fish farming interests we also have as an overriding consideration the natural fisheries of the area.  That is why the Bill goes into such detail on this section.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) makes it an offence to engage in aquaculture except in accordance with a fish culture licence or an oyster bed licence.  There is provision for penalties for any sort of aquaculture that is not being done in accordance with a licence issued by me and in an area designated by me.  Subsection (2) is a designation subsection.  Again, each proposal, will, of course, be examined on its merits and will be limited to a specified area in which we would regard the criteria of viability, compatibility and so on.  A number of scientific criteria would limit strictly an area of designation to a specific area that we would regard as being valid in all the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) makes it obligatory that a plan of the area proposed to be the subject of the order be publicised.  Subsection (4) empowers me to hold a public inquiry.  Subsection (5) contains a requirement to deposit documents and for these documents to be published also. Under subsection (7) there is the right of appeal to the High Court.  An important subsection is (10) which provides that an aquaculture licence may not be granted in respect of an area to which an oyster fishery order or oyster bed licence applies or in a private fishery except with the consent of the owner or the person in whose favour such licence or order has been made.</P>
    <P>Subsections amounting to 18 in all set out in very great detail the procedures to be followed, the designation, the species and so on.  The importance of this is that for the first time we can have a regime <Col N="820" /> under which this whole area can be controlled in the national interest and it will be controlled on the basis of strict scientific criteria and studies.  I wish to assure the House of that and to say also that we have set up internally an excellent scientific administration which will be concerned with the application of the standards and criteria to which I have referred. This whole area, while it is an excellent area in which to be engaging from an investment and employment point of view, is fraught with very real dangers.  Only the strictest scientific standards should be applied.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on some very important points made by Deputy White in adverting to the incompatibility between shellfish rearing and salmon and trout farming.  The incidence of pollution from such farms has not been mentioned by the Minister.  He did not advert either to the problem of red tide, a form of pollution that has been a source of much anxiety to those engaged in aquaculture.  The Minister commented briefly across the House that the central board will have power to prosecute local authorities in respect of pollution, but that seems to come as news to some Members of the House.  Having regard to the high incidence of pollution resulting from the discharge of raw sewage from places under the control of local authorities, it is pertinent that the Minister would comment on that situation.  My question, then, is to ask the Minister whether the emergence of the salmon and trout rearing farms constitute a serious threat in so far as shellfish farms are concerned.</P>

He has not given us any scientific information on the incidence of red tide in terms of the damage that this new phenomenon is causing on the south coast and also on the east and west coast.  What is being done scientifically by the Department to deal with the situation?</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister was listening attentively to me when I adverted to the powers vested in the central board to deal with pollution emanating from local authority sources but it would be a signal warning to all those bodies if the Minister would comment now because many of our rivers, including the River Suir and its tributaries, have become virtual cesspools as a direct result of the discharge of sewage from local authority sources.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about pollution and I wish to emphasise that under existing legislation the boards of conservators have the right to prosecute local authorities.  In fact, there are a few such prosecutions pending, one of which is being taken by the Dublin board against Dublin County Council.  These powers of prosecution will be translated in terms of the new regional boards.  The local authorities themselves have assumed a function under the Water Pollution Act whereby they have established divisions throughout the country and engaged the appropriate technical personnel for the purpose of controlling pollution. Therefore, there are two ways of approaching the problem, but what is important is that the power to prosecute is being retained.</P>

      <P>Regarding the question of red tide, this is a problem that we have been watching very closely.  There are several scientific advisers dealing with the matter in an effort to come to grips with it.  Earlier this year the Fisheries Research Centre held a seminar at Abbotstown on this question.  Among those who attended were a number of scientists from other European countries.  The problem has been assessed and found to be a toxic type of disease, but we are not clear where it came from or how it came. From the middle of August to the end of September this year discoloured water, commonly known as red tide, was observed in many areas between Youghal and the Magharees in Kerry.  The organism responsible is microscopic algae.  It has caused problems elsewhere in regard to sea cage trout, causing severe mortalities and it had an effect on shore organisms&mdash;cockles, mussels, and barnacles, while oyster growth was reduced because of a high level of sprat mortalities. I am told that the exact cause of the problem is not known but we are very conscious of the situation and recognise it as a serious danger to the type of development we are discussing here.  However, I shall write to those Deputies who have raised the point, setting out in detail what I am saying now.  People seem to want more information on this problem but we have not reached final conclusions in regard to preventing it.  It is easy to analyse it but it is another matter to say where it came from or how it can be prevented.</P>
      <P>Deputy White raised the question of Mulroy Bay.  I am aware of very successful scallop investigations in that area.  However, the issuing of licences there has been suspended pending full investigation of the potential of the area.</P>

      <P>Before the scallop potential of the area was discovered, a trout farm licence was issued.  Now we have a scallop potential in the region and we have to see how the two activities can be reconciled.  This whole area of aquaculture is full of difficulties. Throughout the world generally it is a completely new area and we are as advanced as a number of other countries. The Norwegians and the Japanese are particularly advanced in this sector but our scientific staff are keeping up with all developments.  The main aspect is the devising of a regime that will issue the licences, designate the areas, make sure there is no incompatibility between the various forms of fish farming and, above all else, ensure that the natural habitat, environment and spawning grounds are protected.  That is the purpose of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be out of his depth.  He talks about scientific evidence.  I am not just talking about Mulroy Bay because I am from Donegal.  For the Minister to say that we are so advanced in this area as Norway is absolute rubbish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a licence has been given to Fitzwilton to farm 650 tons of salmon per year.  In Norway the maximum licence is for 60 tons per annum. I am afraid multinational firms will be given licences of this kind by the Minister simply through lack of knowledge.  I suggest very few people in the Department know all that much about aquaculture.  The Minister said that a trout licence had been granted for Mulroy Bay.  As I understand it, that was issued nearly a year ago.  In that area they applied for a scallop licence nine months ago but it has not yet been processed by the Department.  It should be the other way around.  The Minister's technical advisers have given him wrong advice.  A licence should be given to the shellfish industry in that area and a licence given in respect of trout farming <Col N="824" /> in another area where there is no shellfish.  As I understand it, the Department did not realise until quite recently that intensive trout and salmon farming pollute the waters where the shellfish are located.  That licence in respect of Mulroy Bay should not have been issued and I am glad the Minister has stated that he will be more than careful in future to see that this situation does not arise again.</P>
      <P>The Minister told the House that we do not know the cause of red tide and he repeated the technical and scientific advice given him by his Department.  If I were in the aquaculture business I would be terrified.  In the poultry industry some ten years ago the poultry stocks were affected by a disease which eliminated 50 per cent of the birds in the United Kingdom and Ireland.  Until we know how to deal with red tide the people in the industry will be in a very precarious position.  At the moment they are living from day to day because they do not know when this form of pollution will affect them.  As I understand it, other parts of the world have experienced this pollution, even though it does not appear in many other parts of Europe.  For instance, Norway is not affected by it.</P>
      <P>Much more technical and scientific advice is needed.  I have got many contacts in Norway and I intend to find out how they have developed their aquaculture farms.  I am glad that Gaeltarra Éireann have formed a company with 300 local farmers in Galway to deal with oysters and mussels.  It would be worthwhile if we got local farmers, particularly part-time farmers, involved in this kind of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his reply I should like the Minister to tell the House whether he has granted to Fitzwilton a licence to farm 650 tons of salmon per year even though the total wild catch of salmon in the country is only 2,000 tons.  Fitzwilton are probably thinking of taking about one-third of our natural wild catch of salmon.  If they have not been granted such a licence, I suggest that we do not issue licences for large amounts until the local farming and fishing community around the coast have been involved.  This is the most important <Col N="825" /> section for future development of our fishing industry.</P>

That right is being transferred from the boards of conservators to the seven regional boards who will continue to have that right to prosecute.  Side by side with that enforcement aspect, there is an administration structure which was set up by the previous Government under the Water Pollution Act, 1976, under the Department of the Environment.  That has been <Col N="827" /> set up and established and there is a Water Pollution Council administering that Act.  Amongst others, our fishery scientific people are represented on that council.  That council administer the Water Pollution Act, 1976, through the local authorities who, since 1976, have been in the course of hiring and taking on water pollution experts and staff. There is a double structure.  We have and will continue to have an enforcement structure in the interests of fisheries to prosecute local authorities, and the local authorities are empowered under the Water Pollution Act to set up the administrative structure to handle the problem in terms of expert engineers and pollution experts.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give the House and the country an assurance that, in the growing dimension of this aspect of aquaculture and fish farming, especially around our coasts, he will not grant licences to large groupings, be they national bodies or, worse still, multinational bodies, without ensuring the well-being of the fishermen concerned whose livelihood depends on shellfish, or salmon, or coarse fish or whatever it might be, and whose livelihoods are being impinged upon by the new development? Will he encourage the local fishermen by giving them the knowledge and the expertise to engage in this new feature of aquaculture rather than seeing stretches of our coastline being taken over by multinational groupings over which we would have little control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the extent to which these new developments will impinge upon the traditional rights of our fishermen.  I am concerned to know what employment they will give and what advantage they will be to the nation.  It is obviously a lucrative business especially if one can go into it to the extent of rearing or farming salmon of the dimensions <Col N="828" /> and size mentioned by Deputy White. This is very big business.  It is no wonder that the big shots are moving in.  We must look at it very carefully.  The fishermen's organisations and the fishermen around the coast should be alerted to this trend.</P>
    <P>Names have been mentioned.  They are the biggest companies in this country. Some of them are equal in size to any company in the British Isles or the EEC.  These people can do a lot of good. We welcome their intervention along those lines if it is done with the approval of our fishermen and if it gives gainful employment.  There must be constraints. There must be controls.  Guarantees must be given that this is not a gigantic takeover by multinationals of the rich preserves of fish around our coasts conceivably to the serious disadvantage and possible wiping out of many fishermen who depend on this industry for their livelihood.</P>
    <P>What is developing in parts of the country is worrying.  We have allowed a serious conflict to emerge through lack of direction from the Minister's Department. People were allowed to engage in the farming of trout and possibly salmon in an area where it was traditional to harvest shellfish.  The effluent from these farms is virtually toxic to the shellfish in the area.  That is a stupid policy.</P>
    <P>There are many worrying aspects but the one I am concerned with now is the extent of this new development of people speculating in aquaculture, in the rearing of salmon in particular, and the repercussions which will arise from that for our traditional fishermen and the nation as a whole.  I am also concerned about the manner in which the fish will be distributed and where.  There are many sides to this very big issue.  At this stage the Minister's observations would be welcome.</P>

Because we have been concerned with the reasons advanced by Deputies White, Treacy and Cosgrave, we have decided to introduce controls under which I can only issue a licence after the production of documents and maps and after public enquiry procedures to ensure that traditional fishing rights are not interfered with.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Although we have been hearing a great deal of talk in recent years about the potential of aquaculture, few positive measures have been taken to further that industry.  With respect to what Deputy Treacy said about multinationals <Col N="830" /> taking over this sphere of activity, it seems that they are the only people who have the resources to go into this line of business.  In the national interest we should encourage anybody, no matter how rich or how ambitious, to go into this business on condition that the rights of fishermen are safeguarded.  I recall asking questions about State initiative in this area.  It seems that there is little State initiative other than the giving of grants and that the EEC will give generous grants for the development of aquaculture.  It appears that development is being left in the hands of commercial interests.  The heavy capital outlay required precludes smaller concerns from becoming involved in the industry.</P>
      <P>Fishery reports do not list the different varieties of shellfish which can be reared in captivity.  I should like the Minister to give us a schedule listing species of shellfish which can be reared under artificial conditions.  If this information was made public it would give people an insight into the industry.  A report from the Leenane International Conference which was held in December 1978 states that the potential for the production of mussels is 5,000 tonnes per annum.  This seems to be a low figure in comparison with the Spanish figure of 150,000 tonnes.  Mussels seem to thrive around our coast and I wonder if we understand the potential of such a fishery.</P>

      <P>The understaffing in the Minister's Department has led to the small development in aquaculture.  The Minister should tell us whether he has <Col N="831" /> the research facilities to develop the industry. I suspect that lack of personnel, money and scientific facilities is the main cause of the present underdevelopment. Mussels and oysters are easy to develop. I do not know what the position is in relation to scallops and sea urchins. There is a market for shellfish in France. Periwinkles are probably our most plentiful shellfish.  The people who collect them are probably getting only one-tenth of their value on the French market.  The industry seems to lack marketing expertise. Can the Minister promise us an improvement in that regard?  In order to develop the industry we must ensure that the producer is given a high percentage of the selling price on the French and Belgian markets.</P>

      <P>This section on aquaculture in general is so important and has been so neglected that we are entitled to dwell on this section to a certain degree.</P>
      <P>Russia expect to supply over half their fish supplies by 1990 from aquaculture methods.  That is a vast amount of artificially produced shellfish.  It behoves us as a country with a far more suitable climate, to attempt to do something about developing aquaculture here.  I would be happy to see private individuals and companies, no matter how rich they are, involved in this, because the bulk of these products are exported and must be of tremendous benefit to us. Is it possible to develop lobsters, crayfish, prawns and shrimps by means of aquaculture?  Surely they occur around our coasts in reasonable quantities.  If we can increase these quantities by aquaculture we should do so especially when other species of fish such as herring and salmon are on the decline.  These artificially produced fish have a high money value on the open markets in Europe.  Will the Minister say what experiments have been carried out by the Department and what projects are going on to develop this very high priced commodity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Killilea suggested that there should be a close season for products such as lobsters.  Will the Minister say if he has any intention of designating a close season for lobster and crayfish and if he intends introducing a licensing system to make sure that lobsters are not overfished?  We seem to take action only when something has gone beyond the point of no return.  We saw that with the herring industry and it is likely to happen with the salmon industry.  Will the Minister refer to a close season for these <Col N="833" /> fish when they are breeding, and also to a licensing system?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The world is still learning in regard to it and there are very big disease aspects involved which have already been referred to.  This section has been introduced because of the importance of controlling aquaculture.  We are introducing for the first time a licensing system, the power to designate areas, to publish, to hold a public inquiry and to control it in the national interest.</P>
      <P>In relation to the technical progress in regard to certain fish, mussels, scallops and oysters can be farmed excellently. Development in relation to lobsters, crayfish, or prawns is not as advanced, but can be further developed scientifically. Considerable progress has also been made in regard to salmon and sea trout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Deasy say he welcomed the research attention that can be given to this area by big firms.  A lot of research, speculation and investigation is going on into this whole area and only firms of consequence can afford the sort of long-term development and investigation that is required.  In Ireland Guinness, BIM, the ESB and Gaeltarra Eireann are involved in this research.  I intend to co-ordinate the whole thing rather than to allow a haphazard development to proceed without any planning.  This section is to ensure that we have some sort of order and control in this area.  Existing fishing rights, natural habitats and spawning grounds have to be protected.  Under this Bill no one will be allowed to interfere with traditional public fishery rights. That is the reason for the public inquiry procedure set out here.  After notice and <Col N="834" /> publication of intention to apply to me for a licence, an inquiry must be held in the area so that anybody who has a right can object and so on.  The section sets out in detail what I have said so as to ensure that no rights are interfered with, and I attach tremendous importance to that aspect.  Existing public rights should be organised on a co-operative basis.  We have had certain success in that area this year in Clarenbridge in County Galway, in Cromane and in other areas around the coast where there are existing public rights held by fishermen.</P>
    <P>We have alerted the EEC to this aspect and we now have sanctioned by the EEC a 50 per cent grant contribution towards aquaculture projects.  At a meeting on Monday I proposed that this, initiated as a temporary scheme last year, should be continued for the coming year, and I hope it will form a permanent feature of the common fisheries policy. The only countries within the EEC in receipt of a 50 per cent grant towards aquaculture projects are Italy and Ireland.  That indicates our intentions in this matter.  Because of the regional development implications in relation to aquaculture we have a good case.  The most suitable locations for aquaculture development are around the coast in our more deprived areas that require redevelopment, so that the implications on a regional social basis are quite exciting and interesting provided we can organise it properly, make sure it is controlled and that we apply scientific criteria to any project proposed.</P>
    <P>The scientific criteria are important because, as we said in the discussion on the menace of red tide, this whole area of disease is very serious for aquaculture&mdash;a disease could wipe out a farm overnight.  Therefore, the scientific aspect is important.  I will look into the points made here with regard to building up the scientific side of my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Following what Deputy Deasy said, I suggest that we send two technical people from the Department of Fisheries and Forestry to Norway for perhaps a three-month period because we do not seem to know enough about aquaculture.  We know enough about intensive farming, such as pigs, chickens, turkeys and so on, but in this area we need more specialised knowledge.</P>
      <P>Although I said I was alarmed at the big multinationals starting up in Mulroy and Cork, I would not like the House to think I was against multinationals as such.  My first priority is for fishermen/farming co-operatives to develop these areas.  If they are not functioning&mdash;I appreciate what the Minister said that it costs a great deal of money to get new types of farming off the ground&mdash;I would welcome the multinationals in the areas where the local co-operatives are not interested.  I would like to see the whole coastline worked.</P>

      <P>One of the amendments mentioned the Foyle fishery area.  If that area is mentioned and if salmon come in from the other side of the Foyle, those salmon should have the right to be sold in the State so long as they are entered in the register.  In the last 12 months instead of selling Irish smoked salmon it is estimated that 25 per cent of salmon sold was smoked Irish salmon coming from the Baltic.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of this.  They have changed the name from Irish smoked salmon, which is our native wild Irish salmon smoked here, and have imported Baltic salmon and have called it smoked Irish salmon.  I suggest that when we are talking about licensing, tagging and so on we should develop a brand name as Board Bainne have done.  The brand name is immaterial once it is classed as Irish smoked salmon.  It is ridiculous to think <Col N="839" /> that we are importing salmon from the Baltic and have the cheek to try to cod the people by calling it smoked Irish salmon.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he has satisfied himself that the building societies are making house loans available to the maximum amount permissible of their deposits and not placing depositors' funds on short-term deposit with other financial institutions instead of being allocated to loan applicants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Quarterly Bulletin issued by the Central Bank in August 1979 indicated that the value of building society mortgage loans had fallen from 77 per cent of total assets in June 1978 to 68 per cent in June 1979.  The value of liquid assets, including cash and investments, had on the other hand increased from 21 per cent to 30 per cent of total assets over the same period.  The reason for this decrease in mortgage assets and <Col N="847" /> corresponding increase in liquid assets can be readily seen in the exceptionally high level of net inflow of funds to building societies during the last quarter of 1978 and the first half of 1979.  In the first half of 1979, for instance, net inflow of funds was running at almost two-and-a-half times the level prevailing during the same period last year.  The societies felt that if they had suddenly released those funds on the mortgage market too quickly it would have had an adverse effect on house prices.  The societies decided to endeavour to spread funds out evenly over the whole year.</P>
    <P>The situation prevailing in June this year is now changing.  Net inflow of funds, although still high, has reverted to more normal levels, but societies are in a position to maintain loan approvals at a fairly high level as they draw down the liquidity built up at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>Information supplied by the Registrar of Building Societies indicates that in 1976, 1977 and 1978 over 98 per cent of building society lending was devoted to housing loans.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, therefore, I see no reason to be dissatisfied with building society lending policies.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he has received representations from the Construction Industry Confederation or other parties in the construction industry outlining their concern at the effect of the shortage of bridging finance on house construction and building projects, and the measures he has taken&mdash;in addition to the moneys made available by the trustee savings banks&mdash;to ensure that the present scarcity of bridging finance will be alleviated.</P>

      <P>I have received representations from the Construction Industry Federation and others about this matter and I am naturally concerned about and in constant touch with the situation.  In this connection I would refer the Deputy to the reply to a similar question by him by the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance on 18 October 1979.  The latest figures show that the amount of bridging accommodation outstanding by the associated banks was £182 million at mid-August, representing a 70 per cent increase over mid-August 1978, and a 43 per cent increase over mid-February 1979.</P>
      <P>I am advised that, while conditions remain tight, bridging finance continues to be available.  Building societies report that their approved applicants for mortgages continue to be able to get bridging finance.  I am assured by the building societies that they are issuing mortgage loans as quickly as they can. In this connection they paid out the record sum of £58 million in the quarter ended 30 September last and estimate that they will advance an equivalent amount this quarter. These payments must have the effect of easing the situation.</P>

      <P>It may not make sense, but under the terms of the Building Societies Act they are prevented from doing so unless they have clear title, as we have been discussing recently.  They will and can give approval for a loan to any person subject to conditions A, B and C, one of which would be the furnishing of a proper title.  That will suffice for the bank to give a bridging loan but the building societies cannot give that bridging loan until they have proper title.</P>

Having regard to the legal constraints which he has described, would the Minister consider the possibility of transferring to someone who has been approved for a loan with the building societies but who is unable to close because of lack of title and so forth, the benefit in terms of the interest earned by the loan approval? That would cost him about 14 per cent with the building society and it can be deposited at about 18 per cent with any other financial institution. In other words, the loan is approved in his or her name.  It cannot be removed until such time as the sale is closed; it can be there for three, six or nine months earning interest at four per cent more than he or she would have to pay.</P>

      <P>Planning permission is normally required for the erection of signs whether on a temporary or permanent basis and whether located in the inner city or the suburbs.  Certain signs are exempted from planning control and <Col N="859" /> relevant details are set out in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1977.  I understand from Dublin Corporation that planning permission has not been sought or granted for the erection of the signs referred to by the Deputy and that enforcement action under the Planning Acts for their removal has been initiated.</P>

      <P>Two applications have been made in the past two years by a number of residents of the Leixlip area to have Leixlip constituted as a town with town commissioners. The function of the Minister for the Environment in relation to such applications is to decide on the suitability of the town boundaries proposed and, if satisfied, to order the proposal to be adjudicated locally.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the progress made to date in the provision of a high level bridge over the River Suir at Waterford city and the procedures remaining before building of the bridge can commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed Waterford Corporation on 12 June last that I was prepared to hold a public local inquiry into their application for a bridge order for a new high level bridge over the river Suir when the corporation had clarified the position in regard to the acquisition of necessary lands for the bridge and its approach roads.  At the same time I asked the corporation to proceed immediately with arrangements for the replacement of Redmond Bridge, which their consultants had reported to be in a dangerous condition.  I intimated that the latter project would afford Waterford Corporation an opportunity to review the implications of the high level bridge proposal, particularly in regard to environmental and financial aspects and present and future traffic needs, and that information of this nature would need to be available for presentation at an inquiry into the corporation's application for a bridge order.  I have also told the corporation that if compulsory purchase <Col N="863" /> order proceedings for the acquisition of necessary lands proved to be necessary it would be desirable to hold the statutory inquiry at the same time as the inquiry into the application for a bridge order.</P>
      <P>It is now a matter for Waterford Corporation to ascertain the necessary information for submission to my Department to enable a date to be set for the inquiry.</P>
      <P>I have recently approved, in principle, proposals by Waterford Corporation for the construction of a new low level bridge across the River Suir adjacent to Redmond Bridge.</P>

      <P>There should not be any confusion in this regard.  I made the position absolutely clear to the corporation regarding what they should do in order to permit me to set up the inquiry.  When they comply with what was requested I shall set a date for the inquiry without any delay, as has happened in other areas regarding bridge orders.  It was made clear not only to members of Waterford Corporation but to officials of the corporation, as the Deputy will recall, that this was the position.  That was confirmed by letter.  Consequently, as I said in my reply, it is now a matter for the corporation to ascertain the necessary information and submit it to my Department so that a date may be set for the inquiry.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he received any formal or informal written inquiries from persons or organisations in the private sector interested in participating in the provision of toll roads for public use under the Local Government (Toll Roads) Bill, 1979, and, if so, the extent of capital which such communications have indicated as being available and the possible extension to the road network that such proposals would envisage.</P>

      <P>The queries raised by the Deputy have already been dealt with in the course of the debate on the Local Government (Toll Roads) Bill, 1978, which has been passed by this House and is now before the Seanad.  I would refer the Deputy in particular to columns 496 and 511 to 514 of the Dáil Official Report of 27 March last&mdash;Volume 313 No. 3.  Pending enactment of the Bill and pending consideration of its provisions by both the statutory road authorities and the private sector, I will not be in a position to give any further information to the Deputy on these queries.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for that reply, but it does not contain anything new.  My question is to ask the Minister if there have been any additional written communications from the private sector indicating interest.  I am concerned about the period from March to date.</P>

      <P>As I have told the Deputy, interest has been expressed.  We would not have any written communica <Col N="869" /> tions mainly because the Bill made it clear that their approach should be to the local authority in question.  That is where negotiations should start.  I have said I will not be in a position to give any further replies with regard to this question until the Bill is passed, probably this evening, when it may be signed immediately by the President.  After that I shall be in a position to give the Deputy a more detailed reply.</P>

      <P>I understand that the National Rehabilitation Board have agreed to compile, at the request of the inter-departmental committee, a register of disabled persons who might be suitable for employment in the public sector.

      <P>A special amenity area order for portion of Dublin Bay was made by Dublin Corporation on 4 April 1977.  The order was placed on public display in April-May 1977 and objections to it were lodged with Dublin Corporation. The order together with these objections was submitted to me on 26 May 1977 and in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, as the objections made had not been withdrawn, a public local inquiry was held on 14 days between 23 May and 30 June 1978.

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the position regarding the Dublin city development plan.  The draft plan was on public display from June to September 1976 and a total of 3,672 objections or representations were made.  In October 1976 the then Minister requested the corporation to re-examine the recommendations of the Dublin Transportation Study and, pending this re-examination, consideration of the objections relating to the road proposals in the draft development plan was deferred. The report of the re-examination of the transportation study was adopted in principle by the council in February 1979 and arising from it amendments were made in the draft development plan and passed by the council in July 1979. As these amendments constituted a material alteration of the draft development plan, it was necessary to put the amendments on public display for a further period from 18 September to 16 November 1979.  The objections and representations made by the public have now to be considered by the corporation. The making and review of their development <Col N="875" /> plan is the function of the planning authority and, while the present delay may be thought long, the provisions of the Planning Acts make specific provision for ensuring that due consideration be given to the views of the public in relation to the provisions of the plan before it is adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that the present situation is unsatisfactory from everyone's point of view?  Having regard to the size of the area under the function of the Dublin Corporation, will he consider the necessity of reviewing the Planning Acts of 1976 and 1963?  An alternative form of planning process should be designed for the large urban areas, not only Dublin, but Cork and Limerick as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy very detailed reasons for these delays. They are justified under the existing Planning Acts.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disagreeing, but will the Minister not agree that the process of planning is such that not one comma of it can be changed until every part of it is agreed?  Many parts of the developments plans affecting the inner city area were designed and published in draft form in 1968.  They are still legally in operation and they are totally unsuitable to the needs of the city.  Their reform is being held up because of other matters.  In view of the size of the city of Dublin, would the Minister not agree that there is a need to change the planning process, not the democratic participation, for large urban local authority areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <P>The section enables the prohibition by order of the sale of specified kinds of fish or rod caught fish, either completely or during specified periods.  We are giving consideration to a ban on the sale of rod caught fish after the closing of the commercial fishing season, as it represents <Col N="890" /> an outlet for evasion.  A proposal to ban completely the sale of sea trout is also being looked at in the interests of conservation. The section will give the necessary power to the Minister to adopt such measures if it is decided they are necessary for conservation.  It is a strictly enabling section and no more than that to enable me to be more flexible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, an oral amendment. Amendment No. 44 enables the prohibition of the sale of certain types of net by order.  I referred to this already in connection with the need to deal with the monofilament menace.  It cannot be described as anything less than that.  I am proposing that we order the prohibition of the sale of certain types of net and I have in mind the monofilament net.  A prohibition on the sale of nets whose use in fishing is illegal would ensure that such nets would not be generally available.  This would help to stop at source dealing in monofilament nets by fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> At the moment monofilament net is illegal, but it is very difficult to enforce the regulation because of the fact that we allow the sale of monofilament net.  Up to now the advice has been that because of its use for other purposes of which the House may be aware, such as the protection of vegetables and tomatoes, and for other industrial purposes, it was difficult to organise or control the sale of the net even though fishing with the net is illegal. I was not satisfied with the reasons advanced heretofore, and I persuaded my people to put in this amendment, even though it is a bit drastic, to prohibit the actual sale of monofilament net as such.</P>
    <P>As well as being illegal to fish with it, its sale or distribution or trading in it will now be prohibited. This will be a big help in enabling us to get at monofilament fishing which is one of the big types of illegal fishing which give the fish very little chance and is a very anti-conservation method.</P>
    <P>I have a small oral amendment which I want to put to the House.  I move that the word &ldquo;proceeding&rdquo; in the first line of subsection (3) be changed to &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo;.  It is a grammatical type of amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 45:</P>
      <P>In page 51, subsection (1), line 14, to delete &ldquo;Each regional board&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;The Central Board&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has to do with the registration of anglers with the regional boards.  Under this section the members of the various clubs are obliged to register and indicate their choice of fishing&mdash;for trout, coarse fish or sea angling.  My amendment seeks to make it possible for a member of an angling club to register with the central board instead of the regional board.  As the Bill is framed, it would be necessary for an angler to register in each region he wishes to fish.  Somebody living in, say, Cavan would need to register in three regions in that area.  A tourist on a mobile holiday would need to register in all areas.  If the register were attached to the central board, only one permit would be required for the whole country.  I suggest that the administration of such a register would be less costly and less <Col N="894" /> cumbersome than if it were a regional function.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister and the House will agree that anglers are more mobile today than they were in the past.  There is greater interchange between angling clubs.  It seems only right that anglers should be free to travel around the fishing areas of their choice.  It would facilitate matters greatly if they could register with the central board rather than registering with their own regional board and being confined to that area.  It would also eliminate the problem of an individual having a vote in numerous regions as he would be obliged to indicate in the central register which region he will be attached to for voting purposes.</P>
    <P>Members of angling clubs in the Dublin area would need to register in a number of regional areas if they desired to fish in, say, the midlands instead of in the Dublin area, likewise people in the South in the Lismore and Waterford areas.  It would be very beneficial for a tourist to register with the central board, especially if he were on a touring holiday. As a keen angler he could then see the country and fish in the rivers and lakes of his choice.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will appreciate the desirability of having a central register rather than the restricting area of a region.  With the advent of the car and the helicopter and air traffic generally, people move about more freely and anglers are no exception.  I believe that fishermen would welcome the suggestion that they be given a wider area to fish and a wider choice of rivers and lakes to fish from by registering in the first instance with the central board.  I recommend that the Minister adopt that policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>For the first time I disagree with Deputy Treacy on this matter. The Minister should consider Deputy Treacy's point in relation to a tourist having the right to fish in any one of the eight regional areas.  This raises the question whether a tourist has the right to vote on paying a registration fee. A tourist should not have the right to <Col N="895" /> vote.  If a tourist applies to the Ballyshannon board and states that he wants to fish in the Waterford area, he should be given permission to fish in the eight regional areas.  The power should lie with the regional board rather than with the central board.  I think that licensing should be the function of the regional boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is confusion between fishing and voting.  On payment of a fee&mdash;it also applies to the existing Inland Fisheries Trust members who are being subsumed under the legislation&mdash;the angler will be entitled to fish in any waters but will only be entitled to vote where he is registered.  I think that this meets Deputy Treacy's point.  As voting is a regional matter, the register should be kept in the voting region.  For the first time the angler will be entitled to vote to the regional board. However, his right to fish in any waters under the control of the central board or his rights as a life member of the Inland Fisheries Trust are not prejudiced.</P>
      <P>If a tourist pays his fee he will have the right to fish but not the right to vote. Voting is reserved for Irish nationals.</P>

The provision is acceptable to me and I am sure that it will be welcomed by large groups of anglers who felt that there was a restriction in the Bill.  There was a feeling that if central registration was accepted they would have free access to the waters around them throughout the country.  If the Minister says that there will be no restriction on them I am quite happy to withdraw my amendment.</P>

    <P>The proposals here are to take section 20 (4) of the Principal Act out of the repeals listed in the First Schedule to the Bill and <Col N="900" /> instead substitute a new subsection for subsection (4) enabling the Minister to define the boundaries of the fishery districts at sea.  It deals with the boundaries of the new fishery regions.  It is necessary for the purpose of by-laws and licences to maintain the legal existence of fisheries districts that we are now describing as fishery regions.  Under the Principal Act the outer limits of these districts have not been defined.  We have legal advice that their areas extend only to 12 miles.  We are extending that definitively in the legislation to 12 miles as far as the new regions are concerned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage the Minister gave an assurance that he would review the matter.  I regret that Deputy Begley is not here to air his point of view.  There has been blatant discrimination in the issuing of salmon licences in recent years since drift netting became popular and extremely profitable.  I would like another assurance from the Minister that matters will be put in order so that the most deserving cases will be granted licences.  Will the Minister spell out clearly the type of selection committees or boards he intends to set up to ensure a fair and proper distribution of licences so that some areas will not have 200 licences when areas with just as strong a tradition and where there are many qualified fishermen may get only eight or nine licences?  This is the case in Kerry fishery district.  I know fishery districts are being amalgamated and enlarged. With the enlargement I would like to see a proper system for the allocation of licences.  Will the inspector from the Department sit on the board issuing the licences to see that everything is done properly?  Up to now, far too often it was a case of the old pals act.  If you were a relative or close friend of one of the people issuing the licences, you stood a far better chance of getting one.  There have been blatant abuses of the system.  Any person familiar with salmon fisheries could name dozens of such abuses.  How does the Minister intend getting rid of that type of abuse and ensuring it will not occur again?</P>

      <P>This comes back to the hard core of the Bill, which is concerned <Col N="902" /> with establishing a more professional structure of protection, development and enforcement in regard to inland fisheries. I agree with the point raised by Deputy Deasy.  I look to the chief executive officers, who carry this responsibility.  This would be their job.  They would be appointed on an independent basis and would be free from any entanglements. They will be like the county manager in charge of a local authority area&mdash;employed to do an independent job and when carrying out their job in an independent and conscientious way their employment will be fully protected.  That has not been the situation up to now. The difficulty has been that the staffs of the board were not appointed on a professional basis and they did not have any job guarantee.  That led to abuses.  I think that is what Deputy Deasy was referring to. I hope the new administrative structure will serve to eliminate much of what happened in the past.</P>

    <P>This is a technical amendment.

      <P>This is another technicality linked to the same area.  As drafted at present a warrant issued under section 297 of the Principal Act allows an authorised person to enter and search a particular garden, dwellinghouse or curtilage.  It is considered that an extension of these powers is necessary to allow any structure or building in such a garden or curtilage to be entered and searched.  The amendment provides for this.  We are up against a number of smart lawyers in fisheries prosecutions and these points were raised in District Courts.  Apparently this was one loophole.</P>

Even at present people have been appointed to boards because they represent the Government side regardless of what Government is in power.  Fianna Fáil are in now and I am afraid that Fianna Fáil nominees would be appointed who would know damn all about fishing.  I do not want to waste my time or the Minister's time by the Minister appointing the wrong people. I would like to see a trade union representative and a member of the staff on the board.  The others should be technical people and experts in the field.  They should know something about aquaculture, which we know very little about in this country.  I do not want Fianna Fáil nominees on the board but experts.  Otherwise there will be questions in the Dáil until I am sick asking them and the people will get so embarrassed that they will leave the board.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 56:</P>
      <P>In page 60, Article 3, paragraph (2), after line 17, to add:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) The Minister shall appoint such members of the Central Board as shall be elected by virtue of the application of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977&rdquo;.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to provide worker representation on the central board.  It will be accepted that especially in recent times it is recognised that worker participation in the management of both State and semi-State enterprises leads to improvement in management-worker relations.  The basis of the new fishery authority is seven regional boards and one central board. Workers <Col N="913" /> in these areas will experience different problems regarding fishery development, and it is essential that they can bring these problems to light not only at regional board level but also at central board level where final policy decisions will be formulated.  Very strong representations were made to the Minister by the workers in the industry especially through their trade union organisations that they should have representation on the central board. The unions and the membership generally in the industry formed a very strong opinion that the Minister would provide representation for them on the central board.  It is regrettable that this is not contained in the Act and my amendment seeks to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>The legislation to which I refer was passed in recent times, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, and already many of our best known State companies operating under this Act are designated bodies under it.  Most of them by now have provided for representation on their respective boards.  It applies to CIE, Bord na Móna, the ESB, Aer Lingus, the B &amp; I Company, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and Nítrigin Éireann Teo.  It is valuable legislation and if the Minister does not avail of this opportunity to provide such representation in accordance with the Act he will be throwing away a large amount of goodwill, co-operation and expertise which could be invaluable in the operation of inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Minister commented earlier rather generally on how he proposes to appoint people to the board but in this case I am asking for a specific assurance that he will do it in the right manner in accordance with the legislation passed by this House and in accordance with what we believe is right in these times when there is so much industrial strife, and so win for himself the greatest possible amount of goodwill, co-operation, trust and responsibility from all the workers in the industry by ensuring democratically that they are allowed to elect one of their spokesmen or spokespersons to the board. I should like <Col N="914" /> to hear the Minister's views especially having regard to the strong feeling among the unions representing the men that this should be done.</P>
    <P>I do not want to introduce disharmony into the debate, but there are already grumblings among the employees of the Minister's Department because there was anxiety in respect of the proposal to transfer the staff of the Inland Fisheries Trust from Dublin to Galway.  That problem is still unresolved. In order to avoid unnecessary haggling, conflict or disruption of the good work of the central board and its agencies I strongly recommend to the Minister that he should do the right thing in this instance and invoke the Worker Participation Act passed two years ago and provide for worker participation as sought in my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Treacy. There should be one member representing the workers or, as I said before, one member representing the trade unions.  That is important and perhaps the Minister would consider this when he appoints the six nominees. Another point&mdash;is the chairman of the central board elected or selected?  Does the Minister appoint the chairman or will the 13 people who will then represent the central board elect a chairman?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the amendment, we are dealing here with two separate schemes of legislation.  The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977 is a specific piece of legislation in which worker participation was introduced here for the first time.  It is an excellent piece of legislation but it specifies in the Schedule seven State-sponsored bodies.  These are designated in that Act, Bord na Móna, CIE, ESB, B &amp; I, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Aer Lingus and Nitrigin Éireann.  Specific regulations are made under that Act governing the holding of elections.  It is a very detailed and complex system of election.  An amendment of that Act would be required before any other regulations could be introduced to extend the operation of that to other State bodies.  This is all worked out between the Minister for Labour and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and so on.  As Deputies know from the names I have read out, they represent the biggest State corporations in the country.  There are nearly 100,000 workers involved in all these companies.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a different situation now.  If at some future date the Minister for Labour does decide to extend the scope of the worker participation legislation, it will be done on criteria and for reasons that can be worked out between the Minister for Labour and the trade unions.  What we are talking about here is something different.  I have given an assurance that I will definitely, without bringing in the Worker Participation Act aspect at all, appoint a representative of the staff.  I have told them that.  I think they recognise the situation.  They put the point of view that Deputy Treacy put here in the House and I put the point of view that I have just put here.  At the end of the day they were inclined to go along with it and they left me with the impression that they would go along with two out of my six.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>One member of his own staff would be appointed.  The main unions <Col N="916" /> involved are the staff association and the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  I prefer to deal with it on that basis rather than on the basis suggested by Deputy Treacy, because it is not really relevant to this Bill and cannot be included.  What his amendment involves is an amendment of the Worker Participation Act.  That is separate legislation in which the Department of Labour and ICTU criteria would have to be applied.  I would imagine that any extensions there would be on the basis of strength of numbers employed in particular State enterprises.  To come back to the point, these are very big corporations.</P>

      <P>I am heartened and encouraged by that approach and by the fact that there will be consultation so that the person elected to the board with the Minister's approval will be the choice of the representatives of the men and women who are operating in the Inland Fisheries Trust and the boards of conservators at present.  I see that it is not strictly a matter for the Minister to apply in this Act but rather for the Minister for Labour now or in the future.</P>

    <P>(b) The Minister may for the purpose of this Article fix the number of members in relation to&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i) regional boards generally,</P>
    <P>(ii)  regional boards of a particular class or description,</P>
    <P>(iii)  a particular regional board.  </P>

    <P>(ii) the period (being a period not exceeding six months beginning on the date on which the resolution is passed) during which the resolution is to remain in force.  </P>
    <P>(4) For so long as a resolution under this Article remains in force the following provisions shall have effect:</P>
    <P> (i) the person by reason of whose ill-health the resolution was passed shall not be a member of the Central Board,</P>
    <P>(ii) the person nominated by the resolution shall be a member of the Central Board,</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 69:</P>
      <P>In page 69, Part I, paragraph 1 (ii), to delete lines 41 to 48 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" />&ldquo;(a) an officer of the Minister or other person appointed in writing by the Minister to be an authorised person for the purposes of this Part,</P>
    <P>(b) an officer of the Central Board appointed in writing by that board to be an authorised person for the said purposes,</P>
    <P>(c) an officer of a regional board or other person appointed in writing by that board to be an authorised person for the said purposes, or&rdquo;.   </P>
    <P>Referring to the authorised person phrase in section 292 of the Principal Act, authorised persons have powers to enforce the fishery laws.  That section of the Principal Act is now being substituted by this amendment on page 69 of the Bill.  We have decided to include officers of the central board as authorised persons and the amendment gives effect to that.  That is important. The central board will be taking over most of the present trust staff and they will have to be authorised persons as well as the existing boards of conservators' authorised persons.  They will all be authorised persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 70 relates specifically to the whole matter of pollution.  The Minister will appreciate that for the enforcement of the local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, the primary control is vested in the local authority, the sanitary authority, the Minister, the Minister for Fisheries or a board of conservators.  When the new Fisheries Bill comes into force the regional boards only will be empowered to proceed under this Act.  My amendment seeks to ensure that the central board will also be involved because in the central board there will be a repository of expert scientific advice which is of vital importance in dealing with this whole question of pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be admitted that there is an inherent weakness in this section of the Bill from a biological point of view.  The definition of pollution matter is in the Local Government (Water Pollution) <Col N="924" /> Act, 1977.  It includes any poisonous or noxious matter, any substance including any explosives, liquid or gas, the entry or discharge of which into any waters is liable to render those and any other waters poisonous or injurious to fish, spawning grounds or the food of any fish or to injure fish in their value as human food or to impair the usefulness of the bed and soil of any waters as spawning grounds or their capacity to produce food or fish or to render such waters harmful to public health or to domestic, industrial, agricultural or recreational uses.</P>
    <P>It is contended strongly that there will be a back-up service under the aegis of the central board that would not normally be available to the regional boards and that there is no justifiable reason why the central board ought not to be able to take action against those who pollute our rivers and our lakes.  In the past the boards of conservators have been unable to get possession of the biological evidence of pollution because of their clear lack of personnel, technical know-how and expertise, and the new regional boards would not have the necessary expert staff to obtain this kind of evidence.  In view of this the central board staff must be available and must be empowered not merely to advise in these things but also to carry out the work if necessary.  In relation to pollution investigation the regional board officers should be advised and supervised by and have the full back-up of the central board specialists.  It should be possible for the central board staff to examine samples from the regional board and analyse them.  This is such an obvious area of co-operation between the centralised board at national level and the regional boards that the Minister will agree that there should be the closest liaison between them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on what Deputy Treacy has said, in regard to the central and regional boards we do not want any duplication.  We all agree that we are giving the central board special functions to perform on the technical, research and administration side.  If the <Col N="925" /> regional boards need any expert advice they will send for someone from the central board to advise them in their own regions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>The regions, in turn, will look after the local staff.  They will do the manual work as far as the restoration of lakes, rivers and estuaries is concerned.  I am in total agreement with the two-tier system as long as we have no duplication. Too many State and semi-State bodies have too much duplication, which is using up a lot of money unnecessarily. I hope that when these boards are set up there will be no duplication.  The central board will have their duties to perform and the regional boards will have their own duties.</P>

      <P>I was under the impression that the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, was to be administered not by the fishery boards but by the local authorities.  I did not think that this would arise.  On that point, I was interested to read the statement by an official of the Dublin Fisheries Board within the past two weeks who expressed his displeasure at the deletion of certain aspects of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, which empowered the boards of conservators to prosecute people for pollution.  The deletion of these sections meant that they could no longer do so. Has the Minister any comment on that?</P>

      <P>That is the situation. Regarding the other point about the central board and the regional boards, amendment No. 70 in the name of Deputy Treacy is met by my amendment No. 69 in that what we are allowing is that the central staff will be designated to be authorised persons under the Act, that they will have the same rights as authorised persons who are on the staffs of the regional boards and can investigate pollution in particular or undertake any other type of investigation considered necessary in the interest of fishery conservation.  Deputy Treacy is right in so far as there was a gap in the Bill but that gap is being closed by my amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 69, Part I, lines 56 to 59, and in page 70, lines 1 to 3, to delete subparagraph (jj) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(jj) the substitution of the following for subsection (2) of section 293:</P>
      <P>`(2) (a)  Subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection, the powers conferred by this Part on a member of a regional board or an officer of such a board or other person appointed under this Part by such a board to be an authorised person for the purposes of this Part shall be exercised only for the protection of the fisheries in the fisheries region of the board by whom the appointment is made or of which the person is a member, and for the enforcement in such region of the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 1979, and any instrument made thereunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) Two or more regional boards may enter into an agreement for the exercise in each of the fisheries regions of those boards by an officer or other person appointed under this Part by any board which is a party to the agreement to be an authorised person for the purposes of this Part of the powers conferred by this Part on such officer or person and for the enforcement by such officer or person in each such region of the Fisheries Acts, 1959 <Col N="928" /> to 1979, and any instrument thereunder, and in case an agreement under this paragraph is for the time being in force, paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be construed and have effect subject to the agreement.</P>
    <P>(c)  A document purporting to be an appointment under this section and to be signed by the chief officer of a regional board shall be receivable as <i>prima facie</i> evidence in any legal proceedings without proof either of any signature thereon or that a person whose signature is thereon was the chief officer of the regional board concerned, and in case such a document states that an agreement under this subsection has been made between two or more regional boards specified in the document, then, until the contrary is shown, such an agreement shall be regarded as having been made and being in force.'.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>This amendment sets out provisions in relation to the limitation to the exercise of powers by authorised persons.  Again, it is a legal limitation.  At present, the section in the Principal Act confines the authority of a warrant holder to the region of issue.  However, provision is not being made for the application of this limitation to officers appointed by the regional boards and who are not officers of that board.  In other words, they are officers of adjoining boards.  The purpose of the amendment is to make exercisable the powers of authorised persons as authorised by the new regional boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They have built up their assets by a levy on milk production.  If the Government are ungenerous in the giving of a guarantee and insist that in order to raise the money Bord Bainne must seek some other means of security this will put pressure on the board to increase the levy on milk production. Although I concede that the sum of £90 million is a generous improvement on the existing level of £40 million which was set in 1976, the time could come when Bord Bainne will even run up against the top of the £90 million.  Already they are imposing a quite significant levy on milk in order to build up their assets and if this guarantee runs out they will have to increase the levy.  At the moment I think it is .2p per gallon and it could be increased considerably if the guarantee of £90 million is insufficient.  I should like the Minister to ensure that the Department keep under review the adequacy of the limit of £90 million with a view to increasing it if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that, but I think that at the moment the £90 million is <Col N="936" /> adequate.  In fact, there have been no claims under the State guarantee so far and no question of expenditure by the Exchequer has arisen or is likely to arise. We will keep the matter under review and we will also encourage Bord Bainne to build up their assets.</P>

      <P>How do Bord Bainne decide whether they should seek to secure a loan by State guarantee, on the one hand, or, on the other hand, by offsetting it against their own assets?  Is there any type of loan that they tend to rely on?  Do they engage in long-term loans or short-term loans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  The Minister agreed with me that when the board wanted to borrow money from a particular bank they went to the Government and the Government gave them a letter of guarantee which they presented to the bank. I took that to mean the State was undertaking to cover that entire loan.  Now the Minister is saying&mdash;if I read him correctly&mdash;that the guarantee covers a proportion of all their loans and not the entirety of any loan.  Which is it, or have I misunderstood the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that if the maximum borrowing by the board is £90 million, it is covered in total.  If the borrowing is £100 million, £90 million would be covered by the State guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing I lend money to Bord Bainne this year for two years. This year Bord Bainne's total borrowings are £80 million and I lend them £10 million.  In the event of their defaulting immediately I am covered this year.  It is a two-year loan and next year, if Bord Bainne for some reason treble their amount of borrowings up to £240 million, my situation has not changed.  I have still got the letter of guarantee but I discover when I look for my money, that the State guarantee covers only a proportion of the total, or about 40 per <Col N="937" /> cent of the total of my loan.  When I got the guarantee it seemed it was for the full amount but, because of other transactions undertaken by Bord Bainne without my knowledge, suddenly my guarantee covers only a proportion of the amount I am owed by Bord Bainne. It seems unusual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the lending institutions accept the conditions of the guarantee and loans made by them are covered by the guarantee.  The conditions set out how it is to apply to loans or proportions of loans.  I do not know whether I am making myself clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear at all.  I appreciate the Minister's dilemma.  This Bill is the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and not the Minister of State.  I presume that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect all those questions on high finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are here to approve of this Bill.  We should be satisfied that we know what we are agreeing to before we agree to it.  The Minister said the institutions who lend money to Bord Bainne agree to the conditions set to the guarantee.  He has not told us whether those conditions include either a guarantee of the entire amount of the loan, or a fixed proportion of the loan, or a proportion of the loan which could vary depending on the overall level of borrowing by Bord Bainne at a particular time when they go bust, if they go bust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were lending money to Bord Bainne I would not accept a State guarantee which said that if the board go bust tomorrow 50 per cent of the loan will be covered, but if they go bust in ten weeks' time, having borrowed a great deal more money, only 10 per cent of my loan to Bord Bainne will be covered by the State guarantee.  I would want to know what proportion of my loan to Bord Bainne was covered by the State guarantee.  I would not be inclined to accept a condition which said it could vary depending on whether Bord Bainne contracted other loans subsequently, and I <Col N="938" /> would have no control whatever over their contracting them.</P>
    <P>We should know the exact nature of the State guarantee.  Does the mere enacting of this legislation mean that automatically all borrowings by Bord Bainne up to the limit of £90 million are covered straight away, or must each individual loan be covered and, if so, under what conditions is each individual loan covered?  That brings us back to the first point which the Minister apparently was not able to answer.  He was not able to tell us what are the actual conditions imposed. Simply telling us that these people accept the conditions is of no use to us. We want to know what the conditions are.  We are the other side of the equation. We are the people who are giving the guarantee.  We are as much entitled to know what the conditions are as anybody who is lending money to Bord Bainne.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I want clarification on two points.  The Minister said earlier that 40 per cent of the board's borrowings are guaranteed by the Government. Is that correct?  Therefore the 60 per cent in excess of that which they would borrow&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very hard to follow.  The Minister said the board would be encouraged to build up assets. It was conceded that these are mostly levies&mdash;.2p per gallon or whatever it is. Have Bord Bainne any other way of building up assets except by way of levies?  Have they profits, or what proportion of their assets comes from the levies?  Have they profits on sales and so on?  How much of the £13.7 million which the Minister gave as their present assets, or their guaranteed assets, or their registered assets, came from levies and will come from levies in future?  It seemed to be indicated that the House covers 40 per cent of the borrowing. Will the guarantee for 60 per cent of their borrowings have to come from their own assets?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point about 40 per cent of the borrowings being guaranteed by the Goverment does not seem very clear.  My understanding is that up to £90 million will be guaranteed by the Government, irrespective of the percentage of borrowing.  During the peak period of milk production the board may have stockpiled assets amounting to £140 million.  With assets of only £13 million, who will guarantee their extra borrowing?  Deputy Bermingham implies that the Minister stated that the Government will guarantee only 40 per cent of the borrowing and that the board will guarantee the remaining 60 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">

An increased State guarantee of £90 million would represent coverage for close to 40 per cent of the board's estimated peak borrowing requirement for 1980.  That is what I said.</P>

      <P>I gave that information to Deputy Bermingham.  It is made up of share capital of £6.8 million, capital reserve of £2.4 million and revenue reserve of £4.5 million, giving a total of £13.7 million.</P>

      <P>I am not happy with the section. It extends the period up to which the guarantee can be granted to 31 December 1983.  I gather that the existing guarantee would have run out at the end of the year.</P>

      <P>In other words, the board are up against a time limit.  If this Bill has not been passed before Christmas there <Col N="942" /> will be no guarantee after 1 January 1980.  A guarantee period up to December 1983 is better than the period allowed in the previous Bill, which was 18 months from the time of the new guarantee until its expiry.  However, three years is still a short period.  It still means that the board will have to look for another guarantee during 1983. There will be a continuing dependence on a political decision to allow them to continue their loan.  Towards the end of the period in which the guarantee is operative there will be some doubt in regard to contracting new loans.  For instance, during 1983 the board will only be able to offer a State guarantee up to 31 December.  The remaining six months of the loan will not be covered unless a Bill is passed in the Dáil.  The passing of a Bill would depend on the political situation at that time.  There might be a minority Government in office.  A difficulty of that nature could arise which would have nothing to do with milk production but would have everything to do with the balance of power in the House at that time.</P>
      <P>Is this a good way to be carrying on? I question whether we should set such short periods at all for the extent of the guarantee.  Should we not have set the guarantee to expire in 1987 and leave it at that?  As far as I know Bord Bainne are unusual in relation to this short time limit for the extent of the State guarantee. In most companies the State guarantee seems to have a pretty unlimited duration and the only time that legislation comes up in the House is when the amount of the guarantee is being increased. Will the Minister say why this time limit is so brief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The long-term object is to arrive at a situation where there will be no need for a State guarantee for borrowing by the board and the guarantee can be dispensed with.  This could be achieved if the board continue to increase their work allied to the acceptance of their creditworthiness.  The extension of the State guarantee for a period of four years allows a considerable opportunity to make progress <Col N="943" /> in these areas.  There is no need to worry about the possibility of having to come back to the House again because Bord Bainne had to come back to the House in 1976 when the guarantee was increased to £40 million and again in 1977 when the guarantee was extended for a further two years.  The present extension is sufficient and in the meantime every encouragement will be given to the board to build up their assets and dispense with the need for a State guarantee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be recognised that the income of the board of .2p per gallon is a very slow and tedious way to build up assets.  My information is that over a long period they have built up £13.7 million in assets.  I question the continued increase in milk production but I hope it will take place because it is important to our economy.  There is no way in which Bord Bainne can build up, in a short period, the type of assets necessary for this level of borrowing. The question raised by Deputy Bruton is important. Why is it necessary to have an expiry date of 31 December 1983?  Is a date fixed for the expiry of other State guarantees in other State bodies?  Why is there a need for a date?  With the present income of Bord Bainne they could never build up sufficient assets to guarantee borrowings of from £90 million to £140 million, even in the next ten years.  If milk production increases, their income will rise, but if not, their assets will go down.  I cannot accept the Minister's answer in connection with the question of their building up that type of assets because there is no way in which they can do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the board will be encouraged to build up their assets over this four-year period.  How can they build them up? The .2p of a levy would not build them up to any significant extent in the four-year period.  Does the Minister intend to have issues of share capital because the share capital accounts for £6 million? How does the Minister foresee that the <Col N="944" /> board will be encouraged to increase their assets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Bainne is a co-operative and not a State body, so they cannot be compared with other State bodies who have looked for an extension of the State guarantee from time to time. There are many ways in which Bord Bainne can build up their assets.  They can build them up by diversifying into different products, by encouraging expansion of their industries and so on.  Indeed their assets are increasing in value all the time.  It is not for me to say exactly how they can extend their creditworthiness.  The co-operatives have been doing a very good job in this regard and there are many ways open to them which I do not want to suggest here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not satisfactory. The Minister said that they would be encouraged to extend their assets.  If the Minister is to encourage them to do something, surely he must be able to say how he expects them to do it.  I asked if they would be encouraged to increase their share capital, to increase the levy or by diversifying their business.  I do not know much about high finance, but I know that if one is to diversify one would need to borrow further capital and Bord Bainne need to increase their assets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>All the ways mentioned by either Deputy Bermingham or myself will help the co-operative to build up their assets.  This legislation will give them four years, and at that stage it will be time enough to start directing them as to how they might increase their assets. It is not for me to say at this stage how they should increase their assets whether by extension of their share capital, the levy or whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is talking in terms of 12 or 14 years for the £13.5 million.  The Minister must understand that the type of assets needed to guarantee their type of borrowings would need to be very substantial.  I can see no way in that four-year period that they can build up their assets to that degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it was the objective that the need for the State guarantee would be eliminated and that the board would ultimately be able to cover all their loans by their own creditworthiness and assets.  Is it fixed Government policy that Bord Bainne's guarantee situation is only temporary? What is the appropriate time the Government expect Bord Bainne to reach the stage where they will no longer require the State guarantee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very hard for me to put a time on that because it will depend on how fast Bord Bainne build up their assets.  The board have increased their assets five-fold in the past six years, from £2.4 million to £13.7 million.  If that trend continues they will be able to meet a sizeable proportion of their borrowing requirements even in four years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but I presume the Government have some idea about the length of time this guarantee will be necessary.  The fact that Bord Bainne are building up their assets is not an accident; presumably it is a matter of deliberate policy by the board arising from a message given to them by the Government to the effect that they <Col N="946" /> should do so in order that a Government guarantee would not be necessary.  If that is so, the Government and Bord Bainne must have some clear target in mind as to the date at which the guarantee will no longer be necessary. Otherwise this would be a sign of very sioppy thinking.  If they did not have a particular date in mind the board would not have any target to work for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unfair to expect that a definite date be settled at this time because there are a number of imponderables. Our target is to work towards a situation where Bord Bainne can dispense with the State guarantee entirely. When we can achieve that is another thing because it depends on so many different things.  That is our target and Bord Bainne realise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not very clear because the rate at which they work towards that object depends on the target date.  If, for instance, the Government set a target of 40 years, it would be necessary for the board to work at half the rate necessary if the target was for 20 years.  The amount of the levy imposed by Bord Bainne on milk producers must be determined by some target set by the Government.  Otherwise they could not settle on a figure.  Assuming everything continues more or less as it is, and assuming that the present levies continue, when would the guarantee no longer be necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impossible for me to put a time on this because the levy on its own is not sufficient.  As I said, over the past six years the board have increased their assets from £2.4 million to £13.7 million.  That trend is in the right direction.  If at the end of a four-year period it is found that the board are still not in a position to borrow on the strength of their own assets, I am sure whatever government are in power will be prepared to give them a further extension because we all know the very important contribution the co-ops are making to the nation.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. I proposes a new section to replace section 1.  There is a minor printing error in the amendment as printed on the green sheet.  In line 5 there should be a comma in front of the second word &ldquo;he&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 4, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash; (1) The following subsections are hereby substituted for sections 6 (2) and 6 (5) of the Principal Act:</P>
      <P>`(2) Whenever the Minister guarantees a loan under this section he may guarantee in such form and manner and in such money (including money in a currency other than the currency of the State) and on such terms and conditions as the Minister for Finance may sanction, the due repayment by the Society of the principal of the loan or the payment of interest on the loan, or both the repayment of such principal and the payment of such interest.</P>
      <P>(3) Moneys obtained by the Society on foot of a loan guaranteed under this section shall be used solely by the Society for the acquisition, transportation, storage and insurance, in the course of its ordinary, business, of dairy produce.'. </P>
      <P>The following subsection is hereby inserted after subsection (11) of section 6 of the Principal Act:</P>
      <P>`(12) In relation to a guarantee under this section in a currency other than the currency of the State&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) each of the references to principal in subsections (3) and (7) shall be taken as referring to the equivalent in the currency of the State of the actual principal, such equivalent being calculated according to the rate of exchange <Col N="948" /> at the time of the giving of the guarantee;</P>
    <P>(b) the reference to moneys in subsection (9) shall be taken as referring to the cost in the currency of the State of the actual moneys paid.&rdquo;'. </P>
    <P>The amendment I am proposing to sections 6 (2) and 6 (5) of the Principal Act and the addition of a new subsection (12) to that section is solely to make it clear that the State guarantee may cover borrowings in currencies other than that of the State.  It is essential to clarify this point as much as the board's borrowing requirement is met by lending institutions outside Ireland and in currencies other than the Irish pound.</P>
    <P>The need for this amendment only came to light when arrangements for circulation of the Bill had been made.  The provision as outlined in the amendment brings this guarantee into line with other similar State guarantees.  The amendment of subsection 6 (5) of the Principal Act is already in the Bill under section 4. It has been included again in the amendment for ease of reference so that all section 4 would appear in one document. This amendment replaces section 4 of the Bill as initiated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is acceptable. The only point I want to question arises from the fact that the Minister is now authorising borrowings in foreign currencies.  What happens if Bord Bainne borrow up to £85 million, mostly in deutschemarks?  Because of changes in exchange rates, the deutschemark suddenly increases in value.  Instead of having two DM to the £ there is only 1½ DM.  When the money was borrowed it was equivalent to £85 million but it now suddenly becomes equivalent to £120 million.  This means that without any further borrowing the board have borrowed more than the £90 million. How exactly does the upper limit operate in that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise some assurance can be drawn from the fact that the punt and the deutschemark are within the EMS but there is nothing in this section which <Col N="949" /> says that Bord Bainne could not borrow from English banks in £'s sterling.  The British are not in the EMS and their currency is, therefore, liable to a much wider range of fluctuation than currencies like the punt and deutschemark which are in the EMS. There is no guarantee that the EMS will continue forever. This point should be clarified. Does the £90 million limit cover the original amount or is it an amount which is adjustable upwards depending on fluctuations in exchange rates to cover all loans contracted in good faith at the time?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 (12) explains this.  In relation to a guarantee under this section in a currency other than the currency of the State, each of the references to principals in subsections (3) and (7) shall be taken as referring to the equivalent in the currency of the State of the actual principals, such equivalent being calculated according to the rate of exchange at the time of the giving of the guarantee.</P>

We were urging something along the lines of what is now in the amendment which he did not accept at that stage.  I wonder if the terminology is sufficient.

A situation could arise where they had goods in store on which they might wish to carry out processing to make them more marketable as a result of change in market demand.  If they had to borrow money to do this the terms of the amendment would not cover it.  It only covers transportation, storage, insurance or purchase of the goods.

      <P>It is very bad drafting practice to have titles containing brackets.  There should be one title.  This should be the Dairy Produce Bill 1979. There is no other Dairy Produce Bill and if there is another one it could be called the Dairy Produce Bill, 1979 No. 2.  To have (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) 1979 is bad English and a complicated title.  I have looked at legislation in the last century when they <Col N="953" /> were supposed to be far more stilted than we are.  They had simple direct titles of one or two words which conveyed exactly what they were about.  This title conveys nothing of the meaning of the Bill but increases its length in an unnecessary fashion.  This is probably the fault of the parliamentary draftsman's office rather than the Minister's, but I should like to convey to him and to them that Bills should have simple titles that would make for easy reference and not have this type of garbage.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to raise the statutory limits on the power of the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowings by the Industrial Credit Company and on the borrowing powers of the Company.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Credit Company was set up in 1933 to provide industrial credit mainly on a long-term nature.  The relevant legislation imposes a limit on the extent to which the Minister for Finance may incur a contingent liability by guaranteeing the company's borrowing. The present limit is £75 million.  I have recently authorised the Industrial Credit Company Ltd. to negotiate foreign borrowings in EMS currencies so that it can continue to meet the high level of demand by industry for investment funds.  A total package of £50 million is envisaged up to the end of 1980 and this money will be on-lent by the company in Irish pounds at keenest going rates for Irish currency.  No exchange risk will arise for the ultimate borrower; the risk will be borne by the Exchequer in return for regular payments to it by the company. The official external reserves will, of course, benefit from the receipt of foreign funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The precise mechanics of this scheme have yet to be worked out but, as it will be necessary for me to guarantee the repayment of the principal sums being borrowed under this package, we need to revise, upwards, the limit in legislation on the power to guarantee borrowings by the Industrial Credit Company Ltd. As I mentioned above, this guarantee limit at present stands at £75 million and as that limit would in any event shortly be reached in the normal course of events, it is now necessary to increase that limit to accommodate not alone the moneys involved in the package referred to but to take account also of the vastly accelerated rate of business being generated by the company.  I therefore <Col N="955" /> propose to raise the limit enshrined in existing legislation from the present level of £75 million to £400 million and, as will be seen when I refer to the general borrowing of the company, this limit is in line with what I propose to fix as the limit on borrowing by the company for a further period.</P>
    <P>Since the company's establishment there has always been a statutory limit placed on the extent to which it may borrow for the carrying on of its operations, and this limit has been extended from time to time as occasion required by amending legislation.  The existing limit on borrowing is £200 million.  Outstanding borrowings now total £127 million and are rising rapidly, as the company's business is expanding at a rate which was not envisaged last time the limit was increased.  On the basis of firm arrangements already entered into by the company it is probable that the statutory limit will be reached by mid-1980. It is essential, therefore, that the present limit be raised to enable the company to continue its very useful work. The new limit proposed in section 1 of the Bill is £400 million.  An increase of £200 million may be considered to be very large.  ICC business is, however, steadily growing and is at present at a level of over £10 million per annum and it is likely that this growth will continue. Lendings of that amount would involve borrowings by the company of some £60 million.  Hence an increase of the limit on borrowing to £400 million should be sufficient to allow the company to borrow its requirements for a further four to five years before Oireachtas approval has again to be sought.  I do not think that Deputies will regard this period as too long.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the Bill has the effect of making the limits for both overall borrowing by the company and ministerial guarantees the same at £400 million.  While certain aspects of the company's borrowing requirements do not require guarantee&mdash;for example, borrowings from the Exchequer&mdash;the experience now is that the financing of <Col N="956" /> the company's operations is more and more being subject to guarantee. Deposits of the public with the company, reflecting the public's confidence in the ICC, have increased substantially.  The borrowing in EMS currencies referred to earlier will also call for guarantee as do the company's borrowing from such institutions as the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the European Coal and Steel Community.  Guarantees are also being sought by other institutional lenders&mdash;this seems to be common practice nowadays&mdash;and as the Exchequer element in ICC's financing represents a diminishing proportion, it is considered appropriate to have the two levels the same.  Thus, the relationship which existed prior to the 1977 Act between the overall borrowing limit and the power to guarantee is being restored. However, despite the fact that it is intended that the guarantee limit will be the same as the overall borrowing limit, it will remain my policy only to give a guarantee where absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>In the year to December 1979, the company expects to have provided financial facilities totalling £74 million approximately for industry.  In the previous 12 months the company disbursed £42 million.  Most of the capital needed by the ICC is secured from non-Exchequer sources, and it is hoped that this position will continue.  Capital required for the operations of the Shipping Finance Corporation is provided by the Exchequer as it is re-lent at a subsidised rate of interest.</P>
    <P>Over the last ten to 12 years, the ICC has expanded its activities considerably. The company's main activity is the provision of longer-term loans but it also offers a wide and sophisticated range of other facilities to meet the complex demands of industry.  These include share investment in industry, capital underwriting and issuing house services, hire purchase facilities for plant and machinery, equipment leasing and finance for distribution.  In addition to the provision of capital it has also a subsidiary company, Mergers Limited, which specialises in the field of mergers <Col N="957" /> and takeovers by undertaking share evaluations and by advising in negotiations for mergers between firms.  It is also concerned with shipbuilding finance through its other subsidiary company, Shipping Finance Corporation.</P>
    <P>In view of the need for higher industrial investment to promote economic growth and generate much needed jobs, there will be a continuing and increasing demand for the facilities provided by the company.  I am most anxious, therefore, that the company should be in a position to contribute to industry the financial and organisational expertise which it has built up over the years in addition to financial assistance.  The present legislation, when enacted, will enable the company to maintain an appropriate flow of funds to industry.</P>
    <P>For almost 50 years now the ICC has been to the fore in the financing of Irish industry.  Many of the successful industries established over that period started from modest beginnings with the assistance of finance provided or arranged by the company.  Facilities are provided for the establishment of new industries as well as the expansion of existing firms and the company has a tradition of giving special attention to proposals in regard to small projects. The continuing increase in the demand for the company's facilities is proof that its importance has in no way diminished with the emergence of present-day financial institutions in the private sector.  The present legislation will enable the company to continue its important role in the development of the economy and I confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <P>I should say at this stage that I would appreciate if the House would agree to deal with all Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to welcome and support the Bill.  I assure the Minister of State that there will be no delay in its passing through the Dáil this afternoon and I am prepared to give it all Stages today.</P>
      <P>There are a number of aspects of the Bill which I would like to discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> First I want to mention the question of foreign borrowing by the company.  The cost of finance is so high here that our financial, industrial and commercial institutions are being forced to go abroad to get finance for their operations.  That is not healthy in the long term.  I know there are limits to what we can borrow abroad and that, in the context of our balance of payments, the debt that would have to be repaid would not really count in the long run.  Nevertheless it is a fact of life that the interest rates available abroad are much more favourable than at home.</P>
    <P>This leads me to criticise the Government for their attitude to the situation within the European Monetary System. It is fair to say that when we were discussing entry into the EMS it was to put to us that our currency system and our structure of finance within industry would reflect the situation on the Continent rather than that in England.  On that basis we looked forward to a low level of interest rates rather than a high one.</P>
    <P>What has happened in effect is that we are still linked with the money situation of England rather than that in Europe. We suffer when the British bank rate goes up because there is still a definite connection.  That is unfortunate because the state of development of Irish industry and commerce, including agriculture, is such as to require a structure of low interest rates rather than high if we are going to see the necessary development in our industry, commerce and agriculture.</P>
    <P>The present level of interest rates here is a disincentive to investors; it is a disincentive to business people to invest in new projects or the expansion of existing factories and businesses.  The Government are certainly to blame because they have allowed this high interest rate structure to continue.  They have not made the necessary attempt to restructure what I will call our money industry in relation to Europe. We are still looking at the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street and whatever she does we must follow on her coat tail.  That is wrong.  If we are to be an independent nation we have to have our own structure which will relate more <Col N="959" /> to the needs of Ireland than to the needs of Britain.  The present interest rates here are anything up to 20 per cent.  Rates are between 17 and 20 per cent unless it is a special loan.  This is not the type of structure we need and the Government must bear the blame for not making an effort to move away from that structure.</P>
    <P>We have another problem in relation to the expansion of industry and commerce here and that is the reappearance of a relatively high rate of inflation.  It is now going up into two figures at 13, 14 and maybe 15 per cent per annum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is getting away from the terms of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go deeply into it.  I merely want to refer to the environment in which our industry and commerce and, indeed, the Industrial Credit Company itself, must work and I feel a brief reference to the inflation rate is relevant to the working of the ICC. When the last Government went out of office in 1977 the rate of inflation was about 7 per cent having come through a worldwide recession.  That is the type of inflation rate that we possibly can afford. We most certainly cannot afford double that rate, 14 per cent.  In that environment it will be difficult to get entrepreneurs or investment companies to invest in new industries and in the expansion and modernisation of old industries. The ICC must be well aware of this inhibiting environment.</P>
      <P>The amount by which the Bill is increasing the borrowing limit from £200 million to £400 million, that is, by £200 million is exceptionally large.  While I would not wish to see any Minister having to come into this House every six months to seek an increase in the limit it must be quite obvious that the £400 million now being sought will mean that there will not be a discussion on the ICC in this House for at least two years and that is a long time.  I would prefer to see at least a yearly discussion on the workings of the ICC in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note, too, that the guarantee which <Col N="960" /> the Minister can make is also being raised to £400 million.  This is interesting because this was not done in the 1977 Bill and Deputy P. Barry, our spokesman on Finance, on Second Stage of the 1977 Bill queried the reasons for not linking the guarantee limits, so to speak, with the borrowing limits of the corporation. I am glad that they are now <i>pari passu</i> and there should be no problem about the Minister giving the guarantee, although I wonder why the Minister used the phrasing he did use.  I quote him:</P>
    <P>However, despite the fact that it is intended that the guarantee limit will be the same as the overall borrowing limit, it will remain my policy only to give a guarantee where absolutely necessary. </P>
    <P>Why was it necessary to make that kind of statement?  Is there some technical or legal reason or has pressure been brought on the company or the Government to give guarantees constantly in respect of borrowing by the ICC?  It is a peculiar statement for a Minister to make in the House concerning borrowings of the ICC.  I would like the Minister to come back to it in his reply.</P>
    <P>I am glad that certain foreign borrowings by the company are guaranteed as to exchange rate risk.  I would like the Minister to state the policy in respect of present and future foreign borrowings. On page 17 of the ICC Annual Report for 1978 is a note which states:</P>
    <P>(13) There has been a partial drawdown in various currencies of loans equivalent to $40,000,000 from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development repayable by half-yearly instalments from 15th November, 1973, converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on date of receipt. No foreign exchange profits or losses will arise on repayment under the terms of an agreement between the company and the Department of Finance. </P>
    <P>That is understandable.  It is proper that State bank institutions such as the ICC and the ACC should not be open to risk on the foreign exchange market.  There is <Col N="961" /> a proper need for the Government to ensure that the risks are guaranteed against in making the initial deal, or are secured by the Government in making the deal or in the course of the loan.</P>
    <P>The corporation have sought finance from the European Investment Bank and that money is being lent to industry&mdash;successfully I may add&mdash;at the low rate of 9 per cent with ¼ per cent added for administration purposes.  That is sound, and obviously demand for it has been such that there was a need to go back for more.  During the year 1978 there was an initial fixed interest rate loan of £2.5 million from the European Investment Bank and this was lent to manufacturing industry at a fixed rate of 9 per cent.  This was so successful, according to the report, that, quite properly, they went back to the EIB for an additional loan of £5 million and it is anticipated that this money will be used in the coming year.  That is good and sound.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in an agricultural debate in the House about two weeks ago and dealing with the ACC, this raises the question of the future role of the ICC.  Certainly they are dealing as a merchant bank more or less within the manufacturing, commercial and industrial sector, giving long-, medium-and short-term loans, hire purchase and leasing facilities and are involving themselves in share investments and underwriting capital issues.  Those are proper functions for a merchant bank.</P>
    <P>Have the ICC any plans to become a full bank?  I merely raise the question for discussion.  There may be an argument for them becoming a full bank and keeping themselves involved only in the industrial market&mdash;in other words, not involving themselves in personal loans. There may be a good argument in favour of the ICC becoming a full bank with current accounts.  Obviously, they have a very large investment in the industrial and commercial sector and on occasion this investment may be in jeopardy because of the lack of working capital being made available to some of their clients.  With many manufacturing industries, <Col N="962" /> for one reason or another, such as a bad year, seasonal problems or down-turns in the economy, there is a tremendous working capital problem which sometimes is not solved.  Perhaps if the ICC were in a position to run an overdraft for such firms that would be a proper extension of their responsibility to industry which could smooth over problems for some of their clients, especially short-term problems in relation to working capital.</P>
    <P>There would be a resistance on the part of the banks.  However, the ACC preferred to become a commercial bank in full because they would understand the needs of farming better and would be seen to be able to be outside a credit squeeze in so far as they could resolve their productive investment and loans. The same could apply to the ICC.  If they were to become a bank they could be exempt from credit squeeze in relation to industry.  Obviously, the ICC bank would not take over from the larger banks, but there is a limited role which the ICC could play profitably and properly in their banking system, certainly in relation to their own clients.  I make the suggestion more as a discussion suggestion than as a policy statement and perhaps it would be more proper to some other time.</P>
    <P>Two subsidiary companies are involved. One is Shipping Finance Corporation Limited who are involved in loans for the construction of ships.  The other is Mergers Limited who are involved with advice in relation to mergers, takeovers, public issues and so forth. That is fine, but it does not come to the notice of the Dáil that these companies are successful or unsuccessful.  We are not aware of the policy being pursued by the ICC in respect of loans for ship construction which is always a difficult area. We are entitled to more information than we are given at present in relation to the operation of Shipping Finance Corporation Limited.  Obviously, the cost of a ship is very great and we would like to see our shipping industry expanding and improving, but under certain conditions which would be favourable to national <Col N="963" /> rather than foreign or multinational industries.</P>
    <P>However, a debate on that would be interesting.  To say the least, the reference to the companies is passing and there has not been any policy statement from the Minister on behalf of the Irish Shipping Finance Corporation.  The field of mergers is very specialised.  I understand that the company concerned have been very successful, that they give good advice, but I should like more information to be put before the House as to the policy adopted by that company. Obviously, we would hope that the company would not favour the emergence of monopolies nor that they would be a party to encouraging a monopolistic or oligarhic situation.  They have a duty to ensure that the firms they advise are firms that will profit from a merger or whatever is intended, but any such merger should not result in an increase in the monopoly situation.</P>
    <P>Again, I am disappointed at the failure of the Minister to make a comprehensive statement in relation to mergers but there was no such comprehensive statement either in 1977 on the policy adopted by Mergers Limited or by the Shipping Finance Corporation.  I am glad that the Industrial Credit Corporation have broadened their activities and have become involved in helping in the area of investment in the hotel industry.  This is a novel idea, but it is an area that is as much deserving of finance as is any manufacturing industry having regard to employment content and so on.  The fortunes of the hotel industry vary enormously. During the seventies that industry experienced very difficult times, primarily because of the Six County situation but also because of inflation and of difficulties in the international money market.  Hopefully, the investment in hotels will play a full and proper place in the overall policy of the corporation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would merely say to the Minister that the present level of interest rates is forcing people to do <Col N="964" /> business abroad.  In the long term the policy that brings about such a situation is wrong.  It is caused by our not having made the necessary effort to insulate our money market and by our failure to make the necessary policy decisions to ensure a low level of interest rates.  This is a very serious matter and one which will cause the deferring of investment at home and that is a serious matter for a country such as ours which is at the developing stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister for Finance is not here but presumably he has other engagements. In broad terms we welcome the Bill, but it has certain implications which bear consideration and some of which are fundamental.</P>
      <P>One of the key differences between this Bill and any of its predecessors relates not only to the alterations in the limits for borrowing and guarantees but to the fact that, in introducing the Bill, the Minister told us that recently he authorised the ICC to negotiate foreign borrowings in EMS currencies.  Of course, a couple of years ago there was not any such system as the EMS.  We are all aware of the problems that arise when one must borrow from foreign sources in the absence of a common monetary system.  Because of circumstances which are totally outside our control, the value of our currency may fall while the value of the currencies in which funds are borrowed may rise so that we may find ourselves in the same position as the clown in a circus who kicks his hat further away each time he tries to pick it up.  In other words, we may be moving further away from the point at which we can repay massive foreign borrowings instead of being able to keep the situation within control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the chief advantages of the EMS is related precisely to foreign borrowings.  We are part of the EMS and our currency has performed reasonably well within the EMS band.  Therefore, we have the right to hope that the new borrowings that will be made on foot of this legislation will not be subject to the <Col N="965" /> kind of see-saw situation that occurred in the past and which placed a major question mark in terms of foreign borrowing policy.  In that respect, if in no other, the present administration are more fortunate than were the previous Government.  But the fact must be faced also that the UK is not a member of the EMS and that, whereas it could be argued that our membership of the EMS has a positive effect on industrial progress and development in relation to currency and export matters, it remains the position that the UK is a very large trading partner of ours and that extreme fluctuations in the currency of that country can have a substantial effect on our trading performance and may at times offset any advantage we may derive from currency stability within the EMS.</P>
    <P>It was instructive to note from the recent summit and from developments since then that there does not appear any likely prospect of the British £ going into the EMS for some time; but until that happens, whatever our level of borrowings and however stable may be the EMS currencies, we must keep an eye in that direction.</P>
    <P>I note, too, that the Minister commented to the effect that the official external reserves will benefit from the receipts of foreign funds.  I am something of an amateur in the field of external reserves and macro-finance but I find it in my heart to wish that there was a better way of improving our external reserve position than by borrowing foreign funds. The activities of the ICC are expanding. They need to increase their limits but, by and large, the Minister is providing for this in the appropriate way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins suggested that the four or five years that may elapse before another ICC Bill comes before the House is too long and he said he would prefer a period of about one year.  I do not know that it is absolutely necessary to bring the affairs of institutions like this to the floor of the House once every year, but there certainly is a problem which may need to be dealt with in another way in that the activities of non-trading State companies are not subject <Col N="966" /> to the same kind of detailed scrutiny as the trading companies that were recently brought within the ambit of the all-party committee on semi-State bodies.  If that were done I do not think there would be any objection to the four- or five-year gap that we will have before the next ICC amendment Bill comes before us. Even if this were not to be done, I think it is reasonable to allow an adequate period for the ICC to continue their activities without having to come to the House for further authorisations.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody in this House for a moment believes that there is anything even remotely untoward in the way ICC have managed the funds at their disposal.  Quite the opposite is the case.  We would really only be insisting on a rapid and regular review of the activities of ICC if there was even the slightest shred of evidence that there was something fundamentally wrong with the policy of that institution.  I have no such evidence.  They seem to be doing their housekeeping extremely well and I do not think we should put any kind of question mark against them.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in his reply the Minister would clear up one sentence in his speech.  He said: &ldquo;Despite the fact that it is intended that the guarantee limit will be the same as the overall borrowing limit, it will remain my policy only to give a guarantee where absolutely necessary.&rdquo;  Strictly speaking, who decides when the guarantee is necessary and when it is not necessary?  Perhaps the Minister would give us some idea about the proportion of funds that will require to be guaranteed in this way?</P>
    <P>Overall this Bill gives us an opportunity briefly to have a look at the operations of the ICC and their place in the industrial and economic framework of the country.  It certainly points out the fact that there is virtually no such thing as private industry in this country anymore in the 19th century Victorian sense where private industry is thought of as industry which is started on, is run on and is dependent solely on private capital.  Few organisations&mdash;except perhaps the IDA and, at another level, <Col N="967" /> Fóir Teoranta&mdash;are as deeply involved in the financing, capitalisation and ongoing expenditure of our so-called industry as the ICC.  I find it ironic to put it no stronger that the spokesmen for private industry who were quick to demand further privileges for themselves are very slow to make any positive reference to the activities of State financing bodies such as the ICC without which many of them would have gone to the wall years ago.  They are quick enough to look for grants and loans when they think they need them but most of them are like the nine lepers in the bible.  They continue to praise the virtues of private industry as though it still existed in its pristine Victorian form.</P>
    <P>Another point worth making is that the funds now being borrowed&mdash;to a certain extent provided or guaranteed by the State and to a certain extent provided by private depositors&mdash;are being economically recycled and they are being recycled largely into profits.  We have to look at the way in which a State-run institution like the ICC, with State guarantees and to some extent with a contribution from the Exchequer, recycle public finance into private finance.  In this they are aided by the structure of company taxation.  I should like to quote from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 4 December 1979 which showed that in a survey carried out by the Financial Executives Association the tax rate on companies dropped from 45 per cent at the beginning of 1974 to 21.7 per cent in the year ended 31 January 1979.  The effect of tax rates on companies almost halved in five years.  This and the investment policies of organisations like the ICC are a mechanism whereby to some extent either public finance or publicly guaranteed finance is recycled into private profits.</P>
    <P>I could wish that that expertise, knowledge and management ability, not to mention the money, which is directed through the ICC into the private sector could be more profitably directed into a public investment industrial sector and that perhaps the ICC could form the <Col N="968" /> foundation for a State bank of a specialised kind.  The machinery and confidence are there.  The managerial and other talents are in the ICC and in similar organisations but it would need a profound change of political philosophy on the part of the Government to put these abilities and assets into the public sphere rather than into the private sphere.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to labour the point because even if investment is going into the private sector in this way at least it is investment.  Some jobs will be produced but not enough by any means and not as many, I would argue, if the money had gone into public investment.  However, a job is a job and I would be the last person to gainsay that.  So far as it goes and subject to the general critique I have made of the activities and the concept of a company like this and its place in our economic and industrial structure, I welcome the Bill.</P>

Therefore, I am interested in any development in the Industrial Credit Corporation or the Agricultural Credit Corporation or the Trustees Savings Bank, all of which come under the direction of the Minister for Finance.  We should avail of this opportunity to tell the Minister of State&mdash;and perhaps he will keep it in mind and say it to whoever is Minister for Finance in the new Cabinet to be announced next week presumably&mdash;that the public at large are sick and tired of being exposed to the wind of the Irish Banks Standing Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very interested to hear more from the Minister about the guarantees which the State will be providing for foreign borrowings in non-sterling currency and in EMS currencies.  What sort of guarantees will he give?  Will the guarantees be restricted to borrowing by the ICC?  I know the Confederation of Irish Industry have been requesting the Government to guarantee industry against the foreign exchange risk of borrowing in EMS currencies in order to get over the present credit squeeze.  I would be even more interested to hear what proposals, if any, the Minister has to reduce the high level of interest rates.</P>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that the level of interest rates has a very significant bearing on the willingness or otherwise of industry to invest.  While it would be idle to pretend that the present high interest rates are solely the responsibility of this Government, they are at variance with what we were told would prevail after we joined the EMS.  We are now in the EMS and industry is suffering the disadvantage of being separated from sterling and all the extra form filling and difficulties associated with exports to the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, without the promised attendant advantage of lower interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any proposal to increase borrowing for whatever purpose, and especially for industrial purposes, is tied up intrinsically with the high level of interest rates.  I should like the Minister to comment tonight on whether there is any prospect of industry getting lower interest rates as a result of this Bill.  Is there any hope that we may have the EEC or EMS level of interest rates?  We are one of the few countries&mdash;I cannot think of any others offhand&mdash;in the EMS with <Col N="971" /> such high interest rates and such high inflation. We have not got the benefits of the EMS.  In this Bill the Minister has to take exceptional measures to guarantee industry against the foreign exchange risk.  What went wrong with the EMS? Will it come right?  What prospect is there for industry?  When will they get the promised benefits of the EMS to compensate them for their disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> the United Kingdom which is still our major export market?  They are the questions I have to ask.  I support the Bill in general.  I hope the absence of the Minister will not inhibit the Minister of State from answering the questions I have put.</P>

As Deputy Collins was the first speaker I will deal with his questions first.  Borrowing is for productive purposes and hence the balance of payments should benefit in due course from the whole system of investment.  We all understand that investment pays if it is put into productive purposes.  The Deputy mentioned the EMS and borrowing abroad.  We are trying to avoid what the Deputy said.  We did not follow the British bank rates recently.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Needs of Physically Disabled: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy O'Connell on Tuesday, 4 December 1979:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the special needs of the physically disabled in Ireland and the present discrimination practised against them especially in relation to employment, social services, housing and other facilities for their welfare, calls on the Government to take immediate steps to improve the quality of life for disabled persons in Ireland. </P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following: <Col N="973" />&ldquo;recognises the positive measures which the Government is taking to improve services for the physically disabled and is satisfied that it will continue to develop these services to the fullest extent that resources permit.&rdquo;&mdash;(Minister for Health.) </P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already mentioned a number of areas in which additional facilities could be made available for the physically handicapped.  I spoke about adaptations to public buildings.  I want to make the point that those adaptations would not only facilitate the permanently physically disabled but would help those who are mildly handicapped, for instance, those suffering from rheumatism, and people with broken limbs.  The adaptation of public transport and public buildings would also facilitate mothers with children, the elderly, people with sight defects and so on.</P>
      <P>The grant for specially modified cars for the physically disabled was increased from £500 to £1,000.  At the time the grant was £500 it represented a greater proportion of the cost of such a car than does the £1,000 grant today.  While the £1,000 grant is a 100 per cent increase, it is illusory in the present context because it represents a smaller proportion of the purchase price of the car than did £500 at the time the grant was introduced. From that point of view the grant would need to be a more realistic one.  It was generally agreed during the debate that the requirement that it can only be given to a person who has a job, or, as the Minister suggests, to a person who is in a position to get a job, is no great advancement.  The position of those who have to travel to their employment and who do not get a grant is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 25,000 to 30,000 persons in receipt of disability benefit.  I accept that some of them would be suffering greater permanent physical disabilities than others.  Nonetheless, 500 or 600 persons are driving specially modified cars.  What happens in relation to the rest of those people who have some disability to the <Col N="974" /> extent that the Minister is prepared to sanction payment of disability benefit to them?  These people must have difficulty travelling on existing transport facilities. The £150 mobility allowance which was introduced this year is pitiful and ludicrous.  The conditions of that scheme are such that it can only be paid to people who are so immobile that they cannot travel at all.  To call it a mobility allowance is a misnomer because it can only be paid to people who are so physically handicapped that they could not be mobile in any way.</P>
    <P>In relation to the 3 per cent employment target, the Minister said that a study group have been looking into this matter and that he has now received their report.  He should let us hear the details of the report.  How many Government Departments and institutions of State have come close to reaching the 3 per cent target?  How many of them have come close to reaching 1 per cent?  I do not believe that 1 per cent of the employees in the public service or in any semi-State organisation are people who could be regarded as permanently physically disabled.  There is a shame on all of us&mdash;those in charge of Government Departments, public authorities and so on.</P>
    <P>It would be unfair if the debate concluded without extending praise to the voluntary bodies who contribute so much towards improving the lot of people who are permanently physically disabled, some of them without any form of State assistance.  The encouragement through State assistance of voluntary bodies is a great way of developing the traditional Irish values of neighbourliness, of care for the disabled, of care for the aged.  It is important for the proper development of our society that voluntary bodies should receive every possible form of State assistance. The idea that the State should take over the work of the voluntary bodies is anathema to me and to my party.</P>
    <P>A recent French study showed that the loss to the economy at 1976 prices for every disabled person in the community was the equivalent in Irish terms <Col N="975" /> of £150,000, including the loss in earning power.  That has been valued at current Irish prices at a loss of £175,000 per person.  It is clearly in the State's interest to invest in proper education, training and assistance for the physically disabled, if for no other reason than economics.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's suggestion that there may not be need for legislation in this area.  What he says bears out my contention that there is a need for a will, there is a need for decision and a need for somebody with a commitment to push for something to be done.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by offering ten points to the Minister, ten different areas in which a committed Minister could bring about real improvement for the disabled, a real improvement during 1981, the International Year for the Disabled, that would make us feel that we had done something.  The Minister may be in a position to influence matters: (1) To set a time limit on all public bodies after which they would suffer financially through the loss of grants if they did not have proper ramps, proper internal facilities, proper sanitary facilities, wide doors, and light switches at the correct level, so as to assist the disabled to use those public buildings.  To conduct a survey of how many public buildings do not have these facilities at present; (2) To require from the local authorities details of the number of houses which have been converted for the disabled, the number of physically disabled persons on their current waiting lists, and the number of houses at planning stage to meet that requirement; (3) To set a date after which the public transport authorities must have modifications carried out to their buses, trains, planes and so on to ensure that the permanent and temporary physically disabled can easily use their facilities; (4) to require a report from every public body, and to issue that report in public, to the embarrassment if necessary of some or all of us, as to how far the public bodies have met the 3 per cent employment content and, having got that report, to set a date obliging the <Col N="976" /> bodies to meet that requirement or suffer the financial consequences; (5) to specially monitor the grant applications made by permanently physically disabled people living in private dwellings, who find extreme difficulty in having those grants expedited at present; (6) to direct that all future planning of streetscapes and new buildings should have built into them a planning requirement for facilities for the permanently disabled; (7) to direct that ordinary school buildings have facilities which would allow the partially or mildly handicapped to use them instead of special schools and to ensure that the special schools have adequate transport facilities so that we do not have the situation where a five year old must leave home at 7.30 in the morning and return at 5 o'clock; (8) to ensure that those who have to stay in permanent long-term institutions should have a reasonable amount of spending money each week so that they are not left with their physical needs catered for but in financial penury for the rest of their lives; (9) to rationalise travel grants for the disabled in respect of the grant for the disabled custom-built cars and the grant for those who have not got cars but who must travel by public transport to their places of employment; (10) to make the Department of Labour the employment agency.  The Department of Health should not be the employment agency for anybody.  If the Minister is still in position to do that after next week, I would urge him to do it; if the Minister is in a position to influence next week I expect that he should.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's amendment.  As public representatives we will never be satisfied with what is being done for the underprivileged. The situation is not as gloomy as it is portrayed.  There have been a number of improvements over the last number of years and improvements are taking place all the time.  One of the difficulties in this debate is the question of definitions.  Last night we discussed the elderly, people in wheelchairs and all the various categories in between.  In the <Col N="977" /> EEC the definition of physically disabled is: any limitation, physical or acquired, of a person's physical or mental ability which affects his daily work by reducing his social contribution, his vocational employment prospects or his ability to use public services.  That covers the very wide range that we discussed last night and it brings one to the question of assessment.  To provide a full range of services it is first necessary to have a register of handicapped persons.  Then it is necessary to identify the needs of those handicapped persons, particularly in relation to employment.  The Minister stated last night that a survey was being carried out in conjunction with the NRB. Hopefully when this survey is completed we will have a proper register of the people we are hoping to cater for.  The health boards, the directors of community care and the NRB can help in this area of assessment which will involve details of age and disability and the social circumstances of the person.</P>
      <P>In relation to physically handicapped, categories will have to be set up for the various degrees of handicap.  The mentally handicapped are divided into three broad categories, depending on their intelligence quotient.  In relation to physical handicap there is a much wider range of disability from the stroke case where a person may be totally or partially disabled, the person confined to a wheelchair, to the person who has just lost a finger, which may not create any major disability.  Until we have a full register of the numbers and needs of the handicapped persons it will be difficult to find solutions to all the problems.</P>
      <P>The Robins Report suggested that 100,000 persons are affected with long-term disability either mental or physical and that 96 per cent of these people could move around.  Of the 100,000 handicapped persons in society about 400 would be totally disabled and 300 would be in wheelchairs.  The Robins Report also stated that it is estimated that there are 15,000 people who would benefit from training for work.  About 10,000 of these are living in the community and 5,000 are in residential care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> Dr. Kennedy of the Economic and Social Research Institute concluded, on the basis of a cost and benefit analysis, that the State would recover more than they spent on rehabilitation and I am sure we all agree with that.  Apart from the human dignity of working, to which everyone fit to work is entitled, by spending money on rehabilitation the State would be rewarded and the money would in time pay for itself.</P>
    <P>In relation to training the handicapped person, we must assess whether the person is suitable for open work or for work in a community workshop.  If a person works in a community workshop it may be possible that, after a spell there, he would be capable of open employment. Many people could play a role in relation to open employment&mdash;the voluntary organisations, general commerce, the public service and many others.</P>
    <P>The National Rehabilitation Board play a very valuable part.  Their placement service is extremely important and needs to be developed.  There are a number of places where handicapped persons can be trained, but the biggest problem is in placing them.  An experienced placement officer who can get employment for the handicapped is a very valuable person.  This area should be looked at again and training for placement officers should be provided.</P>
    <P>In the public service there is a problem because the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1976, section 17 (c), says that a candidate must be in good health and free from any physical defect or disease which would be likely to interfere with the proper discharge of his duties in that position and possess the physical characteristics, if any, described for the position by the said regulations.  This section might have to be changed, depending on one's interpretation.  The public service must know which jobs they can offer handicapped persons and the number of persons available to fill those posts.  The positions which spring to mind are telephone operator, audio-typist and computer programmer.  There are a number of handicapped people, particularly blind people, working as <Col N="979" /> telephone operators.  Switchboards with flashing lights are unsuitable for them.</P>
    <P>Many countries have blind telephonists, audio-typists and computer programmers.  In this country there are a number of computer programmers who pass very rapidly through the public service. There are many more jobs than personnel available.  Computer programming is a career which would be suitable for a number of handicapped persons and they would be happy in the service because of the security of State employment.</P>
    <P>Before we amend the present Civil Service Act, the public service will have to know the number of handicapped people available for work, the type of work they are capable of doing, and the type of work they can offer to these people.</P>
    <P>Housing, the environment, and public buildings were mentioned last night.  The entrance to the Office of Public Works should be adapted to facilitate the handicapped. There are a number of steps up to the entrance and a lift or a ramp should be installed.  Many of our public buildings are over 200 years old. It is only in the last 30 years that there has been any great development in making the handicapped mobile.  It is important that all new public buildings being built should have facilities for the handicapped.</P>
    <P>The disabled persons grant for housing is now £2,400, an increase from £800 two years ago.  The Department of the Environment give £1,200 and local authorities give £1,200.  In 1978, £622,580 were spent by the Department of the Environment on these grants.  As regards application forms and assessments by the local authorities some counties, like County Monaghan, have a space on the application form for persons who are handicapped.  In this way those who apply for houses are identified and catered for as the need arises.</P>
    <P>So far as housing and public buildings are concerned, it is very important that there be a good approach.  A simple solution at pedestrian crossings&mdash;and this might not cost very much&mdash;would be to <Col N="980" /> build small ramps where people in wheelchairs could cross the street.  We could also supply handrails, platforms, suitable doors for wheelchairs to go through, simple lifts, wide corridors and office furniture, to facilitate the handicapped who may be working in these places.  The National Rehabilitation Board have produced a guide in relation to the city of Dublin.  It shows cinemas, libraries, theatres and churches that have facilities for the handicapped.  It is more economic at the building stage to incorporate any needs for the handicapped than to adapt buildings at a later stage.</P>
    <P>In 1978 AnCO, as pointed out by Deputy Boland, trained 224 people.  This year they will train almost 400 people, which is a good improvement on last year.  It is not as many as we should like to see trained, but the problem is one of placement.  The European Social Fund provided £11 million over the last two years, much of which will benefit the training of the handicapped.  Transport has been mentioned.  This is a problem, because if the handicapped are going to work they are going to need transport to get them there.  There is a problem in relation to boarding buses, trains and so on.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are 1,400 births per year with a significant degree of handicap.  About 400 of these are motor.  They involve the muscle system and cause handicap such as spina bifida, cerebral palsy and genetic abnormality. One thousand of them are sensory. About 350 of them have hearing or visual loss and 650 are mentally handicapped. Prevention is important.  The improvement in ante-natal care and modern medical developments should help in this regard.  The number of public health nurses has been increased from 850 in 1975 to over 1,100.  They can encourage the mother to have the necessary check-ups and so on after her baby is born.  While the improvement in medical care will prevent the numbers born with degrees of handicap, it also means that more people survive now with a significant degree of handicap than formally.  We must cater for this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> Deputy Boland referred to the mobility allowance.  I compliment the Minister on introducing this.  It is a benefit of recent origin.  It may not be as much as everyone or the Minister would like, but it is a start.  It must be monitored to assess its merits.  It is available to those immobile and living in their own homes.  They can use it at the weekend or to go on a holiday.  At present it is not available to those in residential care.  I have no doubt that that will come in time.  There are two schools of thought as to whether it should be paid to the person in residential care or to those in charge of the residential institution. Giving the allowance to the person is the better one, because it is undignified to have no income and it enables them to arrange their own outings and so on. Some suggest that to give it to those in charge of the institution would be better value for money.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to all the voluntary organisations involved in the care of the handicapped, to the health boards for the support they give them and for the work they do themselves, to the Minister and to his Department.  The Minister has a tremenodus awareness of the handicapped and over the past three years has made a significant improvement in their quality of life.</P>

      <P>I support the motion put forward by my colleague, Deputy O'Connell.  This debate will serve a number of important purposes.  It will highlight the plight of the people concerned and the apparent lack of public interest in the matter.  It is unfortunate that it takes place at a time when the media might find more newsworthy items to write about.  A debate such as this deserves the fullest publicity.  There is not sufficient public awareness of the lack of services for the physically handicapped. Because of this, handicapped people are imprisoned by our society. They cannot go where they like or do things they might wish.  This motion is for the purpose of setting up a charter of rights to ensure that in future society will be obliged to see that the needs of the <Col N="982" /> physically handicapped are taken care of.</P>
      <P>There was one typical example of the lack of concern for wheelchair cases which I saw this evening.  As I was coming into the House at 7 p.m.  I noticed that somebody had parked on the ramp provided at Leinster House.  Perhaps that person had parked there all day, but certainly the car was there at 7 p.m.  If there is that lack of concern by somebody connected with this House, what can we expect from the public at large?  I say that by way of highlighting the complete&mdash;I will put it charitably&mdash;absent mindedness of people. After many years this House provided a ramp to facilitate disabled people and wheelchair cases.  Somebody with authority to park in Leinster House thoughtlessly parked on this ramp and prevented them from using it.  That is only typical of the kind of thoughtlessness we have allowed to develop in relation to disabled people. We have examples of it every day.  This Bill is a very good method of bringing home to people the need to think, particularly in relation to the provision of buildings and where they park cars, so that they will be building or parking in a way that will facilitate handicapped persons. There is this history of lack of concern and lack of thought and I hope that one of the results of the Bill would be to remedy this to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the necessity to put disabled people into various categories, but I am primarily referring to the physically disabled who are confined to wheelchairs.  There is no code within the social welfare system to cater specifically for such people.  The same code, the same level of benefit and the same qualifying conditions apply to the person claiming sickness benefit with the common cold as to a person claiming because perhaps of paralysis from the chest down.  They both get the same benefit and are subject to the same qualifying conditions.  The person with the cold will in all cases be better after a few days or a week and go back to work, but the person with the illness that <Col N="983" /> results in permanent confinement to a wheelchair has to live on the same level of benefit.  A completely different code for this category of people is required.  It is grossly unjust and inadequate to apply to them the same rate of benefit as applies to the person out of work because of a cold or flu.  Something must be done regarding the establishment of a separate code for these people.</P>
    <P>You also have the same qualifying conditions for free electricity, free travel and free TV licence.  I have in mind a wheelchair case where the person had to have at home two of his teenage children who were in employment in order to lift him in and out of the chair and in and out of bed.  Because he had two children at home who were over 18 he is disqualified from getting free electricity and a free TV licence.  That is grossly unfair and unjust.  Again, the same code of regulations is applied to the ordinary pensioner who is fully capable and to the incapacitated pensioner.  There is again need for a special, separate code unconnected with and divorced from the code that operates generally in the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>These people are not asking for charity but for their rights.  This Bill seeks to establish their rights in legal form, not a system of charity but a system of rights.  With their disablement they are at a disadvantage compared with ordinary men or women and we must try to balance the scales.  One need only look at the decisions in the civil courts when somebody has an accident resulting in physical disablement and see what juries award in such cases.  I am not making the case that a similar type of situation should arise where a person is physically handicapped from birth or through illness, but I think the example helps to highlight the financial disadvantage some people suffer.  It highlights the complete inadequacy of the present system of payments such people get.</P>
    <P>I do not think that our health boards have the necessary staff to give the kind of devotion and attention necessary to the physically handicapped.  They do <Col N="984" /> their best, but that is not good enough in cases like this.  There should be a specialised section within the health boards to cater specifically for the disabled. That could be included in Deputy Dr. O'Connell's Bill.  In our health board system the handicapped come within what is known as the community care programme, a vast programme ranging over a multiplicity of services.  It is very difficult to get somebody directly responsible within that system.  In the final analysis the CEO or the programme manager may hold the responsibility, but there appears to be no special unit for this purpose within the health boards. This is something that should be considered immediately.</P>
    <P>These problems and the extent of them are not generally known because disabled people find it so difficult to get out and the public, when they do not see a problem or see it very rarely, do not regard it as a major problem.  However, there is absolutely no room for any complacency in regard to it.</P>
    <P>In relation to employment and training it is very disappointing to note that only something between 1 per cent and 2 per cent of all people training with AnCO are physically disabled people. That is not good enough.  As regards education generally, there is need for additional grants.  Take higher education grants.  As far as I know, the same rules and regulations and the same means test apply to the physically disabled person as apply to the normal person.  This should not be.  There should be special conditions and a special rate of higher education grant for disabled people. Similarly in relation to AnCO training and other training there should be higher allowances than they are getting at present.</P>
    <P>One of the things that a bill of rights would do is to make it compulsory for public, private and semi-public employers to employ a number of disabled people.  With the kind of automation that has developed in recent years there are now many jobs that could be very efficiently carried out by people in wheelchairs if they were given the opportunity <Col N="985" /> and training to do so.  Unfortunately, this has not been done.  Many positions that could be filled by physically handicapped people are not being filled by these people.  Perhaps it is due to a lack of thought, because basically the Irish people are willing to give a helping hand when they see it is needed.  Perhaps they do not see the need.  They may never have heard of a discussion here in the Dáil about this problem.  I hope that as a result of this discussion there will be a better approach and more enlightenment, particularly in regard to education and employment.</P>
    <P>Similarly in the provision of housing, whereas there are a number of schemes and special grants, there appears to be some lack of cohesion in the system of housing for the physically handicapped. If one were to ask all the local authorities if they have plans and specifications for houses for wheelchair cases, I doubt if more than a handful of local authorities would be able to reply in the affirmative. I doubt very much that even the Department of the Environment could produce a plan and specification for such a house.  I know people who have tried to obtain one and were it not for the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Rehabilitation Centre in Dún Laoghaire, people would have been waiting quite a long time to get a proper plan and specification for a house for a handicapped person.  For those who wish to provide private houses there should be further increased special grants and there should also be special loan facilities at reduced rates for house purchase for those people.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provision of transport, loan facilities at reduced rates should be provided for those who can use an adapted motor vehicle, because unfortunately many physically handicapped people are not in a position to avail of a motor vehicle and to have it adapted simply because they have not got the capital cost required.  In such cases there should be a scheme of loans available at a subsidised rate similar to the loan schemes available in certain cases for house purchase.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> I agree fully with the points made by previous speakers about the necessity for our planners to provide that all planning permissions should take full account of the needs of physically disabled people.  I would suggest that the system of grants for adapting houses should be enlarged to include the houses of parents or near relatives of disabled persons.  Generally speaking, nowadays the design of houses, with houses and rooms getting smaller and smaller, does not take account of the needs of the physically disabled person.</P>
    <P>In relation to the mobility allowance, it is a start.  But when the Minister went about it at all he could have gone about it in a much more generous way.  It seems from the applications already made and the apparently long delay in processing them that the administrative costs <i>per capita</i> of running this scheme are going to be high.  The Minister should have a look at least at the rates in this case and the other limiting conditions which are making it very difficult for people to qualify.  I do not understand the reason for not applying it to people who have attained pension age.  I do not know what pension age has to do with the application of the scheme.  It is beyond my powers of comprehension to know why one does not qualify if one is 66 or over and loses it on attaining the age of 66.  I would like the Minister to have a look at that.</P>
    <P>I agree with and support fully and will continue to shout about the necessity to provide facilities in all public places to enable the physically disabled to go where they wish to go and to help them to lead as normal a life as possible.  I have confined my remarks to the physically disabled who are confined to wheelchairs.  There are other categories such as the blind, deaf and dumb.  Many things could be done for these handicapped people which are not being done at the moment.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to praise the voluntary associations such as the Wheelchair Association and their branches throughout the country.  I had <Col N="987" /> occasion to be involved in a small way with some of these branches and members of these associations are to be admired and praised for the time and trouble they give to the disabled.  If they were not there I would hate to think what the plight of the physically handicapped would be.  In addition to the Wheelchair Association and their various branches throughout the country the National Rehabilitation Centre are also doing a magnificent job but they do not get the kind of support they should get from employers generally.  I do not want to make a blanket accusation in this.  Some employers have taken disabled people into their employment and have been extremely good to them in relation to wages and working conditions, but others have not done so, and other employers again have not given the kind of co-operation they should give to the National Rehabilitation Centre who have the responsibility of trying to place disabled people in employment.</P>
    <P>At the moment the physically disabled are almost totally dependent on goodwill and, whereas there is some goodwill around, the time has come where that alone is not enough.  We will have to have something like the bill of rights proposed by Deputy O'Connell, and I urge the Minister to accept that Bill.  If he finds that he cannot accept it I ask him to do something very soon, because we have talked enough about this matter and now we want action.  The Minister will have the full support of the public at large in anything that he would do to improve the lot of the physically handicapped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate both yesterday evening and now this evening has been very useful.  It is unfortunate that it should be taking place this week when other things are happening in this House to attract the attention of the press and, therefore, what is said between 7 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. this evening may not find many words in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion refers to one area where <Col N="988" /> we as a nation are very likely to slip and that is in regard to providing for the physically handicapped.  The Minister for Health and Social Welfare will, I am sure, for very many years be spoken of where health is concerned, because as Minister for Health he has made his mark and has attained a tremendous press.  I congratulate him on that. Anything he has endeavoured to do for the health of the nation probably on all occasions has got to the front page of newspapers.  Here tonight we have something which probably straddles both his portfolios of health and social welfare.  I am referring to the care of the physically disabled and handicapped.  I have no doubt that the Minister, before he moves on from his present office, is anxious to do something for them. Deputy O'Hanlon spoke of the Minister's awareness of the need to do something in this area.  That is not going to be of much use to those who are handicapped if the Minister moves on and in the future it is written that Minister Haughey was very much aware of their plight, unless he does do something before he moves on to ensure that, even if he is not there to carry out, at least it will be on the desk of his successor.  I hope the Minister will give priority to this matter in the next few days, or maybe hours, to ensure that at least a future Minister will be aware that not only was the Minister aware of the plight of the physically handicapped but he was also prepared to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I want to be associated with the praise expressed for the voluntary organisations who have done so much in this field.  I will go further and say that the general public have been very sympathetic to the physically handicapped, but the time has come, if not passed, when we in this House should give a lead to ensure that the sympathy of the general public is not just taken for granted. In past elections in the forties, fifties, sixties and even into the seventies a certain part of the election programmes concerned the care of those who were not able to look after themselves, but I am sorry that in recent years this seems <Col N="989" /> to have slipped a little and election promises now seem to be directed more to people who are quite capable of looking after themselves.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that in the anxiety of politicians to gain office the people least able to look after themselves may be forgotten.  Having regard to what has happened in the recent past the trend is in that direction.  Local authorities can do a lot to improve the position of the handicapped but they must be given every encouragement.  Usually when they bring in schemes to assist the handicapped it is because of a circular from the Department of the Environment, but it is up to the Minister for Health and Social Welfare to start the operation.</P>
    <P>The ball is in the Minister's court.  I am glad that Deputy O'Connell has brought forward this matter.  It is unfortunate that it should be discussed this week, but it was not possible to judge other events.  I would encourage the Minister at least to give consideration to the ten points put forward by Deputy Boland.  They covered a considerable amount of ground.  Even if the Minister cannot see his way to implementing the ten points, perhaps he can go most of the way.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider giving priority to assisting those people who can be cared for at home rather than those who must be cared for in institutions. Having listened to the debate he might be tempted to give priority to assisting the handicapped who visit public buildings.  I have no doubt that the vast majority of the physically handicapped wish to be cared for in their homes and I appeal to the Minister to give priority to that matter.</P>
    <P>The mobility allowance was a step in the right direction, but I agree with other speakers who said the Minister could have been more generous.  He could show his awareness of their need by increasing immediately the mobility allowance and extending it to other categories.  It will not cost much money, and not only will he get the thanks of the physically handicapped but he will also be thanked by the vast majority of the Irish people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a very constructive debate.  It has achieved a lot in highlighting the needs of the physically handicapped, the lack of facilities provided for them and the difficulties they encounter with regard to access and so on.  I hope the Minister's colleagues will show the same concern that he has shown.  I must pay tribute to him for sitting in on this debate.  It shows his concern for the disabled, but I am sorry his colleagues have not chosen to do likewise.</P>
      <P>The health and social aspect is only one aspect of the area of concern for the disabled.  As I said last night, access to the environment is very important and is one sphere in which the disabled are discriminated against.  I hope the Minister for the Environment will give consideration to this matter.  Not only should he encourage local authorities to take action but he should direct them to do so by way of legislative measures.</P>
      <P>I hope the housing requirements of the disabled receive the priority they deserve.  This matter should be a special function of housing authorities and there should be a special housing programme for the disabled.  I hope this will be given due attention by the Minister for the Environment in the near future.  Disabled people who are contemplating buying houses shall be given special grants or subsidies so that the houses may be built to their requirements from the design stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go over the health and social welfare aspects, but I make a special appeal to the Minister with regard to the maintenance allowance for disabled people.  Those who are destitute, who are dependent on institutions in which they remain for the rest of their lives, should be given this allowance as of right.  This will enable them to keep their sense of dignity and they will not have to plead for money which should be given to them as of right.  I hope the Minister will make a declaration of intent to this effect, that he will say that all persons who have no means will be granted this allowance as of right.  If he did this it would be the greatest step he could take <Col N="991" /> in public life.  I have seen so many of these people depending on relatives and on charity and I appeal to the Minister to take this major step.  It is very important.</P>
    <P>The report of the Irish Wheelchair Association stated that the handicapped were being deprived of their right to employment. I refer to the report by Pauline Faulknan which stated they were not receiving their rights as citizens in our society.  The Government should make a determined effort to ensure that the 3 per cent quota is not only filled but is exceeded. They should set the example for private employers by filling that quota.</P>
    <P>The report of the National Rehabilitation Board as presented to the inter-departmental committee should be published in order to see to what extent the Government have succeeded in fulfilling their obligations in this respect. I realise that it is the Minister for Labour who is responsible for this, but I hope the Minister present will see to it that he makes this report available for publication.</P>
    <P>I should hope that the Government would make a declaration of intent on this matter and that not only would they set the example but that they would encourage private employers to employ disabled people, because in many cases these people are capable of taking up full employment.  The incentive from the Department could be by way of tax incentives, concessions and grants.  There is no reason for the Government not being able to say to private employers that, for instance, if they engaged a disabled person they would be relieved of the social welfare obligation in respect of that person because the Government are prepared to meet the contribution in that regard.  That would be a very good inducement to a private employer to engage some of these people.  In the absence of any such policy on the part of the Government we are left with the situation of disabled persons pleading with employers to give them work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> The physically disabled are discriminated against, too, in relation to education <i>vis-à-vis</i> access to schools and also in terms of the apartheid that exists by reason of special schools for these people.  That is a very bad arrangement, and we must take steps to ensure that this apartheid is brought to an end.  The physically disabled must be allowed, encouraged and permitted to be educated in normal school circumstances.  This is a matter on which I feel very strongly, and I urge the Minister, who seems to have assumed responsibility for these people and who is about the only one who has shown concern for them, to plead with his colleagues to ensure that what I am asking is implemented.</P>
    <P>As I said last evening, the booklet entitled <i>Aids For The Disabled</i> was not available to disabled persons.  Indeed, in many cases they were not aware of its existence.  Incidentally, when my office telephoned the Department of the Environment in this regard, they were not aware either of the existence of the booklet.  I am glad to hear the Minister for Health say that he will ensure the book is elaborated on in order that the necessary information is available to the disabled.  Apart from this booklet, the Department of Health should conduct an information campaign through the media in order to make the disabled aware of their rights.  This would be a great step forward.  Hopefully, the Minister's intent will be implemented by his Department who could do an enormous amount of work on this matter.</P>
    <P>The other question which I considered in much depth last night was the matter of the sheltered workshops.  The Central Remedial Clinic adverted to this question and recommended that it was one area which should be considered very seriously.  The need is for 3,000 places, but the Minister has told us that the number of places available is 1,450.  That leaves a shortfall of almost 1,600 places. In these circumstances this area should be expanded in order to provide for the disabled the right to work.  The Government should ensure, too, that disabled persons are paid proper wages for work <Col N="993" /> done.  Remuneration of between £5 and £12 per week is both insulting to them and discriminating against them.  We must let them know that they enjoy the same privileges, rights and obligations in society as apply to anybody else.</P>
    <P>Last evening the Minister referred to the mobility allowance and expressed the hope that the health boards would be flexible in this regard.  As I have said, this is a Catch-22 situation: no job, no car; no car, no job.  I was delighted to hear the Minister refer to this matter, but I am afraid that too often the health boards are rigid in their approach to this question.  Perhaps the Minister would send a circular to the health boards in regard to flexibility in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take that as done.  Last evening I referred to the question of a Disabled Persons Bill.  This whole area of the disabled is one that concerns all of us.  It is not a party political matter.  It would be my hope that the Minister would succeed to higher office because the time he has served in the Department of Health and Social Welfare must have helped him enormously in the creation of a social conscience.  What he has done in that ministry has been of benefit to the entire country, but should he succeed to higher office I should hope that in formulating policy he would ensure that the social aspect of our economy is given as much priority as is the case in respect of the economic aspect.  Hopefully, he would consider the question of a Disabled Persons Bill, not because we want to see the rights of these people enshrined in legislation but because we are inclined too often to consider as charity anything we do for the disabled.  It would be helpful to the disabled if we were to let them know that we will ensure that their rights are on the Statute Book.  I accept that many pieces of legislation are put on the Statute Book but never put into practice, but in regard to the disabled we should be able to assure them that not only will we legislate for their rights but <Col N="994" /> that we will ensure they get their rights. If such legislation were enacted disabled persons would be in a position to say whether the law was being obeyed in any instance.  Such a situation would be very useful in terms, too, of their morale.  We must get rid of the notion of charity where these people are concerned.  Let us remember that any of us here could become disabled.  The Minister was disabled at one stage as a result of a car crash.  He might have been disabled permanently. If such a fate should befall any of us we would hate to find ourselves in the position of being dependent on the charity of relatives and friends. That is why we must ensure that the rights of the disabled are enshrined in legislation.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would reconsider what he said last night in that regard.  I am glad that my proposal about a register of the disabled is being considered seriously.  If we are to tackle the problem in all its aspects we must at the outset establish such a register, a register which would contain not only information regarding the number of disabled but the extent of their disability and how best we might cope with the situation.</P>
      <P>One other aspect of this area to which I would direct the Minister's attention relates to the question of medical cards, as of right, for the physically disabled. This would establish their independence and might allow us to expand the day centres so that those who need care might not have to finish up in institutions.</P>
      <P>The year 1981 will be the International Year of the Disabled.  I hope we will make progress now so that in 1981 we can look back on our achievements rather than looking forward to promises. If the Minister can see to it that this is done, we can be proud as legislators that we have done something for the disabled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputies for their constructive contributions to this Bill, and for their general  welcome of its basic purpose, which is to provide the necessary finance for Irish industrialists for investment for productive purposes.  I cannot emphasise enough the productive nature of the investments to be financed by this borrowing.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with some points made by Deputy E. Collins.  He said that the balance of payments would be affected by all the borrowing.  Since the borrowing is for productive purposes the reverse will be the case.  The borrowing will be adequately serviced and repaid in due course out of the proceeds of this productive enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>He also mentioned several matters arising out of our entry into the EMS.  He made the point that we are tied to British markets.  However, in negotiating this borrowing we want to go beyond the London markets and avail of the benefits which will accrue in time from the operation of the EMS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> Deputies will appreciate that it takes time to bring these welcome developments about.  The Deputy also mentioned the provision of guarantees and referred to the reference in my speech. Nowadays more and more guarantees are being sought.  However, as guarantees represent a liability contingent for the Exchequer we are slow to respond automatically to guarantee demands. However, if it is shown to my satisfaction that there is no alternative but to avail of loans which require guarantees then naturally we do not raise objections. I would stress again that the borrowing which is the subject of this Bill is for productive purposes.  The Deputy also raised the question of future policy regarding the exchange risk, and suggested that the foreign exchange risks should be assumed by the Exchequer in future similar cases.  It would not be proper for me to discuss this matter at this stage.  Future policy would have to depend on our assessment of prevailing conditions at the time.</P>
    <P>In relation to hotels finance, which was also raised by the Deputy, the Deputy will be glad to hear that the Industrial Credit Corporation have been active in this area and loans of approximately £6 million have been approved by the Industrial Credit Corporation in their financial year ending 31 October 1979.  Since November 1978 further EIB loans of £5 million and £10 million have been negotiated by the Industrial Credit Corporation for the benefit of investment in small industries.  I am sure the Deputy will welcome this.</P>
    <P>I take note of the suggestion regarding the Shipping Finance Corporation Limited and Mergers Limited about the need to keep the House fully informed. These companies are wholly-owned subsidiaries of ICC and as such are subject to the overall regulations of that company. In relation to the control of monopolies this is a function of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and he is quite active in that field.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Horgan for his constructive <Col N="1000" /> contribution.  In regard to his point that ICC money and other public money is being recycled into profits, I would like to inform him we must not forget, as he acknowledges that this money creates jobs and leads to more investment.</P>
    <P>On the question of the length of interval at which ICC matters are discussed in the House I would inform Deputy Horgan that the ICC will appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies early in the new year.  I am sure we will have an opportunity to bring some of the Deputy's points to their attention.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to consider the provision of much needed credit for industry by the ICC.  I assure the Deputy that the functions of the ICC are continuously under review in my Department, and we will take any decision consistent with policy to develop industry and to ensure that all aspects of industry are adequately financed.  As Deputies know, the ICC is one of the most successful bodies here and they are to be commended on their activities.  Our congratulations on the wonderful work and dedication of the management and staff of that body should go out from this House.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister tell the reasons for this section, and more specifically, what type of changes will be <Col N="1001" /> made to alter the memorandum and articles of association of the company?  This Bill primarily relates to the borrowing powers of the company.  Generally, in relation to a company this is a matter of a resolution being passed at a board meeting rather than a change necessary to be effected in the memorandum and articles of association.  Does this section arise because of the dealings on the foreign money market now being entered into by the Industrial Credit Corporation? I would like some clarification of the reason for this section.</P>

      <P>Would there be a need to examine the contents of the memorandum and articles of association of the company, because of the fact that the Minister or the Government will not guarantee all the foreign borrowings?  In that situation the Industrial Credit Corporation is in effect taking a risk on the money markets abroad.  This new type of business being entered into by the corporation may be <i>ultra vires</i> the memorandum and articles of association. It is a new aspect of their activities, and can the Minister confirm that such borrowings and such exchange risks which may be assumed by the corporation are not in fact <i>ultra vires</i> the memorandum and articles of association?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, as do my party.  The Bill is due credit to the excellent work being done by the Industrial Credit Corporation in the commercial, business and industrial life of the country.</P>
      <P>In my Second Stage contribution I referred to my wish to be able to discuss the policies of the Industrial Credit Corporation in this House on a yearly basis rather than on a four-yearly basis. Deputy Horgan would agree with that policy.  I have nothing only admiration for the efficiency of the Industrial Credit Corporation, and there is no question of casting any doubts on their good standing.  I mentioned the fact that I would like to have a debate in the House on a fairly regular basis on the affairs and policies of the Industrial Credit Corporation for a number of reasons.  The primary reason is that the corporation seem to be getting very active on the foreign money market to find future funds.  They will then be open to exchange rate losses.  We should be in a position to comment on their performance in the foreign money market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the two subsidiary companies&mdash;Mergers Limited and Shipping Finance Corporation Limited&mdash;there is a need to discuss them on an on-going basis.  They are dealing in a technically difficult field where the question of monopolies may come under consideration&mdash;this would affect Mergers <Col N="1003" /> Limited&mdash;and the policy in relation to subsidisation of shipbuilding&mdash;this would affect Shipping Finance Corporation Limited.  This is another area I would like to see under review.  For those reasons I would prefer a debate every second year in the House rather than allowing a situation where we would not be able to discuss a policy adopted by the ICC for five years.</P>
    <P>I wish the corporation every success in their future involvement in commerce and in industry.  They did very good work down the years.  They met the challenge of modern industry and technological change.  They have done a wonderful job.  There may be a need for them to be a full bank but perhaps we may have a discussion on this on another occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), to insert, between lines 18 and 19, the following new definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `trade union' has the same meaning as in the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1975;&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The main amendment in this group is No. 3, that which substitutes almost entirely a new subsection (1) of section 3 for the one in the Bill as drafted at present. It will be seen that the remaining amendments are consequential on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> As the proposed new section 3 (1) contains reference to a &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; and to &ldquo;collective bargaining negotiations&rdquo;, these terms will now be defined in sections 1 (1) and 3 (5) respectively.  The definitions are the same as those in the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977.  Drafting amendments&mdash;to take account, in the main, of the additional provision about an employer-trade union agreement in the new section 3 (1)&mdash;are necessary to sections 3 (2), 4, 7 and 8.  As the purpose behind these drafting amendments should be abundantly clear, I do not feel it necessary to deal with them further.  I should, however, like to go into some detail on the background to, and the purpose of, the main amendment in this group.</P>
    <P>The formula for the proposed new subsection (1) of section 3 was worked out in discussions with representatives of the Federated Union of Employers and of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions after completion of Second Stage of the Bill in this House last March.</P>
    <P>The outcome of those discussions is that subsection (1) will now contain two options for employers and employees concerned: the document or the agreement.</P>
    <P>The provision about the document was already in the Bill when it was circulated to Deputies.  Two additions will now be made to this provision.  First, if the document is to be signed by some other person on behalf of the employee, that person must have been authorised in writing by the employee to so act on his behalf.  Secondly, in addition to the employee's being entitled to terminate unilaterally the use of the non-cash method of payment specified in the document, it will be possible for the authorised person to effect such termination instead, on the employee's behalf.  In case the person authorised originally by the employee to act on his behalf might no longer be available, for whatever reason, death or otherwise, at the time when the employee wished him to use the procedure for unilateral termination, provision is being made to entitle the employee to nominate, in writing, some other person for that purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> In addition to the existing provision about the document, which has been revised in the way I have just outlined, a second option will be added&mdash;that of the employer-trade union agreement, whether made before or after the passing of this legislation.  In simple terms, the essence of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 3 is to permit the employer, or a group of employers of which the employer is a member, and any trade union or other body of persons recognised by the employer for the purpose of collective bargaining negotiations, of which the employer is a member, to have an agreement in writing about paying the wages of the employees involved by any non-cash method referred to in section 3.</P>
    <P>Termination of the use of the specified non-cash method will be effected under and in accordance with the agreement, that is to say, either following a review of the position, if the agreement provides for a periodic review, or by one party giving notice to that effect in writing to the other party concerned, such notice being that which was specified in the agreement and being a period of not less than four weeks.</P>
    <P>I might mention, for further clarification, that this second option will apply to a trade union or to a staff association, recognised for collective bargaining purposes. It would cover a contract of employment, if the terms of that contract relating to the method of payment of wages has been negotiated with the trade unions involved.  Hence the need for the amendment to section 8 (2) and (3) of the Bill.  Finally, it would bind prospective employees who were members of the trade union&mdash;or who became members of the trade union on joining the firm in question&mdash;which was party to an agreement of this kind with the employer.</P>
    <P>That explains clearly the purpose of the main amendment in this group, No. 3.  The others are consequential.  That is the essential change which gives the option of the document or the agreement.  I repeat, discussions were held with representatives of both sides of industry after the Second Stage of this Bill had been completed last March and this formula was the result of those discussions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are taking 11 amendments together, one or two of them are very substantial and go to the kernel of this Bill.  I described this Bill as a bank robber's charter.  Even if we accept the Minister's amendments, which undoubtedly are an improvement on his first proposals, it still remains a bank robber's charter.  It facilitates the payment of wages by cash.  I do not believe that would be necessary if my amendment were accepted.  They provide for a cashing service within reasonable proximity to the place of employment.  This would cover a situation such as we had in recent weeks when there was a bank strike.  If such a cashing service was reasonably adjacent to the employment, and particularly in view of the prevailing security situation, there is no reason why we should pussyfoot about or tolerate payment of wages by cash.  There are people who will opt for payment by cash so that payrolls can be robbed.  It is big business in this country to rob payrolls. The Minister in his half-hearted proposal is facilitating the continuance of such robberies.</P>
      <P>It is only common sense that we should do everything to minimise the handling and transit of cash.  That is the intention of the amendments I put down. There is nobody more interested or more in support of the rights of workers than I am.  It is not right for any workers to expect to be paid by cash when that right jeopardises his own life and that of his colleagues.  There is no room for pussyfooting, messing or for &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo;.  We should do everything in our power to stop the payment of wages by cash where there is a reasonably adjacent cashing bank or cashing service. My amendments would enable the Minister to prescribe by regulation what &ldquo;reasonably adjacent&rdquo; is and so on. Neither in his Second Stage speech or in what he has said tonight has the Minister said anything about the problem of paying by cheque.  What are the problems of paying workers by cheque?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister came in with a Second Stage speech and we are to speak to 11 amendments.  My amendments are designed to stop murder, personal injury and payroll robberies. Nothing the Minister has provided in the Bill or in his amendments suggests that he is determined to do everything he can, within reason, to stop murder, to protect the lives of workers, especially those involved in handling cash, in the transit of it in its distribution.  If the omissions in the Bill are the cause of one death, it is one too many.  I do not want to be a prophet of gloom or doom but the omissions are too much to be tolerated, especially in the prevailing security and crime situation in bank and payroll robberies. How many deaths and personal injuries have there been in the past two years?  It is not good enough.</P>
      <P>We will be vigorously opposing the Bill, as we did on Second Stage, and will continue to oppose most of the amendments the Minister put down.  I should like the Minister&mdash;he will have an opportunity during this debate&mdash;to explain his lack of conviction and determination to protect life.  Is it too much to ask workers to accept payment by cheque to protect themselves and their colleagues if the Bill provides for a reasonable banking service adjacent to the employment? I cannot understand the Minister's lack of determination or his lack of concern for the lives of workers and their families.  Perhaps he will say why his determination to protect life, with money as a secondary consideration, is not expressed in the Bill or in the amendments.</P>
      <P>When employees join a company where there is a written agreement between employers and employees in existence, we are giving them the right to opt out of that agreement.  We are going backwards instead of forwards.  They will have that right.  The major amendment the Minister put down is amendment No. 3.  It is some improvement on the situation which he says has arisen from discussions he had with FUE and I think with Congress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go through the amendments one by one.  Amendment No. 1 is a drafting amendment and I have no objection to it.  I am not sure what the connection with amendment No. 3 is.  It is a major amendment.  It gives the right, where there is no agreement between an employer and a trade union but where the practice has built up of paying by cheque or standing order, to the worker to opt out of that agreement, although the Truck Acts say that workers are entitled to be paid in the coinage of the realm.  This is now reinforcing, although it is not specifically stated as far as I know, the idea that a worker may opt out of an agreement that he has already made.  It does not say that in the Truck Acts.</P>

    <P>The practice has grown up and is now very widespread that such agreements have been made all over the country. Despite those agreements a person may now opt out and insist on being paid in cash.  What are the implications of giving, <Col N="1009" /> asserting or establishing or underlining that right?  First, every militant or maverick in society, indeed every criminal and everybody who supports subversive organisations engaging in these robberies will now have a vested interest in insisting on his rights.  It will mean more cash in transit and being handled and more opportunities for robbing. It is not confined only to subversives or their supporters but it also suits mavericks within organisations, trouble makers.  Why should we be giving or underlining that right?</P>
    <P>The second part of the amendment, which I admit is a slight improvement, provides that where there is an employer-trade union agreement, the union may, with four weeks' notice, withdraw from that agreement even though the same people may already have been paid an increment of some sort in order to accept payment by cheque. They may have received an increase in basic pay to accept non cash payments. With that as an established part of their wages or salaries, they can withdraw from the agreement by giving four weeks' notice.  You might say that no reasonable trade union would do that. Probably that is true and I do not mind the unions having that right, but the point is that our Constitution gives people the right to be members of trade unions or not.  They may opt in and out at will.  For the purposes of this Bill they can opt out of the trade union when they like and insist on their rights as established by this Bill.  No matter what trouble the employer has gone to to establish a non-cash mode of payment for the entire staff, now, because one, two or more of the staff decide they want to be paid in cash, he may have to run two parallel systems or his non-cash system may be subverted altogether.  He may have to have a complete cash system as it might not be economical to run two modes of payment in parallel.</P>
    <P>What concerned person or Member of the House, what person concerned about life or limb or money&mdash;money is a very poor third in this context&mdash;can see any merit in this?  I cannot.  That is why we <Col N="1010" /> call this a bank robbers' charter and why we are so much opposed to it.  We believe it would have been better to have a very simple Bill such as I think the FUE wanted, merely amending that part of the Truck Acts which provided that workers had the right to be paid in the coin of the realm.  That legislation was passed many years ago in the reign of Victoria to protect workers who at that time were being exploited, who were being paid as employers thought fit.  Ostensibly, they were entitled to say, £1 or £3 a week and the employers said they would give goods to the value of £1&mdash;goods produced by the firm. Sometimes employers put their own values on the goods.  Of course the provision had great merit 100 years ago or more.  It had merit well into this century but not any more.  Certainly it does not have merit in the security situation now existing.  The amount of money robbed in the past few years, the number of lives lost, people injured and families bereaved emphasise that.  I am strongly opposed to it.  A simple one-section Bill could have repealed that section of the Truck Acts.</P>
    <P>We would have gone much further and had a Bill providing that payment of wages should, as far as possible, be made by a non-cash mode provided there was a cashing service for workers reasonably near.  One could visualise problems in distant parts of the country where men are working out on roads and are paid by cheque miles away from any bank, or if they are paid when the banks closed or something like that.  But if the regulations we like to see were in force workers would be paid only by cheque if there was a cashing service reasonably near, a bank, post office or something of that kind.  So, we oppose amendment No. 3 in the name of the Minister.</P>

      <P>The section that amendment No. 3 seeks to amend is the kernel of the matter.  The Minister's amendment really incorporates my amendment No. 4 in which I seek to add the words &ldquo;provided the employee is also in attendance or has given such authority in writing&rdquo;.  I think the Minister has accepted the phrase &ldquo;in writing&rdquo;.  In so far as his amendment incorporates mine, I welcome it but there are other parts of his amendment that are not acceptable to me.  In amendment No. 5 I seek to delete paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of section 3 or effectively to delete part (ii) of that paragraph which is the subparagraph giving or emphasising the rights of workers to opt out of the non-cash mode of payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am seeking to reword the paragraph to read &ldquo;the document indicates that the specified mode of payment will cease to be used whenever both the employer and the employee so determine&rdquo;.  I am prepared to accept that if there is agreement between the employer and the employee payment may be made in cash, but we should not give the right to either side to subvert an agreement already made or a practice already established. My amendment simply seeks to delete sub-paragraph 2 of paragraph (b) in section 3 (1).  It is in any event deleted by the Minister's own amendment but it is <Col N="1012" /> incorporated in a different way.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 again is a drafting amendment and I have no objection to that.  Amendment No. 10 is in my own name.  It is consequent on amendment No. 5 being accepted.  I have no objection to amendment No. 13.  Amendment No. 16 is consequent on a previous amendment being accepted so what I said earlier refers to that.  Amendment No. 20 is in relation to what I sought to incorporate in amendment No. 4 and that is acceptable.  I have no objection to amendment No. 24.  I do not appear to have amendment No. 24a. on this list of amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained already on Second Stage and again today the purpose of this Bill.  It is obvious from Deputy Mitchell's opening remarks that he has missed the point.  I know he has, as usual, used catch phrases to get screaming headlines.  This is about payment of wages, and the one point that Deputy Mitchell ignored tonight in all the comments he made was that workers have right too in all of this scene.  He seemed to feel that there was a need for a Bill whereby wages would be paid only by cheque.  This was never my intention in introducing this Bill.  This is not my intention now.  Deputy Mitchell went on to say that the FUE wanted a Bill similar to what he was outlining and suggesting should be introduced.  That may well be the case, but the Deputy must remember that there are two sides of industry to be taken into consideration.  The worker has an entitlement that must be protected in legislation brought before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this group of amendments the main amendment is amendment No. 3.  The others are all consequent on it.  The Deputy said that this Bill facilitated bank robbers and other people of that nature. I want to reaffirm that this Bill maintains the rights of employees to payment in cash but it also provides, with the agreement of both parties, for payment on a non-cash basis.  If an option of this nature is not given it could lead to discontent <Col N="1014" /> and industrial strife.  Employers, employees, representative or negotiating groups and trade unions are entitled to that freedom within the terms of this Bill. The Deputy said this Bill was a step backwards, but that is not correct at all. Employees covered by the Truck Acts have always had the right since 1831 to refuse to accept payment by non-cash methods.  The anomaly was created in 1927 by the introduction of the Currency Act.  I am removing the anomaly.  It is not a step backwards, it is restoring the position that existed prior to 1927.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is strange that it has taken until now to do this.  The Deputy also appeared to be concerned about the position of the employers and the trade unions in regard to payment of wages other than in cash.  Amendment No. 3 and the other consequential amendments are being proposed with the agreement to its terms of both sides of industry, the ICTU and FUE.  This is fundamental to helping to have workable, sensible, practical, good legislation going through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell has put down amendments 4, 5 and 10.  I have met the second part of the Deputy's amendment No. 4 by moving amendment No. 3.  I am referring to the authority in writing, as I outlined in my opening comments.  The first part of the Deputy's amendment could create problems where large numbers of employees decide to avail themselves of their right to this suggested alternative.  For example, if 100 employees who are members of a trade union authorise their shop steward to sign the document on their behalf, it would not be practicable to expect all of them to be in attendance at the signing.  It would introduce a very difficult situation which possibly would be unworkable in many cases.  Also, it is important from the viewpoint of the employer that he should not be in doubt as to the bona fides of the authorisation or if any doubt exists it should be capable of being <Col N="1015" /> cleared up without too much difficulty. In that connection confusion would be created by having more than one method of authorisation.  Finally, bearing in mind that I have moved an amendment to the effect that the person's authorisation to sign a document on behalf of the employees must be in writing, I am not disposed to accept the Deputy's amendment on the grounds that I have outlined. That amendment is quite superfluous, and to provide for it in the Bill would not serve a useful purpose.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Deputy's amendment No. 5 would deprive both the employer and the employee of the right to unilateral termination by the one or the other of a particular non-cash method of payment on the expiration of the previously agreed amount of notice.  This proposition would be unfair to both parties. While the Bill provides for mutual termination, it was considered essential to include provision for unilateral termination as well.  For example in the case of an agreement to be paid by cheque, such a method might no longer be suitable during a bank strike, as the Deputy has said.  The conditions of payment at the time of the agreement might later cease to obtain.  Perhaps facilities for cashing cheques may have existed where they might no longer exist, and with changing circumstances a different non-cash method of payment from that agreed previously might be more suitable to both parties.  In the case of payment by cheque or credit transfer the employee might cease to have a bank account. Where the employee is organised his trade union would have to be free to negotiate other arrangements if so desired.  Inflexibility in this area, which is inherent in the Deputy's amendment, again could be a recipe for industrial relations problems for the employer.</P>
    <P>The minimum notice required for unilateral termination is four weeks from negotiating the terms of a document.  In this regard the employer could insist on whatever longer period he wished before consenting to sign the document.  The amendment would not accommodate the <Col N="1016" /> arrangements I propose to include in connection with agreements under the collective bargaining arrangements between employers and their representatives or employees and their representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the bone of contention between Deputy Mitchell and the Minister, that is, amendment No. 3. When this Bill was introduced in the House some time last year I supported its provsions fully.  I felt that in the light of present-day circumstances in our country there was need to protect the conveyance of cash and also the people involved in security in the conveyance of this cash.  However, I emphasised at the time that it was intended to meet the needs of our modern society.  Unfortunately, millions of pounds are being robbed yearly, people are being killed and are living in danger.  However, I did want flexibility and the Minister has covered this in amendment No. 3.  We must protect all people involved in the handling of cash but we must protect also the interests of the worker.  That means that the worker must have freedom to decide how he wants his wages or salary paid.  In the past couple of weeks in my area during the bank dispute there was serious concern and unease when cheques and cash were not available.  The Minister has had consultation with both sides of industry.  A man who possibly has endured hardship in disputes which created cash shortages has a right to opt out of a situation.  On that issue I support this subsection, because it is in the interests of the worker.  If the worker is copperfastened to a Bill which deprives him of the right in changing circumstances to opt out of a system unrest will be created.  For that reason I support amendment No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be idle to pretend that the arguments that the Minister and Deputy Ryan have used are without weight.  Of course workers have rights. As I have said at the outset on both Second Stage and Committee Stage of this Bill, nobody would support the rights of workers more strongly than I would, having come up from the ground <Col N="1017" /> floor myself as a shop steward. However, where there is a clash of rights it is the duty of this House to decide which rights in prevailing circumstnces should be given most weight.  Workers, especially those who are handling cash&mdash;a situation in which I found myself for about two years&mdash;can be living in fear of a gun.  Many workers and their families throughout the country are living in such fear.  The right to seek the protection of the law against the threat to life and limb is greater and more urgent and telling in today's circumstances than the undoubtedly reasonable right in normal circumstances to seek payment in cash.</P>
      <P>That really is the kernel of the debate on this Bill.  One more death would be one too many should it be facilitated by omissions in this Bill.  We might ask what this Bill is all about.  What is the purpose and content of it?  I was led to believe that the original motivation for it was an effort to reduce the level of payments by cash.  There has developed a widespread practice whereby trade unions and employers have agreed on the payment of wages by cheque.  In many cases of which I am aware workers are paid small amounts of money as an inducement to accepting their wages by cheque. In some cases there is a contribution towards banking charges.  Any reasonable trade union would not opt out of such an agreement without very good causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But let us consider the case of the maverick, the criminal or the subversive sympathiser.  Are we not giving such a person the right to opt out of agreements, the right to subvert the authority of the union in places of employment and the right to threaten lives? Therefore, have we not lost our way in regard to the primary motivation for this legislation?  If the purpose of the Bill had been merely to regularise agreements that have been made between employers and trade unions but which are in breach of the Truck Acts a simple one-section Bill would have been sufficient.  Such a Bill would have allowed the unions a free hand in negotiating at different work-places <Col N="1018" /> and would have been much more acceptable than is the Bill before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring in particular to amendment No. 3 and I am querying the purpose of the Bill.  I accept fully the Minister's wish to protect life consistent with maintaining the rights of workers in so far as possible but again I ask the Minister what is the main purpose of the Bill?  Why should it be necessary to enshrine the right of individuals to opt out when the various unions may negotiate those rights, if they so wish?  It is not good enough for anyone to insinuate here that the ICTU want this Bill.  The proposals in amendment No. 3 will not strengthen the trade union situation, whereas they will strengthen the position of anyone who opts out of a trade union, who fails to pay his fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there is substance in that argument but we must measure that consideration against the rights of those workers who are employed in carrying the cash boxes, in paying wages across the counter or in delivering wages to workers.  I know the fears of such people.  They are workers, too, and they and their families have the right to protection by way of legislation. Where there is a clash of rights, as so often there is, we must decide which right is more urgent, and in that regard I do not think there is any doubt about the answer.  In later amendments there are proposals which, if accepted, would <Col N="1019" /> result in there not being any cost to workers as a result of their being paid by cheque or of their wages being paid into bank accounts.  Obviously, if workers must open bank accounts they will incur bank charges but my amendments propose ways of covering those charges. In circumstances in which payments are made by cheque to workers there must be an adjacant cashing service. Therefore, unless my amendments are accepted it will not be possible to pay wages by cheque.</P>

      <P>There should not be a clash of rights here.  The purpose of the Bill was set out on Second Stage last year.  The Deputy has said he was led to believe it was some other type of Bill but I do not know who led him to believe that.  In my speech on Second Stage I said &ldquo;This Bill does not set out to repeal the Truck Acts.  Its central purpose is to amend that legislation in order to legalise the payment of manual workers' wages by cheque and other payment instruments. Both employers and workers concerned are agreeable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the workplace the workers have a right that the Minister for Labour must take into account when introducing legislation of this nature.  Both sides of industry have to be taken into consideration. In my opinion this is a major step forward because it is legalising the payment of wages by non-cash methods and it is facilitating both sides in order to encourage that.  That is the best way forward.  It is better to do this than to come down with a heavy axe that may help to protect in one area&mdash;not an area covered by this legislation&mdash;but which could cause serious problems on the other side with unrest and dissatisfaction caused as a result of such legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan, like myself, represents part of a rural constituency and he would be aware of the fact that there are practical problems in some parts of the country, where it may not be possible for workers to cash their cheques with ease. Deputy Mitchell must realise that many things have to be taken into consideration. I believe this Bill is a positive and tremendous step forward, in co-operation with both sides of industry and in facilitating both sides of industry.  On Second Stage Deputy Ryan expressed himself in favour of the trade union involvement and he must be complimented on that.  We have made a major step forward in amendment No. 3 and in the <Col N="1021" /> consequential amendments.  I would ask Deputy Mitchell to accept those amendments and to withdraw the amendments he has moved.  I have accommodated the Deputy in respect of part of those amendments as far as I could and I have tried to explain to him and to the House why it was impossible for me to accept the others.</P>

      <P>The Chair must come in on that.  It is not a security Bill.  Security is a matter for another Minister and for other Bills.  The Bill deals with the payment of wages and how it should be done.  It deals with the rights of people with regard to payment of wages.  Security is very important but so far as this Bill is concerned it does not enter into it.</P>

      <P>It is a major step forward.  It can be seen as a help towards aiding security matters but it is not a security Bill.  It is not within my power or within my portfolio to introduce a security Bill.  One has to see it as a positive contribution, with the aid and encouragement of both sides of industry, which helps to lessen the risks in a security situation.  That is as far as I can go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every intention of staying with the amendments.  I have to ask the question, what motivated this Bill?  It was motivated by the fact that many enterprises have made agreements with the trade unions, or in some cases have just initiated a scheme of paying wages and salary by non-cash methods. Almost certainly it is illegal because it is clashing with the legal provisions of the Truck Acts.  The question arises why has this practice grown of trade unions and employers, in breach of present legislation, making arrangements regarding the payment of wages by cheque.  I will tell the House the reason and I know this from personal experience.  The reason is to protect life and limb and also to protect money.  That is the major reason for this Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>The next question that arises from my line of argument is, does this Bill enhance the protection of life, limb and money?  I submit it does not.  In fact, it is a disimprovement and in that respect it is a major step backwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Chair is concerned the House is dealing now with a group of amendments. That is all we can discuss.  We are having a further Second Stage debate and the Chair cannot allow that.  The Chair has been very lenient up to now.  If Deputy Mitchell has anything further to say on the amendments before the House he is entitled to say it but we must get away from a Second Stage debate.</P>

      <P>Does amendment No. 3 improve the protection of life and limb, which is my main consideration?  Money is a very important element but the protection of life and limb is of paramount importance.  I am opposed to the Minister's amendment.  I am concerned <Col N="1023" /> about the rights of workers to be protected.  If the Minister says this Bill does not deal with security I say it should deal with security.</P>

      <P>I answered that already.  I quoted from what I said on the Second Stage of the Bill.  I said it was not introduced to repeal the Truck Acts.  I said its central purpose was to amend that legislation in order to legalise the payment of manual workers' wages by cheque or other payment instrument where both employers and workers concerned are agreeable.  I believe it is a major step forward with that kind of agreement on both sides.  Legalising the payment of wages by that method would be a major step forward in the field of security.  I want to emphasise that it is not in my portfolio to introduce a security Bill.  If I were to introduce the type of Bill suggested by the Deputy&mdash;and I am going off the subject now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), to insert &ldquo;or mode of payment&rdquo; after &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; in line 38. </P>
      <P>This section was based almost entirely on section 26 (6) of the Central Bank Act, 1971, where the word &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; is used.  In a submission on this Bill the Irish Banks' Standing Committee wrote:</P>
      <P>We have some doubts whether payment of wages into a bank account of an employee under a standing instruction from the employer to the employee's bank constitutes or involves an instrument.  In such case the employee does not receive any instrument. We would suggest, therefore, that the introductory phrase to section 3 (3) should read: &ldquo;This section applies to the following modes of payment....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter was examined and I am advised that the point made was considered to be valid.  As a result, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, where the words &ldquo;mode of payment&rdquo; are used on their own in the Bill, the term is to be construed as a generic one embracing any instrument and thereby rendering any change unnecessary.  I do not think this is a serious problem.  The submission was made originally by the Irish Banks' Standing Committee.  It was considered and it was agreed that it was a desirable <Col N="1025" /> change.  There is no major change in the amendment.</P>

      <P>According to the legal advice given to me, what the Deputy is proposing is superfluous and unnecessary.  In other words, under section 4 the notice given by the employee to his employer becomes inoperative when the employee returns to his usual place of employment and remains inoperative until such time as he is absent again from that place in any of the circumstances specified in subsection (2). This legal advice was generally accepted by all concerned.  The Deputy's amendment could pose practical difficulties.  It could mean a weekly change of place of employment in relation to a commercial traveller who spends one day at his head office and the rest of the week travelling around the country.  The same situation could apply to an employee who has to travel abroad at regular intervals.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment I am meeting part of Deputy Mitchell's amendment. <Col N="1031" /> The employer will be required to take such reasonable steps as are necessary not only to ensure that the statement is treated as confidential until it becomes the property of the employee but also to ensure that the information contained in the statement is treated as confidential. When this section is brought into operation it will apply to all employees, not just those covered by the Truck Acts and related legislation, whether they are paid in cash or by any other non-cash method.  I am not prepared to accept the first part of the Deputy's amendment on the basis that a deduction cannot be divided into components.  Each so-called component would comprise a deduction and its nature and amount would have to be indicated in writing in the pay statement. The Deputy proposes that the statement should be so presented as to be detachable from any cheque or similar mode.  As the Bill is drafted, the employer is not precluded from furnishing the statement as a document <Col N="1032" /> physically separate from the cheque. Other than that, the question of what form it might take is merely an administrative matter and provision is not made in that regard in the Bill.  Where non-cash payment is concerned, if the employee had strong feelings in the matter he could put his feelings to the employer. If the employer refuses to accommodate him there is no obligation on the employee to sign a document agreeing to a method of non-cash payment of his wages.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Questions Nos. 281 and 282 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the appearance of &ldquo;red tide&rdquo; off the west Cork coast in the current year.  The major organism responsible was a microscopic alga (a <Col N="879" /> dinoflagellate called Gyrodinium Aureolum) which has been responsible for similar outbreaks in 1976 and 1978. These outbreaks of &ldquo;red tide&rdquo; in West Cork are natural phenomena which result from oceanographic conditions in that area.</P>
    <P>There are no preventive measures; only protective measures may be taken in the event of an outbreak, for example, diversion of fishing or the removal of caged fish.</P>
    <P>Red tide is thus an occupational hazard of marine fish&mdash;farming and persons engaged in such are advised by my Department's officers to ensure against the risk involved.  The long-term aim of the investigations by my Department's scientific advisers is to develop an early warning system for fishermen.</P>

      <P>The main income tax child allowance was £240 in 1976-77 and is at present £218, a decrease of 9.2 per cent.  The Deputy will recall that in the 1979 Budget I announced that a priority would be given to social welfare <Col N="880" /> children's allowances and that the resources available would be directed to needy families in the lower and middle income groups.  This was achieved by introducing a special allowance of £250 for single parents with dependent children, by increasing the expenditure on social welfare children's allowances by some 28 per cent and by reducing the income tax child allowance by 9.2 per cent.  Families not liable to tax thus received the full benefit of the increase in social welfare children's allowances and for those paying income tax the benefit was greater the lower they were on the income tax scale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy has in mind the provisions of section 11 of the Finance Act, 1979, which enacted that certain specified short-term social welfare benefits (unemployment benefit, disability benefit, and so on) are to be treated as income for tax purposes.  The Government announced in their <Col N="881" /> Programme for National Development 1978-81 in January 1979 that these benefits would be taken into account from the earliest practicable date in assessing tax liability. The legislation referred to takes effect for the income tax year 1980-81 and subsequent years. The yield from this measure was estimated at £13 million per annum. Statistics are not available which would enable an estimate to be made of the yield from the taxing of the benefits in so far as they are payable to widows.</P>
