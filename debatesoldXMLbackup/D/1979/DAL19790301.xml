      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving the adjournment of this debate last week I was referring to our exports and the satisfactory position with regard to them in recent years.  Córas Tráchtála should put more effort into market research.  We export a lot of our produce but in many cases our representatives travel around the world trying to find markets for products we manufacture here rather than establishing what markets are available and tailor-making products for those markets.  Córas Tráchtála should put more effort into this and allocate more resources to that section of their operations.  We have been singularly successful in attracting industry to the country and the IDA have established a worldwide reputation for their ability in this regard, but there is a shortcoming in their strategy in so far as industry is attracted almost indiscriminately into the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should remember that our tourist industry is our second most important industry and the sooner the IDA prepare <Col N="539" /> an industrial waste disposal policy, the better.  Many problems are arising in regard to the disposal of industrial waste, the indiscriminate dumping of toxic waste in various areas close to the cities.  We must organise the disposal of such waste as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Minister should immediately ask the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the IDA to introduce a programme and national policy for industrial waste disposal.  It is not good enough to attract industries here, establish them and then find that residents' associations and other bodies are complaining because their areas are used as industrial dumps.  We must have a national policy in this matter; it should have been introduced before now, and at this stage it should be pursued as a matter of grave urgency.  On the one hand we have to have industries to create jobs and on the other, keep Ireland beautiful. There is no point in having these two policies running counter to each other.</P>
    <P>Following the budget we have had a great deal of comment on our economic targets and projections.  The growth rate for the past two years has been an outstanding feature of the economy.  It can truly be said that economically the country has come of age.  Our growth rate has surpassed the average for the EEC and OECD countries.  Since the budget the target growth rate has been the subject of some comment and criticism.  The Allied Irish Banks Quarterly Review, Spring Issue 1979, No. 19, one of the first documents published since the budget, gave figures which are more or less in line with the Government's targets.  As quoted in that document, there was a projected growth rate of 5 per cent in 1979 compared with the forecast for the EEC Commission in their annual report for 1978-79 of 3½ per cent in the Community as a whole, almost half the figure we projected.  This would give Ireland once again the highest growth rate among EEC countries on the basis of the most recent OECD projections for 1979 which are as follows: Belgium 3½ per cent, Denmark 2½ per cent, France 3½ per cent, Germany 4 per cent, Italy 3½ per cent, Netherlands 3 per cent and the United <Col N="540" /> Kingdom 2¼ per cent.  Even if we take the most pessimistic forecast, the Irish growth rate far surpasses those other countries.  If we had a little less negative comment on the economy and more positive and constructive comment, we would get further.  For a small developing country those figures are outstanding.</P>
    <P>It is a measure of the success of our membership of the EEC that since 1972, when markets were opened and became available to us, we have responded in a dramatic way and seized those opportunities and made the most of them to the extent that despite some of the constraints that exist at the moment we are showing the rest of Europe how an economy can be run and how well it can be done, even for a small developing island economy.</P>
    <P>The other matter which received most public comment since the budget is the 2 per cent levy.  Last Thursday I suggested here that the farming community should accept a system of taxation on their incomes and their profits from farming which would allow them to pay a fair share of tax, and no more than a fair share, over their tax free allowance, and be seen to be doing that by the remainder of the taxpayers.  I am glad that over the last few days the Government and the leaders of the farming community have worked out a proposed system of taxation which will once and for all bring the farming community into line in the payment of tax, the same as every other business and PAYE people.</P>
    <P>As I said at that time it is destructive and not in the national interest to have the urban and PAYE man accusing the farming community of not pulling their weight.  The only way the farming community can be seen to be pulling their weight is if they are taxed on the same basis as everybody else.  I do not think farmers will have very much to pay and the people who are shouting loudest for them to pay tax will not get the kind of return they expect.  It is only since we joined the EEC that the farming community have had any real outlets for their produce.  Up to 1972 there was a good deal of hardship in various parts of rural Ireland but thankfully, since then, the farming community have responded <Col N="541" /> and the top third of the farming community are in a position to pay their fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>I hope the farming leaders will ensure that a system of taxation which will allow the agricultural industry to develop and expand will be ironed out and that the farmers will get concessions for the development of their businesses because in many cases these businesses are in the developing stage.  The tax system should not be a constraint on development and the farming leaders and the Government should bring in a tax system which would allow them to pay a fair share of tax and at the same time develop their enterprises.</P>
    <P>I am not impressed with the reaction and propaganda we had from the Opposition over the last few days.  A number of Opposition Deputies tried to have the 2 per cent scrapped or dropped. When a reasonable compromise was reached with the leaders of the farming community they still were not satisfied. It is difficult not to come to the conclusion that there is a certain amount of mischief and negative propaganda being made out of this matter.  It would be in the interests of the whole community if this matter could be resolved to the satisfaction of all sectors of the community.</P>
    <P>The farming community and the agricultural economy are contributing more than their fair share towards job creation and the maintenance of living standards in rural towns.  Two out of every three jobs outside Dublin are based in agriculture, services to agriculture and the spin off effects of processing of agriculture produce.  This brings me back to the point I made about market research.</P>
    <P>More milk is being used in the manufacture of products for which there is no market than was the case 20 years ago.  Surely technological advances should have provided the expertise to manufacture products for which there are markets throughout the world.  There is no point in converting milk into butter when there is a contracting market, or into milk powder when there is an oversupply. Those promoting the dairy industry must put more effort into market <Col N="542" /> research, find out the products for which there is a market and ensure that manufacturers produce these products.</P>
    <P>In my area there is an example of how milk, as one farm product, can be manufactured to great advantage.  Milk is converted into almost every conceivable type of product.  We fall down very much in the manufacture of cheese by concentrating on the production of cheddar cheese to the almost total exclusion of the continental varieties for which there is a tremendous market.  In the milk manufacturing concern in Ballineen the whey, which is a by-product, is converted into a very valuable alcohol by using a suitable strain of yeast.  In the old days the whey was allowed to run into rivers and streams, causing pollution and killing fish.  Through this new process there is added value and pollution is being prevented.</P>
    <P>In the meat industry we export too many live cattle and also too many slaughtered cattle.  We should have much more added-value processing and produce individual portions of meat for the convenience of the consumer.  More and more housewives are working outside the home and more time is taken up by interests outside the kitchen.  The convenience element of most foods is just as important as the quality or the type of food.  Any product nowadays which does not have a convenience element does not stand much chance in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on this very comprehensive by-product in line with Government strategy during the past two years.  I welcome the improvements in social welfare benefits.  Social welfare recipients are the weakest sector of the community and it is much more advantageous for these people to have a reasonable allowance to provide them with some comfort in their old age or disability rather than some of that money being expended in food subsidies from which all sectors of the community benefit.  Social welfare recipients should be singled out for special treatment if possible and I am glad that the budget contributed towards the improvement of their position.  I welcome the commitment of the Government to a growth rate of 6.5 per cent for the economy as a <Col N="543" /> whole.  We must endeavour to improve the position for everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget is the main instrument of Government policy and the annual debate on the budget affords us an opportunity of analysing, reviewing and assessing the performance of the Government.  The debate on the 1979 Budget is taking place against a background of unprecedented industrial unrest and growing economic and social chaos.  Strikes, protests and demonstrations are now the order of the day, and each new day brings with it threats of new strikes, new disruptions and more chaos.  As well as that, inflation, prices, unemployment and emigration are all on the increase again.</P>
      <P>We have, at the same time, a Government who were elected a mere 18 months ago with the largest majority in the history of the State.  That Government appear to be totally unable or unwilling to come to grips with these very serious economic and social problems. They appear to stand idly by and appear not to be conscious of the reality of grave economic and social problems which confront the nation at present. Despite all the promises in their election manifesto, despite the fact that we have had multi-coloured papers on the economy, despite the assurances given by various Ministers and the confidence expressed by the Taoiseach and his Ministers, the reality of the situation is that there appears now to be no earthly hope of the Government's economic and social targets for 1979 being realised. There is nothing in the Minister's speech to indicate the contrary.</P>
      <P>The most important target set relates to the annual growth rate, on which economic and social progress depends more than anything else.  It is now quite clear that there is no hope of the 6.5 per cent grow rate being achieved and the forecasts of many independent experts during recent weeks tend to confirm that.  All the evidence is that we will be very lucky if we achieve a growth rate of 4 per cent.  As well as that, it is now clear that pay rises will have to be at least 14 per cent if real incomes are to be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> Indications are that fewer houses will be built in 1979.  The Minister of State opposite, who is involved in this area, may refute this or not, but from the evidence available it is quite clear that the Government's housing targets will not be met this year.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Government's economic policy which is basic and fundamental to the budget and to the White Papers and which was also a key point in the Government's manifesto.  I refer to the creation of employment.  The generation of employment and new jobs will depend largely on success in achieving the Government's target in relation to growth rate. The figure of 4 per cent, which now appears to be a realistic forecast, has serious implications for the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the targets which were set will be achieved in 1979.  Of course the Government will endeavour, as they did last year, to create the maximum number of jobs in the public sector, but this cannot be maintained indefinitely. For every job created in the public sector, there should be two or three further jobs created in the private sector.  Last year the Government created a number of jobs in the public sector.  This was an easy thing to do.  The money was borrowed to do it, but we cannot create real employment in this way.  There were efforts to encourage the private sector to play its part in the job-creation programme.  But I am afraid the strategy of the Government, as pursued in 1978, did not achieve the proper and optimum balance between the public and private sectors.  There is no evidence that there will be any improvement in the situation in 1979.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of national policy that gives rise to grave concern and there is no point in beating about the bush in this matter.  A fundamental and vital element in national development is a harmonious climate of industrial relations. In the past 12 months there has been an unprecedented series of strikes and disruptions and almost continuous industrial unrest.  Is there any evidence that there will be any improvement in the situation in 1979?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the Government's targets for growth rate, employment creation, housing development and so on cannot be met in 1979.  The Government were elected with an overwhelming majority, the largest in the history of the State, and they were elected on the strength of a manifesto that promised a utopia for the Irish people.  It is incredible that we should be confronted with our present situation and with very alarming economic and social problems.</P>
      <P>The budget has been debated at length in recent weeks.  I venture to suggest that in future it will be known as the tale of the 2 per cent.  The most controversial measure proposed in the budget was the decision to impose a 2 per cent levy on farm products.  That decision was the greatest political blunder in the history of the State.  The Government have recognised this now and they have been compelled to rectify it as a result of a very strong and entirely predictable public reaction.  Within 24 hours of the announcement by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech it was crystal clear to Deputies on all sides and to a wide section of the public outside that this measure, which was ill-conceived, indefensible and totally unjust, would never reach the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the Minister for Finance and the Government completely misread the agricultural scene.  They received substantial support from the farming community in the last general election.  Quite deliberately they went out to cajole and persuade the farming community to vote for them and it is incredible to understand how the Government, and the Minister for Finance in particular, expected to get away with such a measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question that has been asked frequently in the past fortnight is how could the Government be so blind as to think they could get away with such a measure.  It is obvious they underestimated the intelligence of the farming community and of the people who are directly and indirectly involved in the <Col N="546" /> agricultural industry.  In recommending this measure to the Government the Minister for Finance was tempted by purely financial considerations, and he fell for the temptation.  It was a surefire method of extracting the maximum amount of tax from the farming community. It would have been applied across the board to big farmers and small farmers irrespective of the size of farm or their income.  The Minister fell for the temptation to apply this measure, thereby compelling every farmer to pay tax.  I believe that some genius in the Department of Finance came up with this idea and it looked effective on paper. I do not know how the Minister for Agriculture, who must take responsibility as a member of the Government, allowed this measure to see the light of day in the Budget speech of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This levy has been written about and discussed at length over the last few weeks.  Yesterday the Minister for Finance was reported as having said that if proposals agreed on in principle the other day with the farming organisations, did not work out, the levy would still be imposed.  This method of raising revenue is contrary to the concept of social justice and to the concept of equitable and fair taxation.  It is indiscriminate as all medium and small farmers would have been required to pay, irrespective of their ability to pay or of the size of their holding.  We had an appalling situation of a Government attempting to extract, by foul means, the maximum amount of tax from the farming community.</P>
    <P>On economic, social and moral grounds, a produce tax cannot be defended.  The Government had obviously not borne in mind the fact that a production tax of its very nature is a disincentive to increased production. Various Government spokesmen have outlined their strategy and programmes for economic development over the last year and a half and Minister after Minister has pointed to the potential of the agricultural industry for increased production, increased exports and increased employment.  We then find ourselves in a new situation where the Minister for Finance comes into the Dáil <Col N="547" /> and announces that he will impose a regressive tax.  There has been strong adverse reaction from the agricultural community and their representatives with whom I discussed the matter over the last fortnight.  All agree that the tax is unjust, inequitable and a disincentive to production.</P>
    <P>Another significant aspect of what might be described as an abortive attempt to impose this levy was the incredible complete failure of the Government to anticipate public reaction to it. Apart from the Minister for Agriculture, many Ministers in the Government represent rural or partly rural constituencies and received a substantial rural vote.  I cannot understand how this measure reached the stage where it was included in the Budget.  Public reaction was entirely predictable.  Subsequent events clearly showed a very spontaneous, widespread, adverse reaction.  It also provoked adverse reaction from sections of the community who have no direct involvement in agriculture.  The decision to introduce the levy was clearly a major political blunder.  The Government have now agreed, faced with very strong adverse reaction, not to go ahead with the levy, assuming a satisfactory outcome of the discussion which took place last Tuesday between the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and other Ministers and the representatives of the farming organisations.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of controversial farm taxation I will express my concern and the concern of many people at the manner in which the Taoiseach and the Government treated this House and this Parliament when attempts were made to have the measure debated and put to a vote in the House.  Early on, the Taoiseach indicated that this measure would not be implemented in the normal way through the Finance Bill but would be implemented by ministerial order.  He then indicated to his own parliamentary party following a discussion there that the Minister for Finance had agreed to modify the measure somewhat.  At the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis details of the modification were outlined.  Following the meeting with the farming organisations <Col N="548" /> on Tuesday a new agreement was reached which, if successful, would mean the withdrawal of this particularly offensive measure.  My point is that on a number of occasions, even as late as yesterday, the Taoiseach refused to infrom the House as to what transpired in the discussion with the farming organisations.  He is not showing very good example.  He is indicating in an arrogant and aggressive way his contempt, if you like, for the normal democratic procedure and particularly his contempt for the Opposition parties in our national Parliament.</P>
    <P>The worst feature of what might be described as this whole sorry episode of the 2 per cent levy, and perhaps the most serious, was the manner in which it has driven a wider wedge between the farming and non-farming communities, between the farming organisations and the trade unions.  At this time, when every effort should be expended by all sections of the community in fostering a spirit of co-operation, harmony and mutual understanding and goodwill, this type of sectoral conflict we have been witnessing in the past few days is not good and is something that could be avoided.</P>
    <P>Out of all the argument and discussion and the whole sorry episode there has emerged in the past few days one very bright omen.  I was very pleased indeed to read in last Tuesday's newspapers of suggestions having been made and responded to in a positive way by both the farming organisations and the trade unions that they should come together in a spirit of mutual goodwill to discuss their problems and differences and try to arrive at a consensus which, while recognising each other's problems, would enable these two sectors of our national life to work together and contribute individually and jointly to our economic development and social progress.  If the country is to make progress, if targets are to be achieved and if the major national objective of full employment is to be attained in the foreseeable future, it is absolutely essential to have harmony, co-operation and goodwill between all sections, employers and workers, farmers and non-farmers, urban and rural.  This co-operation, <Col N="549" /> mutual goodwill and understanding is absolutely vital.  The Government must use every effort and opportunity to encourage it.  That is not easily achieved in a democratic society.  Above anything else, achievement of this harmonious climate which is daily becoming more urgent depends largely on the ability of the Government and the type of leadership it provides.  The Government must first provide dynamic leadership and show example; secondly, the Government must take the initiative which entails courage, enterprise and energy to create the structures which will enable the spirit of goodwill and co-operation and harmonious industrial relations to be achieved.</P>
    <P>I regret that this Government, now 18 months in office, have given no grounds for hope that we might be able to work towards this particularly desirable national climate.  In his Financial Statement the Minister referred to the role of agriculture in the national economy.  He outlined a number of ideas, proposals and policy points regarding the future of this most important part of our economy.  Anything said by the Minister in his Financial Statement in regard to agriculture faded into insignificance following his announcement of the 2 per cent levy.  It cannot be said too often or over-emphasised that agriculture still is, and will be for a long time to come, the most important natural and national resource we have.  It offers the greatest potential for increased production, increased exports and increased employment. This is being more and more realised because if we look back over the past 10 years we can see the contribution agriculture has made to the national economy, to exports, job creation and so on.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the budget and particularly with the Minister's speech.  In the part of the speech which dealt with the agricultural industry, there was no indication of new thinking, new ideas or new approaches to the vitally urgent problem of accelerating agricultural production and generating new exports and new jobs.  It is regrettable that the Government attempted to impose the penal tax which has come to be known as the 2 per cent.  In recent <Col N="550" /> times many experts have commented on the role of the agricultural industry in a developing Irish economy.  Reference was made to it in the Minister's budget speech, in White Papers and Green Papers.</P>
    <P>I regret to have to say there is no evidence that the Government realise the potential that agriculture offers for increased employment and increased exports. Lip service is paid to the industry from time to time but what is needed now&mdash;and the budget makes no provision for it&mdash;is a new dynamic, a new approach, a new forward-looking, progressive policy which would ensure that the agricultural industry achieves its full potential as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Successive Fianna Fáil Governments always appeared to do the wrong thing in relation to agriculture.  There has been no proper appreciation of the industry.  I have been a Member of this House for 18 years.  I remember when the farmers protested legitimately at the gates of Leinster House.  Instead of inviting them in, they were carted away to the Bridewell in Black Marias, and they ended up in jail.  I remember the farmers marching to Dublin from all over Ireland seeking a meeting with the Minister for Agriculture.  He left them sitting in the gutter outside his door for nine weeks and would not meet them.  I do not know what philosophy Fianna Fáil are pursuing.</P>
    <P>The debate has started on the Committee Stage of the Agriculture (An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta) Bill in which the Minister for Agriculture has made substantial changes in the Bill enacted by his predecessor.  That is a retrograde step.  In 1957, there was a reversal of the unique, very exciting and very valid concept conceived by the late Canon Hayes, founder of Muintir na Tíre, the parish plan for agriculture.  It was put into operation by the then inter-Party Government and, when Fianna Fáil took office in 1957, they scrapped it.</P>
    <P>Looking back at the performance and the policies of Fianna Fáil over the past two decades almost, we see their failure to realise&mdash;or perhaps they realised it in an artificial or superficial way&mdash;the fundamental importance of the agricultural <Col N="551" /> industry and their failure to put into effect a progressive, comprehensive, co-ordinated policy which would enable the industry to develop to its full potential.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to a document I have received.  I am sure other Deputies received it in recent weeks and I hope the Government and the Minister for Agriculture in particular will take note of it.  It is a very well-researched document and makes comprehensive and detailed proposals for the development of agriculture.  I refer to the document produced recently by the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society &ldquo;A Framework for Co-operative Development&rdquo;.  It outlines and pinpoints what I would describe as a very exciting future for Irish agriculture, provided the Government are prepared to support the IAOS and enable them to implement their very good proposals.</P>
    <P>The significance of this document is that it is comprehensive and deals with the whole spectrum of Irish agriculture from the production stage to the finished product going into the export market.  I have been greatly impressed and encouraged by the work undertaken by the IAOS.  I sincerely hope the Minister for Agriculture will back them and enable them to implement this policy.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed at the omission in the speech made by the Minister for Finance of any reference to the role of the co-operative movement particularly in relation to the development of the agricultural industry.  The co-operative movement is the greatest thing that ever happened in this context.  It had a difficult existence.  It has the same validity now as it had at the end of the last century when the great pioneers attempted to apply the concept of co-operation to the dairying industry, and it will have the same validity in the eighties and nineties. Greater emphasis must be placed on the concept of co-operation.  Greater encouragement must be given to it by the Government.  Greater financial backing must be given to the IAOS, which is the umbrella organisation.</P>
    <P>Another question is agitating people's minds at present which is fundamental to the Government's economic policy. As far as I can recall, there was no <Col N="552" /> reference to it in the Minister's budget speech.  People are asking what is happening in the Department of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. The annual debate on the budget is the appropriate time to raise this matter. We were presented with what was supposed to be an original idea, one offering the great possibilities&mdash;the decision to set up the Department of Economic Planning and Development. People are beginning to wonder and question what this Department have done in relation to economic planning and development since their establishment 18 months ago.  We have had White Papers and Green Papers.  There is growing disappointment at the apparent total failure of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and of his Department to come up with concrete plans and structures which would enable economic planning and social progress to take place.</P>
    <P>I am concerned particularly with the failure of that Department to come up with any one new idea in relation to a vital element of our national development, that is, regional development.  At the outset of the debate in this House when that Department were being set up, it was indicated to the House that regional planning and development would constitute a very important part of the responsibility of that Department. After all, the budget is the major implement of economic policy.  But there is nothing in the Minister's budget speech to indicate that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and his Department have come up with any new idea, strategy or structure which would accelerate and facilitate more co-ordinated economic development.</P>
    <P>There are in the country eight regional development organisations.  I think my colleague, Deputy John Ryan, has been very closely involved in the RDO in the mid-west region.  But these organisations have no power worth talking about&mdash;no teeth, so to speak&mdash;and very little finance to enable them to undertake their task, which is to co-ordinate economic development at regional level.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance when replying to this debate, or the Minister of State <Col N="553" /> now present, would give the House and the country some indication of what new planning strategies have been evolved by the Government, through the Department of Economic Planning and Development, first of all, for overall national economic planning and, secondly, in relation to regional planning and development.  The question of economic planning and development at national and regional levels are vital elements in any national plan.</P>
    <P>I expressed my support and pleaded earlier for the concept of co-operation between different sections of the community and different sectors of the economy.  If progress is to be made, if employment targets are to be achieved&mdash;in particular the objective of full employment must be achieved&mdash;it cannot be done by the methodology indicated in the present budget or indeed in the different papers, White and Green, presented to us.</P>
    <P>I believe a new approach to national and regional development is vital and is a matter of extreme urgency.  But, most important of all, there should be co-ordinated development.  Any national plan must be implemented at local and regional levels in a co-ordinated way.  In view of the fact that the Government have rejected the concept of a western development board and have done something completely ridiculous in relation to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, by reducing its functions and powers, the possibility of expanding the role, functions, powers and scope of the regional development organisations should be examined.</P>
    <P>We have experienced a situation recently, which was sparked off and intensified by reason of the controversy surrounding the 2 per cent farm levy, when the conflict between sectoral interests, as it might be described, became absolutely detrimental to national development.  There is an onus on the Government to encourage understanding, goodwill and so on between different sections.  There is need also for the Government to lay down the necessary structures to facilitate this goal at regional level in particular.  There is dire need for the formulation and implementation of new structures to facilitate co-ordinated <Col N="554" /> regional development with inputs from the different sectors of industry, agriculture, tourism, fisheries and so on.  I am publicly asking the Minister for Finance in particular, and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development&mdash;if he has not yet spoken on the budget debate&mdash;to inform the House and the country, both of whom are entitled to know, what is happening or what plans the Government have for regional development.</P>
    <P>I made brief reference to the tourist industry earlier.  There is nothing in this budget which could be identified as contributing in any way to the further development of our tourist industry. Indeed, the tourist industry seems to be fading more and more into the background in relation to overall Government planning and development strategies.  This is an industry which has been making successful strides in recent times, but one also which has suffered immensely from the impact of the problems in the North of Ireland and more recently the world economic recession. Nevertheless, it has shown great resilience and seems poised now for further development, provided it is backed by the appropriate policies, assistance and encouragement from the Government.  I doubt very much if this industry is receiving the Government attention it warrants.  I believe it still has fantastic potential as an industry and has tremendous scope for further development, but new strategies and new approaches will have to be applied.</P>
    <P>I particularly want to draw the attention of the Minister for Finance to what is perhaps the major problem confronting the tourist industry at present. That is the cost of access transport.  I want to urge on the Government the desirability of looking seriously at the whole question of transport <i>vis-à-vis</i> the development of the tourist industry. Every time there is an increase in air fares it has an adverse affect on tourism. A comprehensive study should be made into the relationship between transport and tourism development and the relationship between air fares and the cost of access transport to this country and tourism development.  I believe the tourist industry has exciting possibilities <Col N="555" /> for attracting new tourist traffic and developing new markets in Europe.  It is important that greater attention be paid to the problem of overcoming the difficulties of air transport, the cost of air transport and the whole question of access transport.  Have the Government any plans in this respect and will additional finance be made available to Bord Fáilte and to the regional tourism organisations to enable them to exploit the potential that is undoubtedly there, particularly in Europe, for attracting new traffic to this country?</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to refer to is a question which arises indirectly from the last point I was making about the tourist industry.  It is in relation to the whole question of transport, which is a vital and important element in national development.  I wish again to ask for the formulation of a national transportation policy.  According to the latest statement from CIE, Dublin suburban rail services are coming to a standstill; they cannot carry on any longer.  There is a very serious problem here in that the rolling stock on the Dublin suburban services is now very old; it is becoming antiquated and worn out.  There is also a shortage of rolling stock on the provincial services.  I thought the Minister for Finance might have indicated in his budget speech whether money is being provided to enable CIE to proceed with the modernisation and streamlining of the Dublin suburban rail services and the provision of new rolling stock for the provincial routes.  CIE's proposal, which is a very good one, has been with the Government for a year-and-a-half now and the matter has been raised in the House on a number of occasions over the past year. But there is still no indication that the Government are going to provide the money to enable CIE to get on with their job.  I have looked through the budget speech and the Estimates and I cannot find any indication whatsoever of any decision by the Government to provide CIE with the moneys necessary.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of transport is the toll road.  The different Ministers responsible for different aspects or policies should make new attempts to co-ordinate the different elements and to try to formulate <Col N="556" /> and implement a comprehensive coherent national transportation policy. I would draw the attention of the Minister for Finance to the need to look at this area very carefully.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I wish to add my voice to the many voices which have been raised over the past five or six weeks in condemning the decision of the Government to abolish food subsidies.  The 2 per cent farm levy is also a totally unjust and inequitable tax and will affect the small farmer as well as the large farmer&mdash;in fact, it will have an even greater impact on the small farmer.  The abolition of the food subsidies was a despicable act.  I represent a constituency which is largely urban&mdash;the city of Limerick.  Over the years one gets a tremendous insight into human and domestic problems, the problems of the underprivileged and the poor and of the weaker sections of our community.  I was horrified and appalled when I heard the news that the food subsidies were being abolished and that the cost of essential foodstuffs was being automatically increased as a result.  Any Government who would do that while at the same time abolishing wealth tax have no social conscience.  The people are beginning to realise that this Government have no social conscience, no social philosophy and they certainly appear to have no interest whatsoever in the fundamental concept of total justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all.  I should like to refute the allegations made by Deputy O'Donnell.  He stated that we now have strikes daily and clearly gave the impression that the situation in relation to industrial disputes is far worse now than it ever was before. This is not so.  Statistics and figures can prove this.  There were far fewer man-days lost in 1978 than in 1976.  Those figures speak for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like categorically to refute the allegation Deputy O'Donnell made that fewer houses will be built in 1979 than were built in 1978.  This allegation is completely without foundation.  I am convinced that the number of houses completed in 1979 will be at least as high as in 1978.  More and more mortgage finance is available for private housing <Col N="557" /> from building societies and other lending agencies.  A record number of applications are being received for SDA loans by local authorities and applications for the £1,000 new house grant are pouring into my Department at an increasing rate.  All this indicates that the number of houses completed in 1979 will be at least as high, if not higher, than in 1978.</P>
    <P>There is now an air of confidence in the house building industry and in the construction industry as a whole.  I am saying this to refute the allegation made by Deputy O'Donnell in relation to housing.  The one and only reason which might prevent the construction industry from moving on to greater levels is the scarcity of skilled labour.  During the term of office of the National Coalition there was a lack of confidence in the building industry, particularly during the latter part of that period.  At that time young people were not prepared to become apprenticed to the various skills and trades within this great industry and it has been only within the past year-and-a-half that interest has been shown again in this area.</P>
    <P>I intend concentrating on matters relating to my Department as they are affected by the budget and to refer to such matters as job creation, environmental improvement, local improvement schemes, group water supply schemes, planning and development, private housing, housing grants, mortgage finance, house price control and the national house building guarantee scheme.  The services of the Department of the Environment figure prominently in the strategy of the Government as outlined in the budget. The extent to which central government resources are devoted to local services can be demonstrated best by a few figures.  The local authorities who operate under the umbrella of the Department will spend this year an amount in the region of £610 million.  Of this amount the local authorities will raise on their own accord more than £170 million.  The massive injection of funds by the Government to the local authority sector, as disclosed by the figures I have given, produces a twofold effect.  First, it enables local authorities <Col N="558" /> to provide the services the community need and which are so essential for the economic and social development that the Government are striving for.  In addition, ratepayers are being cushioned against the burden of meeting the cost of the services from which they benefit. Briefly, that sets the scene in terms of the implications of the budget for the local government sector.</P>
    <P>In a debate like this one could not hope to deal comprehensively with every aspect of Government policy at it affects the services provided by the Department and by local authorities.  Therefore, I shall concentrate on the aspects I have outlined.  Unemployment has been pinpointed by the Government as a real threat to the future of our country.  The need for the creation of employment is a main theme of the White Paper.  This primary objective of Government policy is reaffirmed forcibly in the budget.  The Government's efforts so far have been singularly successful.  For instance, by the end of 1978 the target of nearly 23,000 jobs under the job creation programme almost £600 million has been provided for spending on building and may be very proud.  The overall employment target for 1979 is to effect a decrease of 25,000 in the numbers out of work.  The main expansion of employment will come from the industrial sector. The building and construction industry, overall responsibility for which rests with the Department of the Environment, will be making a significant contribution.  In the public capital programme almost £600 million has been provided for spending on building and construction.  This is an increase of 27 per cent on the 1978 spending.  Consequently, the increase in the average level of employment in the industry in 1979 should be significant.</P>
    <P>The Department will be concerned very much with part of the £20 million job creation packet announced in the budget.  The Department are being allocated £5.2 million for spending equally on road works and environmental improvement schemes.  These extra allocations are particularly welcome both from the point of view of the jobs that will result and of the benefits that will accrue from the projects which local authorities <Col N="559" /> will be able to carry out.  It is expected that the funds for the special programme on road works will provide the equivalent of about 275 jobs of one year's duration.  This in itself is significant. An extra £2.6 million for environmental improvement schemes increases the total allocation for these schemes in 1979 to £4.28 million and will enable local authorities to undertake further desirable improvement works this year.</P>
    <P>There is a need for special attention from the environmental point of view in the Dublin inner city area.  The Government have earmarked £.5 million of the new allocation for work in this area.  The environmental improvement schemes programme fits in well with the role of the Department in the promotion of activities and projects of environmental benefit.</P>
    <P>Last year a sum of £4 million was provided in the budget for a scheme of environmental improvements.  This scheme was designed to provide short-term employment equivalent to 1,000 jobs of a year's duration, of which 75 per cent were earmarked for young persons.  The collection and execution of works remained the responsibility of local authorities.  The general guideline was that these works should be of environmental, recreational or amenity value to the community.  The type of projects selected include the provision of playgrounds and parks, the provision of car parks and other amenities at scenic areas, the cleaning up of derelict sites and the carrying out of operations to improve environmental standards generally.</P>
    <P>Because of industrial action on the part of certain local authority staff members the authorities were not able to spend the full amount allocated in 1978. However, by 31 December 1978 they had expended £3.1 million.  At peak 2,000 persons were employed on works under this programme.  Included among these were more than 1,600 young people. In all during 1978 there were provided the equivalent of 750 jobs of one year's duration under this programme. Accordingly, it is fair to say that the programme has had a substantial impact <Col N="560" /> in terms of the employment of young persons as well as the carrying out of much useful work to the benefit of the community.  Happily, the Government have been able to continue the programme in 1979.  It is my hope that local authorities will be able to avail of the allocation to the fullest extent possible.  In this way useful employment will be given and this will also make a further contribution to the raising of environmental standards.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Government have been able to make provision this year for a local improvements scheme to the extent of £2.75 million. This is £1 million more than the 1978 allocation and compares with only £1 million provided in the 1977 budget. County councils will be able to expand work to a very significant extent under this scheme.  It is designed to aid agricultural production by assisting land owners to carry out improvements on accommodation roads, bog roads and minor drains.  Substantial social benefits are also derived from the works undertaken. Road access to houses and farms is improved.  One would not want to underestimate what this means in terms of acceptable living conditions for rural dwellers.  Works under the scheme have a high labour content.  They provide a valuable supplement to the income of land owners and land holders in underdeveloped areas.  The vast bulk of expenditure on the scheme takes place in the western counties.  This is now one of the most popular schemes being operated by county councils.</P>
    <P>As regards group water supply schemes, the availability of piped water supply is a further major factor in ensuring acceptable living conditions in rural areas.  It is a service urban householders may take for granted, yet many rural homes lack this basic amenity.  The census of population in 1971 showed that about 154,000 houses, nearly all in rural areas, had no piped water supply. The position has substantially improved since then.  Piped water has been installed in many existing dwellings with the aid of grants.  Older houses which lacked piped water supplies have gone out of use.  Virtually all new houses built in the intervening years have a water supply.  It <Col N="561" /> is estimated that at the end of 1977 the number of houses without piped water supply has been reduced to about 63,000 or just over 40 per cent of the 1971 total.</P>
    <P>There has been a tremendous upsurge in the number of private group water schemes undertaken by local communities with the help of the generous grant assistance available.  A total of 68,500 rural homes have to date secured piped water supplies from group schemes.  In 1978 alone piped water was provided in nearly 10,800 houses by way of group schemes.  This was an all time record.  Group schemes gave access to piped water supplies to about 8,500 farms in 1978.</P>
    <P>We must realise that group schemes are now big business.  An estimated £6 million was invested in these schemes last year.  The future prospects for group schemes are bright.  At the end of last year schemes were in progress which will provide piped water in an additional 9,000 houses approximately.  A further 206 schemes, which will eventually serve more than 7,000 houses, have been designed.</P>
    <P>Irish farmers must modernise their holdings if they are to meet the challenges and avail of the opportunities offered by our membership of the European Community.  A piped water supply is an essential part of farm modernisation plans.  So far, an estimated 48,000 farms have been given access to piped water from group schemes.  The farmer quickly recovers the cost of joining a group scheme from improvements in the yield and quality of milk, higher stocking rates on the land, the potential created for the construction of modern farm buildings and the use of modern farming methods and equipment, including milk cooling equipment.</P>
    <P>The success of the group scheme movement is first and foremost due to the organisers, trustees and committees, all of whom work for their local communities on a voluntary basis.  My Department and the county councils have been glad to give financial assistance and expert advice to groups undertaking these vital co-operative projects. Total co-operation in carrying out <Col N="562" /> group schemes can lead to the launching of other community projects on a co-operative basis.</P>
    <P>I have the highest admiration for all those associated with the organisation of group schemes in their areas.  The community at large owes them a great debt. The EEC have recognised the importance of piped water supplies for agricultural development.  To date the EEC Commission have allocated grants totalling nearly £1.2 million to 99 group schemes from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, FEOGA.  In addition FEOGA grants totalling £4.5 million have been allocated to 75 public water schemes undertaken by county councils, usually to facilitate group scheme development.</P>
    <P>Our physical planning structure is an essential ingredient of the Government's economic development programme. Material progress, unless properly controlled, carries certain risks for the environment. We have to be on our guard to ensure that no form of development can be allowed to exploit our physical resources.  We had to get good quality in planning and design.  On the other hand, trivial and unreasonable environmental opposition cannot be allowed to frustrate or impede the Government's policies to secure development and more jobs.  We must strive therefore to achieve balance and consistency between the laudable targets of taking maximum advantage of developing opportunities and the need to ensure the preservation of high environmental conditions.</P>
    <P>There is no fundamental conflict or incompatibility between those two aims. Services such as housing, roads and sanitary services, which are so essential to our present and future employment requirements, make great demands on resources.  It is therefore essential that priorities for investment in these sources are soundly based.  This is where the local development plans have their role to play.  Each planning authority is obliged to make and keep its plan up to date.  It provides the framework within which development can be promoted. All planning authorities have made development plans and the majority of these plans are currently under review for a second time.  This review is essentially <Col N="563" /> an examination and an updating of the plan in the light of the planning authority's experience in implementing it over the previous five years.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need to ensure that the planning system is used to promote desirable developments rather than merely as a method of negative control.  Planning authorities were requested in September last to facilitate developments which would expand employment opportunities by speedy process of planning applications in relation to such projects.  Top priority should be given to applications for planning permission where job opportunities are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps true that undue emphasis has been put on the negative aspects of planning legislation.  Enforcement of planning controls has tended to get more prominence than the wide-ranging positive powers of planning authorities to promote economic activity.  The local authority has a lot to contribute to the Government's national development programme.  I have said before, and would like to repeat again, that I should like to see each planning authority look on themselves as a development corporation and their developments plans should take cognisance of this very important role.</P>
    <P>With regard to private housing, the provisions made in the public capital programme for the financing of housing reflect the continued priority the Government are giving to housing.  It is a basic plank of the Government's housing policy that as many families as possible are helped and encouraged to provide their own houses.  The provision for private housing grants in 1979 is twice what was paid in 1978.  During the past week we have had two debates on housing, one in the Seanad and one in this House.</P>
    <P>With regard to new house grants, this year we are providing £13 million for new house grants and practically all of this will go to recipients of the £1,000 grant for first-time owner-occupiers.  A small proportion will be needed to pay off outstanding grants under the old grant schemes that are payable where a house was completed before 1 January <Col N="564" /> 1979.  We expect that more than 12,500 people providing houses for themselves will benefit by the £1,000 grant this year. Last year some 12,000 applications were approved and 7,140 were paid.  The shortfall in payments was not due to any delay on the part of the Department in arranging inspections and in paying grants.  Rather it appears that the houses were not being completed at the rate suggested by the level of approvals and applications from July 1977 onwards.  It seems likely that the large number of grant approvals carried over from 1978 will come forward for payment this year.</P>
    <P>Last year we introduced an improved package of financial assistance to philanthropic bodies engaged in providing houses for the elderly.  I am conscious of the invaluable work of such bodies.  I hope the availability of the new package of loans, grants and subsidies will encourage and assist public bodies in looking after those people, who tend frequently to be forgotten.  The voluntary bodies will have considerable freedom to manage their new projects.</P>
    <P>With regard to house improvement grants, these grants, including the provision of individual water supply and sewerage facilities, are expected to absorb about £17 million.  The intake of applications during 1978 was double that of the previous year under the old restrictive and totally inadequate schemes.  Last year more than 30,000 grants totalling £12,500,000 were approved and payments came to £6.15 million. The substantial level of grant assistance available for conservation and improvement works continues to stimulate a very high level of interest from house-holders.  This is an encouraging trend from the viewpoint of overall housing policy.  It ensures that the present housing stock, an immense national asset, is maintained and improved and that the standards of habitability, amenity and comfort of our houses are improved.  If the present level of activity in this area continues for another year, we will have more than made up the ground lost due to the niggardly and short-sighted policy pursued by the previous Government in regard to such grants.</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind that substantial <Col N="565" /> increases have been made available with regard to water and sewerage facilities for private housing. The grant has been increased from £125 to £350.  This, combined with the water and sewerage grant, comes to approximately £950, which is almost equivalent to the £1,000 new house grant.  These grants have a useful purpose in that they help to maintain the existing housing stock.  Were it not for the grants at least 5,000 houses would fall into disrepair each year.</P>
    <P>With regard to mortgage finance, if people are to purchase their own homes the availability of such finance is essential and this is a major preoccupation of the Government.  Preliminary statistics indicate that a record amount of mortgage finance was available during 1978.  In the first nine months a total of £160 million was advanced by the major lending agencies as against £123 million in the corresponding period in 1977.  It is estimated that the total for 1978 was in the region of £220 million, or nearly 30 per cent more than in 1977.  Prospects for 1979 appear even brighter.  Building societies continue to provide the bulk of mortgage finance for private housing. The net inflow to the societies is running at an exceptionally high level at present. It is hoped that sufficient mortgage funds will be available from the societies in 1979.</P>
    <P>The importance the Government attach to the local authority house purchase loans scheme is evidenced by the further increase from £7,000 to £9,000 in the maximum loan which came into effect on 1 September 1978. Since the Government took office in July 1977, the loan limit has been doubled and the income limit has been increased by nearly 50 per cent.  These increases have led to a substantial increase in demand for loans.  To meet this increased demand a total of £43.5 million has been provided for house purchase loans in this year's public capital programme. Both loan and income limits are being kept under constant review in accordance with the Government's commitment to assist people who are unable to obtain loans from other lending agencies.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister for <Col N="566" /> Finance announced a further measure designed to improve the supply of mortgage finance.  Trustee saving banks are to be empowered to grant house loans.  These banks operate on the basis of an overall limit on lending by them of 15 per cent of the balances due to depositors.  This limit will still apply but since their aggregate lending has generally been well within the limit there is worth-while scope for the giving of house loans.  This is a very welcome development.  The commercial banks continue to make a valuable contribution in the field of mortgage finance. While the contribution from assurance companies is disappointing, I am confident that the total amount of funds available from all sources will be sufficient in 1979 to meet the needs of the various sectors of the community.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that in 1978 the certificate of reasonable value system achieved price reductions affecting 1,334 houses and the amount involved was almost £1.2 million.  This amount is by far the highest figure of saving in any year since the system was introduced in 1973.  The operation of the system brought even greater benefits to purchasers of grant-type houses than the figure I mentioned might suggest.  It is a legitimate claim that the system has the greatest effect before the builder submits his price for examination.  The price it is intended to charge must be justifiable before it is submitted for scrutiny by my Department.  I am aware that concern has been expressed both inside and outside this House about abuses of the CRV system and I have already told the House that I am aware of certain unsatisfactory aspects.  I should like to reiterate that the forthcoming housing Bill will contain comprehensive provisions to clarify and strengthen the legal position relating to CRVs and to prevent abuses of the system.  That Bill is in the course of preparation and is expected to be circulated shortly.</P>
    <P>The national house building guarantee scheme offers purchasers of new houses a six-year guarantee against any major structural defects.  The scheme was launched in January 1978 and has now completed its first full year of operation. My Department were closely involved in <Col N="567" /> the development of the scheme.  The housing grant inspectorate of the Department provide the essential inspection service for all new houses covered by the scheme.  While the Department have no part in any decisions made by the guarantee company and have no responsibility for the guarantees given, they are represented at all meetings of the board of the company by two officers with observer status.  I regard this scheme as a significant step forward in the area of protection for house purchasers.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I asked the various lending agencies to support the scheme. I was glad to note recently that the major building societies have decided to back the scheme and from January 1980 onwards they will advance loans only for new houses which have the guarantee.  The level of activity in the first year is, perhaps, somewhat disappointing. The number of builders who have been registered is 352.  Cover was extended to a total of 3,781 houses, not all of which have yet been completed. However, it is always difficult to get a voluntary scheme like this off the ground with any degree of speed.  The vetting of the financial and technical competence of builders can be a slow process.  I am confident that the support of the building societies will provide the necessary stimulus and that this year will see a considerable expansion of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Local government affairs in the widest sense have figured prominently in the deliberations of the House since this Government took office.  During last March and April we had a very wide-ranging debate on the Environment Estimate.  All this shows that the services provided under the auspices of the Department of the Environment are crucial to the well-being of individuals and of the national economy as a whole. It is manifest that in making their budgetary decisions the Government have not been found wanting in giving various local services an equitable share of national resources.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some points raised by previous speakers.  Many contributors to this debate have queried our plans and targets.  I would ask the House <Col N="568" /> to contrast the plans and targets of this Government, as set out in the Green Paper and the White Paper, with the non-existence of any plan or target when the Coalition Government were in office. We know where we are going and we have aims and goals which we are determined to achieve.  We have leadership and unity of purpose in this regard&mdash;two vital assets in any party or Government. Let us contrast this situation with that which existed when the Coalition were in office.  They had no plans or targets and had nothing concrete to present to the EEC in support of applications for additional funds and assistance.  They were just doing what they were told to do by the EEC in the absence of plans and targets.  This Government's targets for the economy in 1978 were demanding. Many people thought we aimed too high, but the record is there.  The growth rate was about 7 per cent, a rate which for the second year running was the highest in the EEC.  That figure was almost double the average achieved in the OECD and almost triple the average in the EEC.  This was a remarkable performance by any standard and one of which the community as a whole can be proud.</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind that we had the biggest annual increase in employment in decades.  In this our experience was quite unusual by international standards.  Figures published by the EEC Commission show that unemployment in the Community as a whole rose last year.  In contrast, it fell here and by a much bigger amount than in those other member states where it was also reduced.  The dynamism of the various sectors of the economy was illustrated by the fact that, as the latest figures show, industrial exports were higher by 17 per cent in value last year and agricultural exports by 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>Since the increase in average earnings per worker in 1978 worked out at over 16 per cent and since the average increase in consumer prices was 7.6 per cent, it must be realised that real earnings per head rose by about 8 per cent. These are among the largest rises in the standard of living of the average worker ever recorded here.  We must also bear in mind that, while this rapid growth in <Col N="569" /> nominal and real earnings may have given satisfaction to those who enjoyed it, the inflation rate for 1978 could but for the high growth in incomes have been about 1 per cent lower and we could have achieved even more than the 17,000 net jobs achieved.</P>
    <P>The recent White Paper describes the policies directed towards attaining the Government's employment targets.  The main growth in employment this year is expected to come from the continued expansion of industry and the inflow of new projects through the efforts of the industrial promotion agencies.  The capital resources at the disposal of these agencies this year amount to more than £131 million, which is 38 per cent more than that spent in 1978.  The Government have reorientated their spending programmes so as to increase their contribution to job creation.  The 1979 public capital programme and non-capital Estimates provide for substantial job creation in the public sector and in the building and construction sector. The Government's foremost social priorty will continue to be the creation of employment.  Job creation benefits not only the individuals concerned but their family circle as well.</P>
    <P>For social welfare recipients an integral part of the Government's programme has been to maintain living standards at least in line with the cost of living.  Excessive income increases do not make this task any easier.  They put up the cost of living and, by making industry less competitive, hamper the reduction of the numbers of claimants for unemployment benefits.  I am sure the public at large wish social welfare recipients to continue to share in our growing economic prosperity by a further real improvement in the allowances payable to them.  I was glad that the Minister was in a position to improve substantially the position of social welfare recipients.  As we are aware, there is a general increase of 12 per cent in the weekly rates of short-term social welfare payments.  These payments include unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit and maternity allowances.</P>
    <P>In the social welfare context the Government see old age pensioners and <Col N="570" /> other long-term recipients, including widows, as deserving of special consideration. It must be realised that their capacity for work and their living requirements are very much affected by advancing years.  As a recognition of this I am glad that the Government decided to increase their allowances by 16 per cent.  This will mean a total increase of £4.50 a week in the maximum old age contributory pension for a married couple of pension age who are under 80.  It is worth noting that the additional Exchequer cost of the proposals relating to the increases in social welfare, all of which will become effective from the beginning of April, is more than £40 million in a full year and over £30 million in 1979.  I am sure all taxpayers do not begrudge this transfer of funds to the less well off sections.</P>
    <P>I was glad that the Government were in a position to make further improvements in the position of veterans of the War of Independence.  There are 18,500 veterans still alive.  It was decided that the means test ceiling should be raised by £100 and this will give an automatic increase of that amount.  Over and above that they will receive increases as a result of the annual revision of public service pensions.  It is worth noting the extension of the telephone rental subsidy scheme for veterans and it is also worth noting the doubling of the funeral grants payable in respect of holders of duly awarded service medals.  As most of us are probably aware, prior to this the funeral grants were payable only in cases where deceased veterans were in receipt of special allowances.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's positive policy on decentralisation.  This is something about which we have heard much but about which nothing was done by the National Coalition Government. The previous Fianna Fáil administration successfully decentralised sections of a number of Departments in co-operation with the Departments and the unions concerned.  The policy of decentralisation will have many advantages both for Dublin city and for the provincial towns to which the various decentralised sections of Departments will go.  We must remember that having all the State's Departments in Dublin, their sections <Col N="571" /> and subsections based in Dublin, and a continuous rapid growth in the population of the city give rise to many problems.  It leaves problems in relation to traffic, transportation, housing and many environmental problems.  The policy of decentralisation to which the Government are committed will go a certain distance toward alleviating these problems.  At least it is a policy that will ensure that these problems are not aggravated.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the provincial towns fortunate enough to have the privilege of providing accommodation and houses for the decentralised sections of Departments will benefit considerably. These benefits will work in two ways: the people who will go to take up permanent residence and employment in provincial towns will be happy to do so in the knowledge that the amenities there will be valuable from many points of view.  The quality of life from many points of view may well be better in these towns than where these people live at present.  I am sure they will find educational facilities available. Decentralisation will be a major boost for these towns because it will create additional employment in the building and construction industry sector in the building of office blocks and office accommodation and the provision of nice new homes for the persons concerned.  I am confident that this policy is and will be very popular.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the budget is a good, sound, solid, logical budget based on well-thought-out plans and strategies. A considerable amount of work, thought and time went into it and I believe it will go down as one of the best ever budgets. Its main purpose is to provide a climate for job creation, for getting more people off the unemployment register and providing more jobs for young people for the benefit of the community as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Early in January, as spokesman for my party on industrial relations, I publicly reviewed the Government's record particularly in the field of industrial peace in 1978, a year in which wealth tax was abolished and <Col N="572" /> food subsidies partially abolished.  In my summing up of the situation and of the Government's activities in that year I described the present administration as the most anti-social Government elected since the foundation of the State.  This can be described as a very substantial charge but in my opinion it is well deserved, and convincingly so in regard to budget day when at the conclusion of the Minister's contribution and his outline of the terms of the budget one could repeat the old saying that, again, the rich were getting richer and the poor poorer.</P>
      <P>The budget prompted an editorial comment in one of our local papers, <i>The Tipperary Star</i>, of 17 February headed &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; as follows:</P>
      <P>. . . . but be that as it may we feel it our bounden duty to say that we detected something of a smirk on the Colley countenance as he delivered his budget speech to the nation&mdash;and we were not alone, it transpired. Maybe the Minister just cannot help it, because it was not <i>our</i> first time to observe it.  He gave us the distinct feeling that he felt he was talking to a lot of gullible gombeens.</P>
      <P>It went on to say:</P>
      <P>. . . . However, it takes no great genius to see that the Minister was less than generous to the really needy and however he might try to convince us with figures, sixteen per cent of a pittance still amounts to sweet damn all,</P>
      <P>It concluded with a very significant sentence&mdash;significant by hindsight:</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mr. Colley must know by now that he has little about which to be smug; indeed there is ample evidence to show that he may shortly find the smile is on the other side of his face&mdash;as the saying goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What a prophetic statement.  Watching television last Saturday one could say the smile was on the other side of his face&mdash;indeed the smile was not there at all.  Instead we saw a haggard and distraught Tánaiste announcing at his party's Ard-Fheis the watering down of the 2 per cent levy.  One could see that he was a beaten man, and that he had <Col N="573" /> backed a loser once again.  I am sure Deputy Meaney had a very enjoyable weekend in Ballsbridge, and he deserved it richly.  If he broke into &ldquo;Happy Man&rdquo;, the Cork entry for the Eurovision Song Contest, one could forgive him.  He was happy.  He did something a backbencher could be proud of doing.  He changed the thinking of his party on one aspect of the budget.</P>
    <P>For months we have been having statements from the Tánaiste, and many senior Ministers, urging industrial peace and wage restraint for a very good purpose, a purpose I and my party support wholeheartedly, for the sake of national prosperity and increased employment. The reaction from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was very responsible and supported wholeheartedly the Government's call for restraint.  Following those pleas for restraint, the ICTU submitted a package prior to the budget for consideration by the Cabinet which included a recommendation of a £100 million tax concession for the long-suffering, overloaded PAYE sector.  What did our concerned administration offer them?  A miserable £26 million in relief out of a figure of approximately £600 million collected from them last year.</P>
    <P>In the days after the budget, the reaction from these people in my constituency was severe.  Many of them described the tax reliefs as purely and simply a con job.  I am at a loss to understand how the Government can expect responsibility from workers seething with discontent and bordering on militancy.  Their patience is practically exhausted.  One can appreciate their discontent when one considers that, out of a total of something like £680 million taxation collected last year, PAYE workers contributed 87½ per cent.</P>
    <P>How can the Government expect the unions to control the rank and file in this explosive atmosphere?  After the abolition of food subsidies, promises were made of compensatory allowances in the budget to offset the ever-rising increases in food costs.  Instead of keeping that promise, the Government offered them the insult of a miserable pittance of a net decrease of 3 per cent in their PAYE contribution to the national coffers.</P>
    <P>I say this in all sincerity as an Opposition <Col N="574" /> backbencher.  In the months ahead, if there is an increase in industrial unrest, the Government should not wash their hands of their contribution to the frustration and dissatisfaction in our workforce.  They are guilty of contempt for and indifference to the ever-increasing burden on the PAYE sector. Following the events of the past few days as we await the announcement of a supplementary budget outside this House&mdash;an extraordinary development, very much removed from the normal procedure&mdash;I appeal to the Executive to heed the new call from the ICTU for a drastic improvement in the tax offer.  If not, the Government should be prepared for excessive wage demands and increasing unrest.  The blame must be laid where it should be laid, at the door of the Government.</P>
    <P>Their lack of concern has prompted the other social partner, the FUE, to make a statement.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Friday, 23 February there is a headline: &ldquo;FUE puts three-year plan to raise take-home wages&rdquo;.  A paragraph in the article by the Industrial Correspondent reads:</P>
    <P>The Federation was convinced that a good deal of the pressures for large increases arose because of the amount which was deducted under the PAYE system and from a feeling among employees that they were required to contribute an unduly high proportion of State expenditure.</P>
    <P>That note of alarm and concern from the FUE should be appreciated by the Government.  A new deal is needed urgently for the PAYE sector, not in five years' time, not next year, not by setting up a commission, not by issuing a White Paper, not by setting up a working party, but by direct, prompt and strong action by the Government this year for the sake of harmony and the national well-being, and for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>Other factors in our society have also contributed to this unrest among our workforce.  Some aspects of the Department of Health are of prime concern and importance to working people.  A very high priority is the medical card to the lower paid worker, especially a man with <Col N="575" /> a family on a low income.  I am a member of the health board in my region and I am satisfied from my own knowledge, and from people calling to see me, that there has been a substantial cutback in the number of medical card renewals this year.  People who have already suffered because of the partial abolition of the food subsidies are now suffering further because of the withdrawal of medical services to which they are rightfully entitled.</P>
    <P>Why?  Because the income limits are unrealistically low.  How could anyone, any Minister, or any CEO of a health board state categorically that a husband and wife with an income of £40.55, 5p over the limit, are financially capable of meeting the cost of hospitalisation or doctor's care at home?  How can our caring Minister stand idly by and do nothing to relieve the terrible anxiety of the worker and his wife in a time of sickness or hospitalisation?  Why does the Minister not instruct the CEOs of the health boards to increase considerably the medical card income limits for these unfortunate people who were the greatest sufferers because of the abolition of the food subsidies?  Ashless Wednesday pales into significance compared with the mental stress and strain of a husband or father confronted with substantial hospital or doctor's bills.</P>
    <P>On the Adjournment last evening when a Deputy of my party recommended that in view of the abolition of food subsidies the eligibility limit for medical cards should be raised, he was told by the Minister categorically that he had had discussions yesterday with the chief executive officers and that those CEOs had decided there was no need to increase the income limits.  Surely this constitutes an abrogation of responsibility? Indeed, I might say that the CEOs are as far removed from the realities of life as is the Minister if they consider that a working-class family with four or five children do not need their income limit raised in that respect. If one were to assess the increase occasioned by the abolition of the food subsidy on milk alone it would be found that a weekly milk bill had been raised by up to £2 for that type of family.  That <Col N="576" /> is not taking into account butter, bread, and other essential foods.  Surely the Minister should not leave such a decision to the CEOs?  They have sufficient power already but in a matter of such social content as the income eligibility limit for medical cards, the onus is on the Minister to ensure that persons in that category reap the benefit of the health services to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>On the Health Contributions Bill, 1978, on 13 February 1979, at column 1008 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The higher paid workers&mdash;and I think I am entitled to call anybody earning more than £5,000 a year a higher paid worker&mdash;will not be left unaided as regards these consultant services.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the Minister raised that figure in the same debate to £5,500.  In the current year with health costs and the normal cost of living rising rapidly, I do not accept that a man earning a gross figure of £5,500, irrespective of the number of his dependants, is a highly paid worker.  I absolutely refute the statement that he is a higher paid worker.  I realise he is more highly paid than a man on a gross figure of £3,000 but his income is much too low to exclude him from this much vaunted and trumpeted health scheme the Minister for Health is about to introduce.  Perhaps an explanation is to be found in the fact that, being well-heeled, the Minister is very far removed from the hard facts and realities of life.  Today a gross income in the region of £5,000 to a man with four children, paying mortgage repayments, cannot in any way qualify him as a higher paid worker.  In my opinion, a man in that category is barely existing with the current cost of living.  The attitude of the Congress of Trade Unions to this new health scheme supports my stand.  They maintain that too many people are being excluded to make for success.  As a contribution towards industrial peace&mdash;for which we all wish&mdash;I appeal to the Minister to listen to the reasoned arguments of Congress. I can assure him that the Congress of Trade Unions is just as concerned as are <Col N="577" /> the Government about the maintenance of industrial peace.  I appeal to the Minister to increase the income elegibility limits for medical cards to at least a figure of £8,000 so as to bring persons who require the benefits of the health services within the new scheme.  I appeal to the Taoiseach and to the Minister concerned to have a reappraisal of the situation and to adopt a realistic figure in keeping with present-day costs.</P>
    <P>Another factor which caused me grave concern was the substantial cutback of £5 million in the budget for social welfare.  From my experience as a Deputy and as a councillor, from people coming to me with social welfare problems, I know there is a definite witch-hunt on&mdash;a definite effort being made not alone to save the £5 million cut-back in the budget but to reduce considerably social welfare expenditure in the year ahead.  That I consider to be a very anti-social step on the part of the Government and one being taken at the expense of the worst-off in our society, those people who have been hit already by the abolition of food subsidies.  This attitude of the Government towards social welfare confirms my statement and rightly brands the Government as being anti-social.  It is something which will be of grave concern also to people involved in community care, in voluntary social welfare services because that £5 million was genuinely needed to aid the most underprivileged in our society. It is a crying sin that such saving should have been effected in that area.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of industrial relations in the Department of Health.  I refer to one of the most united demonstrations and marches I have witnessed to this House made by the nurses last November.  This very responsible body of dedicated workers came into this House.  They listened to the speeches of the Minister and of the appropriate Opposition Deputies.  That evening, in a very touching speech, the Minister praised their work and afterwards promised them a Christmas bonus.  Unfortunately, he did not say which Christmas because these people, who are still awaiting the report of a commission, have not received one shilling <Col N="578" /> of this gift which was promised before last Christmas.  In the light of the failure of the Minister to deliver that package, how can this very responsible body of workers look forward to a genuine and concerned report being submitted to the Minister in the very near future?  This treatment shows scant regard for the contribution made by nurses down through the years to the sick people of our society and their continuing concern and work in hospitals and institutions throughout the country. At the same time as this con job is being perpetrated on the nurses, negotiations are going on for a very considerable salary agreement for another body in the health structure&mdash;the consultants.  Having witnessed their muscle some years ago when another health scheme was put before them I am satisfied that they will not be treated by the Minister in the same manner as the nurses were.  We had experience of their capabilities and of their concern for the sick some years ago when another Minister introduced a service.</P>
    <P>When one tries to analyse the reasons for this terrible unrest in the country among working class people one cannot but come to the conclusion that a major contributory factor to the labour unrest, and the large-scale wage demands being made, mainly in the public sector, is that despite assurances given last weekend the cost of living is escalating week by week.  Ask any shopkeeper.  Ask any housewife.  We have mini-budgets now every week and very little response from the Minister responsible.  I refer in particular to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  His silence is stunning.  What a tremendous transformation that is from the years when he was on the Opposition benches here screaming at every penny increase.  Let him not shift the responsibility to his Minister of State.  That will not be acceptable. He is the senior Minister and the buck stops on his desk.</P>
    <P>Another question I am prompted to ask is what has happened to his food basket promises of 1977?  I can well remember the basket and the list.  What has happened?  Ask the housewives.  In the intervening 18 months food prices have risen by a staggering 34 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> One might ask where has the Minister's previous facade of concern for the harassed housewife gone.  His concern is now only a memory.  Indeed in his statement on television last week when he was indicating impending increases in oil prices he said that the Ayatolla of Teheran was the culprit.  Of course, back in 1974 he never heard about Sheik Yamani.  The transformation that has taken place is amazing.  It was all our fault in 1974.  Now it is the fault of the New Government in Teheran; the Ayatolla is responsible.  Might I ask, as the song says, where have all the consumer associations which were so loud in 1974 to 1977 gone?  Again the silence is profound.  I am inclined to draw my own conclusions about the origins and the priorities of these consumer associations. I would also refer to an RTE programme that operated so conscientiously in those days when we had a weekly tirade, viciously anti-Government, seemingly jocose but nevertheless a well-planned conditioning programme to ensure maximum anti-Government sentiment.  It is seldom I look at it of late so benign has it become. The producer of this programme has since been appointed a film censor. Again I am not innocent.  I will not draw any conclusions here; I will leave it to the imagination of the people to decide exactly where we stand on these things.  I say that in all sincerity.  Where has this Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy gone?  What is he doing?  When he was in Opposition he so stoutly condemned every penny increase; he was screaming from the rafters here in Leinster House.</P>
    <P>Another area of social discontent is the question of housing.  Despite the Minister of State, Deputy J. O'Leary's, very rosy picture of housing programmes in 1979, I will also put on record lest people forget that in the years we were in Government 100,000 houses were built.  This is something that has very peculiarly been forgotten.  As a county councillor and as a person very much involved in the housing needs of my area I see the housing directive of August 1978 from the Custom House to county managers as indicating very <Col N="580" /> clearly that very high emphasis is being put on income restraints and income limits.  High priority is now being given to the ominous document on income tax, P60, rather than to the housing needs. The manner in which the terms of this document are being carried out is another abdication by the Government of responsibility for the provision of local authority housing.  This is a stark reality.</P>
    <P>I mentioned previously that the income limit of £5,500 is inadequate. While shrewdly enough the Minister does not lay down rigid financial guidelines in this respect there is an effective restriction embodying a gross income of approximately £4,000.  In other words, in collusion with the county managers, the Minister for the Environment has now created a situation where a worker with a gross income of £4,000 is no longer the responsibility of the local authority.</P>
    <P>I say this because it is emphasised in the directive of June last that a man on that level of income should be able to provide a house for himself.  This is a farcical situation since the applicant would not qualify for a local authority loan. But, even if the income limit were £4,000, the situation would be almost impossible when one realises that the cost of building an average house today is about £15,000 plus about £3,000 for a site&mdash;and these are conservative figures. Even allowing for the £1,000 grant &mdash;and that grant has lost some of its value in the past year&mdash;how can a man who is urgently in need of accommodation be expected to offset the difference between the loan and the cost of the house?  I appeal for more flexibility in this area on the part of the Minister and his agents, the county managers, because without this flexibility many workers and their families will be condemned to living in bad housing conditions. The directive was anti-social.  It was a shrewd move on the part of the Government, because they are making whipping boys of the county managers by advocating restrictive measures and leaving to county managers the implementation of this anti-worker policy. It would appear that the county managers are dovetailing the new directive <Col N="581" /> with the housing loan limits.  If the Government are concerned that there be industrial peace, they must be seen to help the workers in regard to the provision of modern living conditions.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State talked about the number of houses that will be built this year.  I take it he was referring to the private sector, because the directive to which I have referred will have a very restrictive effect on local authority housing. There is little point in appealing to people to provide houses for themselves while costs are increasing at such a pace. It is admitted by those who should know&mdash;and this includes some people in the building industry&mdash;that house building costs have increased in the past 18 months by 35 per cent.  In rural Ireland an average site can cost as much as £5,000.  I appeal to the Government to think again about their housing directive, because if they continue on their present course they will find that in a couple of years, despite what the Minister of State has said, local authority housing programmes will be minimal and, consequently, increasing numbers of families will face a future in bad housing conditions.</P>
    <P>Our record in terms of industrial unrest is very poor.  This is a matter of concern for the ICTU.  Last weekend the Taoiseach referred to excessive wage demands and appealed for restraint in this area, but how can he expect a satisfactory response to his appeal after the Government's cowardly surrender during the week to a very strong lobby? Can such an act be seen to indicate strong Government?  This erosion of the democratic power of a so-called responsible administration must have tremendous repercussions in the PAYE sector. In such circumstances can anyone blame the Post Office workers for extending their strike into next week?  The surrender to the farmers can only have the effect of escalating unrest among the workers and will substantially increase these excessive wage demands.  The blame lies with the Government.  I must emphasise that, because I believe that if things go wrong in later months the trade union movement may be blamed <Col N="582" /> and made the scapegoats of the situation.</P>
    <P>I should like to know why the Government climbed down.  I wonder if they were thinking of a certain date in June.  It appears to me that this was the guiding influence because they want to win those elections at all costs.  In the light of the Government's action I should like to know how we can be asked to respect the provisions of any future Finance Bill particularly when one has regard to the fact that it was in a matter of weeks of the budget being introduced that the Government yielded to sectional pressure and climbed down on one of their proposals.  Strong Government means making realistic, fair and equitable recommendations and decisions for implementation in a budget and then carrying out those measures in spite of all pressure.  One can respect such a Government but how can our people, in the light of the events of the past week, consider that they have a logical and courageous administration?</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government in this regard may have serious repercussions on labour relations in the months ahead.  I do not want to be pessimistic, but I must express a fear for the future. A terrible blunder was made by the Government in introducing the levy in the first place and, having adopted it, withdrawing it.  It seems to me that we have a Government outside of Leinster House rather than within it.  That trend must be stopped.  If the Government and the House are to retain the respect of the people government must be seen to emanate from Leinster House and not from Portlaoise, Ballybrittas or Liberty Hall.</P>
    <P>The members who constitute the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are reasonable people concerned for the employment and job creation programmes outlined by the Government. Congress has submitted further recommendations to the Government to ensure that every possible means are taken to create the maximum number of jobs in the years ahead.  The Government and semi-State bodies face a tremendous challenge, because in spite of the fact that there were 30,000 job approvals last year we still have something in the <Col N="583" /> region of 103,000 people on the unemployment register.  Unfortunately, we had 13,000 job losses last year in spite of all of the efforts of the agencies concerned with the job creation programmes.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that serious inroads are being made into our traditional industries, particularly those based on natural resources.  Many of those industries are experiencing serious difficulties. I am aware that the meat factory in Roscrea is experiencing great difficulties and that three weeks ago 200 men were laid off.  From the information I have received I believe that unless the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and Commissioner Gundelach, that infamous person in Brussels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I withdraw it and let the people draw their own conclusions. Unless steps are taken by the gentlemen I have mentioned the meat processing industry here, which is now tottering, will fall to the ground with the loss of thousands of jobs.  If the meat processing industry goes to the wall the thousands of people who have been employed in it for upwards of 30 years will be unemployable. Every effort must be made to ensure that the industry is revived and put back on a winning trail.  Otherwise, a town in my constituency will suffer serious repercussions which will affect the workers and the commercial life of the area.</P>
      <P>In the planning and development of our economy as we enter the eighties it is essential that we have a united front to achieve the goals of full employment and improved living conditions for our people. We are a small country and we can ill-afford divisions, rancour or distrust between any sections of our people.  Let the terrible blundering and mishandling by the Government in the past few weeks be a lesson to all that our people must be treated equally.</P>

      <P>It is not surprising that a budget should stir up controversy and this year's budget is no exception.  We have all heard the many serious allegations made following the introduction of the budget.  Unfortunately, the most misleading statement of all came from the Leader of the Fine Gael Party.  The fact that he is leader of the main Opposition party and a man with a reputation in economics means that his words are very important for his party and, to a lesser extent, to the ordinary man in the street.  Deputy FitzGerald accused the Government of using fraudulent figures which were grossly distorted and falsified.  We all know that figures and statistics can be used to back up any argument and that the same set of figures and statistics can be used to strengthen an argument from the opposite point of view.  Playing around with figures and statistics is becoming an annual event here.  I am not saying that all Members indulge in this annually, but this year Deputy FitzGerald is playing a different sort of game when he accused the Government of presenting for debate a falsified set of figures and implied that there was an intention by the Government to deceive the House and the people.</P>
      <P>Last year Deputy FitzGerald and other Opposition Deputies poured scorn on the Government for their plans, predictions and figures, but they have been proved wrong.  The figures we put before this House in last year's budget in regard to the state of the economy and where we were going have been fully implemented through Fianna Fáil's policies.  Those figures were mainly on target and they were severely honest and correct.  The scoffing and blustering about last year's budget by the Opposition has singularly failed them and has not fooled even themselves.  Is this the reason why they cry out that this year's figures are not true?  We should debate the figures fairly and ignore the cry of &ldquo;foul&rdquo; before the debate has even started.  &ldquo;Foul&rdquo; has been cried by the Opposition before this debate even got off the ground and the same cry was heard during the debate on last year's and other budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> In the past Fianna Fáil have proved to be the party of reality.  They proved that in 1979.  I am convinced that in the coming year it will be proved yet again.  We must all admit that last year's budget raised the morale of the country.  People see the real benefits from last year's budget all around them.  The results of Fianna Fáil's policies are positive and expansive.</P>
    <P>In the present circumstances this year's budget continues the tradition of being expansive and realistic.  We have emphasised that our primary economic aim is to create new jobs and this budget is highly geared towards meeting this objective. It is aimed at contributing towards a worthy and realistic target of cutting the number of unemployed by 25,000 this year.  Nobody who has the interests of the people at heart can quibble with this primary aim.  Everyone must agree with it&mdash;young people, unemployed, employed, those working on farms, people in towns and cities and even retired people.  Opposition Deputies must also agree with this aim.</P>
    <P>Last year the Opposition said we would not lower the unemployment figure but we did.  This year they shout we will not succeed, but I can guarantee that we will and the majority of the people know that too because they have seen and felt the results of our efforts in job creation since June 1977.</P>
    <P>This budget provides for a total additional expenditure of £20 million on job creation.  What I like most about the details, backed by detailed honestly planned figures of how job creation can be achieved, are the funds to be expended and the emphasis on jobs for the young.  The extra £5.2 million for job creation in the environment, the work experience programme costing £3 million, the increase in the number of AnCO training places to 6,370 and on top of all that, the additional expenditure of £3.2 million will add another 1,000 to the increased number of young people coming into employment this year.</P>
    <P>No Opposition worthy of its salt and with the welfare of the country at heart can condemn this budget which has the primary aim of creating 25,000 extra <Col N="586" /> jobs this year.  We have so-called experts across the House who say our job-creation target is unrealistic and cannot be achieved, but they said the same last year about our aims and targets and also before and after the last general election. Yet Fianna Fáil in Government have proved all the Coalition's pessimistic predictions wrong.  People see the country is moving ahead rapidly and that Fianna Fáil's good, careful and realistic budget plans are succeeding in the main, irrespective of the what the Opposition say.  I am confident the people are aware of the targets and of the economic conditions Fianna Fáil have achieved in the short space of 20 months.</P>
    <P>In this budget the Minister for Finance looks after the Government's housekeeping in a very diligent manner. He has said that we must reduce our borrowing requirements and provide for extra pay and jobs in the public sector. He has met these objectives adequately in the budget.  Up to now the Government's strategy was to get the economy going at maximum capacity and as quickly as possible.  This required maximum investment.  The growth rate of the economy has speeded up and is maintaining, and will maintain, its forward momentum.</P>
    <P>This budget sees to it that there is still a steady rate of financial input into the economy to ensure a further steady and increasing growth rate. Besides meeting a current budget costing £2,675 million, the Minister sees to it, through borrowing at 10½ per cent of national output, that the economy is driving forward continuously, that the country maintains its standard of living and that the Government's plan for the creation of 25,000 new jobs is fully realised.  The aim of Fianna Fáil to achieve full employment by 1981 is very ambitious but I am convinced that the target will be reached.  Fianna Fáil have made great strides during the past 18 months.  In County Offaly, 1,300 industrial jobs have been created in that time.  I have not the figures showing how industrial development fared under the National Coalition, but I know there was no increase whatsoever in industrial development <Col N="587" /> in County Offaly during their period of office.</P>
    <P>It is customary that a budget brings howls of horror from some sections and we have heard some of these howls already.  The loudest and least sincere howls have come from the Opposition parties.  No budget can earn the applause of all.  Such a budget could be fairly described as a &ldquo;hand-out&rdquo; budget.  A Government cannot give if they do not have the wherewithal.  By careful planning and good housekeeping this Government have much to give.  They seek to ensure that those most in need get most and all get enough to maintain standards. They also seek to ensure a greater degree of equity and this is highlighted in many aspects of the budget.  Some of the loudest howls of horror have come from those in secure employment and this should not be so.  We are giving large social welfare increases and the tax concessions are channelled specifically towards the lower paid.  This is the justice drive of the budget.  Every sector of the community and every partner in the economy should see justice being done and recognise it.  The budget is very realistic and I would hope to hear fewer cries of dissent from any section of the community.</P>
    <P>A feature of the budget which deserves special mention is that children's allowances are increased on a selective basis.  When there is built into the administration of children's allowances the method of clawback, aid is provided for less well-off families without the embarrassment of a means test.  This is an aspect of the budget with which I am in total agreement.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that there had been serious allegations and bizarre statements about the budget from the Opposition.  I dealt briefly with the serious allegation made by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party.  The same Deputy was quoted in the press a couple of weeks ago as saying that this was a &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo; budget.  It seems he discovered that there was a 15 per cent fall off in marriages in the Republic between 1973 and 1978.  The income tax changes in the budget fully recognise the greater responsibility of the married.  For instance, <Col N="588" /> the single person's personal allowance of £865 has been raised to £1,115, while the married person's allowance has been raised from £1,730 to £2,230.  The tax liability of a single person earning £3,500 is reduced by 3 per cent to £724.75, while a married couple without children earning the same amount have their tax liability reduced by 24 per cent to £334.50.  A married couple with two children earning £3,500 have their tax liability reduced by 29.9 per cent to £89.  How can anyone say that there has been discrimination against marriage in this budget?  The opposite is true.  Deputy FitzGerald has been reprimanded by a leading sociologist concerning that statement. Such brash assumptions and statements are made because the Deputy is helpless in his search to find fault with the overall strategy of the Government. He makes those ridiculous statements because he has no real opposition to what Fianna Fáil are doing.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the intention of the Government to reduce unemployment by 25,000 this year.  Their concentration on job training and job creation must have the approval of all right thinking and justice loving people.  I also mentioned the need for equity in the distribution of the burden of providing the wherewithal for spending on the economy.  The national housekeeping bill has to be met by fair contributions from all sections of the community.  I am delighted that the farming organisations and the Minister have agreed to investigate thoroughly ways and means of formulating income tax proposals for the farming community.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking to many farmers, particularly during the last few months, and most of them who were in the tax net even prior to this budget are willing to pay their fair share.  This is a time for stating one's case in a very rational manner and not in a self-interested way.  The farming community fully realise this.  They are making their case for the well-being of the country as a whole.  Those farmers whose incomes allow them to pay tax will do so but Fianna Fáil will ensure that the taxing of farmers will not swing too far and so <Col N="589" /> diminish the wealth-producing capacity of this export-intensive sector.  It would be industrial and financial suicide to do this and I am sure that under a Fianna Fáil Government it will not happen.</P>
    <P>There are those in other sectors who unreasonably say that the taxation of farmers is not sufficient.  It must not be forgotten that not long ago farmers struggled through long, lean years.  They work a seven-day week for 52 weeks of the year.  Even with the thresholds reduced in the budget to £50 valuation, we are still talking in terms of 22 per cent to 25 per cent of the total farming community.  The percentage figure of farmers under £50 valuation is in the region of 75 per cent of the total farming community.  The percentage of farmers who would be in a position to pay tax is in the region of 20 per cent to 25 per cent.  The most fair way to extract money from that section of the farming community is by way of income tax.  The farming organisations are aware of this and they are anxious to contribute their fair share to the economy by way of income tax.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the budget in imposing taxes and in relieving the tax burden on some is to help the weaker sections, to maintain our standard of living and to offer incentives to increase productivity. The PAYE sector has always borne an exceptionally heavy share of taxation and the people concerned must welcome the income tax concessions in the budget.  The income tax-free allowance for a single person has almost doubled in the past 18 months, as has the tax-free allowance for a married couple.  I am sure the PAYE people are aware of the improvements granted to them in the two budgets since Fianna Fáil came to office in 1977.</P>
    <P>The function of the Government is to mediate between all the interested groups in the economy and this job was ably outlined by the Minister for Finance.  Every group must be prepared generally to accommodate themselves for the sake of the national interest as outlined by the Government.  No group or individual should seek only the benefits of tax reduction and none of the <Col N="590" /> sacrifices attendant on taxation.  If each sector looked at it from this point of view we would not hear so many cries of anger with regard to taxation in general that normally come after a budget. There should not be a rift or competition between farming and other industries. For the country to succeed there is no room for envy or jealousy on the part of any group.  All sectors of the community need each other.  In particular the PAYE sector needs the growth of the farming industry but, equally, the PAYE sector is important for the agricultural community because they purchase farm produce.</P>
    <P>The farming organisations now have agreed to pay their fair share of taxation and in view of the fact that single and married people have been given increased income tax allowances the rift that seems to have developed between the farming and non-farming community should not continue.  In a small country like this we should not talk about a rift between any sections.  There must be co-operation from all sides if we are to achieve the aims of this Government. The majority of the people supported the aims of the Government.  A little more co-operation should be forthcoming from the other side of the House.  We should all do our best to ensure that jobs are created for 25,000 people before another budget is presented to us.  Every section will have to make some sacrifice in order to obtain full employment and a better standard of living for all.</P>
    <P>We come to the all-important matter of income restraint, which is necessary if we are to increase employment.  The budget does not ask anybody to accept less.  The real rise in income asked for this year is 4 per cent.  This means a real increase in living standards generally. What is the use of any individual getting an increase of 20 per cent or 30 per cent if there is no real increase?</P>
    <P>The Government are asking that people co-operate with them.  Will people accept that 4 per cent is a real increase and is enough for one year?  Is the Government's appeal for wage restraint not enough to get the support of the masses so that living standards can be maintained and developed?  The outlandish increases being demanded by sections of <Col N="591" /> the community are disgraceful.  These people should pull themselves together and decide to work in the interests of the country and of the future generations. To provide the required number of jobs in one year requires a little sacrifice from the sections who can bear it and that is all the Government have requested in this budget.  By comparison with the economies of other countries our economy is in a satisfactory condition. Our economy is healthy particularly when compared with the economy of the UK where too many people are unrealistically looking for too much too quickly.</P>
    <P>To sustain our present economic growth we need more productivity and realistic increases.  This is what the Government are requesting and if their request is acceded to 1979 will be remembered in Irish economics as the creative year, as the year when the youth and the jobless were drawn into the employment force in growing numbers. We have a greater opportunity this year than many other nations to cope, because of our proportionately young population, which is the largest in Europe.  Because of our large young population an extraordinary effort is needed to provide jobs for them here. That is the ambition and the ideal of Fianna Fáil and with a little effort this target can be achieved.  If we grasp this chance and make a united and concentrated effort, while evenly distributing the necessary sacrifice we will enter into the eighties with a healthy economy geared for further progress.  If our targets are achieved the next generation will be grateful and will thank us.  We must all exercise some discipline.  The budget indicates by its logic that better times are ahead if we exercise discipline. We are asked not to take less, but not to be dissatisfied because we cannot take an inordinate amount.  That is a realistic appeal which I am confident the people will support.</P>
    <P>On our entry into the EMS this type of discipline will be needed if we are to obtain the maximum benefit.  Incomes restraint will make our economic prospects more secure and more lasting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> Many of us who have visited other European countries are aware of the hard work and the positive aims of those people in regard to industry.  If we pull up our socks and exercise a little more discipline we too can improve our position greatly.  I feel confident that the workers in general will make the extra effort to follow the guidelines set down by the Government for achieving our aims.  The Government have asked for only a bearable sacrifice by employers and employees and have given an assurance of a steady real increase in living standards and above all they have given incentives for greater productivity and more jobs.</P>
    <P>The budget has divided the national cake, let each section take their share and get down to the important task of increasing output to generate wealth, thus securing a better economic future.</P>
    <P>The industrial situation in my county of Offaly improved within the past 20 months through this year's budget and last year's budget.  For instance, our county hospital is to get an extension of a 40-bed unit.  That has become possible because of economic growth.  The extension will cost in the region of £.5 million. About £.5 million has already been spent on that hospital since Fianna Fáil returned to office so the total to be spent will be £1 million.</P>
    <P>In relation to social welfare this budget illustrates the policy of successive Fianna Fáil Governments in ensuring that the needy sections are well looked after.  The increases in social welfare allowances are in the region of 12 to 14 per cent.  This is a significant rise.  The increase granted in the last two budgets to social welfare recipients were higher than those granted by the National Coalition in four-and-a-half years.</P>

      <P>On 31 December 1978 there were 58,343 national school and pre-school children awaiting routine dental treatment and 10,159 awaiting orthodontic treatment.

      <P>Under the free electricity allowance scheme a person must be registered with the Electricity Supply Board as a consumer of electricity on the general domestic two-part tariff in order to qualify for an allowance. Persons in the situation described by the Deputy are not so registered and are, therefore, not entitled to the allowance under the scheme as it stands.  The situation of persons in this category is a difficult one to deal with and a solution to their problem is not easy.  I am having the position examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The means of the person concerned were assessed by a deciding officer under the provision of the Unemployment Assistance Acts. The assessment was in respect of the benefit of board and lodgings being afforded to the applicant on her sister's farm and was calculated by reference to the estimated net annual income of the farm and the position occupied by the applicant in the household.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned lives in County Meath but the postal address is County Louth.  Would the Minister agree that a girl who lives with her farming family, has to go to work and works for 18 years and is then declared redundant, and drew unemployment benefit for the relevant period, is entitled to unemployment assistance?

      <P>Would the Minister try to explain to the House and to me how they could allocate income of £18 to somebody who lives with other members of her family who have been working a small farm for many years?  How could <Col N="600" /> it be decided that she is now getting benefit of £18 from the farm, although all along she has paid a share for her keep in this house as if she was living in another house?

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if any new instructions as to any person's eligibility for unemployment benefit or assistance were issued by his Department to the employment exchanges in 1978; and, if so, if he will give details of the changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of instructions affecting eligibility of persons receiving unemployment benefit or assistance were issued to employment exchanges during 1978.</P>
      <P>Some of the instructions concerned the implementation of the changes to entitlement introduced in the budget and provided for by the Social Welfare Act, 1978.  Among these changes were improvements in rates of payments and the removal of the special conditions in the unemployment assistance scheme which applied to single women and widows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other instructions which affected entitlement related to the updating of the <Col N="606" /> oldest means assessments of unemployment assistance recipients and changes in the Social Welfare (Normal Residence) Regulations and in the procedures dealing with the claims of certain unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the Social Welfare (Normal Residence) Regulations enabled an increase of unemployment benefit or assistance to be paid in certain circumstances to a child's father even though the child may not be residing with him.  This remedied a deficiency in the regulations which had been causing hardship in certain cases involving broken families.</P>
    <P>An administrative change was introduced to allow unemployed persons to claim unemployment benefit or assistance while awaiting the results of a disability benefit appeal.  Formerly persons whose claims for disability benefit had been disallowed and who continued to send in medical certificates while pursuing their claim for disability benefit on appeal were disbarred from claiming unemployment benefit or assistance. In the event of losing their appeal they suffered the loss of both benefits.  The present arrangement remedies this situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Pre-1953 contributions are reckonable for the purpose of determining whether a person claiming retirement or old age contributory pension has entered insurance before the prescribed age, or whether he has paid at least 156 contributions since entry into insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are not taken into account for the purpose of the condition which requires a claimant to have had a minimum yearly average of paid or credited contributions.  This average is <Col N="610" /> calculated over the period from 1953 or from the date of the person's entry into insurance if this is later.</P>
    <P>The present unified social insurance scheme came into operation in January 1953.  Pre-1953 contributions did not contain any element in respect of the pensions in question.  The treatment of such contributions in the manner outlined cannot, therefore, be regarded as an inequity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that there is a relatively small number of people in this category.  The Minister will appreciate also that they feel aggrieved because, in some cases, they paid contributions for many years up to 1953.  Subsequently they went out of the insurable area when there was an income limit. In the last few years they have been paying insurance contributions again but find now that all of their former contributions, in some cases up to 20 years' contributions, paid before 1953 are being disregarded.  Because of the period when they were out of insurance between 1973 and 1974 they have not got the annual average necessary.

      <P>The Industrial Development Authority, in consultation with the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department, are engaged in a comprehensive study of the timber processing industry.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the Chair's attention to the fact that these so-called amplifiers or speakers up here might as well not be in position.  I have done this several times and I am drawing the Chair's attention to it again but nothing has been done.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, might I ask the Minister whether, in the interim between now and whatever time in the long distance future it may be, anything might be done to utilise the ever-increasing amounts of forest products in the north-west?  Would the Minister at least look into the possibility of getting the IDA to grant-aid small processing plants to utilise some of the surplus rather than have it exported raw, treated and then reimported into this side of the Border as is now the case?</P>

      <P>I want to emphasise again that this is not a matter which will be a long distance into the future.  The study is practically completed and particular attention has been paid to the north-west in that study.  I am aware, as the Deputy says, that we have this exportation of raw timber to firms across <Col N="613" /> the Border, and it is desirable that there should be an expansion of timber processing facilities generally in the north-west.  I will certainly pursue that matter actively.</P>

Even though it would be a very small processing that would be in question, nevertheless it would be getting somewhere rather than just leaving it scattered and exported raw.</P>

Is he also aware that two years ago there were 156 people working there and that this week there are 114?  When he took up office in 1977, did the Minister not guarantee <Col N="615" /> publicly in Killybegs that there would be no redundancies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is an overmanning problem in Killybegs.  We must run our boatyards reasonably efficiently.  There is no point in losing substantial moneys on them.  Negotiations are taking place with the trade unions concerned on that aspect.  At present there are five fishermen from Killybegs with Bord Iascaigh Mhara negotiating the purchase of five 150 ft. boats to go right out to the 200-mile limit to deal with new forms of fishing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <P>The development of a particular harbour for commercial shipping is primarily the responsibility of the individual harbour authority which is statutorily established for this purpose and which from time to time may prepare development plans for its particular circumstances.  Such development proposals generally require authorisation by my Department, for example, in the form of a harbours works order, as well as approval for borrowing or other means of financing the project.  As far as <Col N="625" /> harbours in the south-west are concerned the only specific development proposal of which I am aware is a proposal by Tralee and Fenit Pier and Harbour Commissioners to carry out additional dredging of the commercial berths at Fenit to improve facilities for larger vessels.</P>
      <P>The promotion of sailing and boating facilities is a matter for Bord Fáilte Éireann in conjunction with local interests.</P>

      <P>At their meeting on 20 February 1979 the EEC Council of Transport Ministers considered a proposal for a Council Decision rendering mandatory the procedures for the inspection of ships forming the subject of resolutions of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation. The effect of the decision would have been to harmonise within the Community by 1 January and 1 July, 1980 respectively:</P>
      <P>(a) procedures for the control of ships to ensure that they comply with prescribed safety standards and</P>
      <P>(b) procedures for the control of discharges under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954 (as amended in 1962 and 1969).</P>
      <P>Newspaper reports that Ireland had entered a reservation with regard to the adoption of the decision were incorrect. On the contrary Ireland welcomed the proposed decision when it was introduced and gave full support to its adoption at the Council meeting.  It was not possible to adopt the decision because the United Kingdom delegation, while not opposing the merits of the proposals, had problems in regard to the implications of extending competence to the Community in regard to technical matters arising in international bodies such as the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to Private Notice Questions on this subject on 20 February.  It remains the case that the <Col N="627" /> Department are ready to resume conciliation negotiations under agreed procedures on the claims for increased pay for staff represented by the Post Office Workers' Union.  Moreover, I have made it clear that, if the union wish to refer the claims to independent arbitration, the Department will facilitate the union in every way possible in having them dealt with quickly.  I have also undertaken on behalf of the Government to accept the finds of the arbitrator.</P>
      <P>I greatly regret that the campaign of industrial action, with its attendant difficulties for industry and for the public, has continued.  The action is in breach of the national agreement and the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the civil service, to both of which the union is a party.  I would again stress that the Government are anxious that the pay claims should be settled on an equitable basis but are also concerned that any settlement should not have the effect of imposing unjustified costs on Post Office users and should not endanger the continued use of orderly means of resolving pay claims in the civil service.</P>
      <P>I would again urge the union and the staff to cease their action and to pursue their claims in accordance with the procedures which the union themselves have agreed should be used to resolve such issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the gravity of the situation and I do not regard my reply as unsatisfactory.  The Deputy is aware that there are two key factors involved.  The first is that the union <Col N="628" /> are in breach of the conciliation and arbitration scheme and the national pay agreement.  The union are party to both agreements.  The second point is that the procedures available to the union for pursuing the claim have not been exhausted. As I stated previously, the Department did not break off negotiations and are prepared to resume discussions under the procedures of conciliation and arbitration.  That is a fair offer. Immediately the union end industrial action, we can have discussions at conciliation, or the union can go to arbitration, or adopt any of the procedures under the national pay agreement which are available.</P>

I do not intend going into those in detail.  I should like to make it clear that neither the Government nor the Department wish that the Post Office staff should be under-paid.  However, it must be accepted that it is not sufficient for the union to put forward a claim.  The union must show that such a claim is justified to the extent claimed.</P>

I should like to make it clear that I am most anxious to be fair to the workers in my Department.

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. J. Flanagan Mr. O. J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few comments to make on this budget, if it can be described as a budget.  I have been a Member of this House for many years and have had experience of at least 36 budgets.  This budget is the nearest to a conspiracy I have seen in my long membership of this House.  It was put together in extremely great haste and in an atmosphere of disappointment because the original calculation included generous contributions from the EMS. Because the EMS backfired, the subcommittees of the Government dealing with the budget had to meet in great haste.</P>
      <P>Many people may feel that the responsibility for such a disastrous budget, which has backfired on at least three occasions since it was introduced, is the sole responsibility of the Minister for Finance; but the real facts are that it is the brainchild of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. He made the recommendations very strongly and forcefully which were accepted by the majority of the Government and included in the speech made by the Minister for Finance.  Whether Deputies agree or not, the position was that the wild cat and harebrained schemes of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development were put to the country in the form of a budget.  He has not spoken very loudly, if at all, since the budget was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make special reference to the fact that in this budget there is no ray of hope for the unemployed.  There are no prospects or plans for the solving of our unemployment problem.  At this moment there are over 103,000 registered unemployed and there are at <Col N="662" /> least 8,000 unregistered unemployed. There is also the constant dribble of emigration which restarted a little over 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>During the last general election and as part of their election manifesto, this Government pledged themselves to create a sufficient number of jobs not alone for school leavers but enough to end the unemployment problem.  Young people were promised faithfully that £20 million would be set aside for a job creation programme.  They now find they have been betrayed very badly.  Instead of a £20 million job creation programme, a sum of £5 million is being set aside, and that is neither here nor there in an ambitious job creation programme.</P>
    <P>I usually take cuttings from a variety of newspapers.  The <i>Irish Independent</i>, 14 January 1979, on page one, had the heading in heavy print &ldquo;Dig holes if necessary&rdquo;.  The report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Dr. Martin O'Donoghue, said yesterday the Government had to provide jobs directly out of public funds even if it meant digging holes in the roads and filling them up again.</P>
    <P>These are the job prospects which that Minister held out for our young people, many of whom have five honours in the leaving certificate, many with group certificates from the vocational schools and many with an extremely high standard of education.  These young people are in search of work and the best they can expect, out of public funds, which that Minister failed to provide in this budget, is that he will provide work for them digging holes in the roads and filling them in again.  There is nothing in this budget to indicate that even a limited number of people will be employed filling in the holes in the roads which already exist.</P>
    <P>The most vital and urgent task facing the Government is job creation.  Unless there is a vast surge in economic activity throughout the world there is no way this Government will be able to deliver on their promise not alone to provide jobs but to cut down unemployment to a figure of 100,000 and that does not include the vast number of school leavers who will join the unemployment register at <Col N="663" /> the end of next June.  The unemployed of today are unlike the unemployed of 25 or 30 years.  Today they are highly trained, well educated and skilled and I can see no prospect for the highly educated young boy or girl who is coming on the employment market.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the promises of Fianna Fáil were the most blatant piece of electioneering.  It must have been obvious to those who were present at the birth of the manifesto that the undertaking could not be put into effect and it was merely a means of hoodwinking the electorate.  During the 1977 campaign Fianna Fáil got great pleasure from waving the manifesto and promising to provide work for every unemployed person.  The latest unemployment figures show that the Government are not even reaching a reasonable target in dealing with this problem.  The promise of jobs is now seen by the public, the unemployed, those who have had to emigrate and our young people as mere voting catching.  I prophesy that an undertaking of that kind will not be easily forgotten.</P>
    <P>During the budget debate we discuss general taxation and a number of social issues.  There is nothing in this budget which gives any practical help to over 100,000 white collar workers.  The rise in the cost of living is making it more difficult for people to make ends meet.  There is no point in economists simply exchanging views on this matter. I remember many years ago the late Deputy Seán Lemass expressing the hope that God would deliver us from the academics.  He hoped this House would never be fully controlled by academics and put special emphasis on the views of ordinary men and women.  Academics can deal with figures, schemes and plans for as long as they like, but the fact is that there are almost 6.5 million people unemployed in the EEC.</P>
    <P>The first change in the living standards in this country occurred not when we joined the EEC but on the change of currency.  Our entry into the EEC, whether good or bad, must be accepted as the clear wish of the vast majority of the people, but it meant that food prices rose steadily and are continuing to rise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> During the next few years they are likely to continue rising substantially.  Parents of four school-going children need an income of at least £150 per week.  This would allow them only £15 per week for food alone.  People no longer can afford butter and meat and nobody can afford meat for the principal meal every day. There are some parts of rural Ireland in which meat is never purchased.  The price of these commodities has become prohibitive.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition left office the economy was in a good state, employment figures were up, inflation was reduced and the balance of payments was sound.  That position has been steadily reversing since 1977.  Current spending by the Government represents 37.5 per cent of GNP and they are borrowing £16 per week for every person employed.  Anybody who reads the budget speech knows that it is unreal and unsound and must wonder if it shows a high degree of insanity.  This irresponsible budget has seriously damaged the chances of a moderate wage agreement.  The Taoiseach and others who have spoken here today have asked working people not to make excessive wage demands and not to make things more difficult for the economy. Let us remember this is the Government who would not tax the wealthy and abolished the wealth tax.</P>
    <P>An effort was made to rake in money. The Government asked the workers to be moderate in their pay demands and they decided to abolish the farmers' dole. In my constituency, particularly in the mountainous areas, the dole was put to very good use.  There may have been abuses of the system but there have been abuses in many areas.  In the main, small farmers have been helped and the dole has been used to subsidise their livelihood.  I do not understand how in ordinary Christian justice the Government can take that aid away from people living on poor quality holdings and, at the same time, abolish the wealth tax. Many wealthy people are earning £4,000 or £5,000 per week.  If a person describes himself as a cultural worker, if he is a dramatist, or a composer of Curley Wee, Gussie Goose, Mickey Mouse and so on, he is entitled to tax-free <Col N="665" /> allowances and all the privileges available.  I am not saying that is wrong. More power to anybody who can get away with it.  I wish the cultural workers well.  I salute anybody who can obtain tax-free allowances on an income of £4,000 or £5,000 per week but is it right?  More than 100,000 white collar PAYE workers have automatically deducted from their pay substantial and unfair amounts by way of income tax. Tax is not deducted from the favoured class and, at the same time, the wealth tax has been abolished.</P>
    <P>Nothing in this budget gives the slightest relief to the PAYE taxpayer but before the concluding Stages of the Finance Bill perhaps the Government may see fit to review the whole situation in relation to PAYE.  There has been a lot of secrecy attached to the budget.  It has been changed several times since it was introduced.  Grave contempt has been shown to Parliament.  This is where I rebel occasionally.  When important announcements are to be made, particularly in relation to major issues of policy and the financial structure, this is the place in which such pronouncements should be made.  Parliament is being ignored and side-stepped.  We are now reaching the stage where the dignity and status of Parliament is being reduced to that of a poor quality county council. I do not know why Ministers do not utilise Parliament to make statements and pronouncements.</P>
    <P>Yesterday what took place between the farming organisations and the Government was privately debated behind closed doors with the Fianna Fáil Party.  A group of Fianna Fáil Deputies were given the full facts of the deliberations while Parliament was ignored and the information was not put on the record of this House.  Political democracy, as we know it, is dying a quick death in this country.  We cannot expect people outside this House to have respect for Parliament when those of us who are responsible for the proper functioning of Parliament are refusing to acknowledge its existence.  It was wrong and disrespectful to Parliament that any group should be informed about major financial issues before this House was informed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> Everyone knows that the 2 per cent levy on agricultural sales was a new form of tax.  It had a separate and completely independent identity from farmers' income tax.  I do not know of any farmer in my constituency who objects to the paying of income tax, provided he has the income.  The Government drafted the budget in panic and in haste.  In order to make up for the millions of pounds that did not come from the EMS they had to fill the gap. They had to choose blindly.  They decided to impose on farmers a 2 per cent levy by way of sales tax.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that the imposition of a levy on agricultural produce will drive the economy back towards where it was during the war years.  I have never before heard of a Minister for Finance introducing a budget with provision for a 2 per cent levy on the people who produce the livestock and the crops&mdash;the people who have worked from sunrise to nightfall, as they have done in recent years.  If Fianna Fáil thought they would get away with it they are more daft than I ever thought them in my wildest dreams.  I sincerely congratulate the farming organisations on their unity in standing up against this injustice. I am glad that the Government have seen fit to act in a responsible manner so as not to drive Irish agriculture back to where it was in the forties.  The coming generations of farmers will be forever grateful to the farm leaders, not for the sake of the 2 per cent but because they stood up on a matter of principle. The imposition of this levy would have been wrong and Fianna Fáil have been taught an expensive lesson in that regard.</P>
    <P>Now that we have heard the end of the 2 per cent levy I am enthusiastic to know what the Government have in mind to deal with the present unhealthy state of industrial relations.  The telephone services are almost at a standstill. There is a serious postal strike, which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs does not appear to be taking seriously.  We may be faced with an ESB strike or a further transport strike and we will almost certainly be faced with trade union demands.  They feel that <Col N="667" /> their turn has come to stand up and demand fair play for their members.  Why are there so many unofficial strikes? Unofficial strikes should never be encouraged, but the high incidence of them shows the impatience of the rank and file workers.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement is too slow in dealing with the serious problems. Workers, particularly those with families, cannot exist and pay for light, firing, for a house mortgage and so on at present.  The trade union movement has a duty towards its members, a duty which the continental trade unions are fulfilling.  It is about time the trade union movement told the Government to take a running jump at themselves when they talk about moderate wage demands.  I would not ask any worker or trade union to be moderate in pay demands.  I cannot see how any responsible trade union acting effectively and efficiently can do so in the light of the Government's abolition of wealth tax and in the light of the Government allowing concessions to well-off people.</P>
    <P>In relation to taxation, a minimum guarantee of indexation of income tax allowances, coupled with a commitment to increase the real value of these allowances, is desirable.  No such guarantee has been forthcoming.  More effective measures should be taken to stamp out tax evasion by professionals and self-employed people who, while the PAYE worker listens patiently and sorrowfully, boast that they do not pay income tax.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to reintroduce the wealth tax.  There is no reason why wealthy people cannot contribute to development.  There is nothing wrong with considerably relieving social welfare recipients and improving their lot generously as a result of the reintroduction of the wealth tax.  The wealth tax only effects millionaires and those aspiring to be millionaires.  Those people should be taxed, but they are not being taxed.  They are being specially favoured by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>There should be twice yearly adjustments in social welfare benefits so as to improve basic living standards and to <Col N="668" /> keep them in line with the consumer price index.  I cannot understand why in present circumstances Fianna Fáil have abolished a major part of the food subsidies, making it more difficult for the sick, the old and the low wage earner and, indeed, all sections of the consuming public.  Without any consideration, with a stroke of the pen, the food subsidies were drastically removed without regard to the effect of severely rising prices on those least able to pay.  I am long enough in Parliament to know that this is the third time Fianna Fáil have raided food subsidies.  The Government of which I was a member endeavoured by subsidising food to keep prices down. This Government recklessly withdraws the subsidies and makes life more difficult for fathers of families, low wage earners, those without any trade union to protect them, those who have to depend on themselves alone, those in the private sector on fixed pensions with no prospect of any increase.  All these have to bear the brunt of the removal of food subsidies.  Nobody in Fianna Fáil will seek to help such people.</P>
    <P>There are many thousands of pensioners with no prospect of an increased income but they must still bear the brunt of Fianna Fáil's irresponsible actions in regard to the food subsidies.  I appeal to the Government to have the twice yearly adjustment so as to safeguard the poorer sections of the community.  I also ask for a job creation policy which will make full use of the potential of the public sector. We heard nothing in the budget that was different from what we got in the manifesto and I venture to say the budget is equally as insincere as the nonsense in the manifesto.</P>
    <P>What amount of taxpayers' money goes into CIE?  A very substantial sum. What steps have the Government taken to examine the possibility of involving private enterprise in providing a more efficient transport service and relieving the taxpayer?  What steps are being taken to have the telephone service handed over to private enterprise when the State has failed in regard to it?  In regard to CIE, the State has failed to provide an efficient and economic transport service. Why therefore should we be pouring millions into a company that is not giving efficient <Col N="669" /> service at present?  In regard to the telephone service let us seek experts from outside the country if there is no private enterprise within the country to undertake it.  Here again the State has failed to provide an efficient service. Businessmen are at the end of their patience with the telex service.  Let it be handed over to private enterprise if the State has failed.  Serious consideration should be given to this in the interests of the public.</P>
    <P>I want to give an example of income tax.  Any single person earning £52 per week, after deduction of income tax and social welfare, really has only £40 a week to take home.  Before he gets his pay packet £12 is deducted.  I congratulate the farmer on taking no nonsense from the Government&mdash;I am 100 per cent with them&mdash;but I hope the trade unions and those responsible for looking after the interests of the working people will not lag behind.  If they do, they will never again get the same opportunity. Bury the idea of moderate wage demands&mdash;they are out of the question. University fees have been unjustly and severely increased.  Some 84,000 people have lost their medical cards under which they enjoyed a free health service. Now they must pay.  The cost of living is rising day by day.  Housing has been considerably slowed down despite what the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment said today.  We who are members of local authorities know there is not the same acceleration in local authority or private building as there was three years ago.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Government, in connection with the whole financial structure of the country, are seriously considering in conjunction with the budget that there would appear to be a complete collapse of Irish society coming very soon.  Time is short.  I can see the day coming when tens of thousands will take to the streets and the roads.  God forbid that that should happen because there was a period in our history in which a great strike was declared and at a given time, even in O'Connell Street, Dublin, the trams stopped where they were and the drivers and conductors left them and went home.  Throughout the length and breadth of the country, <Col N="670" /> because of a principle of workers' rights, this step had to be taken.  Before it reaches that stage again in which there is a complete breakdown and standstill in every activity in the State, I hope the Government will act efficiently and speedily.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants to see strikes. Everybody wants to see a happy and contented community.  Pay the worker and he will work.  Pay him well and he will work twice as well.  Do not bend his back with taxation, as is being done at present.  Invest money in agriculture and assist the farmers, rather than having them whipped off the land by the inspectors of taxes.  On the question of strikes, I deplore the action of the Government in asking the Army to scab on trade unions. Many highly efficient men are serving in the Army, men who obey orders rigidly.  Their job is to defend the country, to look after the security of the State, to provide a service in the event of a crisis of national dimensions, but not to scab on trade unions.  I hope the Government will take serious note of what I say on this matter.  It is wrong to ask the Army to intervene in a trade dispute.</P>
    <P>We learned during the week that people will be obliged to pay for the use of roads.  Toll roads are wrong in principle. People pay enough in ordinary taxation to have the freedom to move about on any road, or to go over any bridge, without having to swell the coffers of any group who invest money with a view to earning long-term and substantial interest.</P>
    <P>I want to make special reference to the Government's failure to reduce by one year the qualifying age of old age pensions.  While the National Coalition Government were in office, the qualifying age was reduced each year by one year.  I have always maintained that old age pensions should be payable at the age of 60 years at a substantial rate to make room for promotions and to create vacancies.  Substantial sums of money should be provided to allow for a proper programme for leisure and to utilise the services of retired persons who are on pension.  We should plan for retirement in a much more efficient way than we do.  Numerous openings should be readily <Col N="671" /> available to retired persons.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the deplorable state of the health services.  I want to mention the enormous growth in expenditure in each health board area. The numbers of staff have been increasing steadily, but I wonder has the service to the patient improved.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the Minister for Finance to the long delay in dealing with nurses' problems.  The genuine case made on behalf of the nurses in all our hospitals should not be put on the long finger by the Government. It should be dealt with speedily and efficiently.</P>
    <P>I am dismayed at the manner in which the budget was presented, its unsound provisions and its many insane provisions. There are important and useful provisions which should have been included in an intelligent budget, a budget with some imagination, some drive and some hope for Ireland in the eighties. This budget holds out no hope and no prospect for that period.  I want to express my disappointment and my personal sadness.  The budget is an admission of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party's and the Government's lack of a policy which would steer us steadily into a period of economic development.</P>
    <P>There is an absence of common sense and planning.  Co-operation should have been sought from all sections of the community.  When the Minister for Finance reads the Official Report of this debate, he will see that I consider the budget very feeble.  It is a disastrous budget which has been a failure three times since it was introduced.  I have been a Member of this House for over 36 years and this is the first time I have seen that happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was elected in June 1977.  I find the speech by the previous speaker the most irresponsible I have heard since I came into the House.  For a man of his standing, a man who has been a Member of this House for such a long time, Deputy Flanagan's words and advice ill-become him.  Deputy Flanagan is a most interesting speaker and likable person.  But I would be failing in my duty if I did not refer to some matters he <Col N="672" /> raised in his speech.  He has told the Irish people, through this Parliament, that he does not want them to be moderate in any of their demands.  He has told them not to listen even to their trade union leaders.  I heard him say: look for the highest possible wage demands.  Such a speech by a prominent and respected public representative does not do the standards of this House any good.</P>
      <P>Since the party of which I am a member were returned to power in July 1977 they have lived up to their promises.  Everybody will agree that the promises made in our manifesto have been lived up to.  We have implemented every one of them.  Also we have lifted the standard of political debate.  The way in which the 1973 General Election was conducted, with both parties putting up their ideas on what they would do, led me to feel that in future elections there would be more of putting up the best goodies and seeing who would vote for them.  In the 1977 election, when both parties brought out their policies I reached a different conclusion.  The document we placed before the electorate was well researched and caught their attention.  Our victory at that time gave us to understand that, whereas we may have won on 16 June, the attitude of the electorate was: If you do not deliver, when the next election comes around, the electorate will give you their answer.  At that time people said our objectives were impossible to achieve.  We set about doing so and that is a tribute to the integrity of the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major controversy surrounding the budget&mdash;and I do not mean the farming levy which has been a controversial item in itself&mdash;is the dispute between two eminent politicians, the Minister for Finance and the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, both highly respected politicians and people of standing.  If one gets down to the basic facts one finds that a lot of argument must revolve around the question of what will be our growth rate in 1979.  For the ordinary man in the street the easiest way to form an analogy would be to suppose that, if one had a business and was trying to predict one's sales for the year, then probably one could estimate one's profit.  One would <Col N="673" /> be aware of one's expenses, overheads, but to estimate one's growth in sales or output for the year is something that depends on a lot of variables.  This is what the gross national product is all about. On our estimated figures of input and demands for the coming year we estimated our gross national product at approximately 6 per cent.  Unfortunately, that does not mean that jobs will grow by an equivalent amount.  If anything has been demonstrated in Western European countries in recent years it is that growth rates in gross national product do not bring about a corresponding increase in the number of people at work.  This is a matter on which considerable research has been carried out, because the greater the output of a nation the more people there should be at work.</P>
    <P>A study I had occasion to read some years ago was of the opinion that since the recession in 1974 part of the reason that growth rates do not bring about any or very small increases in the number of people at work was because employers found that when the recession hit them they had to let go numbers of employees, thereby creating redundancies.  When the recession lifted, when demand increased and their businesses began to grow again, they were very slow in taking on extra people until they found that this state of affairs was real and permanent. Secondly, they discovered that, because they had to cut back on the number of their employees, there was growth in productivity. This has meant that, although we were predicting in our manifesto various growth rates over the next four years, the problem we faced was how we would create the necessary jobs.</P>
    <P>This country faces unique problems among other European countries.  For example, we have the fastest growing young population.  Between the years 1961 and 1971 emigration ceased.  Prior to that time we were able to keep our unemployment figures at fairly low levels, not because we did anything wonderful in the industrial field or made any great strides forward, but rather the safety valve was that we were able to export the young and best of our population. The position has now been reversed, <Col N="674" /> thanks to the policies adopted in the First Programme for Economic Expansion back in the 1950's and continued in the sixties under successive Fianna Fáil Governments.  This means also that we do not have now the safety valve of emigration.  In any event now because of the educational processes here our young people do not feel they have to go abroad to make a living.  If they want to do so it is by choice and not of necessity. This means also that our young population expect and demand a living in their own country.  Since the party I represent have been in power most of the time they have been instrumental in raising the levels of education, through the free education scheme and the economic progress made since the mid-1950's. However, this in turn, has led to certain other problems in that we are now faced with creating an enormous number of jobs each year.  Some traditional industries which provided employment over previous decades&mdash;because of our joining the Common Market and experiencing the severe blows of free trade&mdash;are not in a position to stand up to those winds.  Whereas we had in the recent past been creating a large number of new jobs because of the redundancies which have been effected we must create a lot more.  Any economic planning we undertake must take account of those basic constraints.</P>
    <P>It was a pity that no census was taken in 1976, when it was due.  I do not mean to be party political when I say we can blame the previous Government for not having done so.  In any event it is a pity that the census was not taken in 1976 because it gives us the basic data concerning population trends and everything else for any planning process.  The absence of the census in 1976 was a bad mistake, and I would say that no matter what Government had been in power.</P>
    <P>Until we produced the document in 1977, it was felt that a Government would be mad to commit themselves by giving precise figures in relation to taxation, jobs or inflation, because if they did not live up to expectations the Opposition would say they failed because they did not do what they said they would do. This document is the basis of the whole budget strategy.  We said we would bring <Col N="675" /> inflation down to single digit figures by 1980.  Remarkable as it seems, inflation in 1978 was at exactly the figure we predicted in 1977.  The growth rate which we predicted has also materialised. To people who would criticise the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development I would say that everything they predicted has come to pass.</P>
    <P>Part of our overall economic strategy was to give an impetus to the economy in the first year in order to create more demand and, in turn, more jobs.  In order to do that we had to borrow in the 1977 budget.  At that time we also said we would raise borrowing to 13 per cent of GNP, but in 1978 we would hope to reduce it to 10 per cent and in 1980 and 1981 down to 8 per cent.  There is nothing wrong with borrowing and I never criticised the Coalition Government for borrowing.  What I did criticise was the way the money was spent.  We said that we would reduce the level of borrowing in 1978.  It must be accepted that, if the level of borrowing is to be reduced, then we either have to increase taxes or reduce services or a combination of both.  It must also be remembered that, although the percentage of GNP has to be lowered, if GNP is increased then we may not have to reduce borrowing as much.  Consequently, an increase in GNP is very important.  Our expectation of what the increase will be is vital to the whole economic strategy and also to the percentage of GNP which we borrow.</P>
    <P>The 1978 budget, which was our first budget, was a gamble on the private sector producing.  In that budget we gave incentives to the private sector by way of taxation relief&mdash;for example, the 25 per cent corporation tax relief for manufacturing companies increasing their employment by a certain amount.  The emphasis was on the private sector, but in order to get more people at work we increased the number of public sector jobs, although I would be very cautious of having too many public sector jobs. But the private sector have been saying for years that if they had the proper environment they would create more jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" /> Therefore, our main priority in this budget was to give them the opportunity. I accept that when incentives are given a certain amount of time must elapse before the jobs are created, but I am somewhat disappointed that the increase in private sector employment is so small. I never thought the private sector would go overboard and do all the things we hoped they would do regarding the creation of jobs, because the business man is interested primarily in profit and he cannot be expected to have a tremendous social conscience.  However, I did expect that the increase would have been greater.  I will come later to the reasons why I think the private sector has not increased employment as much as the Government thought they should.  This experience should teach us a lesson, when we come to drawing up our future plans, not to rely too heavily upon the private sector.</P>
    <P>I believe that this country has tremendous potential through financial incentives to attract foreign industry.  Our growth in the fifties, sixties and seventies has been attributed in large measure to foreign industries which were attracted here under various schemes.  It was believed at one time that one could not base long-term employment on attracting foreign industries because it was not possible to keep them.  But apart from the industries which have dried up and gone out of business&mdash;and we have had some very expensive failures&mdash;the experiment has been a tremendous success. In any event Irish entrepreneurs have learned from the successes of foreign industries here which have created a good industrial environment.</P>
    <P>However, I am of the belief that the long-term employment prospects and long-term strategy should be based on industries which have what I would term a natural affinity to this country.  Industries which revolve around agriculture must be the ones we should improve on.  In this regard the meat industry has tremendous potential and it has not been tapped at all.  Most meat factories just kill and ship cattle.  The number of jobs that could be created by those people going into other lines of production would be immense.  There are various industries based on agricultural <Col N="677" /> products which could create enormous numbers of new jobs over the years if it was gone about in the right way.  Until now the Government itself did not become involved in such ventures and private industry, even though it has been encouraged by grants and so on, has not expanded in the way I would have hoped.  Perhaps the day is coming when there could be a joint venture involving the State and some of the people in the food industries to go into further areas such as food processing and so on.</P>
    <P>While we welcome firms who come here from other parts of the world because they are attracted by such factors as our export sales tax relief, it is preferable to have Irish industry where possible.  In this regard I have come to the conclusion that big is not always best.  There was a time when I thought that to have progress we needed the biggest firms who would employ thousands of people but I have changed my mind since then.  I read somewhere that if a small employer, an employer with about 500 people on his staff, were to employ an extra two people, the unemployment problem would be solved.  Another consideration is that in the smaller industries there are usually fewer problems and there is less likelihood of their going out of business because in many of those firms there is involved not only the livelihood of the owner but also a lifetime's work and pride.  Though we have had tremendous success in attracting foreign industry we should endeavour from now on to encourage native-based industry to the greatest extent possible.  There is much potential for the creation of new jobs in native-based food processing industries, for instance.</P>
    <P>I have said before that unless we are able to create the number and the type of new jobs that our young people will require during the next five years, we will be faced with a very big problem.  Young people today want jobs that are satisfying. If we fail in this area we will have hundreds of thousands of educated young people out of work.  It is in the interest of all political parties to try to ensure that we will never reach such a situation.</P>
    <P>There must be something inherently wrong in an education system which <Col N="678" /> turns out thousands of people each year from our secondary schools seeking what are regarded as academic jobs but being unable to find them, while in other industries there is a great shortage of the type of people required.  For instance, though there are more than 100,000 people out of work there is a great shortage of such workers as carpenters, blocklayers and so on in the building industry. In such a situation there is obviously a need for a national manpower policy.  I am not referring in any way to the National Manpower Service but we should have an overall plan that would provide for greater assistance to be given to young people embarking on what is to be their final phase of study as to where the job opportunities are likely to be. There is hardly any point in producing thousands of teachers if there are not sufficient blocklayers to build the schools.  We have not begun in any real way to tackle these problems.  Although the emphasis may differ in so far as each political party is concerned in regard to overall economic planning, I think it can be said that our overall aim is the same. To be successful any national economic plan must include a national manpower policy.  That is why I should like to see some agency being set up by the Government to deal with this question.</P>
    <P>I have said before also that the creation of jobs in the public sector should be regarded as a once-off measure rather than a permanent feature of our economic structure.  The amount of money required to remunerate the people employed in the public sector is immense. I understand it amounts to about half what is collected from the workers by way of tax.  I am not in favour of creating an immense bureaucracy because experience generally has been that the greater the bureaucracy, the lesser the efficiency.</P>
    <P>The budget provides for the creation of more jobs in the public sector.  It is estimated that four jobs are necessary in the private sector to fund one job in the public sector.  Therefore, if in our last two budgets we have created X number of jobs in the public sector, the private sector would have needed to provide four times that number.  Unless more jobs can be created in the private sector <Col N="679" /> the greater will be the amount of money to be taken from the pockets of those working in the private sector in order to pay for people in guaranteed employment in the public sector.  But the more one takes from the worker by way of tax, the less will be his incentive to work harder.  In these circumstances I am concerned with the explosion in numbers in the public sector.  I consider many Government Departments and semi-State bodies to be grossly overstaffed. While there are some very efficient people in the public sector they are not subject to the same demands as are people in the private sector.  It may not be popular to say this but I have found a deterioration in certain Departments in terms of public servants dealing with the public.  I have found a growing tendency among civil servants to be non-cooperative and obstructive.  I have been to Government offices where not only have I noticed civil servants being abusive to the public but where on occasion the offices were dirty.  I have found civil servants in some cases to be the most uncivil people one could find.  There is a general falling of standards in the public sector.</P>

      <P>I recall one occasion on which I had to visit the Department of Education.  I do not know who was responsible for cleaning the place but in that regard it was no credit to the Department.  If we fail to increase efficiency in the public sector while continuing to increase the numbers we shall merely have a situation of less efficiency and more overstaffing.</P>
      <P>The overall strategy in our manifesto of creating a Department of Economic Planning and Development has proved very worth while.  It has led to a situation of new life in the area of economic planning. There should be a policy-making unit in every Government Department as suggested in the Devlin Report many years ago.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donnell has been granted permission by the Ceann Comhairle to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 32 on today's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that it is necessary for me once again to raise on the Adjournment the question of the appalling chaos in our postal and telecommunications services.  For more than 12 months we have had strikes almost continuously and this has led to many serious and recurring stoppages in this vital service.  This situation has already caused severe hardship to many sections of our community.  There is no doubt that irreparable damage is being done to the commercial, industrial and agricultural sectors.  Jobs have been lost, export markets disrupted and, in some parts of the country, the industrial and commercial life has been brought almost to a standstill.  The Minister, who is also responsible for tourism, must be conscious of the adverse effect such disputes are having on the tourism industry.  This is the peak period for booking holidays and I am sure the Minister is aware of the chaos and disruption experienced by travel agents, hoteliers and others engaged in the tourism industry because they are unable to post brochures and other holiday material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to illustrate the serious effect such disputes are having on industry by giving an example of how one industry is affected.  In 1974 in Furbo, in the Connemara Gaeltacht, the Government, of which I was a member, established a modern computer centre. The intention was to provide employment for people with third-level education who were anxious to live there.  A State investment of about £2 million was involved in this project.  The project experienced some teething problems but then went very well.  However, in the last 12 months the operation of the centre has been almost impossible.  I am sure the Minister read in last Sunday's newspapers a story to the effect that the plant <Col N="681" /> was being dismantled and transferred to Dublin because of the failure of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to ensure a continuous service.  I should like to point out that the computer operates on telephone lines.  It is appalling that that should happen and it is a shocking indictment of the failure of the Minister and his Department to provide a continuous and satisfactory telecommunication and postal service.</P>
    <P>At Question Time Deputy Harte stated that as a result of this dispute the North-West was virtually isolated.  I know of many industries and business concerns who are faced with impossible situations, particularly in the last fortnight. We are now faced with the prospect of the dispute continuing indefinitely. If this situation is allowed to continue indefinitely the consequences for the economic and social life of the nation are too dreadful to contemplate. The Minister told me last week, and today, that the union should avail of the conciliation and arbitration machinery. He also told me that the union was in breach of that procedure and of the national pay agreement.  One thing that must come through all this clearly is the fact that the conciliation and arbitration machinery in the Department is totally antiquated and no longer appropriate to a modern postal and telecommunications service.</P>
    <P>Surely common sense dictates that when machinery of that kind is soon to be defective it should be re-examined with a view to streamlining it and bringing it more into line with present-day standards.  There is an urgent need for a radical reorganisation of the industrial relations machinery in the Department. Some time ago the Minister acknowledged that all was not well within the Department and because of this he established a review body to examine the possibility of having off the telecommunications section to private enterprise or a semi-State body. However, we are faced with what is virtually a national crisis now because the industrial relations procedure in the Department is unsuited to modern needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> Basically, I accept the principle that Ministerial intervention in industrial disputes should only take place when all other avenues have been adequately explored but in this dispute it is not possible to explore all avenues when the industrial relations set-up is defective.  We are now faced with total deadlock in this dispute, a continuous disruption and probably an escalation and a worsening of the situation.  Every day this goes on the effects will be more severe, more adverse and other parts of the country, like Donegal, will be cut off from Dublin and other centres.</P>
    <P>I have not brought the Minister here today for the purpose of haranguing him about the situation.  I have given the example of the computer bureau and I am sure there are people in numerous small and large industries whose livelihood is threatened because they cannot receive their mail and cannot be sure of making telephone calls.  All the criteria for ministerial intervention are there.  The Minister should intervene.</P>
    <P>I want to clarify what I mean by ministerial intervention.  How the Minister intervenes is a matter he will have to decide, but basically he has a responsibility to ensure the resumption of normal services, the improvement, streamlining and modernising of those services.  The criteria are there which not merely warrant but make it imperative that the Minister take some initiative to break the deadlock.</P>
    <P>The Government have available to them the Department of Labour who have the responsibility to ensure harmonious industrial relations.  That Department have available to them a wide range of services, facilities and mechanisms for interventions in industrial disputes.  The Minister should be able to call on one of these services.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour the point because Deputy Harte is anxious to intervene and I want to give him some of my time.  I believe this deadlock should be broken, must be broken, and can only be broken at this stage through the Minister taking appropriate and immediate initiative by way of personal intervention or otherwise through facilities or machinery available to him from the Department of Labour.  The country is <Col N="683" /> waiting for appropriate governmental action to be taken to prevent a continuation or a worsening of this very serious national crisis.</P>

      <P>My intervention will be brief but direct.  I see this as a situation which has worsened since the Coalition left office.  I concede that during the term of the Coalition there was evidence of unrest within the Department.  In those days we heard people like the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs saying that if Fianna Fáil got back into office all these things would be put right.  They have not been put right; they have got worse because of a lack of commitment on the part of Fianna Fáil Governments for the last 40 years to do something about telecommunications in the Republic.  There is no getting away from that.  The system is about to collapse. It is a shame to have to defend to visitors the type of instruments we use&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy must understand that when a <Col N="684" /> question is taken on the Adjournment he must stay strictly on the question and nothing else.  The question asked by Deputy O'Donnell concerns the present telecommunications and postal dispute and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have very many minutes left, about four, and you are taking up a lot of my time.  I am elaborating on what Deputy O'Donnell has been saying.  I am dealing with it as I see it, how it effects me as a constituency Deputy, and how it affects my constituents who sent me here.</P>
      <P>This dispute has isolated County Donegal more than any other county.  It makes it impossible for a Deputy to communicate with his home or for a Deputy at home to communicate with Parliament.  Last Friday week I was told if I wanted to speak to the Dáil on any matter I would have to pay double charges and have the call treated as urgent.  This is all tied up in the dispute.  I acknowledge that the conditions about which the Chair talks are not being debated here, but they are allied with the dispute in the minds of the people who are now on strike.</P>
      <P>What I am saying is that not only payment is important but also conditions. I do not know how some of the young girls employed as telephonists live.  Some of them get £40 or £50 a week.  After paying for their accommodation and food I do not know how they survive.  Many of them come from comfortable homes and could not manage but for the help they get from home.  It is disgraceful that the Department keep young married men with families to rear working in such intolerable conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present commitment by the Minister and the Government is lacking in as much as the Minister told us during Question Time today that he was prepared &ldquo;if certain things would fall into line&rdquo;.  While he was saying this I thought of what Pontius Pilate said when they were crucifying our Lord, &ldquo;I wash my hands of the blood of this just man&rdquo;.  It is very nice for a Minister to stand on his dignity and say he did not cause the strike&mdash;except through inactivity. <Col N="685" /> Standing on his dignity will not resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Donnell I am telling the Minister to forget the niceties of office, to forget all the official jargon he has given us time after time in supplementary replies and say to the people on strike &ldquo;I am prepared to meet you, no strings attached.  We understand the country is at a standstill&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained in the House the Government's position in relation to this dispute.  The strike action on which the Post Office Workers' Union embarked was taken at a time when the negotiations on their claims were in progress and when procedures were available to the union for pursuing the claims.  These procedures have not been exhausted.  I want to emphasise that the Department did not break off negotiations and are prepared to resume discussions within the agreed procedures for conciliation.  Independent arbitration by an arbitrator agreed to by all the unions in the civil service is available at any time if they are dissatisfied with progress.  I have undertaken to accept the findings of the arbitrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be evident to everyone that the Department are not putting obstacles in the way of the union.  I have said the Department will facilitate the union in every possible way in processing their claim quickly to a conclusion.  I would have thought that the experience of recent years would have taught us that the only way to resolve industrial problems is by negotiation within agreed procedures which are there for that purpose. It is very difficult to understand why the public should have to face the damaging consequences of a strike in an important public service and the Department <Col N="686" /> are saying that further conciliation negotiations are still available, as is independent arbitration.  All the procedures under the conciliation and arbitration scheme and the national wage agreement, to both of which the union is a party, are there for the purpose of settling pay claims and are available.</P>
    <P>The Government and myself are anxious that the union's pay claim should be settled on an equitable basis, that is, a basic which is fair to the staff and to the users of the Department's services.  An equitable settlement must be consistent with the Department's position as the supplier of important public services to the community.  It is important that Deputies and the public at large should appreciate the importance of adhering to orderly means of resolving pay claims within the civil service.  I fully understand the annoyance and irritation which many people feel when public services are disrupted and I appreciate the hardships which these stoppages cause. It is precisely to provide that such stoppages should not become the norm that the Government are concerned that orderly agreed procedures should be used.  It is only too easy in the face of difficulties caused by a particular dispute to call on the Minister to throw overboard these procedures, but that would cause irreparable damage.  Settlement in a particular dispute on such a basis would have the most serious consequences and clearly would not be in the interests of the public or the staff.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by Deputies opposite who have no responsibility that I should meet the union outside the conciliation and arbitration scheme and that I could do so without adverse consequences. This shows how little they understand the problem.  Under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration agreed between the Minister for the Public Service and all the unions representing staff in the civil service, both sides are committed to using the procedures laid down in the scheme for dealing with matters which are appropriate to be so dealt with.  In my view it would be totally inconsistent with the provisions and the intentions of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for negotiations to take <Col N="687" /> place while industrial action is in progress.  All experience shows that this does not solve problems.  To depart from the agreed procedures would also be contrary to the terms of the national wage agreement which expressly provides for the maintenance of industrial peace and for the processing of claims of this kind through the negotiation procedures.  In such circumstances the future of the conciliation and arbitration scheme would have been gravely endangered. There would be no going back and effectively there would be no negotiation structures within which problems about pay and other matters could be peacefully resolved.</P>
    <P>The last people I would expect to thank me for damaging present procedures in this way would be the civil service unions.  It is a matter of record that over the years the conciliation and arbitration scheme has fulfilled the purposes for which it was agreed and very many claims have been settled.  The scheme relates to all the unions in the civil service.  The dispute which lasted all through the period of the previous administration and spilled over into mine was settled by me under conciliation and arbitration.  If a new scheme is desired by any union or group in the civil service, then in consultation with the other unions and with the Minister for the Public Service a change can be made, provided that it is made with the agreement of all concerned.</P>
    <P>The present strike action is in clear breach of both the scheme for conciliation and arbitration and the current national wage agreement.  The Government could hardly be expected to consider a breach of this agreement, which binds both parties to the maintenance of industrial peace.  The union claims range from 31 per cent to 51 per cent and have been presented on the basis that the staff have fallen behind in relation to comparable workers elsewhere.  It is not sufficient <Col N="688" /> simply to submit claims.  These claims must be justified.  Where it is claimed that the staff have fallen behind comparable workers, the extent to which they have fallen behind must be substantiated. The union and the Department have discussed these claims at a number of meetings and substantial offers have been made which in the view of the Department more than meet the argument about comparability and productivity and the other factors which the union have put forward.  Arbitration is available if the union are not satisfied with the Department's assessment.</P>
    <P>The staff concerned have received all the increases provided under the national wage agreement and will be receiving final payment under the current agreement with effect from today. Increases over and above the increases in the national wage agreement are not precluded, but must be properly supported in accordance with the various criteria laid down in the national wage agreement.  To concede unjustified increases would entail imposing unjustified costs on the post office users and would also be a recipe for inflation.  If the case is brought before the arbitrator, I will accept his decision.</P>
    <P>I have already appealed to the union and to the staff to end their action and I would again make that plea.  I assure them that all the facilities available under the conciliation and arbitration scheme and the national wage agreement are available to them.  They can come back to conciliation if they have further argument to put forward or they can go to arbitration if they are dissatisfied with the Department's offer.  This is still the best and only advice I can give them.  I do so in the conviction that this is the way in which a satisfactory settlement can be reached and their own and the public interest safeguarded.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that expenditure of unemployment assistance to smallholders in County Donegal is currently in the region of £52,000 a week. The new notional multipliers would have reduced this expenditure by about £3,000 a week but the 12 per cent rate increases announced in the budget will increase the amount by about £8,000 resulting in a net additional amount of £5,000 in payments to smallholders in County Donegal.  As a result of this year's budget the weekly amount paid in unemployment assistance to smallholders in County Donegal will be £57,000 as against £52,000 at present.</P>

On the following day he was transferred to the Curragh Military Hospital for further medical treatment.  He was examined there on 6 February 1979 by a psychiatrist from the forensic psychiatric service of the Eastern Health Board, who recommended that the prisoner have in-patient psychiatric treatment.  He was transferred to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, on 6 February 1979 for this treatment.  The Central Mental Hospital was established to provide in-patient psychiatric treatment in a secure setting for prisoners requiring such treatment.
