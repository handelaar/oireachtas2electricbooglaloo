    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish, in accordance with notice given to the Ceann Comhairle, to raise as a matter of urgent public importance, under Standing <Col N="1066" /> Order No. 30, the question of the demolition or excavation work being undertaken at Wood Quay.  I raise the matter, first, because it is a matter in respect of which the Government have responsibility. This is demonstrated by the Government's statement of 10 October last which said that, when certain excavation work had been completed by archaeologists, the corporation, unless some new archaeological finding of great importance had been made, would be granted permission to proceed with the building of civic offices.  It is further shown by a statement by the Minister of State, Deputy Wyse, in the Seanad of 7 December 1978, when he spoke of getting further opinions before making final recommendations to the Government which he hoped to do within the next week.  He said that whatever decision is made was unlikely to satisfy everybody but hoped that all sensible and reasonable people would accept it as a fair solution.  It is evident that this is a matter in respect of which a Government decision is pending and the Government have accepted responsibility. No such decision has been announced.</P>
      <P>Secondly, my motion is within the Rules of Order, because I am raising the matter without delay.  The demolition work started at 6.15 p.m. last night.  It is a sudden emergency and I am raising it without delay.  The work being done could do irretrievable damage; therefore it is a matter of such a nature that a delay in discussing it might prevent effective action being taken.  It is within the executive office of the Government and the Minister, as I have explained. Therefore, on those grounds, in accordance with precedent, the matter is one of urgent public importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further related issue, which is that a consent given in August last year by the commissioners, but not agreed until January, is phrased in terms which permit work to take place to the extent necessary, to wit, the completion of a certain part of the contract. Although evidence was given in court that only half of the site is involved, the commissioners do not know what that half is, because it has not been defined <Col N="1067" /> anywhere at any time.  Therefore, it is a further question that arises as to whether the work now being carried out is within the terms of the consent or not.  For all those reasons I move that the matter be considered by the House as a matter of urgent importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediately before coming in the Leader of Fine Gael announced that he intended to raise this matter.  To be quite honest, in the short time at my disposal I have been unable to establish what the Government accountability may or may not be in the matter.  On the information available to me I could not agree to have the matter raised in this way at present. There are other procedures the Deputy might try.  Unless the Government have agreed to something I am not aware of, that is, to have the matter discussed, I cannot see that I can give permission to have it raised in this fashion.  When I have time to consider it further and see what the accountability of the Government may be in the matter, the Deputy can raise it again on Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Fitzgerald Dr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is clearly of urgent public importance because the damage being done is irretrievable.  I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, whether you could consider&mdash;and I understand your difficulty&mdash;this question of Government accountability urgently and give a decision later on in the course of the day.  I have given my reasons for saying the Government admitted accountability. Otherwise the whole procedure for debating matters of urgent public importance would have no value whatever.  The whole purpose of it is to enable something to be stopped which is irretrievable.  Postponing it until Tuesday would obviously fail to give effect to this procedure.  Therefore, while I appreciate the time required by you to consider what is the Government's accountability, I would urge you, a Cheann Comhairle, to consider it urgently to inform the House of your decision as soon as you have taken it later today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair does not take lightly the importance of matters <Col N="1068" /> which are sought to be raised as matters of public importance requiring urgent consideration.  The Chair is not influenced by anything other than being exact and correct in the decision given.  I am not sufficiently versed in the question of whether or not there is Government accountability.  If I gave that decision now, as I am giving it, it could not be raised later today.  It would have to wait until Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you said, and understandably so, that you had not time to establish whether or not there was Government responsibility in the matter.  The Taoiseach and most of the Cabinet are present, and surely the Taoiseach could now indicate whether or not the Government recognise that they have responsibility in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of what took place between the parties in this matter but, at this stage, it is a matter entirely for the Chair.  The Chair is ruling that it is not in order under this procedure.  There are other procedures.  The matter could be raised again after today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I urge you to reconsider that decision.  In that event, Standing Order No. 30 could have no value.  Obviously the question of Executive responsibility is involved. That has been decided in an earlier precedent.  I have given the grounds for saying it is involved, the statement of the Minister for State and the statement issued on behalf of the Government.  I have furnished you with those and shown them to you.  You may require a little time to study them.  I accept that, of course.  But that you should rule that it is not a matter of urgent public importance because you have not yet been able to examine and read the relevant documents, and therefore rule the matter out completely under this Standing Order, would vitiate the purpose of the Standing Order.  I would urge you, therefore, to reconsider the matter, to take some time and to give a decision later today. Otherwise the Standing Order could have no value at all.  To raise it on Tuesday <Col N="1069" /> would be useless because at that stage the damage will have been done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very well aware, I am sure, and all other Deputies in the House, that it is a matter for the Chair to decide.  The Chair is not satisfied that it is a matter of public importance requiring urgent consideration. I am not in a position to say whether or not there is Government accountability. Therefore, I rule against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach whether the statement made on behalf of the Government by the Minister of State about taking a decision on the matter after 7 December is not an acceptance of Government responsibility? Have not the Government publicly accepted that, as they did in the statement of 10 December?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one observation to make at this stage.  Deputy FitzGerald raised this matter with me but it was about one minute to 10.30 a.m.  I understood from him and from my private secretary that he endeavoured to contact Government Buildings earlier on but, because of the postal dispute, he was not able to get through.  When he spoke to me just before 10.30 a.m.  I told him naturally that it was a matter I would like to consider. I should like to consider very seriously the position of the Government <i>vis-à-vis</i> the decision of the Supreme Court yesterday.  I have not seen the judgement.  I should like to consider it fully. I just looked at the newspaper reports of it.  It is a matter which would have to be examined very carefully to see to what extent the suggestion made by Deputy FitzGerald about Government responsibility in the matter is relevant to the situation.  That would have to be examined against the background of the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Taoiseach for his response which I appreciate and to ask him if, in order to give him time to consider the matter which I quite understand he needs, he would ask the corporation to cease the work until he has time to examine it. <Col N="1070" /> Otherwise the thing would be futile.  Is the Taoiseach willing to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I could do that in the light of the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Work has now started on the site and all this talk may become redundant within the next two days.  I respectfully ask you, Sir, to examine the position raised by Deputy FitzGerald so that this House later today, but no later than today, can have an opportunity to discuss the matter under the standing order mentioned by Deputy FitzGerald. Irrespective of whose responsibility the decision is, if it is not raised today, there will be no matter to discuss by next Tuesday.  That is a fact and it is known to everybody in this House who studied the matter.  There is a question of democracy here.  Could I have some undertaking from you, Sir, that if you satisfy yourself that it is the Government's responsibility, as we believe it is, this House will have an opportunity to deal with the matter some time today before the Dáil adjourns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other procedures.  The standing order makes it quite clear that the Ceann Comhairle's decision must be given thereupon and I have given my decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While there are other procedures, arising out of yesterday's decision on questions, one person's interpretation of a procedure might not coincide with that of another.  I am asking the Ceann Comhairle if he is satisfied that there is Government responsibility, to give us an opportunity to discuss it later today.  If it is left to other procedures we could have a similar dispute about the interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has tried to draw an analogy with yesterday's discussion on the submission of questions.  There was nothing contrary to Standing Orders in what was discussed yesterday.  Some people seem to have thought there was.  My point was that if it is to be changed the Committee on Procedures and Privileges is the place to change it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understandable that since this matter was raised shortly before 10.30 a.m. when the House sat, the Taoiseach has not had time to consider it.  You have also indicated, Sir, that you have not had sufficient time to establish where responsibility lies and if there is Government responsibility.  In view of the unique circumstances surrounding this case that, if a decision is not taken in the immediate future irreparable damage can be done to the national heritage, would the House and the Ceann Comhairle consider adjourning for an hour to give the Taoiseach an opportunity to establish whether or not there is Government responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this matter requires that type of decision. I have given my decision under Standing Order No. 30.  The decision must be given now.  The matter may be raised again.  There are other procedures which can be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have quoted from the Official Report in which a Minister of State told the Seanad that he would be making final recommendations to the Government.  He referred to the Government decision and said whatever decision was made was unlikely to satisfy everybody.  There is therefore a public record, on the record of the other House, of acceptance by a member of the Government, of a responsibility to make a recommendation to the Government and the Government to make a decision, a decision which had already been announced in a Press release of 10 October. That is a <i>prima facie</i> case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is not at all as simple as the Deputy endeavours to make it.  I think we have had sufficient discussion.  I do not think I can give any further explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am entitled here to say that when a Minister of State has announced in one of the Houses of the Oireachtas that he has made a recommendation to the Government and that the Government have taken a decision, the Chair cannot then say that it rules something out as not being a matter <Col N="1072" /> of urgent public importance because there is not Executive responsibility.  I submit that admission by a Minister of State requires the Chair in those circumstances to give a decision in favour.  If the Chair wishes time to consider it further, then that can be taken and the matter can be reconsidered in an hour's time, or by 12 o'clock or 1 o'clock.  But for the Chair to refuse in the face of that <i>prima facie</i> evidence even to consider the matter is to vitiate the whole purpose of Standing Order No. 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair does not agree.  The Chair is in a position where it must take a serious view of this matter.  Certainly I would not be happy in giving a decision to permit a debate. The Chair is not aware, in regard to the many negotiations that were taking place and statements made in this House, in the other House and outside the House regarding Wood Quay, to what extent all these have been superseded by a decision of the Supreme Court.  The Chair is not aware, and I am now taking a decision.  I will not permit a discussion on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has stated repeatedly that the Chair is not aware of what is the actual position.  The Taoiseach has stated, and understandably so, that he had been informed only shortly before coming into the House.  I suggest that this matter is of such supreme national importance we should adjourn the House for an hour.  The House has been adjourned on far lesser issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies are aware that the Chair's decision must be given immediately and I have given my decision.  There are other procedures which may be sought.  I propose to go on with the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I protest about a decision being taken on the grounds that the Chair is not aware of Executive responsibility when the record of one of these Houses shows acceptance of Executive responsibility.  I have to submit that that decision is one which is indefensible.  I would urge on the Chair to give it <Col N="1073" /> further consideration and, if he needs more time to consider it, to adjourn the House for an hour to enable him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have agreed to permit the Deputy to raise the matter again on Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this procedure&mdash;if I may read from precedents&mdash;the purpose is that the matter must be some sudden emergency; <i>prima facie</i> urgent to be raised without delay, of such a nature that delay in discussing it might prevent effective action being taken.  I submit that that is self-evidently the case, that the Chair cannot and is not entitled to rule that I raise this matter again as a matter of urgent public importance next Tuesday.  That would be contrary to Standing Orders, because Standing Orders are concerned with matters in respect of which delay in discussing them might prevent effective action being taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has taken a decision that it will not permit discussion on this matter.  There are other procedures if the Deputy wishes to use them during the day or any other time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a pity if this were to escalate into a political brawl. The Chair has persisted that the matter cannot be raised until Tuesday next.  The Taoiseach was requested to ask the corporation to cease any demolition on the site pending the matter being raised on Tuesday.  The Taoiseach has said, understandably, that he is not quite clear what his responsibilities are in this matter. Nobody is asking the Taoiseach at this point to instruct the corporation.  All that is being asked is: would the Taoiseach request the corporation to cease any operation on the site until Tuesday? Would the Taoiseach agree to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>And until the Taoiseach has had a chance to consider the position and inform this House as to whether the Government have yet taken the decision mentioned in the Seanad and as to what that decision is, if the <Col N="1074" /> Taoiseach would request the corporation to hold action until he has had a chance to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will consider that.  I do not know what are my rights in this respect, especially having regard to the decision of the highest court in the land.  Naturally, one must respect that decision and one does not say lightly that one is going to in any way flout it, even though unintentionally. Certainly, I shall consider to what extent I would have any right or duty in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday last I was referring to the importance of the Department of Economic Planning and Development in the role of this Government and in the plans we had brought forward.  I had said that the budget should be seen as part of our overall plan.  I am afraid discussion on that aspect of the budget has tended to be overshadowed by another aspect that revolves around the question of farmer taxation.  If that has done one good thing it is that it has brought into the open a discussion among all sectors as to what people should be paying in income tax, who should be paying and what amount. The question also revolves around what is a fair share of taxation for all sections of the community.  If discussion on farmer taxation or the farming levy has brought about a greater awareness of the taxation system, then it will have done some good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1974, when farming taxation was introduced, anybody could be forgiven for not visualising that in 1979 farmers would be asking to pay their fair share of tax.  I did not hold much brief for the previous Minister for Finance but he must be complimented in some way on the fact that, since the outcry there was at the time he brought in farmer taxation, five years later farmers would wish to pay income tax like everybody else. The level of acceptability among farmers about what they should pay in income tax has increased in that time.  They have come to accept that they must pay income tax like everybody else.  If any section of the community can be seen not to be paying income tax like everybody else, then there will be a recurring budgetary problem such as has been experienced in the past couple of years. Each time a budget is introduced there are headlines in the papers to the effect <Col N="1076" /> that farmers contributed only X million in income tax and that their contribution does not bear any relationship to that paid by other sections of the community. The solution now proposed will take this problem out of the arena at budget time.</P>
    <P>When we speak about farmer taxation and whether or not one includes rates, or whether or not one excludes farmers with a rateable valuation of £20, the fact of the matter is that farmers are not seen to be contributing the same share as other sections of the community.  Last year farmers contributed 2 per cent of their income as compared with other people who paid approximately 16 per cent of their income.  If one excludes farmers with valuations below £20 that figure goes up by 5.5 per cent.  It is a long way short of what other sections of the community are contributing.  So long as that situation exists the masses of people who have to pay under the PAYE system will complain that farmers are not paying their fair share.</P>
    <P>If farmers have been paying so little in income tax there must be some reason for it.  Even with the lowering of the threshold each year bringing in more and more farmers, the contributions from farmers have not lived up to what is estimated by the Revenue Commissioners at the start of each year.  In that regard there has only been progress in farming in Ireland in the past five or six years. Farmers have been reinvesting the little extra money they made in their farms. Any farmer on accounts is allowed, like all other sections of the self-employed community, to claim that as a deduction against his income tax.</P>
    <P>There are some myths about farming profits.  Some farmers are doing very well and some are doing very poorly.  To say that all farmers are millionaires and making a fortune is just not taking account of reality.  The reason people expect farmers to do excessively well is that since we joined the EEC farmers' incomes have shot up dramatically.  People see the amount of money that has gone into farming as a result of our membership of the EEC and they say, &ldquo;look at all the money the farmers got out of the EEC&rdquo;.  The fact of the matter <Col N="1077" /> is that it is the same as the case of a man who is earning £10 per week and gets an increase of 100 per cent in his wages and so earns £20 per week; but £20 per week is a lot short of what most other people are earning.  If farmers' incomes have increased dramatically they were starting from a very low base and account has to be taken of that.  They have not got a taxable income and that is the reason. They made enormous strides in the past five or six years but they were starting from a very low base and that is one of the reasons that the profits people think they were making are not there.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I believe we cannot have a situation continuing where the PAYE sector contribute so much and the farmers contribute relatively little. There must be a solution.  Publicly, and within the structures of the Fianna Fáil party, I opposed the idea of the levy.  I was opposed to it on the principle that it bears no relation to income or ability to pay.  That is the only argument that a person need have against the 2 per cent levy.  But if we accept that argument which the farming organisations also put forward then we must accept that we must have a taxation system which makes one pay on one's income.  That is exactly what is being proposed now.  The solution to the problem of farmer taxation is first of all to abolish the notional system.  According to the Revenue Commissioners there is only approximately 16 per cent of all farmers still on the notional system.  I am prepared to say from experience that the notional system, even if the multiplier is increased to 300, will still prove impracticable for most people.</P>
    <P>I am sure each one of us here would like to have a taxation system where we could multiply some figure by our age or something and pay tax on that basis; if we all had the option of taking some figure then we would all opt for it.  But the rest of the community do not have that way out.  As long as any section of the community has a different basis of calculating taxable income then there are going to be problems.  I am in favour, and always have been, in favour of the abolition of the notional system no matter what the multiplier is.  All farmers should pay income tax on their accounts. <Col N="1078" /> There is a great myth in regard to accounts.  The answer to that is that if one does not have an income one does not pay income tax.  If one's valuation is at a very low figure and one is making a profit then one pays income tax. Farmers need not be afraid that if an accounts system comes in for all farmers they are then going to have to pay income tax.  The same applies to them as applies to everybody else; if they make money they pay income tax and if they do not they should not be paying income tax anyway and the only system which can accurately reflect that is the accounts system.  For administrative purposes there would not be much point in going below the £15 poor law valuation. I am not saying that I am against the principle of bringing all farmers of all valuations into the income tax net on accounts but administrative problems aligned with the amount of income tax that might be collected would mean that, for the next couple of years, it would not be worth while to collect the tax. Therefore it might not be feasible to go below that figure for the time being.  But I am not against the principle of going down to £10 valuation because I think everyone should be on the same system. That is a system which I believe the PAYE worker and the trade unions will accept because the trade unions opposed the idea of the levy; the farming organisations opposed the idea of the levy; the small farmers and the Land League opposed it.  It was opposed on the grounds that it was a disincentive to productivity and bore no relation to income. It must be accepted that we must have a taxation system based on ability to pay.</P>
    <P>The idea in regard to the accounts system that, on the one hand, farmers will not be able to do it and, on the other hand the Revenue Commissioners will not get any money from them or will not be able to police the system is no excuse. We do not allow people to go around driving cars while drunk just because there are not enough policemen to catch them.  We say that it is against the law and if someone is in contravention of the law and is caught he will be fined or imprisoned. The machinery is there to collect tax on accounts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> The amount of bookkeeping that farmers will have to do is very small. When people think of bookkeeping they think of the small shopkeeper or different professions or business they might be in and, with the present regulations and VAT and so on, there is an enormous amount of bookkeeping for even the smallest shop.  But for farmers there is nothing like the same amount of bookkeeping.  If they wish to keep books for income tax then it is a very minute set of records they have to keep.  Any good farmer will keep a more elaborate set of books in order to show what kind of enterprise he is making money on and so on.  But to comply with the income tax regulations for the Revenue Commissioners the amount of bookkeeping is very small.  If a farmer uses his cheque book for doing business and lodges all his money the amount of bookkeeping is minimal.  There is no comparison with the amount of bookkeeping that other sections of the self-employed community have to do.  The argument goes on that farmers will not produce accounts. Every other section of the self-employed community is given an estimated assessment of tax at the start of the year and if they do not wish to contradict that estimated assesment then the amount of tax estimated is collected.  If they do not pay up immediately the sheriff will eventually come around and collect it.  The reason self-employed people do their accounts and produce their books is usually to show that their real profit is less than what is estimated by the Revenue Commissioners.  But for administrative purposes the tax inspectors in the Revenue Commissioners would be quite glad not to have the problem of people sending in their accounts and to collect on the estimated assessments.  It will be no different with the farmers.  Is anyone going to tell me if a farmer's income tax is assessed at £5,000 and he should be paying only about £1,000 that he is not going to keep records to show that he should only be paying £1,000.  Farmers are as cute as any other section of the community.  A farmer will not pay £4,000 just because he does not keep a few records.  The machinery exists within <Col N="1080" /> the Revenue Commissioners to collect the money irrespective of whether the farmers keep accounts.  It is no excuse to say it cannot be done like that.</P>
    <P>Since the budget the newspapers, in particular one newspaper, seem to be deliberately trying to highlight a confrontation between two sections of the community.  Newspapers are in the business of selling their papers and making a profit but they must work in the interest of the community and not just themselves.  They should not bring about a situation where one section is fighting the other section.  The media in general, both TV and newspapers, seem to be more interested in confrontation among politicians or sections of the community than in any constructive debate.  Perhaps it is a sign of the times that generally people do not read articles in the papers very thoroughly; they tend to look at the headlines and form their opinions from such headlines.  This may be due to the increased pace of life and the fact that people do not have so much time.</P>
    <P>I have never said that the income tax system is sacrosanct.  It is not like the Ten Commandments.  The system is a device thought of by man to collect money to run public services.  If there is a better system, I am prepared to discuss changing our present methods.  In an income tax system all people should pay the same rate.  I am prepared to look at other forms of collecting revenue so long as they are applied across the board.</P>
    <P>The PAYE sector has been contributing approximately 85 per cent of the total income tax collected.  Those people have been saying that this is more than their fair share of taxation and they maintain the self-employed are not paying enough.  The problem here is that PAYE is an exact system of collecting tax and I think there are one or two reasons why there is a sense of grievance about it.  Workers in a factory know that basically they are all paying the same rate.  Some may have more allowances but they know that the tax is collected at source, that they are paying the right amount and that there is no fiddling. However, we do not know when we pay cash across the counter in a shop or a pub, to a doctor, dentist, solicitor or accountant <Col N="1081" /> that he is paying his fair share of tax.  The tax of the self-employed is computed on a different basis.  These people have to wait until the end of the year before they do their accounts.  The PAYE person is not sure that people who are self-employed are paying their fair share because of the different method of calculation.  I am prepared to say that the vast majority of self-employed are paying their fair share but, like the 10 per cent of social welfare recipients who abuse the system, it is the 10 per cent of self-employed who evade taxes that give that sector a bad name.  It is like a county football team that has one or two over-robust or dirty players who give the team a bad name.</P>
    <P>The question of tax evasion is much over-estimated.  I think the complaints of the PAYE people are due to a kind of social philosophy.  When that sector say it is paying too much and the self-employed are paying too little, these people are really saying to one another that if they had the chance they would fiddle their taxes, that if they had the opportunity they would not give the correct returns.  They are imputing motives to others and that is their underlying philosophy in this whole argument.</P>
    <P>What is the reason for that?  The PAYE people do not see where their taxes go.  Income tax is disincentive to greater productivity and to overtime. The question of income tax raises queries regarding social conditions.  People want to have more money in their pockets to spend as they wish.  They want more disposable income, whether to spend on an extension to their house or on drinking.  Politicians may make noises and talk about the public conscience. The people we represent may subscribe to this in public but they are also saying that, while they want to pay less tax, at the same time they want more services.  That cannot be done.  If we want more services and more social equality, the people in employment must pay tax.  However, the underlying philosophy of the self-employed and the PAYE sector is that they want more disposable income and less money going to the Exchequer.  This matter could be discussed at a later date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> There are certain anomalies in the income tax system which could be corrected. These would help the PAYE people. I do not see why travelling expenses to and from work should not be allowed to the PAYE sector.  People who carry on their own business are allowed such expenses.  There are different schedules within the Income Tax Acts that allow this.  A self-employed person can get the benefit of travel expenses, depreciation on a car and so on, but this does not apply to the PAYE people.  I see no reason why the Minister, in talks with the interested parties should not give this concession.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about evasion of taxes.  I read in the papers recently that the Revenue Commissioners have given rewards to people who have informed on others.  Perhaps I am old-fashioned. I come from a rural background where the word &ldquo;informer&rdquo; has not happy memories for many peo-ple. Perhaps the social climate has changed.  For reasons of social conscience and so on, perhaps people are prepared to point the finger at those who evade their taxes or abuse the social welfare system or are in contravention of the law.  Perhaps that is the way to think, but personally I do not advocate anybody being part of a system of spying or informing on other people. Perhaps I could be accused of telling people not to uphold their public duty but my personal feeling is against such a system.</P>
    <P>Within the framework of the budget the increase in the interest allowable against income tax from £2,000 to £2,400 is worthwhile.  This £2,000 has remained since 1973 and it was only in this budget that it was increased by 20 per cent.  If it had been increased in line with other allowances since 1973 the figure would be far greater than £2,400. Prior to 1973 you could have your total interest allowed against income tax. There were reasons then for saying you should get only £2,000.  Part of the reason related to the fact that there was no capital gains tax.  Since then we have capital gains tax and I ask the Minister for Finance to increase the allowable interest figure further because the amount <Col N="1083" /> of interest payable on a mortgage on any reasonable house quickly accumulates. If somebody has a bank overdraft and perhaps a car loan, his interest payments will pretty quickly reach £2,000 or £2,400.  The figure is far too low.</P>
    <P>Much trouble, particularly for small business people, could be overcome if the thresholds for exemption for value-added tax were increased substantially.  I happened to be on the committee which examined the VAT Bill and it did in-crease the thresholds by roughly 50 per cent which means that if a shop-keeper now has a turnover less than £18,000 he does not have to register.  Registering for VAT for people under £50,000 turnover creates enormous difficulties and involves an inordinate amount of bookkeeping. These thresholds should be greatly increased.  The amount of VAT collected from the small shopkeeper with a mixed business is very low.  I believe statistics would bear me out; in grocery shops where I think the majority of goods are nought per cent the amount of VAT collected is very low and does not warrant the bookeeping involved.</P>

      <P>There were other matters I wished to speak on but since my time has run out I shall conclude by saying that I should not like this budget to be remembered, as it is going to be remembered, whether we like it or not, as the budget that brought about this continued confrontation between the PAYE sector and the farmers.  The overall strategy of the budget for good or evil &mdash; people may have different viewpoints about whether the strategy is <Col N="1084" /> right or wrong &mdash; has been forgotten and we are going down this side road.  I see the budget as part of the overall plan enunciated in the manifesto of June 1977 which we have lived up to in the budgets of 1978 and 1979.  Whether people agree with our strategy or not we have been consistent in what we have done and our plan has been as outlined in the Green Paper and in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the 1977 election raised people's expectations.  If any political party promises X, Y or Z at an election, ex-pectations are raised to such a level that whatever party comes into power in any future election will have trouble unless people realise that it is only hard work by themselves and the community that will increase the cake and that individual standards of living will be improved.  No Government can do more than administer and cut up the cake in a better way, give an impetus here or a reduction there.  I fear people are beginning to think that the State owes them a living. People must realise that it is they themselves who will make or break the country.  Naturally politicians like to be elected, and we may have contributed to a state of euphoria so that expectations keep on going up and nobody wants to make sacrifices or take a cutback, whether PAYE worker or farmer; everybody wants more; but if, as politicians, we can make people realise that the Government of whatever party can only help and that it is the people themselves who must make the grade in the long run and that nobody owes them a living except themselves, we will have done a good day's work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget will surely go down in history as one of the greatest political blunders.  I can easily sympathise with the Fianna Fáil backbenchers trying to justify the budget or convince themselves that it is a good budget.  It is easy to convince oneself when one wants to believe.  If one wants to go down a dark tunnel wearing dark glasses there is no problem in poking in the dark.  Convincing oneself about the budget is not what is important; it is to convince the electorate that we represent here.  I can say that if there was an election this year some young new Members <Col N="1085" /> who are trying to justify this budget have had their chances seriously jeopardised by the way in which this budget was presented.</P>
      <P>On budget day when I observed some of the potential aspiring Euro politicians I could see beautiful smiles on their faces as the Minister laboured for two hours with his budget statement.  They seemed very happy then but as the days passed and as people analysed what was in the budget for them, one now sees some of these aspiring Euro parliamentarians are not so happy with the outcome of the budget.  They are very disappointed.  I believe they will have an opportunity later in the year when the Minister for Finance is certain to introduce a mini-budget of coming across to the respectable side of the House, this side, and give the Minister for Finance his answer by voting with us against the budgetary proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the last general election Fianna Fáil campaigned on the basis of massive taxation concessions such as the removal of car tax, the removal of rates on domestic dwellings and substantial cuts for the PAYE group.  But this year's budget has almost nullified these concessions. The ICTU sought concessions for the PAYE sector to the extent of £100 million.  Estimates of Government receipts published prior to the budget showed that income tax will yield more than £800 million this year but we all know that 87 per cent of the income tax returns are from the PAYE group.  The increase in PAYE receipts is estimated to be more than one-third this year compared with last year.  In these circumstances the demand of the ICTU was reasonable and realistic.  The amount of the concessions sought represented less than the total amount of the tax concessions in last year's budget but the Minister for Finance showed his total lack of concern for the PAYE people by disregarding the ICTU demand and by offering concessions in this regard to the extent of £27 million or only a little more than a quarter of the amount sought. Naturally there was a reaction from the workers and many impartial commentators expressed the view that the budget had eliminated the possibility of a <Col N="1086" /> national wage agreement this year because of the failure to give reliefs to the PAYE group.</P>
    <P>In last year's budget the Minister proposed the abolition of wealth tax and substantial concessions in respect of capital gains tax.  These concessions benefited the 5,000 wealthiest people in the community.  We were told that this move would stimulate employment but the unemployment figure remains at more than 100,000.  Obviously, then, that policy failed.  If the wealth tax had not been abolished and if the capital gains tax had been retained at its previous level the Minister would have been in a position to concede another £25 million or so by way of income tax concessions to those in the PAYE band. At least that would have gone half way to meeting the ICTU demand and it might have resulted in the creation of the economic climate necessary for agreement on pay and incomes this year.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the circumstances I have outlined we can see the budget only as a conservative and anti-social device designed to antagonise rather than to appease people.  Whatever may have been said about the budget in the days after it was announced public reaction to the taxation measures have become stronger with each passing day.  We opposed the proposal to impose a 2 per cent levy on farmers in respect of sales because we regarded such a tax as regressive, a tax that hit the small farmer as much as it hit the rancher.  This party have been opposed always to regressive taxes. However, one of the reasons for the furious reaction of the farmers was that prior to the general election Fianna Fáil had led them to believe that if returned to office they would virtually abolish farmer taxation.  This year's budget represents a reneging on that promise but it was a promise that should not have been given in the first place because farmers must pay their fair share of taxation just like anybody else.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the Government antagonising the farmers they have succeeded in antagonising every section of the community by the way in which they have handled the 2 per cent levy question since then.  There was some merit in <Col N="1087" /> the concession announced by the Minister for Finance at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis in so far as that concession was designed to help the small farmer but there was no merit in the total capitulation of the Government to the farmers in abandoning the proposal. Regardless of what the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste may say about their meetings with the leaders of the farming organisations the people beleive that the Government gave in under pressure from the farmers.  The PAYE group have been antagonised to a point that is unprecedented in our history.  Throughout the country workers are protesting in the strongest terms and are threatening to engage in various forms of demonstration against other sectors of the economy who are refusing to pay their fair share of taxation or who have succeeded in avoiding tax.</P>
    <P>The Government must act quickly and decisively to ensure that farmers pay taxation in proportion to the amount contributed by the other sectors. Farmers, like everyone else, should be taxed on the basis of income.  The accounts system should apply to them and, of course, they should be allowed the same concessions as other income tax payers.  The principle in this whole area should be that people pay their fair share of tax irrespective of which line of economic activity they are engaged in. So far the Government have been free to apply this principle to farm incomes but, judging by their behaviour since the budget, we have no reason to believe that they will apply this principle in future.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the Minister for Finance has achieved the impossible, antagonising every sector of the economy by his taxation proposals.  In doing so he has threatened our economic future.  The public outcry about taxation has rightly focused attention on those in our community who evade paying taxes.  The Minister for Finance is undoubtedly aware of a recent statement by an official of the Revenue Commissioners that £50 million is being evaded in income tax annually.  The evasion has been carried out by the professional classes in <Col N="1088" /> the main, people who are amongst the most highly paid here.  They have all secured substantial incomes.  At the same time it is impossible for anybody on PAYE to evade even one penny of taxation.  Many old age pensioners pay taxes on the pension they receive from the State and even on the pension they receive from their former employers. That is a social scandal particularly when viewed against the fact that £1 million is being evaded in income tax weekly, according to an official of the Revenue Commissioners.  Regrettably, this pattern seems to be socially acceptable. What a scandal and a shame that such people go unapprehended evading paying their fair share of taxes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance should substantially increase the staff in the office of the Revenue Commissioners so that they can tackle this great social evil of tax evasion.  It should be made clear that tax evasion is a crime which is punishable by law.  Those found guilty of it should be brought before the courts so that the maximum publicity can be given to their case.  It is only by doing that that we have a chance of ever getting the money which justly belongs to the State. It is a disgrace that there is not sufficient staff in the Revenue Commissioners to tackle this crime in the way it should be tackled.  In effect, we have one law operating for one set of taxpayers and another for another set.  Tax evasion is also a crime against the rest of society because some people are literally robbing their neighbours while at the same time they enjoy all the services provided by the State.  One good thing that could come out of the Minister's mishandling of the taxation measures in the budget would be a demand for an end to tax evasion of such strength that he would have to act and provide extra staff at the office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The increases granted to social welfare recipients are welcome even though they fall short of what is required to help those unfortunate categories.  We must question a policy which gives social welfare recipients increases in the budget when just a month before budget day the Government commenced their policy of dismantling the food subsidies. <Col N="1089" /> By removing those food subsidies the Government took back what they gave away in the budget.  The budget will make a mockery of the Government's claim to be interested in social justice. The Minister knows better than anybody that the poorer sections of the community spend a greater proportion of their income on food than those in the upper income bracket.  The removal of the food subsidies was a deliberate blow to the standard of living of those in receipt of social welfare benefits and allowances. If the social welfare recipients were to be kept in line with the rest of the community they should have been given an increase of at least 25 per cent to compensate them for the loss of food subsidies.  The increases fell far short of that and not even the Government's well-oiled publicity machine would convince old age pensioners that they are better off now than they were 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>We were all shocked last weekend to read the figures produced by Dr. Brendan Walsh about emigration.  Dr. Walsh is to be congratulated on bringing to the attention of the public the reappearance of emigration which for so long was a national scourge.  The Government boasted that their economic policies would reduce unemployment and end emigration but, according to Dr. Walsh, some 20,000 people emigrated over the last three years.  The rate of emigration in 1978 amounted to 10,000 of our best young people.  I doubt if the Minister could contest the accuracy of Dr. Walsh's fears.  We are all aware that emigration, which was eliminated in the mid-seventies, has reappeared. Emigration has always been a traditional Fianna Fáil way of solving our unemployment problems and, obviously, it is being used again.  That is ample proof that the Government's economic policies have not worked and are not working.  It is frightening to think of what will happen if those economic policies do not work in the future.  If that happens there will be two consequences, massive unemployment coupled with renewed emigration.</P>
    <P>As in the past it is the young who emigrate and Dr. Walsh estimated that <Col N="1090" /> the vast majority of those who emigrated last year were in the 15-to 20-year-old category.  Once again, we are losing our best young people.  The so-called Fianna Fáil economic miracle is turning into an economic nightmare.  My party say: let Fianna Fáil get away from their blind commitment to private enterprise and instead use the State sector as a means of providing badly-needed employment.  If they do not, they will be providing employment only for the air and shipping lines in exporting our young people in ever-increasing numbers.</P>
    <P>We all know that next June there will be local and European elections.  This budget highlights another danger of the continuation of the Government in power.  Because of all the money they gave away last year and because there is now very little left in the kitty, they have to cut back on expenditure.  The main cutback will occur in the area of local authority expenditure, particularly with regard to housing and health services as well as roads and sanitary services.  I want to warn the Government that they will not be allowed to get away with this policy of sacrificing local authority expenditure at the expense of giving money to the wealthy classes.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his Ard Fhéis speech made it perfectly clear that his objective in the local elections was to secure Fianna Fáil control of local authorities so that they will keep quiet while their services are cut back.  The Labour Party will not let that happen, because those who will suffer most from this policy are those who need the greatest help from society.  The housing shortage is still a scandal.  Many areas of the health services are still a disgrace. Unless local authorities are given the money to do the job, this budget will have caused even greater public suffering than has been realised up to now.  We have in our own city 900 people on our waiting list for new homes.  Our policy of house building has been cut back because money is not being made available.</P>
    <P>We had a money cutback where it was most badly needed, that is, for the maintenance of local authority houses. In Limeick we have three large housing <Col N="1091" /> areas which were built in the mid-thirties and forties.  At that time they were considered up to standard but in modern society can be classified as not only substandard but, I suggest, unfit for human habitation.  Yet these houses belong to the local authority.  We in that authority cannot get adequate funds to carry out the necessary repairs to modernise them. By modernising I mean the installation of bathrooms, which everybody is entitled to.</P>
    <P>That is the policy of this Government. That is what the budget has meant to the people of Limerick city and to all those people living in local authority houses throughout the country.  We cannot get adequate funds to carry out repairs to local authority houses, yet these people are expected, and are continuing, to pay high rent.  I appeal to the Minister for the Environment to make the money available to us because he has a moral duty to get the money so that the people can be given what they are justly entitled to&mdash;a decent home to live in.</P>
    <P>There is another ludicrous situation. Every day we hear of houses fetching completely inflated prices.  I read in this morning's paper that there is a flat available in Dublin for £60,000.  There is no control over the house price situation. If people are prepared to pay these prices and have the money to do so, that is their business.  Local authorities have tenant purchase schemes and the people are expected to pay inflated prices.  Four or five years ago fortunate tenants purchased their local authority houses for £500 while other unfortunate tenants, because of economic reasons, were unable to purchase at that time.  They are now expected to pay an inflated price for those same houses&mdash;£5,000 or £6,000.  When will the Minister set an example and give leadership by trying to stabilise the price of house purchase?  He is allowing local authorities to charge unrealistic inflated prices which are beyond the means of those living in those houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seriously take a look at the tenant purchase scheme, review it and the local authorities should sell these houses at a fair price.  After all, <Col N="1092" /> these people have been paying the local authorities rents for a considerable number of years.  Some of those houses now being sold to those occupiers have been more than paid for on the rental system.  Yet we have the farcical situation that the Minister of a Government trying to control prices is aiding and abetting the local authorities at an inflated rate.  That is a scandal.  The Minister should immediately set about reviewing the tenant purchase scheme.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which will affect seriously the local authorities. Heretofore the Road Fund grant was given to local authorities without recoupment of VAT by the Minister for Finance.  This year, for the first time, the Minister for Finance will be taking back VAT from these grants.  This will have very serious repercussions for local authorities.  It is going to get people off jobs much sooner, because money to keep them there will not be available. The Minister for Finance is taking back a lot from the Minister for the Environment who was given those grants for the purpose of maintaining our roads at a reasonable standard.  The roads in our country at the moment are surely the worst in Europe.  If they are allowed to deteriorate as they are doing, the roads in primitive countries will be as good as ours.  We are failing to live up to our responsibilities.  The money was given to the local authorities to enable them to do the job they are expected to do.  Only the Minister for the Environment is in a position to allocate that money.  Surely he should see to it that maximum value is got for the money he allocates to local authorities and should immediately seek to prevent the Minister for Finance recouping a lot of it on the VAT policy.</P>
    <P>A matter of high priority for workers is the medical card.  A man with a family on a low income may not now qualify for a medical card.  Such people have already suffered severely because of the abolition of food subsidies, and they are now suffering further because of the withdrawal of medical cards.  The income limits are now unrealistically low. How can a Minister, chief executive officer or anybody else suggest that the husband and wife with £40.55 per <Col N="1093" /> week&mdash;and that would be 5p over the limit&mdash;are financially capable of meeting the cost of hospitalisation or doctor's care at home?  How can these people afford the terrible expense of hospital or to buy drugs when it is more than difficult for them to provide food for a week on such a small income?  Food prices are increasing on a daily basis, and we have a deafening silence about all this.  The Minister responsible appears to be lost, or else he does not care.  Of course, when the Minister was in Opposition he reminded the people of any increase in food prices that took place, and rightly so, because that was his duty.  But we were also told that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power they would not only control price increases but they promised in their manifesto to stabilise prices and bring down the cost of living. How false these promises seem now.</P>
    <P>We, the people of the country, have to endure and listen to announcements by the ESB of a frightening increase of 20 per cent in their charges.  I wonder if the Minister will come on television to announce this crippling blow that will have a resounding effect on the Irish economy.  It is unlikely that he will, and the social ills that are continuing to emerge and grow will be attributed to the problems of the Middle East.  We have been told that there are to be increases in the prices of oil and petrol.  We are told that this is a new system.  But the people were reminded daily, if not hourly, when the present Government were in Opposition, that if they were given the opportunity and power world economic prices would not make a difference&mdash;they would wave the magic wand to give all the people the living to which they are entitled.  In Government, Fianna Fáil knew that this was not possible because of world economic prices.  Now that they are in power what is happening?  They have beaten the Opposition in telling about increases.  They are so arrogant that they are not leaving it to the Opposition to tell about the increases.  They are telling us of the anticipated increases. That is how good they are at stabilising and controlling prices and keeping down the cost of living.  They are a complete failure.</P>
    <P>In an Adjournment debate last week a <Col N="1094" /> Deputy of the Labour Party recommended that in view of the abolition of food subsidies the eligibility limit for medical cards should be raised.  He was informed by the Minister that he, the Minister, had had discussions with the chief executive officers and that these officers had decided that there was no need to increase the income limits.  Surely this constitutes an abrogation of responsibility.  The chief executive officers are far removed from the realities of life, as indeed is the Minister, if they consider that the working-class family with four or five children do not need their income limit raised in every respect. Assessment of the increase in costs brought about by the abolition of food subsidies reveals that on milk alone the bill has increased by something like £1.50 or £2 per week for that type of family.  Of course, that is not taking into consideration butter, bread and other essential foods.  The Minister should not leave a decision such as this to the chief executive officers, who have enough power as it is.  In a matter of such social content as the income eligibility for medical cards the onus is on one person only, and that is the Minister, to ensure that persons in that category reap the benefits of the health services to which they are justly entitled.</P>
    <P>The Post Office workers who are on strike at the moment and their trade union have agreed to allow the Department of Social Welfare to implement an emergency service to ensure that little distress or hardship will be caused to people on disability benefit or in receipt of benefit for long-term illnesses.  We are thankful to the Post Office strikers and to their union for permitting this emergency service to take place.</P>
    <P>How concerned is the Minister for Social Welfare about the people throughout the country who are in receipt of sickness benefit and disability benefit?  How concerned is he about the people who have to go to the local employment exchanges so that they can get their cheques?  What are they confronted with?  There is no provision whatever made by the Department of Social Welfare to improve this service? There are many thousands of people in the country in receipt of those benefits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to compliment the Government on the budget package, which embraces every aspect of Irish life.  I believe that the Government's philosophy since they took office in 1977, is being continued in this budget, despite what Opposition speakers may say.  The manifesto announced by Fianna Fáil was clear and decisive.  While a lot of people may call it euphoria, I believe it is reality and has dealt with the problems which held the country back during the previous four years of Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>I have seen during the past few months an effort by the Opposition, the Press and the media to try to bring about polarisation between the different sections of the community.  I believe that the media are acting as the Opposition, because to all intents and purposes we have no Opposition in this House.  Banner headlines over the last few months have created that feeling throughout the community between urban and rural dwellers.  That attitude has been there since 1973.  The previous Minister and previous Coalition tried to create this polarisation.  This attitude has been resurrected in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great strides have been made in the budget in relation to the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  There has been taxation on cigarettes and alcohol. I am a compulsive smoker and the efforts of the Department of Health have made me more aware of the dangers to <Col N="1098" /> health so that I at least try to break the habit.  Perhaps next year or in 10 years' time if I'm still alive I will break the habit altogether.  The increased taxation on cigarettes has also made me more aware of the effects of smoking.</P>
    <P>There was no great outcry about the increase of taxation on drink.  I am also a drinker but not a heavy one although I once was.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Not compulsive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The increased price of alcoholic beverages plus the campaign by the Minister for Health to make people aware of the dangers of alcohol abuse are having their effect.  Ale and &ldquo;Guinness&rdquo; contribute to a social way of life and I would not consider them a health hazard.  The price of those have been increased enough and perhaps too much but the price of whiskey and other hard alcoholic drinks has not been increased enough.  An increase of 3p in the price of a half one is not enough, because we are getting into a situation where the problem of alcoholism is on the increase.  In any public house or licensed premises on any night of the week the youth of the country are soddenly drinking hard alcohol.  The price of hard alcohol should be further increased and perhaps people would revert back to the social pint of stout or ale.  I know there will be reaction against that from the multi-nationals or semi-multinationals who produce hard alcohol but something must be done to protect the people from the results of overindulgence in hard alcohol.</P>
      <P>Despite what the Opposition may say, the issuing of medical cards under the health scheme is operating more fairly than ever before, although there will be reviews and we as politicians must help our constituents when making applications. Because of the new eligibility limit in relation to the contributory health scheme more people can come into the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increased old age pension is welcome.  Perhaps the Government should have another look at the means test in the light of the circumstances of 1979.  The method of operation of the <Col N="1099" /> means test should be clear to people. Between the savings in the bank, house valuations and so on, a lot of confusion has been created among old age pension applicants in relation to the means test. A more simple system would help a lot of these people.  Social welfare benefits have also been increased to benefit the weaker sections.  The new programme of farmers' dole as it is commonly known will benefit those in most need.  The scheme where we are taking £2 million on the one hand and giving £2 million on the other is a scheme well handled where there is no loss to the Department.</P>
    <P>The substantially increased children's allowance may not be as much as we would like but it is a recognised increase. Perhaps the Minister would give some thought to changing the system of monthly payments so that people would have a choice of weekly payments.  This would not entail a lot of change and would benefit housewives in their weekly budgeting.</P>
    <P>In relation to PAYE I will refer to the philosophy of Fianna Fáil as set out in our manifesto where it is clearly stated that in two budgets we would double the income tax allowance.  That has now been achieved.  No matter what efforts are made at polarisation, Fianna Fáil's promises to the PAYE sector in the manifesto are being implemented totally and completely.  We have increased the income tax allowance.  Yet front bench Opposition spokesmen point the finger at us as if they did not know that happened at a time when the Government brought down inflation from around 22 per cent in 1975 to 7½ or 8 per cent last year.</P>
    <P>What reliefs may be given in the future to the PAYE sector?  We must provide benefits for those in our society who most need them.  Workers on PAYE who want to build a new house make an application for a loan from a county council or a corporation whose guidelines state that £3,500 is the maximum they can earn and still qualify for a loan.  We could make a major concession to PAYE workers in this area.  In my capacity as a TD, I often find that young married couples cannot qualify <Col N="1100" /> for a loan because of the application of the figure of £3,500.  Income tax paid under the PAYE code should be taken into account when they make an application for a loan.  Applicants for loans make a big input themselves both in the physical erection of the house and in their savings. There is one outstanding feature in county council or corporation loans, that is, the interest rate.  This is another area where we could give relief to the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>On the question of education grants, PAYE workers have to work long hours to enable their children to take advantage of third-level education.  Sometimes they find themselves above the guidelines because they have worked overtime.  Income tax paid should be taken into account in the allocation of those grants.  The Government are aware of this problem.  Real money in his pocket matters to the person in our society who is making a tremendous effort. PAYE workers should also be considered in the allocation of medical cards.  I do not know how much that would cost.  I am sure that in the coming year the Government will look at this aspect of loans, education grants, and medical cards if possible.</P>
    <P>It was timely and constructive that in the budget the Government considered the problem of the single parent.  The income tax relief granted in the budget is appreciated by people in that bracket. The relief in the interest rate on loans for houses is also welcomed by them. Another move in the proper direction was giving permission to savings banks to grant house mortgage loans.  It helps those who want to help themselves.  That is what good Government is about.</P>
    <P>In the matter of local government we have heard loud cries from the Fine Gael Party who failed to be re-elected in 1977 when they said our programme of rates relief was not on and could not be financed.  That programme was financed and is being financed.  They talk about county councils, corporations and town commissioners losing authority but that is not seen or felt by such bodies, and I say that categorically as a member of Galway County Council.  If we were to apply the same system of collecting <Col N="1101" /> money for the administration of local government and to give the services the Government are giving, we would have to have an increase in the rate of about £10 in the £.  That is an undeniable fact. If we had asked for an increase in the rate of £10 in the £ in the past two years, local government and the local elections in June would be the greatest joke of all time.  We never hear from the Opposition that rates have been abolished.  But when it is pointed out to the people in this manner they will judge the performance of Fine Gael and Labour, they will be clear about that decision of this Government and also in regard to the implementation of that part of their manifesto.</P>
    <P>I want to welcome in particular the reappearance of increased amounts from the Department of the Environment to local authorities for the local improvements scheme, which money was curtailed in the years 1974, 1975 and 1976. Indeed we look forward to the proposal for the new roads plans, in which I am sure our European partners will be lending a hand.  Now that the European Monetary System is on a solid road it is here the Government of the day will turn their attention.  Indeed it is clear that they have done so already.</P>
    <P>I want now to turn my attention to the agricultural proposals in the budget. This year the Department are spending £160 million on agriculture; in fact it is somewhere between £160 million and £170 million.  Bearing that fact in mind let us consider all the propaganda that has been issued and all the talk that has taken place in the past three weeks concerning farm taxation.  I shall not dwell too long on the subject except to point out the following facts and, in so doing, turn my attention to Fine Gael and Labour Members and ask them: what is their policy on taxation of agriculture? Today, and indeed last week, Deputy Cluskey said that the modified farm levy was unconstitutional; he may not have used those words but that is what he meant.  Today Deputy Lipper says: why did the Government&mdash;in the way in which he put it&mdash;drop the levy? Therefore, we have one section of the Labour Party contending it is wrong and the other section asking why it is wrong. <Col N="1102" /> The same applies to Fine Gael.  We have had the front bench of Fine Gael, for the sake of opposition only, crying as though they did not know exactly what were its implications.</P>
    <P>I want to give a few facts concerning a statement I made about the larger farmers who, through their organisations, appeared on the national network and who had stated they wanted to pay income tax.  There are 11,000 farmers in this country over £100 valuation.  There are a further 24,000 farmers with valuations between £60 and £100.  In all there are approximately 36,000 farmers over £50 valuation whose contribution last year, through the accounts system, was £36 million.  That clarifies the whole position.  There are 11,000 farmers with valuations in excess of £100 standing on what I consider to be approximately £20 billion worth of property, who contributed to the State £36 million, and they said they want accounts.</P>
    <P>The statistics are not up to date.  We know what happened the old ones&mdash;Deputy Kelly's party decided they had not £5 million to spend on taking a census.  Out of 26,000 farmers in County Galway there are 23,500 with valuations of less than £30 and out of 26,000 there are some 25,500 with valuations under £20.  Could one credit that in the county of Galway the latest statistics show that there are 23,500 farmers out of a total 26,000 with valuations under £30 and 25,500 out of 26,000 with valuations under £20.  I listened on national television to every one of the farming organisations talking about the abolition of the modified levy and bringing farm accounts down to valuations of £15, as though they were the people who would administer the taxation proposals for the farming community this year.  I saw red&mdash;that the farming organisations wanted an accounts system; because such suited the larger farmers the smaller farmers should pay for them.  I am reassured that this Government would never allow such to happen.  Until such time as the large farmers of this country, over £50 valuation, are prepared to pay income tax, this Government will not renege on that proposal.  The accounts system is beneficial to the larger farmer <Col N="1103" /> because, in depreciation alone, he can write off thousands of pounds.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Fine Gael Deputies of Counties Galway, Mayo, Clare, Kerry, Sligo, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Longford, Offaly&mdash;indeed I could continue to go around the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to come here and tell us that they are prepared to back the IFA in their attempt to command the Government to drop the threshold for taxation purposes from £50 to £15. Does Deputy Kelly, who is in the House today, agree with that, since he is a philosopher of one description or another?  Can he justify the big farmers demand that the threshold be dropped to £15.  It cannot be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The modified levy which I believe may yet be advocated is a good one for all the counties that I mentioned.  Lambs are now being sold on the hard-won French markets which this Government recently got from Paris and which were unable to be found by the previous Government.  When the Government came into office lambs were being sold at prices from £8 to £16 and are today being sold at £40 to £45.  They are free from the levy.  Sugar beet in all the western counties is free from the levy. Because of the hinterland problems surrounding the Tuam factory, the profit from an acre of beet in County Galway or County Mayo is not comparable to an acre of wheat in Mallow or Carlow. This concession was given because it was checked and found to be genuine.  I thought that the levy on milk up to 5,000 gallons which is equivalent to approximately £2,500 in terms of PAYE tax allowances was fair and equitable but this was modified.  All pigs were excluded from the levy, and rightly so, because the levy was being paid already on the resultant manufactured food stuffs. Barley and cereals going into the local depots were not included in the levy because that is not a point of manufacture. The ranchers and the dealing men <Col N="1104" /> of the country who bring the cattle from the marts to the point of export&mdash;the men who are the multi-millionaires of this country today and who, I am sure, have never paid an iota of tax yet&mdash;were caught by the levy.  In a supply and demand trade did anyone think that they could pass the levy down?  That cannot be done.  We know what was passed down previously.  We remember it quite clearly in 1974 when Deputy Clinton and the IFA had very little to say concerning the price of livestock at that time.  The dealers had very little sympathy with them when livestock were being given away, literally stolen, by the vested interests.  There is no passing down of the levy now.  I think I have made my point clear.  I would like to see how the IFA and the farm organisations, and particularly the Land League who represent the small farmers, would react to the dropping of the threshold from £50 to £15.  Fianna Fáil philosophy down the years has been very clear. When we see the people with valuations of £50 and upwards paying their fair share of tax, then we can consider who else can make a contribution.  But no effort can be made until such time as that is done.  I trust the Government to see to it that an equitable share will be collected from them.</P>
    <P>The fact that in this budget the Government are investing £165 million in Irish agriculture is surely a unique performance.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> today we see the cost to the farmer of the eradication of brucellosis and TB. We know how rampant this disease is in the country.  Some of us remember who is responsible for the situation that we now find ourselves in.  Deputy Mark Clinton, Minister for Agriculture, could not get a few shillings out of the coffers of the Coalition Government to continue to implement the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government for the eradication of disease in our herds.  Today the farmers are paying the price for it.  The Government's policy is to give help to those farmers who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in this terrible mess.  The grant aid scheme for the eradication of these diseases is certainly welcome.  While every effort is being made by the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1105" /> to help those farmers to speed up payments to them, perhaps the Department and the Minister would have another look at the problem to see if they could move faster on it.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to the job-creation programme of the Government.  We have the small industries section of the IDA.  The efforts and the policies of this Government are helping every entrepreneur in the country to develop in whatever way he sees fit.  I wish to pay a tribute to the county development officers and the county development teams, particularly in my own county and in the neighbouring counties, for the way in which they are now co-operating with the smaller people to help create jobs and create a firm foundation for small family firms.  It is money well spent because, no matter what people say about the big industry that may change the whole life style of a town, the small family firms now being aided liberally by this Government are most certainly the best type of firm to have because in these responsibility, reliability and continuity are almost guaranteed.</P>
    <P>We have seen the strides that have been made in the building and construction industry, which is also being helped by the Government, and correctly so. The building industry is a broadly-based industry giving great employment.  The environmental schemes for youth are again enshrined in the budget after the experience of last year, which proved to be a very fruitful exercise.  Here we have £20 million being made available to our youth to give them employment here, and that also is money well spent.  The work experience programme is one of the finest schemes ever put into operation, because we have industry, business and every establishment of Irish life taking the untrained youth and giving it appropriate experience.  The six-month programme could be extended for another six because it is a good apprenticeship and it is money well spent.  I suggest to the Government that they might be able to bring it to the point where the student or apprentice could obtain a certificate after passing an examination.</P>
    <P>Another point that must be made is the situation regarding oil and petrol.  It <Col N="1106" /> is a small thing to ask the Irish people to resurrect a national spirit.  This will be necessary if we are to continue the progress the Government have made.  Individuals should cut their petrol consumption by at least 10 per cent.  It should be done immediately.  It would give a lead and this much-needed energy could be diverted into new industries.  By making that small cut only our leisure activities would be slightly affected.  The national spirit should be rekindled.</P>
    <P>People in employment should remember the unemployed.  In the EMS we have a golden opportunity given to us by our partners in Europe and achieved as a result of sound negotiation by our Ministers.  We can attain full employment in the early 1980s if we play our part.  Those in employment must remember that there are many who are not so lucky.  When they are making demands people in employment should know the facts of the situation.  Eventually the employed will have to pay for those out of work.  There must be a new division of the national cake.  If we can attain full employment by the early 1980s we will be remembered as a nation of Irish people as good if not better than those idealistic people in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start by admitting that there are some positive elements in the budget and I will list them.  It will not take me long to do so, but I will list them for what they are worth.  Fine Gael welcomed the continuance of stock relief and the continuance of the employment maintenance scheme.  For myself I welcomed the idea of allowing premiums paid on permanent sickness and accident policies to be deductible for income tax purposes.  Perhaps I should declare an interest in this, in that I have such a policy.</P>
      <P>Of course there were the routine social welfare increases that scarcely deserve a mention.  There was nothing spectacular about them.  They were absolutely predictable and no Government of any colour can expect to be particularly highly praised for not departing from such a routine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall speak later about the broader <Col N="1107" /> purpose of a budget.  Within the budget there are at least two highly negative elements which must be emphasised and which have not attracted enough attention so far.  First, there is the ending of the gross cost allowance in regard to new plant and equipment which the Minister announced in his speech and which will have the effect of increasing substantially the burden on industry, particularly industry that is in the process of re-equipping itself.  It is true that there was a certain anomaly in the way the allowance was calculated, as the Minister pointed out.  Its effect was that the Exchequer gave tax relief in respect of a considerable element of expenditure which the Exchequer itself had borne. That is undeniable, and I suppose when looked at in that light it was an anomaly. However, the world is full of anomalies; and a Government who are professedly anxious to make life as easy as possible for industry, and particularly for manufacturing industry, should avoid the removal even of an anomaly where no serious social purpose will be achieved by its removal, where all that will be achieved is a relatively marginal saving in the context of a national budget.</P>
    <P>Another highly negative element in the budget is the disposition whereby the Minister decided &ldquo;that the relief ordinarily allowable in respect of bank interest should be scaled down appropriately in cases where an employee enjoys a preferential rate of interest.&rdquo;  He stated that the reduced relief in such cases will be computed by reference to the proportion that the actual rate of interest paid bears to a specific rate.  He has not said what is the specified rate, but if we take it to the average rate on a mortgage&mdash;say, 14 per cent&mdash;and compare that with the preferential rate that is common among employees of banks, insurance companies, building societies and service enterprises of that kind, which account for many thousands of households in the city and in other towns, the difference is in the region of 10 or 11 per cent.  Depending on the size of the person's income and the level at which the allowance will make a difference <Col N="1108" /> to the tax incidence, it will deprive him of from £3 to £6 a week in cash.</P>
    <P>I am all in favour of people being dealt with equitably and I shall return to this theme later.  But a Government must realise that an executive wage claim even in a non-producing category&mdash;in other words, in a service category or one that does not mean that wage cost inflation will make Irish products uncompetitive&mdash;means that large wage claims there will spill over into every other sector.  To produce a measure of this kind purely for the purpose of saving a relatively small amount of money for the revenue is a directly inflationary move.  I am surprised to find that in the budget of a Minister who professedly, like all his colleagues, is trying or says he is trying to contain inflationary wage demands. That particular measure, once the realisation of it has sunk in, is certain to fuel wage demands even further&mdash;it infallibly will.  Those are the two negative elements I select from the actual Budget Statement.  Others have already been dealt with, but I think these two have not yet attracted sufficient attention and I felt I ought to emphasise them.</P>
    <P>Regarding the figures on which the budget is based, leaving aside the dispute between the leader of my party and the Minister for Finance&mdash;I am surprised the Minister has not yet entered the debate in order to vindicate this point of view&mdash;the very least that could be said is that the Budget Statement is based on an estimate of revenue for the year pitched at the optimistic extreme.  The Budget Statement and its accompanying literature, the Economic Background to the Budget, are at least insufficiently frank in regard to the likely inflation rate in 1979.  I can imagine the Government's political reasons, some not by any means dishonourable, for trying to conceal its estimate of what the inflation rate is going to be; but we must establish some standards of frankness or candour in important economic statements such as a Budget Statement, and the least that can be said about the Minister's performance in his Budget Statement is that it fails the frankness and candour test in both regards.  He might at least have said <Col N="1109" /> that his revenue projection far exceeded estimates made by other people; and his inflation estimate, or the implicit inflation estimate, was something which should have been expressed in words, or the Dáil should have been given adequate reasons why it was not so expressed.</P>
    <P>We are beginning to enter a period in which conflicts about figures are occurring every other day.  Not very long ago people did not fight about figures; they were accepted, particularly official figures, and if they were available one did not fight about them.  But every other week now there is a row about cooked figures, or unavailable or opaque figures that one cannot understand or get a grip on.  That is a bad way for a Government to act that has not yet been in office for two years.  It is setting a precedent which the National Coalition never set.  It is bad if from now on we are to have regular conflicts about percentages in regard to inflation, in regard to revenue, figures in regard to unemployment and production.</P>
    <P>I honestly feel that in spite of all the denials about not cooking the books and no falsification the Minister began his task by saying to himself: &ldquo;I have to produce figures which will make it appear that the politically dictated targets of 1977 have been achieved, or are in course of achievement, and everything else must be made to fit that&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There was a mythical Greek figure called Procrustes who had a bed in which he placed his victims.  When he could not make the victim fit the bed, he chopped off the victim's feet to accommodate him more comfortably within the alloted space.  The Minister for Finance and the other members of the Government are involved, whenever they now produce figures, in what I have to call a Procrastean operation.  They know that they are confined by the parameters, if you do not mind&mdash;a Merrion Street word&mdash;of their political targets; and everything else is cut down or inflated or trimmed or pumped up in order to fit those parameters.  That is a bad habit for a Government to get into. It tends to devalue the language of Budget Statements and the credibility of <Col N="1110" /> Ministers for Finance.  It tends to alert us to the strong likelihood&mdash;if this Government is still in office&mdash;that we shall be given the same type of figures next year. It alerts the public generally to the increasing unreliability and contentiousness and questionableness of official figures.  That is completely apart from the fact that it is possible for estimates to differ.  I make no special reference to the fact that the Central Bank, which is also an arm of the State, has produced an estimate of 1978 economic growth which is very substantially below the estimate which the Government produced, naturally again in consequence of the Procrustean operation of trying to get the figure to suit what it said two years ago the figure would be.</P>
    <P>The confidence one might have in the Government's accuracy in regard to figures is from the beginning undermined by the experience we have had over the past couple of years when we discovered in consequence of the EEC Labour Force Survey taken up in April and May 1977, that at a time when the Fianna Fáil Party were telling the people that there were 160,000 unemployed, there were in fact just a shade over 100,000.  The EEC survey, made up in those very months when the manifesto was being printed, or at least when the finishing touches were being put to it, in April and May, showed that there were 85,000 people out of work who had previously held jobs, plus about 15,600 school leavers or people in a similar category who had not yet had a job, who were looking for jobs.  That gave a total of 100,600.  That is less than 101,000. That did not prevent the present Minister for Economic Planning and Development producing the figure of 160,000 and standing over that figure in the House subsequent to his election.</P>
    <P>To me that is the thirteenth stroke of the clock.  A Government that can produce figures like that, so wildly out, and not by a mistake but because it politically suited them to be wrong, because it was to their political advantage to make a howler of that magnitude, are digging away the ground from under themselves as regards their <Col N="1111" /> credibility where figures are concerned.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say regarding the actual provisions which the budget contained and the figures on which it is based.  The figures cannot be trusted; and some of the measures which I have just mentioned are positively detrimental. I leave out the farm levy to which I shall return later.</P>
    <P>The Budget is more than just a parcel of fiscal adjustments.  Ever since Keynes it has been acknowledged that it is more than that.  It is the major instrument of social adjustment, and the major implement of Government; perhaps to the extent that the implement may need fine tuning it is perhaps a good thing that it ought be employed more than once a year though not necessarily always to impose taxation.  As the major weapon of government it is a good thing that the budget should be related to a strategy&mdash;I had better not say philosophy.  That word was booted about this morning by Deputy Killilea, and I note that he has the distinguished example of the Taoiseach in this regard, who said at column 802 of the Official Report of 8 February that he wanted to emphasise the &ldquo;basic philosophy&rdquo; of Fianna Fáil policy.  Can you beat it? This is more devaluation of ordinary language.  We were brought up in school to think of philosophers, so far as we had any clear picture in mind at all, as beings who were detached, had no personal axe to grind, who sought truth wherever it could be found, who followed wherever the path of logic might lead, not people who wanted to get into office and stay there by any means.  That is not a philosopher and the periodical statements put out by people of that kind is not philosophy.</P>
    <P>My understanding of a philosopher was of someone like Diogenes, the man who lived in a barrel, who was self-sufficient. He was a kind of Grecian de Valera.  He believed that man should be satisfied with the most frugal existence possible.  That was why he lived in a barrel. When Alexander the Great asked if he could do anything for Diogenes, Diogenes replied that the emperor could do something, that he could stand out of <Col N="1112" /> the light.  That was the type of ancient philosopher about whom we learned at school; and strangely enough that philosophy was not too far removed from the only thinking that could ever be regarded as philosophy on the part of Fianna Fáil, that was, the philosophy articulated by de Valera and which in turn was very similar to the philosophy articulated by Arthur Griffith.</P>
    <P>But that is not the philosophy that Fianna Fáil can boast of any longer.  It is a philosophy that has been subverted and thrown over by them; and what they are articulating now is a Diogenes philosophy in reverse.  If one can imagine the parable of Dives and Lazarus being cast into philosophic from, Dives is now the philosopher on whom the Government's approach to the world is based. As Deputy McCreevy was honest enough to say here this morning, they have wantonly and for short-term political advantage exploited people's cupidity and raised their expectations. Now they are crying about the people being selfish.  How, for example, can one accuse a child of greed and selfishness if the child has been led to believe that if he cries long enough his indulgent parents who wish to have a night's sleep or, to turn the metaphor into political terms, wish to remain on the Government benches, will hand him out packets of sweets?  What else could be expected from a child treated in that way but greed and selfishness?</P>
    <P>When I hear the Government lecture the trade unions about excessive wage demands I can only ask what other example has been given to the workers.  I am not trying in any way to make matters difficult nationally.  I am not trying to soup up wage demands.  I realise that wage cost competitiveness is vital to us, and that, to the extent to which this competitiveness is not achieved, jobs will be lost or ones that might have been created will not be created.  At the same time it is an unseemly spectacle to see Ministers in dinner jackets at chartered accountants dinner functions lecturing the unions on restraint in wage demand.  When has the worker ever learned restraint from those Ministers or from those well-to-do people who were so jubilant when Fianna <Col N="1113" /> Fáil were returned to power, who made no secret of the fact that they were returning from the Bahamas because the boys were back in office?  Where is the philosophy in that?</P>
    <P>That does not alter the fact that a State like ours, particularly a revolutionary State, and I use the word &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; in a quiet sense, founded on the idealism of men on all sides of the House, ought to have a philosophy and that philosophy ought to underlie our fiscal and budgetary measures.  If instead of using the word &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; we use the word &ldquo;target&rdquo;, it may be said that we have a common target on all sides, that is, the achievement of full employment and the ending of a situation in which people cannot find jobs.  But we know the factors which threaten that target.  These are excessive wage claims and, associated closely with that factor, the problem of bad industrial relationships.  These are the enemies.  To switch for a moment from the metaphor of philosophy to the metaphor of war, if the budget contains a strategy, that strategy can be articulated in military terms.  The object of a strategy in terms of war is to seek out and destroy the enemy.  So far as concerns the objective of budgetary policy in a State like ours, the enemy must be excessive wage inflation and the associated bad industrial relations.  I am not alone in saying that.  I can produce umpteen sources where independent people have been saying this also.</P>
    <P>Though the Government have been talking continually about their targets, I have noticed a consistent observation on the part of independent people to the effect that the Government are confusing the statement of the target with the methods needed to achieve it.  They think it is sufficient to articulate a target and to add various provisos.  The whole point is to realise those provisos.  That is what government is about and the target will then look after itself.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the White Paper last month I quoted Mr. Ivor Kenny, who is the managing director of the IMI. On that occasion the Chair and I had some words because of my trying so elaborately to make it clear that I was <Col N="1114" /> acquitting Mr. Kenny of political involvement. Maybe I am doing him too much justice, but I accept that he is an independent observer.  He said that he was afraid the Government were confusing targets with the necessary preconditions for achieving those targets.  Only last week the same view was expressed, but in slightly different language, by Senator Whitaker in the other House, who is a nominee of the Taoiseach's although I am not making any special point about that.  I shall quote the Senator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <P>I shall not contradict the existence of such a rule but I am prepared to bet £1 with the Chair that it is a slavish copy of some 17th century convention of the British Parliament, and I shall not be bound by it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator said that the targets set out in the White Paper were <Col N="1115" /> less important than are the conditions for their fulfilment.  He enumerated those targets in the same way as I have enumerated them.  These are pay restraint, and good industrial relations. All the talk about objectives, about the Government taking their courage in their hands, is a bottle of smoke unless the Government measures are conducive to the production of those preconditions.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the way in which those preconditions have been aimed at in this budget and let us have regard to the kind of world in which these preconditions must be met.  Perhaps I might digress here for a moment and make a few general remarks about the kind of world in which the budgetary proposals must operate.  It is important that we should keep an eye on the hardening of our own mental arteries.  We should make sure that we are not fighting the battles of 1979 with the unchallenged assumptions of 1939 or 1949.  It is important that we should try to get a perspective on ourselves which can make us reasonably sure that we are keeping up with the way the world is moving.</P>
      <P>I know all about leadership and how one must try to give the world a lead, but there are large incoherent and inarticulate fluctuations in the world's history which are not always initiated or controlled by politicians, but which can wash over politicians unless they see how the world is moving.  In the 18th or 19th century it would have been thought beyond discussion that the death penalty was appropriate for theft.  It was beyond question in the early 19th century and accepted by all classes that the defence of property was the main object of the law, the maintenance of order.  That point of view has gone out the window, it has gone like last year's snow off the ditch.  In the later 19th century it was an absolutely unquestioned assumption on which governments, and their subjects, operated that the State had no role in social support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the assumption which directly contributed to the fact that the amount of assistance provided in Ireland during the famine was so incredibly small by comparison with what today would be <Col N="1116" /> thought an acceptable level of government intervention.  The intervention then was by a government which was then the most prosperous and advanced government in the world; but Peel and his government in the 1840s behaved in the same way as any other government would have behaved.  It was an axiom of government in those days that they did not interfere, expect in a marginal way, to stave off even the most appalling natural calamities.  People were supposed to look after themselves and the State did not carry any duty beyond maintaining order and defending property.</P>
    <P>Later in the 19th century and in the early 20th century it was an axiom again that governments were supposed to balance their budgets.  It was as a result of taking that axiom seriously&mdash;at least that is part of the political folklore of the country&mdash;that the first government of the country left office, because in order to balance their tiny budget, in order to save the wretched £500,000 or £250,000 necessary to leave the State able to hold its head up and not be in debt, our first Minister for Finance removed a shilling from the old age pension.  According to the political folklore which Deputies will no doubt accept, he left the party to which he belonged in the wilderness for 16 years as a result.  He had not spotted that the world was moving and was changing.  He did not understand that those points of view were no longer acceptable, that one could not break the ten shilling note of an old man who used it to purchase tobacco and to buy sweets for his grandchildren even to balance a budget, or that one would do so at one's peril.</P>
    <P>I want the Government and the House to make sure that they are not ignoring the way the world is moving today and not trying to fight today's battles on yesterday's assumptions.  I am afraid that just as one can still see our Army vehicles going around with ZC and ZD registrations and with equipment which is 25 or 30 years old&mdash;I recall that when I was in the FCA as a school boy in the late forties I had a rifle which had been made at the time of the Boer War&mdash;one will find all kinds of analogies in a small and not very <Col N="1117" /> prosperous State like ours for not being able to keep up with the times where it is only a matter of money&mdash;but there is no excuse for not keeping up with the times when it comes to trying to see the way people's minds are working.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and the Government, are living in a society in which the handing out of another few pounds per week will not make people happy.  That may be wrong, it may be deplorable and a threat to our wage cost structure, our industries and so forth but it is the truth. People will not thank us any longer for an annual rate of wage increase which will leave them at the end of their working lives no better off in any serious way than at the beginning.  They want a horizon for their lives, they want to be able to look out and see some social mobility for themselves or, if not for themselves, at least for their children.  If they find themselves trapped in a hopeless suburb like that which Deputy Lipper spoke of in regard to Limerick, with their children because of deprivation going back a couple of generations and not just bad schooling, they find that a complex of factors are operating against them and likely to keep on operating against them and their children.</P>
    <P>Naturally such people want to make a great leap forward.  I should like to make it clear at this stage that I am not taking sides in regard to any of the present disputes and I share the Government's view that wage-cost inflation is a deadly danger.  However, a postman, a dustbin man or any of the kind of people who are in chronic dispute with the Government may say to himself that he needs one joint leap forward in order to bring him into the situation where he has a social horizon for himself and his children and, thereafter, annual wage increases of a modest kind could be discussed. Such a man may feel that they cannot do that kind of heavy work indefinitely, his wife may be getting on and on tablets, his children may not prove to be the success he hoped at school.  All that builds up into a complex of worry and frustration in the mind of a man in his thirties or forties and those things are now related to what can be got from the political establishment.  They are now <Col N="1118" /> related to what the Government can be forced to do for such people in the years they have left.  They are no longer in the dark about how some people live their lives, the way their fathers or grandfathers were in the days when there was no television or press coverage of social occasions and when one could not fly off to Tenerife, the Canaries for a rest at Christmas.  Those people are not in the dark any longer about how the other half live, and they do not like to be lectured by Ministers and, as a Marxist would say, the class that supports the Minister and has conspired to put him where he is.</P>
    <P>I am not a Marxist but, unfortunately, the kind of world we live in lends an eerie colour to the Marxist contentions in this regard.  People do not like being lectured to by the class I have referred to, a class of which a Minister is automatically given a membership ticket.  A worker may not like 4 or 5 per cent of an increase, but he would take it from a government which is seen to be doing justice all round and is struggling, perhaps against its own nature and background as the Fine Gael Party did, and against the instincts of some of its own supporters, towards achieving some kind of equality.  Fine Gael fought through a world recession but the people who were required to carry the burdens could look around and see that everybody else was carrying their share. That is the opposite of what this Government have achieved.  In getting into office they abolished the wealth tax.  There were loud vulgar cheers from the wealth tax class.  It is unseemly that somebody in the wealth tax category&mdash;I do not care what the industrial arguments are in favour of not chasing away capital&mdash;should be seen to exult at not having to pay anything.  It should be remembered that such a person was only asked to pay on whatever he had above his private house plus another £100,000. It is unseemly that he should be seen to exult and at the same time associate with an establishment which is lecturing workers on accepting 6 or 7 per cent on a weekly wage of £50, a good deal of which will be eaten up by inflation.</P>
    <P>I am not a communist or a doctrinaire socialist or Marxist, but I can see the unseemliness <Col N="1119" /> of that situation.  I will not lecture anybody in regard to moderation of wage increases as long as there is a government in office that does not have the courage, or that it politically does not suit, to impose burdens on everybody in the same way.  I know that it cannot be done literally in the same way, but everybody should be seen to be sweating at the same rate.</P>
    <P>The same thing could be said about the adjustments made in the capital gains tax.  What would a man living in the kind of place Deputy Lipper spoke about, a worn-out corporation suburb which in its day, the 1930s or 1940s, was a great improvement on the rookeries that the wretched people had been transplanted from, but now are not fit for human habitation, think when he finds that the Government composed of the party with the Diogenes' philosophy has remitted three quarters of capital gains tax?  What impact is that supposed to have on a man who will never make a capital gain, unless it is by backing a horse?  What impact is it likely to have on a man who is never likely to accumulate even a fraction of what would put him in the wealth tax category?  How are we to expect people of that kind to be moderate or restrained in presenting wage demands?</P>
    <P>I could have said the same thing, and I believe I did say it, probably more than once and before the farmers entered the picture.  My party co-operated in imposing direct taxation on farmers for the first time.  Everybody knows the kind of people who support us.  They are much the same as the kind of people who support the Fianna Fáil Party except that there are fewer of them.  In some parts of the country we had a very substantial belt of support among middle-sized to big farmers, that is true but by no means universally so because I canvassed in by-elections like North East Cork where there are many big farmers and I can remember going along a road and I would, by no means, be welcome in every house.  I admit we had a good deal of support in that category.  As a result of doing what we thought was right, as a result of Deputy Richie Ryan doing his duty and allowing himself to become a <Col N="1120" /> hate figure, we lost a seat in Kildare where the farmers almost to a man deserted us, we lost a seat in North Tipperary, Laois, and Westmeath.  We paid the penalty for that.  I would not have minded if we had lost 24 seats instead of 12&mdash;I suppose if my seat went down the drain I would mind more.  I would prefer to have it said of me that I belong to a party which, even at the cost of alienating old supporters, had seen the way the world was moving and was trying to move with it for the nation's sake. As I said, we paid the penalty for that.</P>
    <P>This Government got in by pretending shamelessly to the big farmers that they were to be relieved of tax, and warning the small farmers at the same time that it would be no time at all under the Coalition before the tax threshold for farmers sank so low that it would encompass them as well.  The Minister of State knows that is the line on which the campaign was run in his part of the country and everywhere else.</P>
    <P>The farmers gave Fianna Fáil a much bigger vote in 1977 than previously and handed them a lot of seats which formerly had been Fine Gael seats.  That was all right until the Revenue squeeze obliged the Minister for Finance to look at a situation two weeks ago and announce a farm levy of 2 per cent.  I thought that was a bad idea.  I hope nobody will think me opportunistic in trying to have things both ways because I am not.  Farmers should pay the same kind of tax as everybody else.  I thought the levy was a crude weapon for extracting money from them.  I agree with what Deputy McCreevy said, that it did not differentiate between the man who was making money and the man who was not, that it did not differentiate between people on the basis of their ability to pay.  He said that was his only objection to it and I think that a very substantial objection to any taxation system.</P>
    <P>I have another objection.  It penalised production.  It was directly related not to wealth but to production and therefore to efficiency.  The more efficient a farmer was and the more he produced the more this tax would hit him.  At the same time, I never thought it possible that a hard-nosed party&mdash;which has developed a very soft centre if I might mix my <Col N="1121" /> metaphors&mdash;would be frightened by the kind of demonstration the farmers lay down against the levy once they got news of it.</P>
    <P>In terms of newspaper stories I want to reveal to the House the tragedy of this from the national point of view, leaving aside all question of scoring points at the expense of Fianna Fáil.  On 28 February there were two headlines on the front page of <i>The Irish Times.</i>  One was a heading which I would have been very pleased with had I been in Government&mdash;&ldquo;Irish Congress of Trade Unions hopes for Pay Deal by April&rdquo;. The Congress issued a very positive document and I want to quote one or two lines from <i>The Irish Times</i> Industrial correspondent's story.  He said:</P>
    <P>The document offers co-operation with the Government on a voluntary incomes policy for the coming year in return for concessions on social welfare, taxation and, particularly, jobs. . . .</P>
    <P>But the document's commitment to full employment is underlined by an important offer to co-operate with the Government on job-creation measures in return for a commitment by the Government to underwrite this year's job target of 25,000. . . .</P>
    <P>On the same day, six inches from that story, <i>The Irish Times</i> carried the following headline: &ldquo;Farm levy dropped as part of tax plan deal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 1 March the following was reported under the heading &ldquo;Unions angered by tax deal for farmers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Trade Union Leaders, angry at what they see as the Government's capitulation to the farming organisations, are to step up their demands for a reduction of the tax burden on the PAYE worker.</P>
    <P>We have seen how hard and how high those demands have been stepped up since then.  What is one to say about a Government which can throw away the priceless advantage of having the ICTU tentatively on their side, which can fling it away so that within 24 hours the General Secretary of that Congress is able to express that degree of anger? <Col N="1122" /> Do the Government know what they are doing?  The Coalition did not consist of saints.  We had the same human weaknesses as everybody else, but we knew who the Government were.  We took no bullying from anybody.  We were willing to do things that were unpopular if they had to be done.  What are this Government about?</P>
    <P>The levy was a bad idea and I hope it will be replaced by some system of extracting a fair amount of revenue on a fair basis from farmers.  This bungle is inexcusable.  It has simply had the effect of bringing on to the streets sections of the society which were never seen on the streets before.  I am a PAYE worker, so is the Minister.  Are we going to join the march?  Perhaps not, but I think this is the first time a march was organised in which I am entitled to walk along the streets.</P>
    <P>I mention this fact because I am trying to show that the dimension of dissatisfaction and revolt, the feeling fuelled by the expectations Deputy McCreevy was referring to, are completely new.  We are being lectured about not being selfish and greedy by the very people who have encouraged us to be so, who have held out the fruits of selfishness and greed in return for votes.</P>
    <P>The situation in this regard is so bad that if the Government were to walk out today and not come back, and let the National Coalition in again unopposed, we would have a hell of a job to get things right.  The Government have done terrible damage to the morale of the country.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzpatrick, made a speech a couple of weeks ago in which he referred in the middle of this chaos to the alleged fact that the Coalition had left behind a &ldquo;stagnant economy&rdquo;&mdash;a &ldquo;stagnant economy&rdquo;, in which there were record increases in industrial production in their last two years&mdash;and a &ldquo;demoralised people&rdquo;.  Where was the demoralisation under the National Coalition comparable to what there is now?  At the moment the self-employed and the people with the Bermuda tans have not yet been soaked, but with the exception of that numerically small though psychologically very important category, there is no section of the people who are not now in <Col N="1123" /> conflict with the Government, and not just in conflict about some transient matter like the Donegan affair with us. This conflict is not going to go away. Even if the Fianna Fáil Party leave office today it will not go away, so deep and deadly has been the damage they have done to the economy and to society.  They are unique.</P>
    <P>Of course, they alone are not responsible for bad industrial relations, but the kind of fiscal policy which they have pursued since the election conduces to those relations being as bad as possible. I do not put the blame directly on the Minister or the Government; I put it on them indirectly for the chaos in the public service and particularly in the Posts and Telegraphs sphere.  How are you to expect a linesman or a postman to settle for a reasonable way of doing business or wage settlement when he sees what is done for other sections of the population who are able to shout or who, because of their pocket-books, are able to subsidise a party which makes them powerful?</P>
    <P>We were told by the Taoiseach in his budget speech two weeks ago that the Government had &ldquo;social&rdquo;, &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; and &ldquo;environmental&rdquo; objectives apart from the economic ones.  It is like being told that an army in headlong rout is going to stop and organise a few art exhibitions in villages as it passes on its way through them.  What is to be said about a Taoiseach who is capable of such a degree of self-deception as to imagine that there are social and cultural objectives still being pursued, when the capital city in which he lives is knee-deep in uncollected refuse?  This Government must be unique in history.  If I may stick to military metaphors, the Government have succeeded in producing a state of siege simultaneously with a state of rebellion and a traffic jam.  I use the traffic-jam as a figure of speech compendiously to describe the quality of life which is going steeply downhill, as the Minister opposite must know.</P>
    <P>Not even a change of Government tomorrow morning will cure that.  Unless I am overtaken by a rush of blood to the head, you will not find me outside church gates saying &ldquo;Put the Coalition <Col N="1124" /> back.  Put Fine Gael in and all will be well&rdquo;.  It will not be well and it will be a very long time before things are well, unless the basic philosophy&mdash;I used that word sarcastically&mdash;underlying this Government's action or the actions of any other Government who may succeed this one, are aDapted to recognising that the world has changed.  That change has been contributed to largely by the actions of Government in exciting expectation and in failing to provide people with the feeling that they were being treated equally.  I do not believe that my party in the morning are going to be able to cure that, so bad is the damage.  Only a year ago what I am about to say would have got a horse laugh, although I know that the Minister opposite would not be so ill-mannered as to give a horse laugh whether he was alone on the benches or not.  I believe that he is going to have the shaming experience of seeing a positive nostalgia for the National Coalition.  He is going to find that people's recollections of the recession are going to be somewhat over-clouded by the recollection that at least in those days they had a Government which ran on some kind of principle of equality for everybody, and who were not afraid to call on even their own supporters to carry burdens which they had not previously carried, and who were not afraid to face their enemies, economic, political or any other kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin by making a few comparisons of different budgets.  At the end of the life of the previous Government in 1974 the Financial Statements of the then Minister for Finance, Deputy R. Ryan, who this year is a candidate for the European Parliament, stated that the consumer price rise for the year would be not less than 14 per cent.  The present Minister for Finance on 7 February 1979 indicated to this House that the consumer price rise would be 7.6 per cent.  Speaking on the budget debate in 1974 the Fianna Fáil Opposition spokesman of the day made various constructive proposals which if implemented at the time would have made a radical difference to the fibre of life for everybody in this country.  Unfortunately, these criticisms were not taken and <Col N="1125" /> we have had a series of disastrous Coalition budgets leading to the inevitable in 1977.</P>
      <P>Another example is the difference in capital expenditure for 1975.  In the Budget Statement of 3 April 1974 an amount of £384 million was the total capital expenditure.  This year in our budget the total capital expenditure is £843 million.  Even allowing for exaggerated claims of inflation in any direction, there is a substantially greater quantity of money being spent by this Government than was ever capable of being found or spent by any previous administration.</P>
      <P>The previous budgets could be described very simply as budgets of desperation.  They failed totally to meet the needs of the time and the necessity for a target capable of achievement by our people.  They were groping blindly for solutions to problems they did not understand, and the lack of understanding is evidenced in their many contributions to the budget of this year. Subsequent Coalition budgets followed the pattern of their first.</P>
      <P>In total contrast is the budget of this year, which is one of achievement catalogued over a very brief period of time and also an indication that the people are capable of even greater achievement with a very small change in direction of the various destructive forces operating in our society today.  It is a pity that these destructive forces are being encouraged by the more irresponsible Members of the Opposition.  This is in total contrast to the contributions of the various Fianna Fáil spokesmen in Opposition.  We never decended to empty destructive observations.  Either in Government or Opposition to be constructive was always our pattern of contribution and we came to the election of 1977 with positive ideas and proposals which were then and are now capable of realisation.  It has been said in this House many times that these things are being done and are seen to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic foundation of many of these proposals is the possibility, for the first time in our history, of full employment in this country.  The notion of full employment was something which on many occasions caused front bench <Col N="1126" /> spokesmen on the opposite side, whether in or out of power, to throw up their hands and say that it could not be achieved.  They claimed that we in Ireland were incapable of governing ourselves.  At other times they said that outside forces had taken over, we had no control and that there was nothing we could do about it.  They showed no grasp, no direction, no reality.  The brave constructive opportunities created by the two budgets introduced by Fianna Fáil since they came back into power have given the lie to this defeatism and have enabled the people to look forward to achieving, within themselves and with the assistance of outside forces, the employment of all our people and the ending of emigration.</P>
    <P>In my lifetime, initially because of forces outside our control due to the occupation of the country up to the early part of this century, we had a very high rate of emigration.  Now, because of constructive Fianna Fáil attitudes towards stemming the haemorrhage of emigration, we have, for the first time ever, not alone stopped emigration but we can create full employment. When Fianna Fáil came to office two years ago several figures were given for the number of people unemployed.  The most optimistic figure put forward then by the Opposition was 100,000.  We said that the figure was closer to 160,000.  In two years, whichever figure one uses, the objective fact is that the unemployment rate has dropped dramatically with no emigration whatsoever.  Not alone are the jobs which were lost on our accession to Europe, because of increased competition by the freeing of the markets, being filled but we have stopped emigration.  We are taking care of industries which have gone out of production and we are creating new industries and giving new jobs and hope to our people.</P>
    <P>The industrial promotion agencies are being allocated £135 million in the current budget.  This figure is almost half the total budget introduced in 1974 by the Coalition Government.  This figure of £135 million in relation to the £835 million is quite a small figure, but we must contrast that with the figure for 1974.  If <Col N="1127" /> we take inflation into account this is still a very substantial commitment to the programme for creating employment.  It gives a chance to the individual who wants to progress within an expanding industry to create a larger business out of a small one.  It gives an impetus to creating new industries.  It gives the fisherman the chance, for the first time, to buy a large fishing boat.  It gives a chance to the shore industries to expand the processing end of the industry.  It gives the export agencies a chance to go abroad and display our goods at trade fairs all over the world.  It is indicative of the outward look and the forward thinking that this budget and last year's budget have brought back into the country.</P>
    <P>Under previous Coalition Governments we tended to look inwards.  There was no awareness of the world outside. There was a throwing up of hands and saying that something was not possible. The figure of £135 million is a spur for further investment.  Great opportunities have been given to small industries such as small welding plants and repair of various farm machinery in the country. It gives an opportunity to the small man in a city back street, doing wrought iron work, for instance, to take on an extra apprentice or an extra helper.  It gives an opportunity to a man who is making window frames or who has a small plastics industry to expand his business and to ensure further employment on a small scale.  It gives large businesses the opportunity to expand different departments, to expand their product ranges and to sell those products in foreign countries.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to see the ability of people to go abroad, find new technology, bring it home, use it to manufacture in Ireland and to export again.  A typical case is provided by some of the new electronic factories which have sprung up under Fianna Fáil guidance in North County Dublin and various other places.  Those factories are encouraged through budgets of this type to send people all over the world in search of products which can be manufactured by our young men and women after training.  New industries are starting because of this attitude.  The <Col N="1128" /> micro-processing industry in the electronics field is a new concept of job creation which budgets of this type have enabled forward-thinking Irish men to indulge in.</P>
    <P>It is seldom realised that we are well on the way to being the largest exporter of electronic components to Europe.  We are creating new wealth and new conditions of employment which did not exist a decade ago and which certainly were undreamed of 20 years ago.  Successive Coalition Governments had no imagination in regard to this type of advancement for our people.  Fianna Fáil are continually looking for this type of advancement. We know that our young people have the ability to avail of educational facilities and research facilities at home and abroad to find the type of products which we can with profit use for the development of the country.</P>
    <P>During the previous Coalition Government, the building trade was on its knees.  There is no doubt that over those years housing slowed down. Various figures have been trotted out by Deputy Tully as showing new and revolutionary thinking in relation to local authority housing, but the objective fact is that not one local authority house was built during his term of office on one rood of ground that he bought.  If the land for those houses had not been made available because of the constructive and forward-thinking of previous Fianna Fáil budgets, Deputy Tully would not have been able to perpetrate the illusion he created.  This type of forward-thinking has always characterised Fianna Fáil, as it still does today.  We are engaged in rebuilding the country from the shambles it was almost brought to during the period of office of the Coalition Government.  We are well on the way to becoming self-generating because the building industry, for instance, has again shown its resilience by expanding far outside our shores.  There are Irish building firms throughout the EEC and around the world.  They have used the prosperity they built at home to establish themselves throughout Africa, as far as Australia and even into the US.  This type of advance is only possible when we have a sympathetic Government. <Col N="1129" /> This is shown by Fianna Fáil budgets.  This section of our industry is now on an international rather than on a national basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to the city of Dublin we must be concerned about the lack of development of the inner city region north of the Liffey.  Dublin was fortunately spared the ravages of two World Wars and we have retained a lot of the character of the inner city.  But north of the Liffey the decay which set in because of people moving from the inner city to the new suburbs, is evident in the many half-developed building sites and in the areas which need rejuvenating. The progressive thinking of the Fianna Fáil Members of Dublin Corporation in relation to Wood Quay is shown, where they made sure that the use of budgetary money for development would be constructive. They could only be questioned on one point.  If the regressive elements succeed in stopping developments at Wood Quay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies.  The north city being in such need of rejuvenation would certainly benefit from an imaginative scheme like the Irish Life development near Amiens Street station. This type of development must be encouraged because it is within walking distance of major arterial transport access, in the scheme of the railway which serves the whole of the north county. Schemes of this type would benefit enormously from budgetary consideration, in that people naturally want to stay in the centre of the city, they want to see the inner city living again and they want to see places like Mountjoy Square getting a new lease of life.  The south side of the city has several very lovely open squares and perhaps the provision of imaginative new inner city open space areas or new <Col N="1130" /> squares could be a major contributor to the rejuvenation of that part of the city.</P>
      <P>The £4.28 million that this Budget has given to local government for the improvement of the environment could be used with effect to give a new lease of life to the northern city areas.  When one travels from this House to the north end of the county one must pass through the most dilapidated part of the city.  It is unfortunate that when one goes to that very fine modern airport in Collinstown one must travel through areas which are in desperate need of rejuvenation.  Some of the £4.28 million in the budget for environmental use could be used in that area.  This would help to stop the rush to create new suburbs with growing demands for expensive services which already exist in the inner city area.  I am referring to water and sewerage facilities and electricity lines and so on.</P>
      <P>The Continental attitude in relation to the inner city of Dublin will be useful in this context.  In many Continental cities there is an attitude that a village can and will be created in the centre if there is a situation where people living in a small area are proud of that area which has all facilities within walking distance.  In this context one can think of areas like the North Strand, Ballybough, Marino and Capel Street, all of which are areas capable of having their own identity. This has happened in many other cities in Europe and there is no reason why it should not happen in Dublin.  It is happening to a small extent in the Liberties and the Coombe.  Serious attempts have been made to give pride to the localities and the people are proud to live in these areas.  This idea should be considered for other areas north of the river Liffey.</P>
      <P>In this context, there is a special place for EEC funding because Dublin as an old city did not suffer the ravages of the last war.  That means that ours is a different kind of problem to that which obtained throughout the Continent.  I would point to the publicly acknowledged failure of some public representatives in the last few years to get special places of this type recognised by the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In future budgets we will have to give close scrutiny to what is happening in Europe.  The attitude of the expenditure <Col N="1131" /> of the European budgets in relation to national budgets must be fought, to ensure the maximum result for places like the inner city of Dublin.  EEC funding in relation to us has been quite good but special places need special treatment. The rejuvenation of the northern end of the city is such a special case.  We will need to fight hard to make sure that a scheme can be devised to help future budgets in this area.  The EEC budget in relation to national budgets will in future be more controlled by the elected representatives.  At the moment only five per cent of the Regional Fund can be controlled by the Parliament, but in future it seems that the elected representatives will have a much stronger case for altering that.  Officials have indicated that this may be the case.  In future, elected representatives will be able to initiate schemes for the expenditure of these funds.  That is a radical departure which could be of enormous benefit to future budgets.  For the first time elected representatives in Parliament will be able to contribute to specific portions of the budget.  Fianna Fáil recognise that this has got to be done.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil budgets have always been very detailed.  Objectives of this type would be welcome to enable us to attain the goal of full employment which can only be achieved by bringing together the details necessary in preparing the nitty-gritty of a national budget and whatever can be obtained from the European Community.  We are fortunate in that we have been benefiting from that source in the ratio of 10:1.  In other words, for every £1 we have put into the EEC budget we have been able to take back £10.  In certain areas we might be able to improve on that, and we might be able to change dramatically the face of the inner city and the northern end of the county.</P>
    <P>The remarks of some Opposition speakers about this budget were confusing, to say the best of them, and totally without foundation, to say the worst of them.  The distinguished leaders of the Opposition parties challenged the veracity of the figures presented.  There were wild statements about morale and a demoralised people which showed a total <Col N="1132" /> lack of appreciation of the budget.  The Leader of the Fine Gael Party seemed to be going around in circles.  He started off on one tack by attacking the integrity of the Civil Service and the veracity of the figures presented in the House without substantiating any of those claims.  The Leader of the Labour Party also seemed to be going around in circles at a slower rate.  If people in such high places are capable of nothing else but going around in circles, God help us if those circles ever start to diminish.</P>
    <P>We heard various other protagonists on the far side of the House making wild claims that problems will not go away, that the budgets presented by Fianna Fáil were smokescreens, that they contained wild ideas and raised hopes which cannot be achieved.  It is interesting to look back on other budgets.  I remember three series of budgets very vividly.  I was a very young man when the Coalition Government introduced their first series of budgets which effectively destroyed the capacity of Aer Lingus to expand.  Fianna Fáil always gave people an opportunity to make use of their abilities and to carry out their mission.</P>
    <P>In the first period of Coalition Government, Aer Lingus had the capability of flying the Atlantic.  They had landing rights across to Los Angeles.  These were thrown away and nothing was got in return.  Today Aer Lingus cannot take advantage of the opportunities given to them in previous Fianna Fáil budgets because they cannot fly legally to the west coast of America.  They were emasculated for many years.  The job creation capacity which they had achieved under Fianna Fáil Governments was very nearly destroyed in the period of the first Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>This exemplifies the inward thinking of every Coalition Government who have sat in this House.  They never had the ability to look outwards.  They always looked inwards.  They never had the imagination shown in various Fianna Fáil budgets to raise the hopes of the people of our little island.  This year's budget points out how the people's hopes can be raised.  In the period of office of the second Coalition Government exactly the same thing happened.  New <Col N="1133" /> suburbs had been created by the Fianna Fáil Administration with progressive budgetary policies.  The very fine development at Ballyfermot had just been completed and was beginning to be occupied.</P>
    <P>Under the second Coalition Government in various budget statements it was claimed that there was no unemployment problem and no housing problem. They were quite right because the houses Fianna Fáil had built were left idle and boarded up.  There were streets of houses in Ballyfermot with galvanised iron across the windows and the doors.  People had to go elsewhere for work.  There was no hope, no forward thinking, no forward planning.  There was nothing to keep our people at home.  That is in total contrast to the budget we are debating today which provides people with the opportunity to stay at home and fulfil their personal ambitions.  That ambition may be to rent a house at a reasonable rent, or to buy their house at an economic price, or to have a job which will provide them with a reasonable standard of living.  This budget makes that possibility a reality for many tens of thousands of our people.  This is in total contrast to the second Coalition Government who were a disaster for the working man.  They created vast labour forces for England, America, Australia and New Zealand. The unfortunate people had no hope because there was no forward thinking.</P>
    <P>When the National Coalition Government took office there was no emigration. Fianna Fáil Administrations had successfully stopped that horrible haemorrhage and, for the first time in our history under any Administration, our people could stay at home and find work.  At that time the unemployment figure was approximately 65,000, a most unacceptable figure from our point of view and a figure we were battling to lower.  Within a few short years there was a total reversal and an inward looking attitude.  The attitude was that we could not do anything because outside forces were beating us.  Unemployment shot up to 140,000 or 160,000.  The most persuasive of the Opposition speakers now claim that the figure was 100,000.  Whatever it was, it was certainly <Col N="1134" /> much higher than the figure Fianna Fáil left behind them.  When Fianna Fáil took office they had to reverse that inward looking attitude again.  This year's budget has afforded our people a chance to go out and do something for this little country again; a chance to look objectively, creatively and constructively to the future, one they have not had in the last four years and never experienced under any Coalition Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>At the outset I want to make it quite clear that there is no question of any Garda inquiry, internal or otherwise, being held into the death of this boy.  That matter has already been the subject of a sworn public inquiry, in the form of a Coroner's inquest, before a jury.  The verdict returned by the jury, in accordance with the medical evidence, was that the boy died from meningitis.</P>
      <P>In answering an earlier question about the matter on 21 November last, I said in reply to supplementaries that the medical advice tendered at the inquest was to the effect that the dead boy was in a poor nutritional state at the time of his death.  The State Pathologist did in fact give evidence to that effect.  I was not aware at the time that a second pathologist, who also carried out a postmortem examination, did not agree with the State Pathologist's view about the boy's nutritional state.  However, the findings of the two pathologists differed only in that one respect.  They were in agreement that the cause of death was meningitis.</P>
      <P>As I said in reply to a supplementary question on 21 November last, allegations of ill-treatment of the boy while in Garda custody were made by his mother.  A Garda investigation into the criminal aspects of these allegations was carried out and, on completion of that investigation, the full facts of the case were, as a matter of course, reported to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who was satisfied that no prosecution was warranted against any member of the force who dealt with this boy and his companion while they were in Garda custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the investigation into the criminal aspects of the allegations, the Commissioner directed that an investigation into the question of possible <Col N="1137" /> breaches of díscipline by the members involved be carried out under the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1971.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that this investigation is not completed, I must make it clear that these are statutory regulations and that proceedings under them are formal in character but are not public.  Accordingly, such proceedings could not properly in any particular case be the subject of public comment by me as Minister for Justice.  Where a complaint has been made against members of the force and results in an investigation being carried out, the Garda authorities may inform the complainant of the outcome of any disciplinary proceedings&mdash;that is, whether the complaint was upheld or not&mdash;but the findings are not otherwise made public.</P>
    <P>No member of the force has retired or been compelled to retire as a result of the case mentioned in the questions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the Garda, the Department of Justice or the Minister should introduce a system whereby an inquiry of this kind would be carried out in such a way that the public would know that it was effectively a judicial inquiry, in so far as both sides of the case would be put by the people competent to do so?  Would he not agree that any exculpation of the Garda in that situation would be to their benefit rather that this seemingly star-chamber type of investigation in which the proceedings of the inquiry are carried on secretly behind closed doors, an old practice with which we are all familiar.  Would the Minister not believe that, in the interests of justice and of the good name of the Garda, it would be better if inquiries of this nature were made public?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned in the course of my reply to the Deputy that there was an investigation and that the papers in the case were sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who was satisfied that no prosecution was warranted. It was the Director of Public Prosecutions who made that decision.</P>
      <P>I further mentioned in my reply to the Deputy that the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána directed an investigation to take place into breaches of discipline by members involved and that this is being carried out under the statutes which provide therefor.  I am very satisfied that the inquiry at present being carried out will be a proper one.  I cannot accept the allegation made by Deputy Browne that it is a star-chamber type of inquiry.  That is a wrong thing to say.  I believe it truly to be a very wrong thing to say.  I am satisfied that the inquiry being directed by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána is an inquiry that will give us the true picture as it is.  I am satisfied that this is the proper way it should be carried out.</P>
      <P>Might I say to the Deputy that I have as much interest in the good name of the Garda Síochána as he would have or anybody else for that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that at a coroner's inquest&mdash;this is the public inquiry to which the Minister referred&mdash;the inquiry is concerned simply with the cause of death; it is not a tribunal of inquiry in the true sense.  That is the first point. Secondly, is it not a fact that we have accepted, in order to establish justice in any difference of opinion between citizens in our society, a very complex system of open courts in order to be satisfied that justice is being seen to be done?  Why, in the case of the Garda, an extremely important sector of our society, is this principle not being established?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Arising out of the Minister's statement that a sworn inquiry in the form of a coroner's inquest was held, would the Minister not agree that a coroner's inquest is a limited inquiry to ascertain the cause of death and nothing more, and that in fact the coroner's <Col N="1139" /> jury is precluded by statute from apportioning blame or exonerating anybody?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to part of my original reply.  Perhaps because of the length of the reply the Deputy might not have heard it properly or clearly.  I said that the matter in question has already been the subject of a sworn public inquiry in the form of a coroner's inquest before a jury.  The verdict returned by the jury in accordance with the medical evidence was that the boy died from meningitis.  I deliberately said that because there was a doubt about what the boy died from.  Therefore I thought it was necessary, in the course of my reply to Deputy Browne to make it clear that that is accepted.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I want to make it clear that I am not going into the merits or demerits of this matter because I am not in a position to do so but will the Minister agree with me that a coroner's inquest could not be regarded as a satisfactory sworn inquiry into a matter of this sort?</P>

      <P>Will I have to put another question down to find out or will <Col N="1140" /> the Minister convey the findings of the inquiry to us when they are available? Also there are a number of disturbing factors in relation to the child who died from meningitis; it could have been meningitis following brutal treatment while in custody.  There was a charge that the child was wrongfully held but, most important of all, would the Minister in this year of the child do something to see that minors are not taken into custody by the Gardaí and questioned without some adult, either a parent or someone who would act in <i>loco parentis</i>, in order to see that they are not frightened or, bluntly, brutalised as has been suggested takes place on some occasions?  I have heard indeed of children of ten and 12 years of age having their fingerprints taken.  Will the Minister, in the circumstances, now devise a system of judges' rules in order to protect children in custody?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I said on 21 November last and again today that an internal inquiry is taking place.  There are reasons why the internal inquiry is taking place and when the findings of that inquiry are available I will be in a position to take whatever action is necessary.  I assure the Deputy that he will not have to put down a further parliamentary question.  As soon as I have information from the inquiry I will communicate with the Deputy on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that when the boy was taken into custody he was not suffering from the effects which led to his death?  While I accept that nothing malicious was done to the boy and that this was a very grave tragedy, will the Minister take steps to ensure that in future when any boy is taken into custody a similar thing will not happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question whatsoever that the meningitis from which the boy died was contracted while he was in Garda custody or as a result of being in such custody.  The State Pathologist informed the Garda authorities in writing at the time that in his view it was virtually certain that the boy caught his infection while he was at <Col N="1141" /> liberty and not while he was in Garda custody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

We are talking not only of substantial sums of money but also of basic approaches to the problem, approaches which may determine the pattern of a scheme for many years.  However, I want to make it clear that the Government are committed to introducing civil legal aid and there is no question about our intention to honour that commitment.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's statement, referred to in the question, related to when a scheme might be ready, not to whether there would be a scheme, as that is already decided.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to say when any further statement may be made on the matter but I hope that a scheme may be ready by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The information sought is in the form of a tabular statement, which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated with the Official Report.  At the outset I should explain that, strictly-speaking, it is not possible to give an absolutely accurate answer to the question &ldquo;what is the capacity of a prison?&rdquo;. Thus, in the closed institutions there are a number of cells intended for multiple-occupancy and the occasion can arise in this as in other countries, though up to now far less frequently here than in some other countries, where pressure on accommodation can lead to cells being occupied by more persons than they were intended to cater for.  Another point that needs to be made is that, because of alterations either in structure or in the use of accommodation, the number of cells or rooms available for sleeping in may vary from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The grounds of the local GAA club at Crossmaglen, County Armagh are next to the combined RUC station and Army base and this has been a source of tension and of difficulty since the beginning of the present period of violence in Northern Ireland.  In July 1974 the British authorities compulsorily acquired part of the GAA grounds and in 1976 further land was requisitioned, some of it belonging to the GAA.</P>
      <P>At present, the British authorities are engaged on a building programme on the property under their control, which includes some of the land requisitioned from the GAA.  In particular, they are building a perimeter wall.  The construction of this wall has been the subject of objections from the GAA and, in addition, the GAA have objected to the dumping of considerable quantities of rubble from the British Army base on to the ground between the GAA playing field and club changing-rooms.  Finally, the GAA have objected on many occasions over the years to the harassment of players in particular by helicopters flying low over the field while play was in progress.</P>
      <P>The problems arising for the GAA in Crossmaglen have been raised by the Government with the British authorities at all levels, frequently and with the utmost vigour.  Indeed, I myself raised the matter again with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State at my meeting with him on 14 February.</P>

    <P>In reply to the representations made by the Government over the years, the British authorities have informed me of their intention to relocate within the area under their control the helicopter landing pad which is the principal means of communication for the Crossmaglen British Army base.  As a consequence of the relocation of the helicopter landing pad <Col N="1152" /> and other modifications, the British authorities have undertaken that, with effect from the date of the completion of their building programme, helicopters would no longer land on the GAA playing field, thus avoiding damage to the playing surface, which has been a major source of contention over the years.</P>
    <P>The British authorities have also sought to replace the existing overhead high tension cables with underground cables, in order to facilitate an approach to the base by helicopters in such a way as to minimise the danger of interference with matches.  However, the GAA and the British authorities have been unable to agree on the relaying of the cables under the GAA property, as a consequence of which the British authorities indicate that they have been able only partially to execute this proposal.</P>
    <P>At our meeting in London on 14 February, the Northern Ireland Secretary of State informed me that a local contractor had been commissioned to remove from the area behind the goal the remainder of the rubble that had been dumped there.  This area, which forms the entrance to the grounds, has also been the subject of complaint for many years because of the damage caused by heavy duty British Army vehicles crossing it to enter the base.  The British authorities are now arranging to have this area resurfaced and have undertaken that, again with effect from the completion of the building programme at the base, use will be made of this area for access to the base only in the most exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>The British authorities have also suggested that it is open to the GAA to seek compensation for any damage they have suffered in Crossmaglen.  They have also suggested that inconvenience to the GAA could be minimised if it were possible for the GAA to give to the British authorities some advance notice of fixtures at the ground.</P>
    <P>The response given by the British authorities to my representations clearly does not dispose of all the difficulties of the GAA in Crossmaglen.  In particular, most of the land requisitioned from the GAA around the ground in 1974 and 1976 has not yet been returned to them <Col N="1153" /> and, indeed, some of it will be enclosed behind the base perimeter wall at present nearing completion.  In addition, I understand that there are fears that the wall itself may interfere with play.  The Northern Ireland Secretary of State has conveyed to me that the land requisitioned will be returned to the GAA as soon as the security situation allows and that it will be restored to its former condition.  I shall, of course, continue to have the situation in Crossmaglen monitored and to make representations to the British authorities as appropriate in the light of the developing situation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the present position regarding the drafting of a United Nations Convention against Religious Discrimination; the policy of the Irish Government in this regard; and if, in view of the abnormal delay in completing the work of drafting, which has been proceeding since the sixties, he will request the EEC to give this greater priority at the UN.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The General Assembly of the United Nations initiated the drafting of a declaration and a convention on the subject of religious discrimination in 1962.  In 1972, in the absence of any progress in reaching agreement on texts, particularly that of a convention, the Assembly decided to give priority to drafting a declaration.  So far the working group of the Commission on Human Rights, to which this task was entrusted, has reached agreement only on the title and preamble of a draft declaration on the elimination of all forces of intolerence and of discrimination based on religion or belief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government attach great importance to the elaboration of international instruments on this subject.  Irish delegations to the General Assembly have consistently worked to endeavour to speed up the drafting of a declaration, as the first step towards the elaboration of a convention, and have regularly co-sponsored resolutions to this end.  At the most recent session of the General Assembly, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution expressing regret that the Commission on Human Rights had not completed work on the draft declaration and requesting the Commission to give high priority to this task.  This resolution was co-sponsored by a number of our partners in the European Community <Col N="1155" /> and supported by all members of the Community, who share our concern at the lack of progress.</P>
    <P>Although I would not like to hold out the hope that agreement will be reached on texts in the near future, in view of the lack of support on the part of some states for a declaration or convention on religious discrimination, prospects for progress seems slightly better at present than they have been, and I can assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to promote progress in any way they can.</P>

According to information supplied by the European Commission, the value of contracts awarded since then to Irish firms under the fund is of the order of 2.25 million units of account (MUA) or just over £1.5 million.  Of these amounts 586,000 u.a.&mdash;£396,000&mdash;are accounted for by contracts awarded to semi-State bodies and 1,662 mua&mdash;£1.12 million&mdash;by those awarded to private firms.

      <P>Formal cultural exchanges between Canadian provinces <Col N="1157" /> and this country could take place only in the context of a cultural agreement with Canada.  The absence of such an agreement does not mean, however, that useful exchanges, officially sponsored or otherwise, cannot take place.

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if the Irish Government have subscribed to recent United Nations proposals directed against racial discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>United Nations' activity in relation to racial discrimination at present takes place in the framework of the Decade for Action to combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, the ten-year period from 10 December 1973 proclaimed by the General Assembly. <Col N="1158" /> The General Assembly unanimously adopted a programme for the Decade, to which Ireland fully subscribed, setting out policy measures and guidelines and outlining activities to be undertaken within the UN system.  This programme, while it dealt with racial discrimination in general naturally laid particular stress on the situation in Southern Africa where the problems posed by racism and racial discrimination are particularly acute.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the programme, a world conference, in which Ireland participated, was held in Geneva from 14 to 25 August 1978.  In the course of the elaboration of the final documents of the conference, a number of extraneous and unacceptable elements relating to the situation in the Middle East were introduced into these texts, which were otherwise generally acceptable to us. Ireland and its partners in the European Community, together with a number of other countries, felt obliged to dissociate themselves from these texts by taking no further part in the conference and by declining to approve the texts when they came up for endorsement by the General Assembly.</P>
      <P>It may be noted that the member states of the European Community, including Ireland, had, since the adoption in 1975 of the resolution equating Zionism with racism, endeavoured to avert the introduction of extraneous elements into the Decade against Racism. Unfortunately, this effort was unsuccessful at Geneva.</P>
      <P>Ireland naturally continues to support UN efforts to combat racism and racial discrimination on the basis of the original programme.  I hope that future activities during the decade will be on this basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, what is involved is that there has been a tendency, both at the UN and at the world conference to which I referred, particularly in regard to the situation in the Middle East, to couple Zionism with racism. During the course of my visits to Africa <Col N="1159" /> I pointed out to the various heads of government and foreign ministers with whom I met that we do not regard this tendency as helpful in the whole situation of racial discrimination and racism. We put forward the view that, if there were problems to be resolved in the Middle East, they should be resolved on their merits and should not compromise our approach to the whole question of racial discrimination which is so rampant in South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this refer in any way to the fact that military advice and different kinds of assistance have been given by the Government of Israel to South Africa?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It refers to the equating of racism with Zionism. Whatever might be one's opinions on Zionism, it is not appropriate to equate it with racism.  For that reason I should hope that the problems in the Middle East would be tackled independently and on their merits.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Customary international law recognises that coastal state jurisdiction derives from the fact that the Continental Shelf is the natural prolongation of the land territory and Ireland claims jurisdiction over its adjoining Continental Shelf accordingly.  In its review of existing international law the Law of the Sea Conference is also at present considering this question and is seeking a more precise definition of the continental margin and how the outer edge of the Continental Shelf may be delineated with more certainty.  I would also refer the Deputy to the designation orders made with respect to the Continental Shelf, the most recent being that made on 1 February 1977, designating areas within which rights of exploration <Col N="1162" /> and exploitation of the natural resources of the sea-bed may be exercised.</P>
      <P>When a Continental Shelf is the natural prolongation of two or more opposite or adjacent states then the question of delimitation of the shelf between them arises.  We have agreed with the British to submit the question of delimitation of the Continental Shelf to an independent third party dispute settlement procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be difficult to answer that question, but I can refer the Deputy to the physical limits of the designation order which is contained in Statutory Instrument, No. 22, 1977. However, the whole question of the rights of states to the exploration and exploitation of the Continental Shell generally is a matter for the most serious consideration at the International Law of the Sea Conference.  Ireland has made specific proposals in that regard to ensure that the jurisdiction would stretch out to the margin of the Continental Shelf, which in some instances is perhaps more than 200 miles.  The question is very complex and technical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of the edge of the Continental Shelf but of a continuation of the sea-bed to the extent that one can justify this by reference to scientific data.  That is one of the matters that is under detailed consideration at present.  The limit is not fixed by reference to a fixed point on the shelf.</P>

      <P>The situation in South East Asia is a matter of great concern to the Government at present. Because the present conflicts could have very serious repercussions far beyond the immediate area, no country, however distant, can remain unconcerned by them.</P>
      <P>This concern of the Government was already reflected in a statement on the conflict issued in Paris on the 19 February on behalf of the Nine member States of the EEC, including Ireland. This statement was as follows:</P>
      <P>The Nine member States of the Community consider that the situation developing in SE Asia could have serious consequences for international relations.  They express their concern in this regard.  They deplore the growing rise of tensions in the region.  They call for establishment of a situation assuring the independence, territorial integrity and self determination of each of the states concerned, especially of Cambodia and Vietnam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultations on the situation are continuing among our partners within the framework of European Political Co-operation. At the United Nations, a special session of the Security Council met on 24 February to consider the situation.  No resolution on the conflict was adopted and the meeting has now <Col N="1165" /> been adjourned.  Informal consultations among members of the Security Council are continuing.</P>
    <P>It is my earnest hope that the parties directly involved will show full respect for the UN Charter and for the territorial integrity and independence of all their neighbours and I urge all of the major powers, directly or indirectly involved, to do everything possible to reduce tensions in the whole area.</P>

    <P>The Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, made under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, provide that every load carried by a vehicle in a public place shall be of such a weight and size and so distributed, packed, adjusted and attached to the vehicle that, so far as can reasonably be foreseen, no danger is liable to be caused and that there is no interference with the stability of the vehicle.  These regulations also provide that no load carried shall exceed a reasonable weight having regard to the engine capacity, brakes, tyres and general construction of vehicles.  The maximum permitted laden weights of heavy vehicles, including articulated vehicles, are as set out in the table above.  In the case of a vehicle in excess of 17 tons in weight laden, section 15 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, provides a scale of penalties related to the extent of overloading and additional to any penalty which may be imposed under the 1961 Act.</P>
    <P>Statutory provisions also govern the issue of permits in special cases, the speed limits for articulated vehicles, the ages of drivers and hours of driving.  Enforcement of the appropriate legal requirements is a matter for the Garda Siochána.</P>

      <P>It was decided unanimously by the Supreme Court yesterday that Dublin Corporation have a valid and subsisting consent to the completion of the contract for the erection of civic offices at Wood Quay.  The Government have no legal or statutory powers to withdraw or revoke this consent. The only matter outstanding is the question of further archaeological excavations on part of the site.  The corporation have indicated that they will give adequate time to permit of this excavation within the physical constraints of the site.  Discussions on this matter can now take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister who is speaking on behalf of the Taoiseach, which I very much regret in these particular circumstances, aware of the facts of the case?  Is he aware that in a statement issued by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Wyse, on 10 October reference was made to the granting of permission to the corporation to proceed with the building of civic offices in the future tense&mdash;the corporation will be granted permission to proceed to the building of civic offices when the excavation is completed and if new archaeological finds of great importance have not been made? Is he aware that in the Seanad in December Deputy Wyse also spoke about the recommendation he was about to make to the Government and the decision the Government were going to take?  Is he aware that, while both these statements were being made, it had not been disclosed to the public or to either House that a consent had been given under section 14 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, on 29 August 1978?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Was the Taoiseach aware that the Minister of State had made these statements relating to the future that a consent had been given and, if so, is the Taoiseach satisfied that this behaviour on behalf of the Minister of State was in <Col N="1172" /> accordance with the principles which should guide Members of this House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be under a misconception in regard to what the Minister of State's remarks related.  In the Seanad on 7 December he was speaking of a recommendation to the Government in the context of extensions of time to permit of archaeological excavations, the matter to which I referred in my reply and on which the corporation have expressed themselves as entirely willing to meet the interests concerned to allow such archaeological excavations to take place in order to ensure that any finds can be secured.  I understand that in relation to the particular work which gave rise to the injunction proceedings, the excavations have been completed and no find has been discovered. There are further areas where there may be such finds and the corporation have expressed their willingness to co-operate with the interests concerned with a view to giving any necessary extensions to allow such excavations to take place.  It was in that context that the Minister of State was speaking at column 666 of the Official Report of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The position now is that the consent dated 29 August 1978, referred to by Deputy FitzGerald, authorising the corporation as owners of the site to proceed with the erection of civic offices, is the issue which was the nub of the Supreme Court decision and that consent has been validated, five to nil, by the Supreme Court.  As far as the law is concerned, the issue is closed, but further discussions can take place between the corporation and interested archaeological parties with a view to granting extensions of time to allow the appropriate excavations that may be necessary to take place.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the expectation of the archaeologists is that the number of finds in the area now under destruction is likely to equal those discovered in the area recently excavated, around 1,500, and that the area is crucial?  Could the Minister explain how he reconciles the statement he has just made with the statement issued by the Minister of State on 10 October in which he said that when the excavation is completed, unless some new archaeological find of great importance has been made, the corporation will be granted permission to proceed with the building of civic offices?  That was a statement that the Government were going to do something at a future point and in certain circumstances. He now tells us that the permission to build the civic offices was given in August and that they are proceeding under that permission.  How can he reconcile those two statements and how can we avoid the conclusion that the statement of the Minister of State misled the public and the Seanad subsequently?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is still under a misconception.  I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  The building as such is of no concern to the Office of Public Works or any Government Department.  That is a matter for Dublin Corporation.  The question of the consent between the Office of Public Works and Dublin Corporation was the matter of contention in the Supreme Court. That consent has been validated five-nil by the Supreme Court.  That is the law as it stands.  The Government at all stages&mdash;and this is the burden of what Deputy Wyse had to say in the Seanad&mdash;were anxious to help and the corporation were very anxious to assist in ensuring that full archaeological excavation took place.  That is still the position: to ensure&mdash;I repeat it and the corporation have made it plain today in a statement&mdash;that such assistance will be forthcoming and any extensions of time or adjournments of construction work will be given to enable full archaeological investigation to take place.</P>

That was a reference to something the Government were going to do in the future.  It was not a reference to what had been done.  How can the Minister now say that the Government have no function in the matter of granting permission to the corporation to build civic offices when the Minister of State made that statement?</P>

      <P>It is not just me saying that the Government have no function in the matter.  The Supreme Court stated it very fully in their judgment as reported in today's paper.  Basically what the Supreme Court have found is that the Government do not have any function in the matter and that it was purely a matter of the validation of a consent, which they have now validated and authorised Dublin Corporation to proceed.  That is the answer to the Deputy's first question. The other matter the Deputy raised was the question of work in progress today and this evening.  The work has finished now.</P>

If there are other areas of interest to archaeologists at the site, these areas will be opened to such archaeologists for full examination and <Col N="1175" /> full facility will be given by Dublin Corporation, I understand, towards the proper excavation and proper archaeological investigation required to ascertain if there are any such finds in any such areas.  Therefore, full co-operation will be given.  Regarding the site that has been cleared today, the work was done under archaeological expert uspervision and no particular matter was found.</P>

      <P>The imaginative courage of the Minister for Health in his forward thinking in persuading our people to give up smoking on the one hand and to be moderate in drinking on the other will have an effect on future budgets.  The courageous anticipation of the possible loss of revenue from those traditional sources must be admired.  It is possible that, should our habits in those directions change radically, the saving to the health services will be quite substantial. It has been estimated to be in excess of the revenue collected from tobacco and drink.</P>
      <P>This is a very important consideration. It is in conformity with the progressive attitudes of this and other Fianna Fáil budgets.  It provides avenues for progress by all our people.  It provides an avenue for increasing the enjoyment of life.  The Minister for Health's vast programme for the expansion of hospitals and the health services in general is unprecedented.  A simple figure is the allocation for the Mater Hospital.  A sum of £9 million is being provided for ongoing expenditure.  This is the largest and most expensive hospital in the country.</P>

      <P>The interruptions are merely indicative of people grasping at straws because they have nothing else to do but provide budgets which did not take account of the forward-thinking which is necessary for the progress of the people. The moderation in drinking and no smoking will undoubtedly have a beneficial affect on the population at large and will enable future Ministers to be a little less demanding on the resources for hospitalisation and capital expenditure of this type.  There is no <Col N="1201" /> doubt that the Minister concerned is very courageous in his programme of hospital rationalisation and building.</P>
      <P>He took a courageous decision in sanctioning the building of the huge new complex at Beaumont, which will be of great benefit to the people of that area and to the country.  He is to be congratulated on the success of his negotiations with the medical profession and the people concerned for the very rapid start to that major investment.  This is in line with the various other attitudes in the budget.  Earlier today I gave some comparisons with budgets of previous administrations. As far as social welfare is concerned some comparisons are worth giving.  In a budget introduced by Deputy Richie Ryan at a comparable period during the Coalition Government a widow with three children got £15.45p. In this budget a widow with three children will get £34.10p.  Can anybody say that that is not imaginative, courageous, sympathetic and in line with the forward thinking of this side of the House as far as social welfare is concerned? We have consistently looked after the poorer sections.</P>

      <P>A widow with three children is not a member of any strong trade union. She is not a self-employed person and is not a person earning a very large salary.  She is an unfortunate person dependent on the State.  Fianna Fáil are now giving her £34.10 compared with £15.45 and we will make it more next year.  With regard to children's allowances, in 1974 the first child got £2.30.  That did not change at all during the whole period of office of the Coalition Government.  For that whole period successive budgets told us that sources outside our control were bringing in high inflation.  The effrontery of the Minister concerned saying &ldquo;he was responsible <Col N="1202" /> for 50 per cent of this inflation&rdquo;.  Not once was the first child's allowance improved. We have now improved it to £3.50.  We are taking courageous, progressive steps and we are looking after the poorer sections.  Looking at the needs of the people in the developing areas we are constructing health centres in abundance and the health centres are constructing smaller ancillary health centres so that mothers with prams and small children will not have to walk too far to get the necessary advice and help mothers with young families must have and which they are getting under our social conscience budgets.  That is in total contrast to what happened under the previous administration.  The lack of concern and planning has been reversed in a short period.  The Minister for Health is to be congratulated on so many fronts that he is an example of the budgetary thinking of Fianna Fáil in getting the country moving forward.</P>
      <P>Over the years we listened to the rant that Fine Gael were the party of law and order.  What happened under their administration? We had the tragedy on the north side of the city that youngsters who unfortunately were neglected were termed &ldquo;Bugsy Malone Gangs&rdquo; because of their gangster-like activities.  We have now successfully channeled their energies in other directions and have given them an opportunity to become decent citizens.  Our attitude towards law and order is to help people and this budget allows for an increase of 500 extra members to the Garda.  Under Fianna Fáil guidance the Garda are a force to help people rather than a force that uses the heavy arm and the baton to put down unfortunates who under a different administration may not have had the opportunity to be anything better. These 500 extra Garda members with their better training and better job prospects within their profession will help relieve rather than merely contain criminality.  There is no doubt that the situation which obtained in some of our inner city areas will improve when these young men come on duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the previous administration, the so-called law and order Government, it was impossible in certain areas to walk <Col N="1203" /> the street at night and there were few places where one could park a car. There were &ldquo;no parking&rdquo; signs everywhere.  Fianna Fáil have not even two budgets under their belt and one can walk the streets again and can park a car wherever one finds a parking space.  Admittedly, because of the increased prosperity the traffic has increased and it is almost impossible to find a parking space.  However there are no &ldquo;no parking&rdquo; signs where they were three years ago.  This must be a great satisfaction to the Minister for Justice in his clearing up after four years of the so-called law and order people.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have been clutching at straws in this debate.  This was illustrated by the hysteria shown during the debate on the EMS before the presentation of this budget.  When the budgetary proposals were eventually brought before the House we heard nothing.  The EMS is now on the cards and we can move forward into Europe with confidence because of the successful negotiations within the context of this budget by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. The relationship between Europe and our national budget has been very ably demonstrated to be in the interests of the people, in total contrast to the hysteria which was indulged in by the people on the far side of the House.  They had not one progressive or constructive suggestion as to how to get over the so-called difficulties they claimed existed. The only constructive suggestions carried out and being carried out in relation to the budget, the EMS and our relations with the European Parliament have come from this side of the House.  The people elected us to do what we are doing and what we will continue to do.</P>

      <P>What we are doing is in line with the forward thinking of Fianna Fáil. Our negotiations in regard to the EMS having come to a successful conclusion, I am surprised that we have heard so <Col N="1204" /> little from the far side of the House on the recent developments in that area.  We heard enough from them when it looked as if they might not come to a successful conclusion.  This is typical of the regressive attitudes that come from the far side of the House time and again.  What is the point in claiming to be progressive Irishmen here to further the progress of our nation, if they cannot come up with something constructive?  When we were in opposition we made constructive suggestions culminating in our manifesto and in the budget which is being discussed. The Fianna Fáil philosophy of the ability of our people to improve themselves with proper incentives and proper guidelines laid down by progressive politics is typified in this budget which was constructed by a forward-thinking team working in unison for the betterment of the people.  We have a Cabinet that is not a coalition, a Cabinet of committed Fianna Fáil activists who do not have one hand pulling against the other, or one foot not knowing in which direction the other foot is going.  We were told we would never get into the EMS.  We are in the EMS.  We are in Europe.  We are progressing in Europe and, with Fianna Fáil policies as outlined in this budget, we will continue to progress for the betterment of our people and there will be no limit to that progress.</P>

      <P>This budget is a bold and imaginative attempt by this Government and the Fianna Fáil Party to <Col N="1206" /> achieve something for our people.  The House will recall the chaotic state of this country before the Fianna Fáil Government took up office in July 1977.  We all remember the frustrated and anxious faces of our young people.  We remember that they regarded themselves as a people without a future, without hope, as people with no possibility of being provided with an opportunity of making a contribution to Irish society. All of that has changed in the past 18 or 19 months.  It has changed because we have a Government that is part and parcel of the plain people of Ireland.  We have a Government prepared to introduce budgets which are realistic, bearing in mind the demands, needs and aspirations of our people.  Indeed, this Government have made a bold and daring attempt to create the thousands upon thousands of jobs needed for our young people.  That is something our opponents did not even attempt to do because they had no policy and could not agree among themselves on the ways and means of tackling the problem.  This Government have tackled that problem. But they have been hampered in every way possible by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties and by organisations closely associated with and allied to the Labour Party.  They seem to be endeavouring to wreck the economy of this country at every available opportunity. The Irish people must be on their guard; they must decide once and for all not to heed those people.  They must realise that somebody has got to get on with the job, that this country has got to be governed.</P>

      <P>I was endeavouring to deal&mdash;again before the continued interruptions of Deputy Harte&mdash;with the problem of creating more and more jobs for the young and growing population of this country.  This Government have done something bold and imaginative in their budgetary proposals in an effort to <Col N="1209" /> tackle that enormous task, which was aggravated by four-and-a-half years of continued neglect, despite the fact that we were told we had the men with all the superior intelligence, the men of all the talents, who had all the answers and solutions to the problems.  We saw what happened.  Now the least we could expect of those people is a certain amount of goodwill and co-operation in this Government's efforts, through their budgetary proposals, to tackle this enormous task.  That spirit of co-operation is sadly lacking because of the frustrated thinking and attitudes of the people on the Opposition benches.  However, the public will take note of their behaviour and will have something to say in regard to the record of those people, as opposition groups for the past 18 or 19 months, when they cast their votes next June.</P>
      <P>This Government are committed to a programme of job creation.  In that programme they are entitled to expect the support of all sections of the community. Unfortunately, that support is lacking.  Efforts are being made to try to aggravate every situation in an effort to dampen the Government's job-creation programmes.  The Government want to continue with that work and it will take the most determined efforts of the Fianna Fáil to carry out that programme.  We have got an endorsement from the people and as a party and a Government we are expected to deliver in the field of job creation and to provide the necessary jobs.</P>
      <P>More money has been made available to local authorities by way of additional moneys for the environmental grant scheme, for road works, housing, water and sewerage.  It must be borne in mind that many local authorities are now in a better position to give more employment than they have been for many years.  All that has been made possible despite the fact that rates on private houses and tax on cars were abolished.  The Irish people in general have made a beneficial saving as a result of the implementation of the promises outlined in the 1977 manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The young people still look to us as the only party that can give them any hope for the future.  We are pleased that <Col N="1210" /> all those incentives are, one way or another, helping to give the additional jobs which were promised.  It may be said&mdash;and Deputy Harte will say it, I suppose&mdash;that we fell short of our targets in 1978.  That is quite true.  We fell short of our targets because every effort was made to ensure that our targets would not be met.  The culprits were not the Fianna Fáil Party but the Fine Gael Party and Labour Party and their close allies who did everything in their power to try to wreck and hamper the Government's job-creation programme.  But the work of the Government must be continued. The Irish people must get everything that was promised in the manifesto of 1977.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joseph Fox spoke about the liberal social welfare increases that were granted in the previous budget.  This is the first time we have had any real or significant increase in social welfare benefits and all this happened through the imaginative thinking of the Government. Indeed it has happened because Fianna Fáil promised, and have always adhered to the principle, that they would look after the weaker sections of the community, the people who are unable to look after themselves&mdash;the widows, orphans, old age pensioners, the disabled and the infirm.  That has been Fianna Fáil policy over the years and it is still Fianna Fáil's priority to look after those in greatest need.  That has been achieved in this budget and these benefits will be paid shortly and the people will have some idea of the determination of the Government to look after the most needy sections of the community.</P>
    <P>We had a very low rate of inflation in 1978 but organised groups are endeavouring to ensure that that situation will not obtain in 1979 by deliberately creating inflation.  They are endeavouring to create as much havoc as possible to ensure that the inflation rate will continue to rise and to ensure that the Government's social welfare benefits will seem insignificant because of inflation.  We must bear in mind that excessive wage demands can only result in continued inflation which will in turn result in more and more unemployment. We are committed to the <Col N="1211" /> elimination of unemployment.  The people who have the interests of the country at heart should ensure that the wreckers are not given the opportunity they want, that the climate they want to create is not created because, they want to wreck the economy of this country.  They have no interest in job creation.  They have no interest in the economy.  When I speak of a country I speak of our island.</P>

Indeed, it can be said without fear of contradiction that Fianna Fáil were always the party of realism, the party that understood the needs of the sections of our community that were in greatest need.  That has been seen to in the budget and those people will enjoy real benefits in the coming year if the efforts of the wreckers are subdued.  We have in our society at present elements determined to wreck the entire economy of this country and to dismantle our democratic institutions as we know them.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, those wreckers seem to have complete access to the media, something Fianna Fáil do not have and never had.  However, we always get by and get an endorsement from the people, despite the fact that we do not enjoy our fair share of fair comment from the media, whether it be the newspapers or RTE.  The Irish people have noticed this during the years.  They noticed it in June 1977.  Our party have not suffered despite the campaign of victimisation that has been going on for years.  Fianna Fáil will be a force in Irish political society for many generations to come and that is something that is causing further frustration to the Opposition. There is no doubt about that and there will be no doubt about it next June when the people go to the polls again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from granting liberal social welfare increases, the budget has ensured that every local authority has a liberal supply of money to embark on a programme of road and house construction, on the installation of water and sewerage facilities and the improvement <Col N="1213" /> of waterways.  All those things are necessary and they must be pursued with the enthusiasm that only a Fianna Fáil Government can generate.  That enthusiasm will be obvious throughout this year when we see each local authority embark on an ambitious road development programme, something that was lacking in the four years of Coalition Government.  Despite the fact that they collected car tax and that on one occasion the then Minister for Finance hiked the price of petrol by 15p per gallon, they did little for road development.  The Minister for Finance in the Coalition Government was short of money and he had to beg, borrow and steal to get it.  That is not the situation today.  We have more formal and planned budgeting than during the years of Coalition misrule.</P>
    <P>That kind of planned programming and budgeting will help to develop the economy in the way the Irish people expect. It will create the many thousands of jobs that are needed and it will make this nation the envy of our European allies. In 1978 we had the highest growth rate in the EEC.  That was achieved because of the ambitious programmes outlined by the Fianna Fáil in budgets, because of the determination of the Government and the Irish people to produce more, because of their efforts to create more jobs and to export more of our manufactured and agricultural goods.  It is that kind of activity that has made us the envy of Europe.  It is worth nothing that the Rev. Mr. Paisley when he went to Brussels recently was amazed at the figures produced for him because they outlined clearly the progress made here.  That progress was made because Fianna Fáil are determined to carry out their programmes.</P>
    <P>The business incentives in the budget have been accepted widely by the majority of the business community.  We all realise the important role they are playing in their efforts to stimulate greater growth and to expand our economy. They realise that the Government have embarked on the right policies.  They know they have the incentives necessary to make their full contribution to the promotion of job-creation enterprises, to <Col N="1214" /> expand our economy and to generate more and more wealth.</P>
    <P>The agricultural sector has played an enormous role in recent years due to our accession to the EEC in 1973.  I suppose it is reasonable to say that other sections of the community here have been envious of the rate of progress that the agricultural industry has made.  The farming community realise they have been the chief beneficiaries of our EEC participation and they know they can be expected to pay their fair share of tax in order to provide the necessary services. In 1974 a former Minister for Finance introduced taxation of farmers for the first time.  That year was a disastrous one for the agricultural sector.  Livestock could not be disposed of due to marketing difficulties and because the then Government could not agree on the line to be adopted with regard to determining a green £ for Irish agriculture. The result was that millions of pounds were lost to the economy and to the farming sector and it took that sector two years to recover.</P>
    <P>Farmers have fully recovered now and they are anxious to play their role in creating a better and more forward-looking Irish society.  They are determined to avail of all the new outlets that the opening of the enlarged Community has created for them.  They want to pay their fair share of taxation and I am sure all of us are pleased that for the first time they have admitted they are willing to pay their fair share.  That could not be said in 1974 or 1975 because they did not have the means to pay anybody. They had no income.  It was extraordinary that the then farm leaders did not create the same scenes as they have created recently.  Is it that the leaders did not want to rock the boat on that occasion? Was it a political manoeuvre on their part that they would not have any large-scale demonstrations or protests? Probably they felt they should not rock the boat on that occasion.  Yet a Minister for Finance on that occasion stated that he expected to get £35 million from the farmers.  He got less than £1 million.</P>
    <P>Coupled with income tax, we had also wealth tax which created burdens for thousands of farmers.  That tax was <Col N="1215" /> abolished in 1977, but it is no harm to remind farmers that many of them have enjoyed benefits as a result.  If the wealth tax were now in force thousands of our wealthier farmers would be obliged to pay the contributions laid down in that tax.  They were relieved by the Fianna Fáil Government and some of the more wealthy farmers should be doubly reminded of that.  They have enjoyed the benefits of the abolition of that tax and should therefore be prepared to pay their fair share of tax so as to create a more equitable system of taxation for all our people.  There was a time when they were not in a position to pay but they are now able to make that contribution to the national economy.  We are encouraged by the fact that the vast majority of farmers now feel they can meet their obligations.  I hope that before May an equitable system of taxation will be agreed on and accepted by the Government and the farming community, bearing in mind that it is the responsibility of the Government to introduce that equitable system.  I have no doubt they will do so.  The farmers have admitted that they are prepared to pay their fair share.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the farmers are tax dodgers but there is no way in which they can dodge their obligation because of the method of disposing of farm goods and output.  All farm produce must be sold at the creamery, the factory, the mart or exported.  There is no way in which they can fiddle accounts. There may be other sections of the community not paying their fair share.  It has been alleged that some professionals and self-employed persons have devised ways of fiddling the books in making tax returns.  I have no evidence of that and I am sure that if there is such evidence the Revenue Commissioners are equipped to chase those people and extract from them a fair share of taxation.</P>
    <P>The PAYE sector have made an enormous contribution to revenue in recent years.  I am not surprised that there is such unrest in that sector at present, but we must remember that they only pay tax on money they earn, when they have their pay packets in their pockets.  They <Col N="1216" /> are in a better position to pay tax than the underprivileged or those with no incomes at all.  I hope that as our jobs programme succeeds more and more people will be contributing tax and in that way that the amount of PAYE tax can be gradually reduced.  When we have fewer contributing we have more unemployed, more call on other benefits and the drain on the Exchequer and on those in full-time employment is greater.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the EMS will create a new dimension for Ireland.  We shall see the Irish nation play its full role as a member of the strongest currency in the world at present.  That is why I welcomed our decision to join the EMS. All sections must realise that, if we are to participate fully as members of the new monetary system, there must be moderation in wage demands by every section of the community.  It is extraordinary that in 1979, after the year of lowest inflation for many years, people are making excessive wage and pay demands, people in sheltered positions not concerned with market fluctuations or problems in other countries.  Yet those people are making demands in excess of 50 per cent.  Are they serious in their demands?  Do they realise that they are going to wreck our economy?  Are they part of an organised scheme to bring about the down-fall of this economy?  I say to such people &ldquo;It is time for you to play your full role in Irish society and accept your fair share of the national cake.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If a few people succeed in getting a larger slice of the national cake less will be left for other sections.  That would be a disastrous situation and that type of situation will come about if excessive wage demands are conceded.  Public service workers should realise that they have something that thousands of other workers have not; they have a guarantee of continuous employment.  They have not the same anxieties or worries as people in the private sector, because whether they are working in agriculture, industry or in any type of service they are affected by developments or trends or crises in other countries and their jobs can be in jeopardy.  If a manufacturer here discovers that he cannot sell his <Col N="1217" /> products in competition with other countries, that factory has no option but to close down.  Redundancies are created and more people join the list of unemployed.</P>
    <P>To all who are making excessive wage demands at present I say &ldquo;In the name of Ireland and the Irish people moderate your wage claims.  In doing so you are doing a service to yourself and every other member of the community because nothing can do more damage to the Irish economy than to have a few people getting more than their fair share of the national cake&rdquo;.  Let us hope that all the unrest that is with us at present will disappear and that we will have moderation in pay claims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for permitting me to raise this matter this evening and I regret any inconvenience that may be caused to the Minister of State.  Unfortunately, the issue is of such importance as to warrant being dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject matter of the two questions relates to the general situation prevailing in respect of the electrical wiring and electrical fitting of houses, particularly new houses.  I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that we may not be fully cognisant of the seriousness of the situation in respect of the standards in the area of electrical wiring and fitting nor may we realise fully the implications of this situation for life and limb.  In 1973, the most recent year for which I have been able to obtain figures, almost 20,000 houses went on fire in this country.  There was a significant number of deaths as a result of those fires.  In 1978 there were 130 fatalities arising from fires in domestic dwellings.  I would not imply that all of <Col N="1218" /> those fires were due to bad or faulty wiring but there is strong circumstantial evidence to indicate that this was the cause, especially since many of these fires occurred during the night.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that from 90 to 100 people lost their lives in 1978 in fires that could be attributed to faulty wiring. None of us need be surprised at that having regard to the extraordinary situation that exists in the area of wiring and installation.  The position is that anybody, regardless of whether he has not even the slightest knowledge of electrics, is entitled to contract to undertake wiring in a private house, and once that wiring has been carried out it is not necessary to have an independent assessment of the standards used before the current is switched on.  In other words, the wiring contractor need not have any qualifications in this area and there is no overseeing of the standards used.</P>
    <P>There is the system of the issuing of what are known as completion certificates. These are obtainable from a number of sources, including the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland. Unfortunately, the situation is that anybody can purchase these certificates, which are available also at a number of other outlets.  Yesterday I became the owner of one of these certificates, which on my signature would imply that a job I delineated was carried out adequately. This would be accepted as evidence by the ESB that the work was carried out in accordance with their required standards. Of course, I would not be so irresponsible as to utilise that certificate in any such way and it will be scrapped after this debate.  These certificates are available at about 2½p each.  They are signed by the person who executes the work.  There might be some safeguard if they had to be signed by somebody else, but to have them signed by the contractor is similar to asking a person to adjudicate on his own work.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to doubt that the majority of contractors are genuine people, but because of the basic seriousness of electrical wiring, and its implications not only in terms of workmanship but in terms of life and limb, there should not be any loophole that would permit a careless contractor's work not to be <Col N="1219" /> detected.  The ESB accept the certificates at face value.  On 15 February the Minister for the Environment undertook in the House to have the matter considered, but even he on that occasion was under a false impression.  In reply to a question from me he said that the ESB inspect electrical installations.  The context of the question implied that he was talking about all electrical installations. He went on to say that the installations are inspected by the ESB before the current is connected.  After some further exchanges the matter rested with the Minister undertaking to consider the situation, but those who are interested in this matter have found it very difficult to get evidence of cases in which inspections were carried out.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for these inspections not being carried out may be a reluctance on the part of the ESB to undertake the task because of inadequate staff for that purpose, and there is also a reluctance on the part of the householder in this respect because an inspection costs £40.  Therefore, there is no clamour to have inspections undertaken with the result that there is not any independent overseeing of the standards used. Concern has been expressed widely by a number of bodies about this whole situation. In recent correspondence arising out of the exchange in the Dáil on 15 February the Association of Electrical Contractors (Ireland), no doubt very conscious of the fact that their members' livelihoods are involved as well as their natural concern for public safety, adverted to the question in their letter of 23 February which was circulated to the press and from which I quote a paragraph which indicates their agreement with the case I am making:</P>
    <P>Completion Certificates are only supplied by the two Contractor Associations to their members but unfortunately as the law stands at present these Completion Certificates may be purchased by anyone from other sources all over the country and indeed electrical installations work may be executed by anyone qualified or unqualified....</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> ...It will be appreciated that where thousands of installations are carried out every year in this country, the unfortunate ESB supervisors cannot possibly examine all the installations in detail and assume responsibility for the quality of the work done.</P>
    <P>In other words, the situation is that there is open season regarding the electrical wiring of houses.  This is a very serious matter.  I would go further and say that not very far from here there are breaches of even the basic standards set down by the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland and the ESB.  The ESB in their document <i>Requirements for Domestic Metering</i>, effective from January 1974, set out a number of standards.  One of these reads:</P>
    <P>Where the ESB apparatus is located indoors one cabinet may be used to house both ESB and consumer's equipment, provided all requirements for ESB metering cabinets are satisfied and a space measuring 585 × 380 mm. is reserved for ESB apparatus.</P>
    <P>I understand that it is not appropriate to refer by name to people who are outside the House, but I would draw the attention of the Minister to housing estates in the Kilnamanagh area of Dublin.  These are houses built by private contractors. If the Minister wishes I can let her have examples of where standards in respect of electrical wirings and fittings, as well as other standards such as those laid down by the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland, are being broken in this estate. For example, regarding the necessity for a fuse board for domestic installations intended for mounting in dry locations&mdash;that would be indoor&mdash;these fuse boards are being mounted in outdoor meter chambers.  This is contrary to the rules laid down by the bodies concerned and contrary also to the requirements specified by the ESB.</P>
    <P>That may not seem a major point but it should go out from the House that those who are in the process of changing electrical fuses in a chamber outside the House intended for use inside run the risk in wet weather of electrocution.  I do not wish to be alarmist about this, but this is highly dangerous.  It is not just <Col N="1221" /> dangerous in the Kilnamanagh estate being developed by a firm of well-known builders; there are examples to be found in Sligo and other areas where there is a cavalier approach to the placement of fuse boxes and the material used in them.</P>
    <P>Immediate measures are necessary to combat this situation.  There is photographic and other evidence available for those who may doubt my word in this case.  I have a piece of fuse wiring in my possession and I can show with it the common practice adopted in wiring houses.  I am told that the proper practice when wiring a house is to twist the wires around each other so that wind or any other movement will not cause them to touch but, because it saves time&mdash;and possibly material&mdash;the common practice almost nationally is to keep the wires parallel to each other.  If the wires are in an attic a draught may cause them to touch.  If that happens a very dangerous situation develops. Those short cuts are not tolerable because lives are at stake.  It is imperative that a rigid set of standards are introduced and are seen to be adhered to in such cases.</P>
    <P>I am told that a symptom of this situation is when lights flicker in a house for no apparent reason.  If that happens it could be an indication of danger.  It is our duty to bring such matters to the attention of our people.  One of the specific regulations being broken in the Kilnamanagh estate is paragraph 5.9.2 in the book entitled <i>National Rules for Electrical Installations.</i>  An attempt was made to defend that in a recent newspaper article.  This is not the first occasion this matter has been aired.  The Electrical Safety Bureau of Ireland, a voluntary group of expert people who have a lot of experience in the electrical field, also aired it.  Due credit should be paid to them for pursuing this case, often at great personal inconvencience, financial loss, embarrassment and, in some cases, apparent discrimination.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the media have endeavoured to show the anomalies that exist here and the <i>Sunday World</i> highlighted this problem.  That is all to the good because it meant that the <Col N="1222" /> Minister of State, and the Minister for the Environment, were in a position to give a detailed reply to my question.  The Minister of State admitted that in view of the present unsatisfactory situation she intended to start consultations immediately with the relevant interests concerned with a view to establishing the best possible procedures to protect the public interest in this area of activity.  I should also like to thank the Minister for the Environment for his commitment last month to get something done about this problem.  It has taken many years to get the admission that the situation was unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State to tell the House the steps, apart from the consultations, she intends taking and how long it will take these steps to become effective.  If we can manage to save one person as a result of our efforts, we will be achieving a lot.  The cavalier approach in this area is exemplified by the issuing of completion certificates which are available for anybody.  The booklets which contain the basic rules are not madly purchased by some electrical contractors and it is possible that that is due to the price being in excess of £8.  Some form of system should be adopted to ensure that the requirements are not alone in the possession of electrical contractors but are known by them.  The Government, after all, rightly insist that nobody can drive on our roads without a driving licence and it is not possible to procure such a licence without having knowledge of the rules of the road.  That is the way it should be in the electrical business.</P>
    <P>The time has come to terminate the extraordinary practice whereby anybody can buy a completion certificate over the counter.  We must establish a register of contractors for the electrical trade to help to bring about at least minimum standards in this regard.  I should like to know the Minister's proposal in this connection. Consultations and deliberations have been going on for a long time about this matter.  I have in my possession a letter from the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland, dated 12 August 1974, which indicates that that body consider the matter serious and are concerned <Col N="1223" /> about the registration of contractors. That letter was written five years ago and we do not know what loss might have been saved had action been taken earlier on the lines suggested by that body.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates that this is not a party political issue.  It is a matter of public concern.  The registration of contractors is important; as is the introduction of an independent assessment system.  I am told that the standards which exist on paper at present are unsatisfactory because alterations have been introduced which are not helpful.  The ETCI, and the supervisory body the Minister may decide on, should not only represent, as the ETCI does at present, what might be called the vested interests involved, it should also represent the consumer, the State and trade unions.  The existing group responsible for overseeing these standards represents only people who have a direct interest in the trade; it does not represent the public interest.  They have admitted that the standards are not satisfactory and, in fairness to them, they could not be expected to be biased in favour of the consumer.  I know that that is where the Minister's heart lies.  There are many issues in this area which are serious and I hope the Minister will tell the House what is to be done and how long it will take.  There is great need for this matter to be treated as urgent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the subject raised I should like to refer to the question of raising it on the Adjournment. I am delighted that Deputy Keating felt he needed to apologise for inconveniencing the Minister of State by bringing her back on the Adjournment, but I hasten to assure him that he, or any Member, would not inconvenience me at any time if they felt a matter was of such importance that it should be discussed here.  Since I became a Member I felt that the reason for raising a matter on the Adjournment was because a Member got an unsatisfactory answer from the Minister concerned during Question Time, particularly if the <Col N="1224" /> Member was present and had an opportunity of asking supplementary questions. I was genuinely concerned yesterday that Deputy Keating felt the question was sufficiently important to put down at Question Time, but not sufficiently important for him to be here personally to ask supplementaries. Perhaps the concern he has shown this evening does not go very deep.</P>
      <P>In my reply yesterday I said that the full question and the importance of the two matters raised had been recognised for a considerable length of time.  I also said that in view of the present situation which I, and everybody else found unsatisfactory, I intended to start consultations immediately with everyone concerned, including Ministers, with a view to establishing the best possible procedures to protect the public interest in this area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made some sweeping statements to which I will refer later.  He mentioned the ETCI liberally during his speech.  It is important for the House to realise exactly who the ETCI are.  They were formally established in 1972.  They are an advisory body to the Minister, made up of representatives of manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, the electrical trade unions, electrical traders and representatives from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Department of Labour, the ESB and others.  They have no responsibility for policing the work of contractors or enforcing national wiring rules.  In 1976 the ETCI drew up national rules for electrical installations.  Provisional specific rules for domestic installations were published in 1976 and were later confirmed in 1978.  Both rules replaced the 1968 rules for wiring, which had been drawn up by an earlier committee composed of the ESB, the Electrical Contractors Association, the Association of Electrical Contractors of Ireland and the Consulting Engineers of Ireland Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating spoke about the incorrect information given here, not intentionally, by another Minister in connection with the ESB.  He is right in stating that they do not inspect wiring in houses, nor is it their function to do so. <Col N="1225" /> The internal wiring of houses is the customer's responsibility and when the ESB engineers call they only make a cursory check to ensure that the wiring will not interfere with the ESB's external supply system&mdash;for example, by overloading the existing system.</P>
    <P>The Deputy gave some information&mdash;I am not sure how full the information is&mdash;when he made allegations of dangerous wiring in a certain housing estate in the Dublin area.  He has not mentioned if he has concrete evidence of this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or if he has any information that the wiring done in this estate was carried out by unqualified people.  I would be delighted if he were to tell the House if he has this information. If he has concrete evidence of this, something can be done about it. Unless we can prove that certain things are dangerous for the public safety and should be looked into, I do not think we should abuse our privilege in this House by naming certain estates in the Dublin area.  All we have to do is name the estate and immediately the finger is pointed at the person who did the work. I do not think neglecting to mention the person's name is sufficient.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating mentioned the proposed roll of approved electrical contractors. Since 1975 efforts have been made to establish a roll of approved electrical contractors which would be on a voluntary basis.  Members would pay a fee, and criteria relating to trade and experience would be laid down.  There would be powers of administration, rejection or expulsion, investigation of eligibility and equipment available to contractors.  On 19 January 1978 I requested that this should be encouraged.  I said that the main purpose of this scheme is that the industry should regulate itself and maintain its own standard of quality.  Many professional people impose self-regulations on members of the profession and this is an excellent way to do business.</P>

      <P>Contractors would be free to be included in this roll and would not be forced to go on it.  The two main contractors associations have different views on this roll.  The Electrical Contractors Association said they would refuse to operate within it unless the roll were made statutory. They have not presented any convincing reasons or information to me that would make it necessary to give this roll statutory backing.  In case I were to damage any discussions going on at the moment, I want to tell the House that both associations are currently discussing the whole question of setting up the roll and how it should operate.  I hope that a satisfactory conclusion will be reached as quickly as possible which will be suitable and effective for the safety of the general public and improve the trade itself.  Every electrician would be delighted to enrol in such a roll of electrical contractors.  Most of the builders who give work to electrical contractors would ensure that only those who are on the roll would be accepted by them.</P>
      <P>The withdrawal from the market and from issue of the blank certificates, to which Deputy Keating referred in yesterday's question, would not be regarded as effective, particularly those issued by the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland because these certificates can be and are issued by others.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the proposed new Irish standards of electrical wiring proposed two years ago by the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland; if he accepts that these standards should be incorporated into house building requirements in this country; the proposals if any, to this effect, or other proposals to bring about improvements other than these specific regulations; and if the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland has asked his Department to include such regulations in general building standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am so aware and, as I informed the Deputy on 15 February, electrical installations and fitments in all recently built local authority houses are required to meet the requirements of the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland and the Electricity Supply Board. Similar standards are prescribed for private grant-aided new houses and are incorporated in my Department's memorandum and outline specification for such houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1178" /> The Electro-Technical Council of Ireland have been in touch with my Department with a view to incorporating the &ldquo;National Rules for Electrical Installations, Part I, General Requirements&rdquo; in the building regulations at present being prepared in my Department. However, I have informed the council that the incorporation of the national rules at this stage would create legal and practical difficulties for planning authorities who will have responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations. The council had already been made aware of the difficulties in discussions they had with officers of my Department. I agreed that I would re-examine the position when the regulations are made and local authorities have set up the necessary organisations, have experience of their operation and have had an opportunity to consider how enforcement could be best achieved.</P>
    <P>I also asked the council in the meantime to pursue whatever other means which might be available to them, to ensure that the requirements of the rules are met in all new building.  I have also asked my colleague, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, under whose aegis the council operates, to investigate the question of the restriction to qualified electricians of the issue of blank certificates.</P>
