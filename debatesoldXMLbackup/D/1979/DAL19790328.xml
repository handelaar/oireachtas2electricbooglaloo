      <P>The last time this motion was debated there was a lot of talk about Government strategy and what was intended by this budget.  It might be forgotten by the Opposition that this budget is a continuation of proven Fianna Fáil strategy on behalf of the people. The first stage of this strategy took place in the 1977 Budget, when we had direct Government action to boost economic growth, increase employment and reduce inflation.  That proved most effective, and the 1979 Budget, the second stage of that strategy, continued economic growth and social development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recognised by all that we have had a dynamic economy since the return of a Fianna Fáil administration.  Confidence has returned to our economy and the public sector.  This fact is accepted by the Opposition parties, by no less a personage than the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy FitzGerald.  In a recent television programme he was adamant that we had a dynamic economy and he used this fact in pursuance of his confederation policy.  He accepted that Irish dynamism would be a good enticement for those in the North to join an all-Ireland confederation.  The Labour Party did not want us to join anything, including the EEC and EMS. It is a good ploy not to agree with anything, because it gives one an opportunity to castigate efforts made subsequently. I concede that they have a habit of joining marches in pursuance of aims <Col N="555" /> which might not be in the best interests of the State at this time.</P>
    <P>Everybody accepted that 1978 targets were ambitious.  No forecasts were made, but it was agreed by all, nationally and internationally, that our growth rate of 7 per cent last year not only was the highest in the EEC but was a remarkable performance by any national or international standards.  Fianna Fáil strategy has been spelt out over the past two years by all economic Ministers and it covered the three points I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>Whether the Opposition like it or not, the statistics are there to prove that in 1977 the inflation rate was 13.6 per cent and in 1978 it was 7.6 per cent.  It was the Government's strategy to combat inflation successfully and it has to be agreed by all that they have had unique success.  Comparisons may be odious but comparisons will have to be acceptable because things were different during the Coalition's term of office.  Inflation was at an unprecedented level.  It is wasting time to talk about inflation today when one considers the rampant inflation that existed under the Coalition.</P>
    <P>Part of the Fianna Fáil strategy was a determined policy of price control. When the Coalition were in power there was a price increase every Friday.  They had no idea of price control, but price control returned when Fianna Fáil took office in 1977.  Coupled with that we had a responsible wage restraint which has always been part and parcel of Fianna Fáil's strategy.  This is the formula for increased growth the Minister for Finance has been speaking about recently.  This is the formula for growth that will give an increase in the level of employment, an improvement in living standards and better environmental employment conditions. Is that not the aim of any democratically elected Government? Who has been more successful in pursuing that type of policy than the single unified Fianna Fáil administration?</P>
    <P>Job investment was, and still is, the primary aim of the current administration. This is a continuation of the Fianna Fáil strategy for continued economic growth.  What is the best way of achieving that?  We must aim at lower costs, <Col N="556" /> greater productivity and better and more determined marketing at home and abroad.  It is not suggested by Fianna Fáil that the Government are alone in this area of economic growth. Employers, employees and unions all have their role to play.  We must consider the consequences of any arbitrary decisions taken by any one of these sections in pursuance of sectional interest that might not be in the best national interests. There is general agreement that the best way to combat unemployment is to create new jobs by implementing an active growth policy.  This coupled with high investment and improved competitiveness must be the way, as enunciated by the Minister for Finance recently, of achieving a better employment situation.</P>
    <P>We have had a remarkable success in this matter since 1977 when Fianna Fáil returned to office.  Comparisons may be odious but it must be remembered that the Fianna Fáil strategy has paid off. The achievements in employment in 1978 were tremendous.  Almost 30,000 new jobs were created leaving a net job creation of 17,000 when one takes away redundancies and other problems over which we had no control.  The objective of the Fianna Fáil economic policy is to have a return to a high level of employment and the strategy has been to strengthen economic growth and give employment a new boost.  The figures for employment were increased for the first time in decades last year.  What kind of situation existed during the Coalition's term in office?  The high rise in unemployment figures was the talk of the nation and of our international friends. The figure of 100,000 was often passed and we were nearing the 200,000 mark. Yet within two years more jobs were created under Fianna Fáil than were ever created in any two-year period since the foundation of the State and this at the time when unemployment in the Common Market countries rose.</P>
    <P>Both sides of industry must play their part in promoting a lasting growth and bringing about lasting improvements in the employment situation.  The EMS will have many advantages for us but it must be directed towards resolving problems we have in economic growth and <Col N="557" /> employment.  Special measures will have to be introduced to deal with youth employment.  We must consider new methods and opportunities for training and retraining our workers to allow for greater flexibility and mobility.  Certain industries cannot find trained personnel. This is unfortunate when we have a high unemployment situation.  Measures are to be taken by this Government to ensure that training and retraining is made available through the Ministers for Labour and Industry, Commerce and Energy.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the job creation programme of Fianna Fáil in 1978.  In the public sector 12,529 jobs were created, chiefly in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and other State bodies.  No Opposition Deputy can quibble with the fact that more personnel were needed in these outlets yet we had to wait until Fianna Fáil were returned to office before the question of improving the situation occurred to anybody.  In the building construction industry there was an increase of 5,592 jobs.  This figure would have been greater but for the strike situation which existed during 1978.  When one considers that the building industry had an unprecedented year of growth in that year it is a guarantee of further growth in the industry. During the Coalition's time in Government the building programme virtually collapsed through lack of funding from State sources.  This has never been the case during Fianna Fáil administrations.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the need for youth employment, Fianna Fáil have taken particular interest in providing jobs for young people.  Fianna Fáil brought in the environmental works during 1978, thus creating 3,800 new jobs.  The AnCO community training programmes created 1,500 jobs.  Some of these were of short duration but there was a commitment from Fianna Fáil that they would be repeated this year and, not only are they being repeated, but substantial sums of money are being made available by the Minister for Finance to continue and expand these programmes during 1979.  Fianna Fáil recognise that youth employment will play an increasingly important role in Irish life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> The employment incentive scheme has been improved and expanded and it is now being made available for the construction and hotel industries.  This has had a major impact on job creation within these industries and some 10,000 new jobs were supported in this way during 1978.  This must be regarded, in the present climate, as remarkable and Fianna Fáil can be justly proud of their performance.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil recognise the fact that these economic policies must be continued and strengthened in 1979.  That is what the budget this year was all about. Too many smokescreens have been laid down concerning the 1979 budget.  If one leaves aside one provision in it, it will be recognised that it was probably the greatest economic growth document ever produced.  The budget has as its chief aim to continue the primary objectives and strategy of the Government, which is, a job for everyone who wants it.  In furthering this policy it is important that there is continued expansion in industry. The agencies dealing with this have been supported by substantial increases in funds to enable them to carry out their expansion programmes.</P>
    <P>There has been a continued inflow of new industry, and marketing agencies have been given increased funds to enable them to carry on their programmes. However, some of the activities perpetrated and supported here at home make their job a very difficult one.  They have been wonderfully successful throughout the years and we confidently expect them to reach their targets as far as the enticement of new industries to Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>We must continue to expand our agricultural industry.  This expansion will be of paramount importance during 1979 and ensuing years.  This can be achieved only by increased productivity. Many people had honestly felt that for far too long many thousands of acres had been left unproductive because of lack of finance to provide new schemes for the improvement of that land.  That is being tackled in 1979 and will be continued in the following years.</P>
    <P>We can get increased production on our land by paying more attention to the application of expertise.  It is only right <Col N="559" /> that there should be greater Government awareness of this.  They are providing funds so that new programmes can be developed and that expertise will be available for the improvement of productivity of agricultural land.  This improvement must be preserved rather than whittled away through schemes that would not have the desired effects on our non-productive acres.</P>
    <P>In 1979, it is hoped to create some 5,000 new jobs in the public sector.  I do not think anybody in the House would say anything against the need for continuous job creation in such Departments as Posts and Telegraphs, Finance&mdash;particularly in the Revenue section&mdash;and associated Departments. These jobs have to be paid for and it has been made abundantly clear that the cash is there for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The capital programme for 1979 stands at £600 million, a massive increase of 27 per cent on last year.  This can be expected to provide 4,500 new jobs in the building industry, and as everybody knows, when the building industry here is at peak production, everything else falls into place.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to increase the strength of the Garda by 500, providing us with a force of more than 10,000.  This is an appropriate area for job creation because the people paying for the service will then be able to have the best possible protection against those who set out to destroy the objectives of the Government.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase of £4.28 million for environmental work, for new job creation.  This will give a better chance to young people to get their first jobs and thus to gain the experience necessary to take up full employment in later job creation programmes.  The allocation for infrastructure provision has been increased and I do not think anybody will disagree with the necessity to improve our road network or our general infrastructure in relation to industry and social amenities.</P>
    <P>In the recent past there has been a spate of Opposition misrepresentation and scare headlines in order to divert people's minds from the efforts made by <Col N="560" /> Fianna Fáil in the past two years.  This is not in the public interest, but I do not think the public will be so gullible as to accept everything that is printed.  In the past two years there has been a great reawakening of objectives in relation to our economy and the Government have been negotiating successfully both nationally and internationally.  A campaign has been waged to increase the real standard of living of our people and Fianna Fáil are thus living up to the promises so firmly set out in the manifesto.</P>
    <P>Those who have said that our pre-election manifesto is our bible should be reminded that it seems to be their bible because not an Opposition Deputy speaks without referring to that document. We are proud of the manifesto which was our commitment to the Irish people.  Most of that commitment has been realised and the remaining items will be dealt with in the near future.</P>
    <P>Let us now contemplate the achievements of Fianna Fáil since they came back to office.  Our 1978 growth rate has been recognised internationally as a record.  We have led the economic structure of the EEC.  That year was the second in a row when we led those countries in growth rate, and our 1978 return was the envy of all OECD members.  The growth rate in 1977 was 5½ per cent and that was increased further in 1978 both in terms of investment and exports.  All these things mean that we will be able to increase employment and production still further.</P>
    <P>It has been said that during Coalition days incomes rose by between 16 per cent and 17 per cent annually.  That may be so, but we had an inflation rate in excess of that, so real earnings were debased.  The opposite has been happening since because our inflation rate has been held at such a low level that for the first time in years we have been having an increase in real incomes.  This, in turn, because of the increased spending power, creates the atmosphere for increased employment.  The tax burden, as a result, will be spread over a wider area to the benefit of the less well off in the community.  Conditions like that do not occur in time of recession.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> During the four years of Coalition administration the belt could not be tightened any more.  It is only since Fianna Fáil's return to office that living standards have improved.  This can be borne out if we consider that the number of new car purchases registered in the last 12 months stood at over 105,000.  It is only at times of improved living standards, when disposable income has been increased, that people are able to make these purchases.  Deputy Desmond said in relation to traffic congestion that Dublin was choking itself to death and I agree that the consumer boom is adding to the problems in Dublin.  This congestion has been brought about because more people are on the move.  They are able to move only because of the increased living standards since 1977. There is definitely a need for a better communications system and a better roads system.  The Government accept that, and one of our aims is to improve telecommunications and infrastructure. Huge sums were made available this year to implement our policies in this area.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition were in government there was a decrease in the level of grants made available towards improved telecommunications and infrastructure generally.  Any country councillor or local authority member will agree that during the Coalition term of office things were getting worse.  There was an increase in inflation, but there was no corresponding increase in grants to the local authorities for increased costs of materials.  Fianna Fáil have always agreed that a job creation programme is essential but during the Coalition term there was a reduction in the number of jobs created.  The level of job creation was below the 1973 level and still the Coalition said that they had the best interests of the ordinary people at heart. How can they justify that?  In this regard we had a very welcome improvement this year.  The people are conscious of it and are grateful to the Minister for Finance and to the Government for making the funds available to get the country back on the rails and to improve infrastructure as far as rural Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> May be the suggestion I made on the last occasion is not so far fetched after all.  Decentralisation was taken up by Fianna Fáil many years ago and a start was made.  There was some difficulty in relation to staffing at the time, but I would bring it home to the Government and to the Opposition that all the objections have been removed.  The Department of State located in Castlebar is a shining example of successful decentralisation.  There is no question now of people being unwilling or unavailable to travel west.  People now recognise that a better standard of living is available in the west, that there is less pressure and so on.  We have a long waiting list now of people anxious and willing to transfer to these offices.  A good job would be done if most Departments of State were decentralised.  We might very well consider locating the Department of the Taoiseach and the Dáil somewhere other than in Dublin. Imagine the boost it would give to the western economy if our capital was located in Athlone or in Shannon.  It would relive the congestion in Dublin.  If we carried out a proper decentralisation programme and removed the capital of Ireland to some other location it might have a happier effect on the people as a whole.  This has been done elsewhere and it should have been done here when we got our independence, but it would be better late than never.</P>
    <P>Another achievement of the Fianna Fáil administration already referred to in this debate, is the rate of growth of our fixed investment which rose by nearly 10 per cent in 1978.  The building and construction sector were chiefly responsible for this growth.  It can be stated unequivocally that since 1977 there has been a continued increase in this area, so that we now have a situation where we have the greatest number of building jobs ever and the greatest amount of investment in building and construction.  It can also be honestly said that during the Coalition term of office there was a slowing down in that area.  It is well known that the job lay-offs in the building industry at that time caused concern to every employer.  Still people are talking about a lack of activity here.</P>
    <P>More houses are being built since <Col N="563" /> Fianna Fáil came back to office both by individuals and local authorities than was ever contemplated during the Coalition term.  Greater financial assistance is being given in each budget to the private individual, to build his own home.  I would like to see more emphasis on this.  I accept that the local authorities must be involved in caring for those who have not the financial resources to cater for themselves, but greater assistance should be given to the private individual who is prepared to take out an SDA loan and spend the rest of his life paying it back. This loan should be increased to £12,000 or £13,000 and the income limit for eligibility to apply for this loan should be substantially increased, perhaps to £5,000 per annum.  This is part of the Fianna Fáil policy.  Since 1977 we have taken two steps and, conscious of the need to build up the housing stock, we have made huge sums of money available this year to local authorities to continue their building programme.  During 1978 there was a substantial new capital inflow for house building and industrial buildings.  One does not get an inflow of capital when the economy is depressed, one only gets it when there is confidence in the Government.</P>
    <P>There have been increased farm incomes as well in 1978.  There has been a great deal of new investment in farm buildings.  Consider what agricultural income was during the days of the Coalition Government.  I do not have to remind anybody who has even the remotest connection with agriculture about the situation which pertained in 1974 when calves were offered for sale at £1 each and nobody could be found to buy them.  They were left to roam around in State forests because it was not worth while keeping them.  Nobody could dispose of them.  That kind of situation does not pertain today.  There is an increase in farm income each year, successfully negotiated by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is still a low income problem in the western counties.  The 12 disadvantaged counties in the west have a relatively low level of development with resulting low income limits.  Many fac <Col N="564" /> tors are responsible for this, some of them physical factors such as poor quality land, inadequate drainage and difficult terrain.  These are all factors which have kept incomes low in the west.  There are demographic characteristics peculiar to the west which affect age and marital status and do not apply in other parts of the country.  There has always been insufficient capital for re-investment which has lead to continued low incomes for western farmers.  There has always been an unwillingness on the part of small farmers in the west to invest large amounts of capital because they did not have the income to support the repayments.</P>
    <P>There has been a persistent decline in the farming population in the west, especially on the under 30 acre farms.  I will give a few statistics to bear that out. In Mayo, which I represent, 62.5 per cent of farmers have less than 30 acres; 25 per cent of them are in the 30 to 50 acre bracket; and 10 per cent of them are in the 50 to 100 acre bracket.  An income gap has existed between average farm family incomes and average industrial earnings and it has always been in favour of the industrial worker.  For that reason in 1966 the now famous farmers' dole was introduced.  It remained substantially unaltered until the budgets of 1976 and 1977.  Between 1966 and 1976 the number of claimants for this type of assistance increased from about 7,000 persons to 30,000 persons. The notional income figure per £1 valuation stayed the same.  The maximum rates of assistance increased substantially during those years due to budgetary provisions.</P>
    <P>We now come to 1976 and 1977 when the multipliers were increased and those with valuations over £20 were no longer entitled to the notional assessment and could get the farmers' dole on factual income assessments only.  Very often the important role the dole plays in providing a minimum income for farmers in the western counties is not fully appreciated.  Should the abolition of the scheme ever be contemplated it would lead to severe hardship, a decline in our population and a movement away from the land.  With more stabilised <Col N="565" /> prices, considerably more people could be accommodated on the land and we could increase the volume of production given the right incentives.  It is Fianna Fáil's policy to keep our farming population on the land and to provide them with the necessary finance and the necessary investment to increase their productivity, thereby maintaining a bigger population on our western farms.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about removing the farmers' dole or changing it.  Alternative systems could be used with some kind of built-in incentives. Perhaps we could consider a few of the alternatives which may be available.  We could use that small assistance to farmers to pay the interest on capital for development purposes.  This would have the desired effect of increasing productivity and doing away with the old habit of not being prepared to borrow for development purposes. Perhaps we could give that assistance by way of an annual lump sum.  This would encourage investment.  We could give development grants based on yearly assistance and tied to development programmes.  This would also have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>Unemployment assistance to small farmers was always intended to guarantee a minimum level of income.  It should not be called unemployment assistance as many people in receipt of it are fully employed.  I would suggest a two-tier system for farmers in the disadvantaged areas which could be applied to those who are available for employment and those who need small farmer's assistance to improve their income limits.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently said that we could have no growth without an energy policy.  I accept that.  The picture in the eighties will be one of increasing pressure on oil supplies with the likelihood of substantial increases in real prices.  The EEC rely on imports for about 60 per cent of their primary energy and could find themselves under increasing pressure in the competition for the limited world supplies which will be available. During the nineties the supply of oil will peak and the supply of gas will not be far behind.  If the world supply of energy will be diminishing before the end of the <Col N="566" /> century, it is in our best interests to lessen our dependence on external supplies. The energy gap can only be closed by drastic conservation of fuel and the development of new sources of supply.</P>
    <P>There is a need for rapid action in oil and gas exploration.  More money will have to be provided in the hope that these resources may be found off the Porcupine Bank.  There will have to be a positive approach to nuclear power.  The price of delay is clear: power cuts, balance of payments difficulties and low growth in the industrial and commercial fields.  The debate on safety and security and the disposal of waste can go on together with increased research into the production and use of hydrogen, solar and geo-thermal energy.  Our energy gap has to be eliminated so that we can maintain and improve our living standards. It will be poor consolation to the people of the next generation if, through tardiness on our part in grasping the nettle there is a lack of growth and a lack of job opportunities.</P>
    <P>The best way to save energy is to halt pollution and to make better use of existing sources.  We will have to improve our standards of promoting thermal installations. Heating systems in existing buildings will have to be carefully judged and assessed.  We must develop better driving habits, better urban passenger transport systems and, as the Minister said yesterday, more recycling of waste. The £1,500 million spent on waste every year in the EEC could be used to provide us with new sources of energy and new methods of conserving our existing sources.</P>
    <P>In this debate no recognition was given to the increase across the board in social welfare benefits given by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare. A tremendous boost was given to the less well-off in our community.  Our balance of payments is now better than it ever was and when one fully realises the great advances that have been made during the past two years it will be readily realised that the people have been well served by the Fianna Fáil Government. Fianna Fáil's plan is to get to grips with unemployment and inflation, to restore stability to our national finances and to increase growth by priming the economy <Col N="567" /> so that the private sector can intensify its efforts and production capacity.  These are the aims of the Fianna Fáil administration. These were the aims when our Taoiseach and his Ministers were negotiating our entry into the EMS.  I believe that the policies being promoted by Fianna Fáil at this time are the policies that will best leave us with continued growth during the eighties and continue to serve the people to the best advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget could be truly described as a sleight-of-hand budget&mdash;now you see it, now you do not see it.  When the public heard about it they really thought there was something in it for them by way of tax reliefs and other reliefs.  But when they sat down and did the sums they did not add up. Consequently we have on our hands a very annoyed PAYE sector.  They were led to believe that there would be handsome benefits for them.  They themselves felt that this was due and were looking forward to some much needed reliefs. But, alas, the budget came and one must doubt whether it was a budget or not, but I suppose we will give it its title.  The budget came and went without any real relief for these people.  They were conned into believing they were getting something in reliefs and they got very little.  I will come back to that at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had several budgets.  We had increases in the cost of social welfare stamps; we had an increase in health contributions.  The killer of all these increases was introduced earlier this year&mdash;the removal of the food subsidies. That triggered off great resentment throughout the land and rightly so.  People are at the pin of their collar to live on the false promises the Fianna Fáil Party made in the 1977 election.  Fianna Fáil attacked the basic foods of the large family&mdash;bread, butter and milk.  They said they were giving relief by way of children's allowances to offset this.  But that was so much nonsense because children's allowances were due for review anyway.  To attack the basic foods of the people was a major blunder on the part of the Government.  Old age <Col N="568" /> pensioners and less well-off families, particularly large families, spend most of their money on food whereas better-off people spend only a percentage of their income on food.  That is why this was such a savage attack.  It attacked the underprivileged in a way that has never been seen before in this State.  I have no doubt that these people can look forward to more of the same next January.  Indeed it has been promised that the remaining portion of the food subsidies will be removed thus putting the staple diet out of the reach of people with large families and out of the reach of old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>Is this the social concern we hear being bleated from time to time on the far benches, their concern and all they are doing for the less well-off?  The record is there and it is quite clear.  They removed food subsidies which affected the poor and the larger families and the old.  They removed food subsidies and at the same time abolished wealth tax giving some £10 million back to a small number of people.  So much for equity there.  The facts are there for everybody to see and it would not take any wise counsellor to see in what way the Government of the day thinks with regard to people who are less fortunate than others.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the problems we have today.  In relation to the sharp increases various spokesmen on the far side will say that these were due to factors beyond their control and other factors which will be non-recurring.  That is so much waffle.  One just cannot believe what one hears from the far side any more because when they do say something and it is reported and what is reported is not palatable to them they then stand up and say that they are being quoted out of context.  They might be quoted out of context once but they are not going to be quoted out of context all the time.  Newspaper reporters are people of integrity who compare notes to ensure that as far as possible what was said will be reported but when they do say something, whether it is in Brussels or somewhere in west Cork and it does not go down well with the public they say, &ldquo;I am sorry.  I did not really say that, I said something else&rdquo;.  So it is very hard to accept what is coming from the <Col N="569" /> Government side any more.  It is becoming a little monotonous and, if I might say so, something of a joke.</P>
    <P>We have heard so much about this great budget, that was to lift the economy, that the economy was in a state of boom.  I see this morning that the boom ended last November.  Despite what we thought, it did not go over to the Christmas period at all but ended last November.  We are now in a grave period of stagnation with the cost of living rising dramatically and the Government unable to take any action to curb it but only to fuel it with their stupid decisions. As a result of this Government's mismanagement and their total ineptitude we have for the first time in the history of the State a feeling of hopelessness among the people.  Their growing discontent is a result of the lack of leadership on the part of the Government whose attitude is to respond to problems only as they arise.  That is not government.  If a government are to function properly they must plan but the present holders of office have failed badly in this regard.  The various green and white papers that they have produced have been no more than cosmetic exercises designed to hoodwink the people.</P>
    <P>We are in the throes of industrial trouble but the Ministers responsible remain silent.  They are prominent enough, though, when they attend at some function or other, be it an opening ceremony or the funeral of someone of note.  On Sunday last our industrial problems were made known to the world because of the failure to produce sound for television networks for the coverage of a major sporting event.</P>

      <P>It deals with many matters, including the question of employment, a problem that this budget is not designed to help.  Indeed, the budget is only fuelling the discontent that is in evidence all around us today and which manifested itself in no small way just more than a week ago not only in this city but in the various other towns.  It is time that the Government took note of the situation.  If they continue to ignore the problems, the people will reject this House.  That would be very unfortunate, to say the least.  Parliament should be protected.  I am sure I speak for everybody here when I say we do not wish for a situation in which the people generally rather than the Government would make the decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can this budget be regarded as being a budget as we understand the meaning of that word?  Generally when a budget is brought before the House there is discussion of it and some modification may be considered.  In this instance, too, modifications were considered and at an assembly in Ballsbridge recently the Taoiseach stated clearly that these modifications would be acceptable.  He said that he had consulted with the rural backbenchers and with other people and was convinced that it was correct to make these changes.  That was on a Saturday evening but on the following Tuesday there was total capitulation by the Government on a budgetary issue. This is a very serious matter because if a government are to give effective <Col N="571" /> leadership they must be prepared to abide by whatever decisions they make. If a government are seen to capitulate to sectional interests they are reneging on their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The various sectors in a community have the right to make a case for their members but the responsibility for decisions must rest with the Government. This Government have what is possibly the greatest majority that any government have enjoyed in this State since its foundation but when they were faced with a challenge from a sectional interest, they weakened.  The Government seem to have lost their political will and direction though I doubt whether they ever had any direction.  The result is the development of what could be a very serious situation.  Until there is another general election the Government have the responsibility to do the job they were elected to do.  Already the people are tired of them.  That is why I say to the Government that as soon as possible they should give the people the opportunity of electing a government who will not run away from their responsibilities. This Government have been responsible for alienating various sections in the community.  We can only hope the good sense of the people will prevail and that they will see the futility of a divided community.</P>
    <P>In regard to social welfare increases, percentages are used to hide the facts. What does the old age pensioner know about 12 per cent?  Percentages tend to lull the public into thinking they are getting more than they are.  There has not been a commitment by the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Social Welfare to give further increases later in the year when the cost of living rises. Such a commitment was given by the Coalition.  I am not happy with the social welfare reliefs this year.  In government, we reduced the old age pension qualifying age to 66 and it should by now have been reduced to 65.  This further reduction has not taken place and the Government have not given a commitment to this.  Had we remained in government we would have fulfilled our commitment by now and it is remiss of the Government not to have reduced the qualifying age.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> No great imagination was shown in regard to social welfare benefits.  The Government lack the caring attitude which is necessary in this area.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the budget to help intending house purchasers.  The maximum SDA loan is £9,000 and the income limit is £3,500.  This limit is derisory and people earning £3,500 are very few and far between.  There was a time when one could produce a certificate of income from an employer but now one must get a PAYE certificate of earnings, making sure that as few people as possible will obtain loans.  Unless the loan is raised to £12,000 and the income limit to £5,500, then as a mechanism for the purchase of houses this system is ridiculous.  From this negative and stupid attitude will flow a severe housing crisis, particularly in Dublin.  People are putting their names on the corporation housing list who heretofore would have purchased their own houses but are now unable to do so because of building society stipulations and because they may be earning, say, £3,600, which is not a large income.  Houses now cost £12,500 or £13,000 and the SDA loan is £9,000; there is a deficit of about £3,500 to be made up and very few people can accumulate that amount in a short time. The housing crisis is manifesting itself at present in Dublin and within two years it will have reached major proportions because of the fiscal policies of the Government who do not see that SDA loans must be raised substantially to meet the astronomical cost of houses. They have been very silent on this matter.</P>
    <P>There should be a public inquiry into housing costs which so gravely affect the lives of many people.  The Government seem content to let this crisis develop and then they will write policy documents on how to tackle it.  The time to act is when the malady is apparent.  I heard a Minister saying that the housing problem in Dublin was not acute any more.  In fact, it is worse now than it has ever been.  Because of the limitations on SDA loans and their inability to borrow elsewhere, people are going on the housing list.  The housing allocation last year in Dublin was £28.5 million and this year we are to get £30 million.  Taking <Col N="573" /> inflation in the building industry into account, this means that there will be a drastic cutback in the building of local authority houses at a time when the ineptitude of the Government is forcing more and more people onto the housing list.  It is time the Government considered this matter seriously.  The Government only seem to take action when people react instead of acting to improve the lives of the people.</P>
    <P>There is no commitment in the budget to the infrastructure.  The previous speaker said that a large amount of money had been allocated for roadworks.  In our local authority area we have not been informed that funds are being made available for improving the city of Dublin, which is choking to death.  CIE have been pressing for a rapid rail system to serve new towns such as Tallaght, Clondalkin, and from Howth to Greystones.  The provision of a rapid rail system would not upset property or land as the rail line is in existence. Instead of committing themselves, the Government have set up a committee to consider the problem.  If some action is not taken soon in regard to our transport problem the centre of Dublin will die.  Dublin has been ignored for years and has never been given grants to encourage industrialists.  There is provision in the budget for £500,000 for the development of Dublin.  That is a very small sum of money when we are talking in terms of £200 million for a rapid rail system.  The Government have not committed themselves to the development of our capital city.  The previous speaker said the capital city should be somewhere else, which is a novel idea after Dublin has been neglected for 50 years.  I hope that is not the Government's solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>The country is now at the crossroads. The Government should make decisions and see them through.  Like the willing worker, the PAYE sector has been overburdened. All the increases given to this sector should have been linked to the index. Why should the PAYE sector pay more than their fair share of tax when other sectors refuse to contribute to society?  We have been told that tax reforms are on their way and that this, <Col N="574" /> that and the other will be done to improve the tax system.  Of course this is merely a reaction instead of a carefully planned policy.  If the Government were honest they would have solved this problem before now.  When the Minister was abroad he said he would not respond to the demands of the PAYE sector. When he returned home he said he did not say that, but he is making daily pronouncements on the subject.  To find common ground with the PAYE sector and the trade unions the Minister will have to make a bold gesture, otherwise we will have industrial anarchy and chaos.</P>
    <P>Our Ministers continue to do nothing in the hope that our problems will disappear. Problems must be tackled as they arise and the only way to tackle them is by being honest.  It is time the Government took their courage in their hands and were honest with wage earners.  If they do not take action there will be more resentment.  It is the responsibility of the Government to stem the tide of resentment by introducing fair taxation. The average person would be willing to pay tax under a fair system.  Instead of making veiled promises the Minister should take action.  As Minister for Finance, he has the power to introduce a new taxation policy.  That is what he should be doing instead of making pious statements and trying to curb events which may take place on 1 May.  This is not the way to curb these events.  You curb them by being honest with the trade unions and people involved and giving them a firm commitment.  To draw up a fair tax system would not be a Herculean task.  It would be merely a question of adopting policies and implementing them.  Therefore, I ask that we be serious about our problems here and tackle and solve them.  Because of the serious conditions in our society today we should not put this on the long finger.  If we respect the democratic institutions it is time we did something about them.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the extensive industrial problems.  You do not know whether you can get a bus or a cup of water.  You do not know whether you can make a phone call, post a letter or switch <Col N="575" /> on a light.  This is a sad situation, and we have not seen the last of it.  The local authorities' staffs apparently are thinking of coming out on strike next Monday and this could mean a shut down in our sewerage and water system and a whole area of services.  What is this House doing about that?  Absolutely nothing, living in cloud-cuckoo land as if everything in the garden is rosy and all we have is a disgruntled public who want too much and that is the end of it, we will not give it to them.</P>
    <P>This Government have a head-in-the-sand attitude.  They seem to have lost their nerve and their will, or maybe their false promises are catching up with them.  The chickens are running home to roost and the Government can do nothing about it.  Time has caught up with them.  No doubt they were hoping that the EMS and funding here and there would fuel the pumps for them.  This has not happened.  Things do not work that way, as the Government have found out, and what are they doing?  Absolutely nothing.  There is no direction whatever. In this budget document there is very little that is going to fuel the economy and bring employment.  There is nothing about worker co-operation or worker co-operatives in the job incentives area or about employment.  A lot of jobs are created in the public services.  I am not against creating jobs, but it does not need any great imagination to say that we created 10,000 jobs in the public service. That takes only a stroke of the pen, but it takes about four jobs in the industrial or service end to pay for one of these jobs.  That is not solving problems; in the long term that is creating them.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about employment we must look at the areas of industrial growth.  We must look at the production element of the jobs created here to see that they have a real meaning and are creating wealth, not drawing it off.  If we are to develop we must do this.  I see no incentive to employers to encourage profit-sharing or worker participation. You will not get this by legislation.  Participation must be by consensus, by agreement.  The only way to get that is through the tax mechanism.  By giving tax concessions in the field of industry <Col N="576" /> you can create good relations and profit-sharing and you can develop a whole new structure that will eliminate many problems in the industrial field.  A lot of our industrial disputes should be dealt with before they become serious.</P>
    <P>There is no imagination in this budget document in relation to education.  On the basis of inflation there is a cut-back in education this year, not an improvement as might be the impression gained from reading this document.  Taking inflation into account, there is a cut-back in education, an area where it is important that moneys be spent.  If we are ever going to develop our potential fully it will be through our educational structure. We still have a terrible problem of overcrowding in the classrooms in our cities.  In parts of the cities where there is a decline in the population classrooms are empty.  What is done about that? Instead of leaving the teachers there to deal with the problems of a socio-economic nature in education, they remove the teachers.  Here again there is no sense of meeting the problem, and it is a grave problem.  It is one of deprivation and of socio-economic background.</P>
    <P>In one school I mentioned recently the parents of 56 per cent of the children were out of work.  A lot of pupils have a reading age five years lower than they should have.  That is a sad indictment on our educational system.  When we realise that this budget is cutting back on education we can see that the Government are not serious about taking on these problems which have major social connotations.  Low educational standards tend to bring about vandalism, discontent and a reaction against society.  People who are products of such a system feel that they are victims of society, and it can be fairly said that they are.  They are not getting any share of the wealth of our society.  About 80 per cent of them live in overcrowded local authority flats.  In school they are deprived.  They leave school illiterate and not equipped for life.</P>
    <P>What are we doing?  We are perpetuating this evil because we have not the policy or the courage to do something about it.  Why? These people really have not a voice.  They do not know where to shout or to cry out.  They <Col N="577" /> must suffer indeed.  This is why the Government is there, to ferret out these ills and to eradicate them.  If a Government are serious and have a conscience they will do that.  This Government have no social commitment, they have lost their conscience and they are not fit to govern.  This budget document leaves a lot to be desired and it is not tackling the problems at all.  I foresee that this time next year things will be a lot worse even than they are now.  No doubt there will be all sorts of excuses put forward, but basically a Government are elected to do a job and they must carry the can.  If they do not carry the can then they must bear the odium of the people.  I believe the people today are in a hostile mood because of the way they are being treated.  It is time the Government took the country seriously, themselves seriously, and either resigned or got on with the job.  They must stop the clowning and hoodwinking that has been going on since they assumed office nearly two years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended speaking on the budget.  However, I am prompted to do so in view of the Government's claim to have conferred such benefits on all sections of the community. It is difficult to reconcile this claim of all the benefits that will accrue to all sections as a result of this budget with the complete unrest and dissatisfaction shown by all sections since its introduction. It is true to say that all sections, rural and urban, have never shown such unified unrest and dissatisfaction before.  Were we to believe the Government and their story of the benefits accruing from the budget one would not have expected 250,000 people approximately to march in the PAYE protest in Dublin city, Cork and other centres in protest against the unfair actions of the Government but rather to acclaim the Government for the great work they had done.  However, we know this march was dismissed lightly by the Minister for Finance from a safe distance in Brussels although he said, like many other Ministers, that he had been misquoted in the papers.  That has become an everyday contention of present Ministers; regularly they contend <Col N="578" /> that what they have said had been wrongfully interpreted on radio, television or in the Press.  It must have been brought home to the Minister for Finance, by the response to that march in Dublin alone, that it was no irresponsible action by a section of workers. Rather was it a very serious effort by a harassed section of the community to draw the attention of the Government to the serious and unjust burden imposed on the PAYE section.  Those workers were determined to show their dissatisfaction with the system by their action and their determination to use all means at their disposal to compel the Government to take cognisance of their plight.  Indeed they were willing to do so at their own expense.</P>
      <P>Up to that point while the Government may have been aware of unrest, they were not fully aware of the gravity of the situation and to say they were surprised at the extent of the march would be the under-statement of the year; we all know that Government Ministers were shocked to observe its extent. However if the Government claimed beforehand to have been unaware of the seriousness of the problem, they can no longer dismiss it lightly; neither can they dismiss the need for an urgent improvement in the position.</P>
      <P>In this budget the Government eliminated the lowest band of tax applicable to people who found themselves in the position of having to pay although they could ill afford to do so.  They reduced also the child allowance for tax purposes and no longer permit social welfare contributions to be deducted for tax purposes.  This is in vivid contrast to the actions of the Coalition Government. Furthermore the Government have diminished other forms of taxation conferring monetary gains on the well-to-do section of the community, those least in need of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the abolition of food subsidies the social welfare benefits conferred in the budget had long been eroded before they ever came into being.  One must remember also that there are no increases in social welfare benefits being granted in October, something which had become a regular feature in recent <Col N="579" /> years under the Coalition Government, which means again that social welfare recipients find themselves now in a worse plight than before the budget.</P>
    <P>There is another problem seriously affecting the Dublin area to which Deputy O'Brien has already drawn attention but which cannot be too often emphasised. That is, the plight of house buyers in Dublin city.  One would have expected that the Government would have seen fit in this budget to grant some relief to people who would endeavour to avail of SDA loans but rather they have completely ignored this section.  It is easy to understand the very serious plight of people in this bracket when one considers that the maximum loan that can be obtained from a local authority is £9,000.  The maximum loan under the SDA loan scheme is £9,000 and in order to qualify for that the income ceiling is £3,500.  We have all read advertisements in the national newspapers offering new houses at prices between £14,000 and £20,000.  Therefore, a person on an income of £3,500 or less considering purchasing a house at £14,000 can expect a loan of £9,000 but must find a deposit of at least £5,000.  In addition, that person must be prepared to meet many other expenses.  How can a person earning £3,500, or less, hope to raise £5,000 as a deposit for such a house?</P>
    <P>With a view to getting together a deposit for a house many people work overtime but they are taxed on that and the amount earned is added to their income thereby debarring them from qualifying for an SDA loan.  If the Government are serious about assisting people to buy their own homes they should devise a system that would help those who are saving for a deposit. Overtime earned by such people for two years prior to the time they submit an application for an SDA loan should not be added to their income so that they can qualify for the loan.</P>
    <P>We have been told on many occassions that there is no immediate solution to the problem of those paying tax under the PAYE system but that is in sharp contrast to what happened when the Government announced their intention <Col N="580" /> of introducing a 2 per cent levy on farmers.  I agree that they levy was unjust and it was condemned as such by both sides of the House.  In their folly the Government sought to introduce the levy but, after serious repercussions from the farming community and disagreement with Ministers and Government backbenchers, it was decided to meet representatives of the farming community to devise another form of taxation. That is in sharp contrast to what the Minister for Finance said about the PAYE system, that there was no short-term solution.  The Government have denied that the farming community are being allowed dictate their own form of taxation but the community at large will decide that issue.</P>
    <P>It is normal practice prior to a budget for the different sections of the community to meet the Minister for Finance and put their case for tax reliefs but I do not think it ever happened that immediately after a budget and before the introduction of a Finance Bill a Government agreed to meet a section of the community to devise an alternative method of taxation to that announced in the budget.  The Government have recognised the unfairness of the 2 per cent levy and the PAYE system but they are only willing to remedy the problem facing one section of the community. Those involved in the PAYE system justly feel they are being victimised.  It is questionable whether it is profitable for the Government to expect employers to act as tax gatherers under what has been acknowledged to be an unfair tax system.</P>
    <P>I should like to warn the Government about the seriousness of the situation because those concerned with the PAYE system are more discontented than the Government realise.  To date they have acted in a calm and disciplined manner but if the Government continue to disregard their complaints and fail to give them some relief we will be faced with a serious situation.  Discontent has been simmering for years because wage earners saw so much of their earnings going in tax.  How can the Government who, on assuming office saw fit to abolish the wealth tax and seriously reduce capital gains tax&mdash;a move which <Col N="581" /> benefited the well-off section of the Community&mdash;and who acceded to the request of the farming community in relation to the 2 per cent levy, expect those concerned with the PAYE system to silently accept what has been held to be an unjust method of taxation?</P>
    <P>Is it the case that the Government, accepting the unfairness of the PAYE system, can do nothing about it because they must pay for the lavish promises they made prior to the election?  Is it a fact that because of the lavish promises they made in order to get into power the Government are caught in an awkward situation but are determined, by fair or foul means, to get the money to fulfil those promises?  They are determined to compel the PAYE workers to contribute an unfair share.  Every day there is some strike or some threatened strike.  We do not know what section will come out on strike next.  This is because of the financial position workers find themselves in as a result of the PAYE system.  Many Deputies, now Ministers, were very vocal in Opposition when a strike took place, even if it was only for a few days, or even before the strike took place. They did not hesitate to let their voices be heard in the House at that time but they are now very silent about strikes which have dragged on for weeks and even months.  They do not seem to consider what they may lead to and how the lack of communications by telephone or letter can affect industry.</P>

      <P>Surely strikes and the unnecessary burden of taxation on the working-class is a matter that can be usefully discussed in a budget debate?  I have not said any particular strike.  If there is a falling off in communications <Col N="582" /> and if orders cannot be sent to firms they can be lost.  If they are once lost this may result in a permanent loss and have a serious effect on our economy.  The Government at the Ard-Fheis modified the 2 per cent tax for farmers.  Once they did this they cannot blame workers in industry all over the country if they bring pressure to bear on them to do something about the PAYE tax.  They feel that this is the only way open to them to draw attention to their plight and gain something for them.</P>
      <P>It is well known that the farmer Deputies on the Government side have forced the Government to have second thoughts on the taxation policy in relation to the farming community.  I now ask city Deputies, particularly Dublin city Deputies, to let their voices be heard.  I know they are very conscious of the problem of workers in this city.  It is well known that approximately six of the Deputies in Dublin city constituencies hold their seats by 100 votes or less and they know the unrest among the PAYE section.  Unless they let their voices be heard and see that some relief is given to those workers they could find themselves in a very serious position at the next election.  I impress on the Minister the necessity to grant some immediate relief to PAYE workers.  If it was possible to give relief in regard to a system objected to by one section of the community surely it is possible to do it in regard to others?  I appeal to the Minister to think again before it is too late.</P>

      <P>It must be unprecedented that the Minister for Finance will close this debate at a time when this year's budget is actually being negotiated.  Nobody knows at the moment what is in it.  It sounds to me like a comic opera that a budget debate is being closed at a time when the budget is being debated.  We must be the laughingstock of Europe.  We are now discussing one of the many budgets since the first day of this year.  First we had a minibudget when the Government partially abolished food subsidies and got £22 million for the Exchequer.  The price of milk, cheese, butter and flour was increased and put a great burden on the <Col N="583" /> under-privileged section of the community. We then had the annual budget which increased the price of beer, stout and cigarettes.  We then had a further budget increasing the price of petrol and coal.  All those budgets have hit the most vulnerable section of the community. The social welfare recipients are the worst victims.</P>
      <P>How can Government Deputies face the public on a price record after their remarks hurled across the House while they were in Opposition?  They now have to tell the people that they were not sincere or that the opportunities they believed were there were not there and that the Coalition Government were not as bad as they said they were.  The Coalition Government were in power when we were going through a world wide recession.  We now have a favourable climate.  The Taoiseach said on the Adjournment Debate on 28 June 1978:</P>
      <P>1977 was a good year for the Irish economy.  Our growth rate of over 5 per cent put us at the top of the EEC league.  Industrial production showed a substantial rise, agricultural output increased, employment grew, exports remained buoyant and inflation dropped sharply.</P>
      <P>That was only a year after the change of Government.  Surely the Fianna Fáil Party cannot under any circumstances claim credit for what happened in that period?</P>
      <P>The country is in a sorry mess.  People who have love for their country cannot derive any joy from the present position of the economy.  There was never more frustration or unrest.  In their election manifesto Fianna Fáil stated:</P>
      <P>Government policy must be directed towards discouraging increased costs and prices in all areas where it has control or influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Had the Government control or influence over the partial abolition of the food subsidies?  Did they not directly increase taxation although their manifesto stated that it was their intention to keep down costs over which they had control <Col N="584" /> or influence?  The manifesto also stated that they would investigate middle-men's margins.  Who was the middle-man in this case?  It was the Exchequer, the Minister.</P>
    <P>Was the abolition of food subsidies within the control and influence of the Government?  Of course it was and the manifesto stated that it was their intention to keep down prices.  When we were in government and prices were increased because of factors outside our control, Fianna Fáil jibed at us and called the then Minister for Industry and Commerce the &ldquo;price king&rdquo;.  As a Limerick man I suggest that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy O'Malley, should be given that title.  The former Minister, now Senator Keating, cannot compete with him in that area. The present Minister's record on prices has outmatched anything at a time when the political climate could be described as normal.</P>
    <P>Why were the food subsidies abolished prior to the budget?  Did the Government hope that the people would be naive, that they would forget about the subsidies and that they would consider the budget not too bad when it was introduced?  Things could not have been worse because prior to the budget £22 million had been taken from the pockets of the people.</P>
    <P>In their manifesto Fianna Fáil stated that they intended to:</P>
    <P>maintain the living standards of social welfare recipients by regular adjustments of the level of payments at least in line with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Where is the adjustment?  Where is the review?  The benefits of the previous budget had been eroded and in October 1978 social welfare recipients were on the breadline.  The percentage increases granted to these people has not compensated them for the increased cost of living. We are told that there is plenty of money available and that social welfare recipients are being looked after.  They are the most neglected section and it is a sad day for the country that this vulnerable section have had to face such hardships.</P>
    <P>The country is in a period of unrest. All sections are seeking more.  This is <Col N="585" /> necessary if they are to maintain a decent standard of living.  There is another reason for the discontent.  Eighteen months ago the manifesto gave the impression that everything was available for people who supported Fianna Fáil. The people were told then that the crisis at the time was of our own making, that it was not due to a world recession.  They were told that all that was needed was a change of government.  Now people are on the streets.  They are there because of their great disappointment and I do not blame them.  I was never anxious to support strikes and it is sad that the parades had to take place.  As many speakers have said, workers are desperate because of the cost of living.  It is not that easy to get people to leave their jobs and to parade on the streets but yet 150,000 responsible people, many of whom never took part in a strike or protest, walked in the streets.  They did this because of their disappointment and disillusionment with the Government who promised them that everything would be easy.  What other way could the people have made their protest when the Government handed back a lot of money to the millionaires.  We were told that wealth tax was not needed, that it was a disincentive.  Surely that money could have been used to cushion the working class against the cost of living, the people who are blistered by taxation.</P>
    <P>When we were in office any bank robbery or incident in the street was met by hand clapping by the then Opposition. Continually they told us what we should do.  What has happened in the past 18 months?  It is a sad situation when a bank robbery is no longer a news item or regarded as important.  Such robberies are occurring twice or three times daily and it is impossible to keep up with them.  We are told that violence is occurring throughout the world, that it is a passing phase.  If the former Minister for Justice, now Senator Cooney, had said that, what would the other side of the House have said?  The position has grown much worse.  At the moment nobody can tell me who is the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy a fair amount of <Col N="586" /> latitude.  The Department of Justice, violence and bank robberies have nothing to do with the budget nor has the Garda Commissioner.  The Deputy, therefore, will not continue along those lines.</P>

      <P>At least that was not a false promise; it was kept.  When the Coalition introduced farm taxation we got a very rough time at farm meetings throughout the country.  Coming up to election time Fianna Fáil candidates went around the country whispering to farmers that farm taxation would be abolished if they were returned to power. They told groups of farmers that farm taxation was introduced because we were closely associated with a socialist party and had no choice.  This Government have 84 seats, a majority of 20. Not alone did they retain farm taxation <Col N="587" /> but they trebled it and then introduced the farm levy.  They could not blame us for that, so whom did they blame?&mdash;the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  They promised the farming organisations that he would have to go.  The Cabinet should make the decisions. The people in the country are being told that this man is responsible for their present position.</P>
      <P>Anybody who is a member of a local authority must feel that he is in a straitjacket. Never in our history were our roads in such a bad way.  In two weeks time an all-party deputation from my county council will come to meet the Minister to get extra money to do something about the potholes throughout County Limerick.  The position was never worse.  Never have our ratepayers refused to give an adequate rate to meet the services that are required. Now they do not even have that choice.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for the Environment was speaking on the abolition of domestic rates, it was pointed out that the ceiling of 11 per cent at that time was brought about to protect the people who did not benefit from the abolition of domestic rates.  What has happened? The farmers are subsidising the domestic rates.  Limerick rates receipts today are proof that the partial abolition of the agricultural grant has come into line with what the Government are giving to cover the abolition of domestic rates. This means that the agricultural community are subsidising the domestic rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £9,000 house loan is completely inadequate because the price of houses has gone out of control and nobody has done anything about it.  When the Coalition were in power the loan was £4,500 and the price of a house was £7,000.  The potential purchaser had to borrow £2,500.  Every day Fianna Fáil Deputies asked what we were doing about it.  Today the maximum loan is £9,000 plus £1,000 grant, a total of £10,000.  Houses now cost £19,000 or £20,000, a difference of 100 per cent.  Where do the would-be purchasers get this money? Never were the section of the community <Col N="588" /> who are anxious to build their own houses so badly hit.</P>
    <P>We hear about pay restraint.  We are told to be good, not to strike, not to give any trouble and to do as we are told. Fianna Fáil have made a commitment and are not able to honour it.  We are asked not to embarrass them because things may improve.  But things are not improving.  I am not so naive as to think that the Minister has unlimited resources, because that was never possible for any Government and nobody expected it.  I believe there is an obligation on this Government to tell the people that 18 months ago they told lies and that they cannot honour their promises. They should ask the people to forgive them and to give them a chance to make a new start.  That is the only course open to them.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to my pet subject, that is, decentralisation.  We all know what is happening in the Land Commission and the Land Registry. People, particularly those building houses, are dependent on bridging loans. A man on a bridging loan of £6,000 pays £80 a month while he is waiting for a simple transfer from the Land Registry office.  Each county should deal with its own Land Registry work.  I fail to see why there should be a delay of one year, 18 months or two years.  The same applies to the man who is passing his farm to his son or daughter.  These people can wait years before the registration is in order.  I appeal to all Ministers and to all parties to make this an important issue and to view it seriously.  The same applies to the Land Commission.  If a person applies for a subdivision to the Land Commission office in his county, that has to go to Dublin and is returned after four or five months to the people in the county office.  Why is it not possible to have a district inspector who would sign the transfer?  The system will be changed some time but why have so many people to suffer while they are waiting for this change?</P>
    <P>The Government must be candid with the people.  We are in a mess.  The people should know what is happening and then there might be restraint.  While we keep telling them we were right to give millions of pounds to millionaires it is not <Col N="589" /> possible to tell them that we now have no money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are here to discuss the 1979 budget but this is rather difficult to do as we seem to have had a series of financial statements.  We had a statement by Deputy Colley, Minister for Finance, early in February.  Previous to that there was an announcement about the withdrawal of a certain proportion of food subsidies.  There has been the announcement by Deputy Haughey, Minister for Social Welfare, about the withdrawal of farmers' dole to a great number of people in the west and a reduction in dole for a number of others. More recently there have been savage increases in rents of local authority houses which, in most cases, have exceeded the rates which were payable on the same houses a year or two ago.  They completely negatived that concession which was given to local authority tenants.  In many cases people living on social welfare cannot meet these huge increases and I have asked the health boards to pay supplementary welfare allowances to such families to enable them to overcome the increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In speaking of the insignificance of the budget, what has shocked us most of all is the fact that a decision which was announced in this House was withdrawn outside of the House.  I refer to the 2 per cent levy which was placed on some farming commodities.  This is an example of a great erosion of the authority of Dáil Éireann.  Every elected representative must be annoyed and perturbed by this action.  This is where decisions are made and when we find that this decision was reversed on two occasions, at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis and at a meeting with the farming organisations, we, as public representatives, have good cause to be alarmed.  I hope this type of abdication of Government will stop.  It is bound up with the unpleasant, and what should be unnecessary, action by the public in talking to the streets to express their displeasure with the way things are done.  People should not have to resort to these methods.  It is not in the interests of democracy to have mob rule.  I hope that things will not take a turn for the worst <Col N="590" /> in this regard.  Let the decisions be made here by the elected representatives. Democracy is an institution which must be jealously guarded.  At the moment it is being eroded.</P>
    <P>There is probably a strong case for drastic reform of parliamentary procedure.  Events seem to have outgrown the system we have been using for the last 56 or 57 years.  If it needs to be reformed the sooner it is done the better. Events of recent weeks and months have shown that it is bad for any Government to have a large majority.  The Government would surely have acted in a more definite manner if their majority was small.  Whether it is a feeling that they cannot be removed from office and are completely secure that has led to this weakness it is hard to say, but it seems to have been a contributing factor.  I cannot find the exact explanation.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Taoiseach say on occasion when one of his Ministers was taken to task for failure in his Department that it was not the Minister's fault, that his Cabinet was ruling by collective responsibility.  In my experience of club committees and so on the expression &ldquo;collective responsibility&rdquo; is an excuse for doing nothing or for avoiding a difficult situation.  The Taoiseach is the man in charge and his Ministers have responsibility for their various Departments. That is where the buck stops. Collective responsibility should be forgotten about and they should be able to decide for themselves whether decisions are good or bad.  Whether it is collective responsibility or mob movement in the streets, it all adds up to an erosion of our powers and an undermining of democracy in general.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the situation which exists with regard to the distribution of State and EEC funds.  I am not against an equitable distribution of the finances of this country or of those which we derive from the EEC Regional Fund or other sources.  However, in recent years there has been an inequitable distribution of these moneys.  From all appearances this unequal distribution will continue.  The west was, for many years, the disadvantaged part of the country but when the EEC were drawing up their list of priorities the whole of <Col N="591" /> Ireland was designated a disadvantaged area.</P>
    <P>I represent a constituency in the south, just as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle represents a constituency in the south-east.  I see a great imbalance in the amounts of money being provided for infrastructural improvements and other such matters in that region compared with the west.  A time has come when we must cry halt in this respect.  I say the south-east is not getting its fair share of the funds being distributed.  My region is suffering considerably from bad roads and bridges.  For instance, if the bridge at Waterford, which is on the point of collapse, were to fall down, industry in the entire south-eastern region would be brought to a standstill because the movement of goods there would come to an end.  I appeal to the Minister of State now in the House to prevent such a possible catastrophe by providing the necessary funds.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago I asked a number of questions in reference to our foreign policy and what our stance will be at the reconvened Law of the Sea Conference in Geneva.  The replies I received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs were not satisfactory because they did not allay my worst fear, that we are not fighting our corner at the most important conference, possibly, held in recent years, or ever.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate it does not arise on the budget.  I have been very lenient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has grave consequences for us because our Achilles heel in our international dealings is our lack of vital raw materials which may exist in abundance in the seabed around our coast. This has been brought home to us vividly by the imminent shortage of oil, the prospect of oil rationing.  Our case for a substantial portion of the seabed off our coasts should be pushed with the conviction required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question the other day regarding the ownership of Rockall, the Minister stated that he had been in consultation with an official in the British Home Office&mdash;apparently <Col N="592" /> the question I had put down forced him to seek an interview with the official concerned. That is not good enough.  We should be taking the initiative in these matters.  We are in what I might call a <i>cul-de-sac</i> in regard to oil and gas supplies because we cannot demand or obviously expect as much oil or gas as we need.  We are like beggars going to the Middle East.  The sooner we become selfsufficient in this respect, the better.  But are we doing everything possible to see that we will be enabled to exploit the seabed off our coasts to the fullest extent possible?  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has said that a third party is being brought in to help in the negotiations between ourselves and Britain on Rockall.  We should be demanding a major portion of the seabed off the Continental Shelf and if we do not get it it will be a shocking indictment of our negotiators.</P>
    <P>The US to my knowledge have been making a claim to the area lying between Ireland, the US, Canada, Greenland and Iceland and we seem to be content to settle for a relatively small area.  In the interest of future mineral and oil exploration we need as large an area as it is possible for us to get.  Landlocked countries have been coming in laying claim to the mid-Atlantic area to which we and the US would be entitled under previous agreements.</P>
    <P>Still on the question of our oil supplies, we seem to be having negotiations with every other country in the world, like Poland and the Soviet Union, with whom we have large imbalances of trade in their favour, when according to the Minister we have little or no diplomatic relations with Iraq.  It would seem obvious that when our oil supplies are threatened we should be making overtures to every oil-producing country in the world.  It is not very intelligent not to have diplomatic relations with Iraq which supplies most of our oil.  We should make as many overtures as possible. The West Germans, the French and the British are doing so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to have a great lack of business acumen here.  We bring in foreign industries and neglect home-based industries.  In the last six months or year there has been a closure of a number of industries based on native raw materials and the Government seem to have done little or nothing to protect them.  We must be the good guys in the EEC.  When industries in other countries are threatened because of EEC regulations they break the rules to suit themselves.  The French did this <i>ad nauseum</i> in relation to the importation of cheap wine from Italy and in relation to the exportation of lambs from here to France; they just closed the market and made no excuses.  When British industries were threatened in the last couple of years they introduced an employment subsidy scheme whereby the industry is subsidised by the Government paying £20 per week to the employees. We are too slow to act to protect our industries. If the EEC barks or threatens us with prosecution we immediately run for cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be tougher in our stand. Recently in <i>The Irish Times</i> a list of the infringements by member states of the EEC showed that of the nine members Ireland was the country which least offended with regard to infringing EEC regulations.  We could be regarded as the best Europeans in the EEC but that is not much good to the workers who find themselves out of a job in an industry which should be secured by subsidies to a larger extent than generally permitted by the Government in the event of difficulties arising.  For example, the tanning industry is under severe difficulty at present.  Hundreds of jobs have been <Col N="594" /> lost; one factory has been closed and the work force has been depleted in the two other factories.  We produce more of the raw materials for this industry, cattle hides and sheep skins, than can be used in the existing tanning industry.  We are in an exporting position in relation to the raw materials and still the tanning industry has run into severe financial difficulties. While this situation may arise it should not be allowed to develop into a critical situation where jobs are lost and factories close down.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper published just before the budget we were told that there was tremendous scope for expansion in the wood processing sector.  We were told that about 900 extra jobs could be provided almost immediately in that sector. When the White Paper was produced in January there were 700 jobs in four projects in that industry.  In the last two months two of them have closed down.  At the moment we are planting something like 20,000 acres of forestry a year.  About 700,000 acres of the countryside are under trees at the moment. What for?  We have not the facilities to use this timber.  There is vast over-production in the State forests. Timber is literally rotting in the ground because we have been unable to provide the facilities to process it.  What a reflection on our business acumen.  We cannot use the materials we are producing.  With our business acumen we seem to be incapable of harnessing these materials. We wish to see this situation redressed. Thousands of jobs could be found in industries such as timber processing, the chipboard industry and the leather industry. Instead of these closing down there should be expansion.  The timber is rotting and the hides are being exported while hundreds of people are being thrown out of jobs.  What other EEC country would tolerate that?  If we have to break the rules of the EEC we should do so without making excuses to anybody.  We are too honest.  I would have expected this Government would have been strong enough with their 20 seat majority to see that this situation did not arise.</P>
    <P>Last week it was announced in the papers that another native industry is in dire trouble.  I am referring to the virtual <Col N="595" /> closure of the three State boatyards at Killybegs, Dingle and Baltimore.  This country, surrounded by water, should have a vast fishing fleet, the existing boatyards should be bulging at the seams with orders and there should be full employment.  We got considerable protection as a result of the Maritime Jurisdiction Act introduced by the previous Government in 1977 which prohibited third countries from fishing within 200 miles of our shores.  In recent times we got conservation measures which prohibited EEC fleets from fishing as well.  One would have expected that with all that we had tremendous potential for expansion.  One would have expected that the processing sector would be employing tens of thousands of people because of the improved circumstances. What has happened?  In the only three State boatyards the work force is being reduced by two-thirds and only a skeleton staff is being kept on.  We seem to be incapable of sustaining an industry which should not be just ticking over but should be expanding.  It is a sad reflection on us that we cannot keep these industries going.</P>

      <P>The amount of the national debt is compiled at the end of each financial period. Final figures for end-1978 are not yet available.  It is provisionally estimated that the level of the national debt as at 31 December 1978 will be of the order of £5,170 million.  The national debt figure was £3,612 million as at 31 December 1976 and £4,219 million as at 31 December 1977.</P>

      <P>I would agree that it limits considerably any Government's room to manoeuvre if an undue proportion of current revenue is taken up in payment of interest on national debt. For that reason the Government are reducing the borrowing requirement as a proportion of GNP.  The Deputy is well aware that a great deal of the debt was incurred while he and his colleagues were in Government, but he will be pleased to know that, for the first time since 1975, this year the proportion of revenue going on payments of interest is the same as last year.  For each of the other years there was a substantial increase.</P>

Of course, a whole lot of people who are taxpayers are not income tax payers.  His question relates to taxpayers.

      <P>I am satisfied that the present exchange controls are, in general, meeting the objectives for which they were introduced.

In so far as the relaxation sought would defeat the purpose of exchange control I cannot accept them or say that they are justified.

      <P>The possibility of an appreciation or depreciation of sterling against other currencies was taken into account in settling the fluctuation limits to apply to the Irish pound in the EMS.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it is the Government's intention to maintain the one-for-one parity relationship between the Irish pound and the pound sterling for as long as this is feasible in the light of our EMS obligations.  The possible short-term economic implications, in the event of a divergence between the rates for the two currencies, have been fully examined.  These effects would depend on the direction and size of the exchange rate movements, as well as on various other factors including the speed with which domestic costs adjusted to the exchange rate changes.</P>

      <P>Yes, but not just by the Minister's Department.  I did not ask about those solely under the aegis directly of the Minister.

It does not relate to the statutory duties and obligations of various semi-State bodies.  If Deputy Bruton chooses for his own purposes&mdash;maybe because it is more convenient for him&mdash;to put down a question to me instead of to the appropriate Minister, that is his fault and he need not try to blame me for it.

      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary is yes, I said that the road is open for the limited purposes I mentioned.  The agreement relates to commercial traffic limited to holders of special passes, issued jointly, as I have indicated.  The arrangement does not impinge in any way on the existing concession pass procedure for private cars.  In the beginning the special passes are being limited to bulk goods which can be readily identified and checked.  Extension to other goods is not ruled out in the light of the experience of the operation of the concession. Perhaps I might add also, for anybody who would be interested, that applications for passes should be made <Col N="608" /> to the Surveyor, Customs and Excise, Monaghan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in reply to a similar question on 18 April last, the present volume of sales would not justify the establishment of a second Government Publications Sales Office.  I can now inform the Deputy that the Office of Public Works are at present making arrangements for the transfer of the Government Publications <Col N="612" /> Sales Office to new premises in Upper O'Connell Street, and that the Stationary Office itself is being moved to new premises from the Beggar's Bush location.</P>

      <P>I am glad to know that. Would the Minister agree that the difference in convenience between O'Connell Street and the GPO Arcade for people who have to think about parking is not very substantial?  Secondly&mdash;I am aware it is not part of the question; I discovered it only after putting the question down&mdash;would he agree that the service in any case is less perfect than it could be in view of the fact that the Government Publications Sales Office is not open on a Saturday morning which is the only time in the week when many people are able to fag down to the GPO Arcade.</P>

There are other considerable problems for the staff in operating the Government Publications Sales Office.</P>
      <P>As to the question of parking, this is a difficult problem if the location of the office is to be anywhere central.  It is a problem that would attach wherever it is located.  We could solve the parking problem by locating it in a thoroughly inaccessible place but I do not think that would satisfy the Deputy or the public.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> asked the Minister for Finance if he will arrange with the Revenue Commissioners to deliver to personal callers during the postal strike all documents lodged for stamping assessment, etc. when they are ready for delivery.</P>

      <P>Stamp duty matters have been dealt with by long-established practice either by personal attendance at the stamps branch or by use of the postal services.  The practice of calling to the stamps branch and dealing there with stamp duty matters has not been interfered with in any way by the current dispute affecting the postal services.  The alternative procedures which relied on the postal services for the despatch of documents are regrettably not available while the postal strike continues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The position is that documents which were posted to the Revenue Commissioners, were received by them before the commencement of the postal strike and were ready for delivery to the applicants shortly after that, are being held by the Revenue Commissioners.  Is the Minister aware that they will not be delivered to personal callers?  Should the long-standing arrangement not be departed from in the present emergency and documents handed out to their owners who call for them?  Will the Minister ask the Revenue Commissioners to be more flexible and cooperative with such applicants?</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It is unlikely that somebody who is not entitled to collect <Col N="614" /> such documents will call to the Revenue Commissioners for them.

    <P>(2)  Separate figures for VAT on motor vehicles are not available for years prior to 1975; for those years motor vehicles were included under the same rate of VAT as other goods and traders were not required to distinguish them in their returns.  The VAT figures for the years 1975 <i>et seq.</i> are estimated having regard to such matters as the extent to which vehicles qualify for relief in respect of use for business purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why the Minister of State at the Department of Finance has not met a deputation from Laytown-Bettystown, County Meath, Development Association which was asked for in November 1978; and on four other occasions since, to discuss coast erosion in the Laytown-Bettystown area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy on 13 December 1978, because of other <Col N="619" /> prior commitments it is not possible to say when the statutory preliminary engineering examination of the Laytown-Bettystown case can be carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works but that authorisation by the commissioners is not necessary in the case of a local authority itself undertaking protection works.</P>
      <P>As I explained to the Deputy in a subsequent letter, there is little further I could tell a deputation from the locality and I would still be loath to put members of a deputation to the expense of coming to Dublin when in my opinion a meeting at this stage would serve no useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On at least three occasions the Minister assured me that his private secretary would discuss the question of the arrangements for the deputation to be met, but in spite of that neither the Minister's private secretary nor himself had the courtesy to tell me the date on which the deputation might be met.  Is he aware that this deputation, consisting of representatives of not alone the Laytown Development Association but of the local golf club, two community councils, the two residents associations and the local pitch and putt club, are prepared to pay their own expenses to Dublin for the purpose of pointing out to the Minister how necessary this work is?  Will he now have the courtesy to agree to meet the deputation at a date suitable to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not misinterpret all the discussions on this matter.  I have a letter sent to the Deputy on 24 January 1979 explaining the position at the time.  I have to be practical in this matter.  It is not practical to bring a deputation to Dublin at their own expense when I have already given the information to the Deputy.  In the last paragraph of my letter to the Deputy I more or less suggested that the Deputy would come back to me again to discuss the matter and told him that, if he wished me to receive a deputation, I would be only too delighted to oblige.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister deny <Col N="620" /> that not alone did I reply to that letter saying I wanted the deputation met but on three occasions in this House he told me that arrangements were being made to meet the deputation?  Does he suggest that it is more economical to bring a deputation about coast erosion from Kerry, which he met last week, than to bring one from Laytown-Bettystown?  Is he only worrying about the people in County Meath?  I can assure him that they are well able to pay their expenses and they will be here if the Minister will agree to meet them.</P>

      <P>The large number of vacancies to be filled arises mainly from the creation last year of a considerable number of extra posts not only at recruitment level but also at the senior levels which are normally filled by promotion.  Recruitment thus became an ongoing process depending on such factors as the output of graduates from colleges at particular times of the year and variations in the general demand for architectural staff.</P>
      <P>The number of architects in the Office of Public Works engaged on the building programme is 62 of which 26 are in the recruitment grade.</P>
      <P>It is not expected that the process of filling vacancies will seriously affect the building programme as a degree of flexibility is maintained in the allocation of work between the office staff and private architects working on a commission basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something of a surprise to look back at the budget.  So many events have occurred since then that it appears to belong to another political era.  A former British Prime Minister said that a week was a long time in politics.  We have seen that a little <Col N="646" /> over six weeks is a very long time in polities, maybe not in terms of time but in terms of the changes which have occurred in public opinion towards this Government.</P>
      <P>This Government were riding high in public esteem.  There has been an improvement in the economy, as there had been in the world economy, and we benefited from that world improvement. From all sides we hear of protests and public demonstrations.  A lot has happened since this budget was introduced. It was produced by its authors as a budget which, above all, attempted to meet the claims of the PAYE sector.  In my contribution on the night of the budget, I said I would base my judgement of the budget on what it did to improve industrial relations, which even then were in need of improvement and help.  I said that the way the budget could assist the difficult industrial relations situation was to afford some genuine relief to the hard-pressed PAYE sector.  I thought many of the reasons for industrial disputes were the result of the growing tax burden on that sector and felt that many of their grievances resulted in industrial disputes and stoppages of one kind or another.</P>
      <P>If wage and salary earners are overtaxed they will seek to remedy the situation by lodging very large claims, and they will be forced to try to remedy the imbalance in their taxation position by seeking a remedy on the wages front with their employers.  We have seen a major proportion of discontent in the public sector in the past few months. That is the sector in which the Government have most immediate responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot has happened since the budget was introduced a few short weeks ago. On Budget Day, I described it as a masterly presentation in PRO terms: we all make mistakes.  Even quickly totting up the figures, it did not appear to offer a very genuine bargain to the PAYE sector. The allowances, taken in conjunction with the clawback on children's allowances and dividing it into the various family sizes, did not appear to give the average PAYE wage and salary earner a very significant bargain.  I noted too that the trade unionists who had made pre-budget <Col N="647" /> submissions to the Minister for Finance had put a figure of £100 million on the size of the contribution they thought he should make to the PAYE taxpayers.  As was apparent even that night, he had made a contribution of £27.7 million and would be taking far more revenue from that sector this year while giving back very derisory amounts by way of increased allowances.</P>
    <P>This Government are approaching the half-way mark in their parliamentary life with our current economy returning to double digit inflation.  It is accepted by all authorities that that will be the outfall for the end of the year.  Rising inflation throughout 1979, will be in excess of 11 or 12 per cent, although we must even now revise those figures in the light of the decisions reached by the OPEC Ministers yesterday.  What the increase in the price of crude oil will add to domestic inflation must be taken into account. We cannot blame the Government for that, although I recall a Government which were blamed for increases in oil prices.  In 1973, after the close of the Yom Kippur War, because of circumstances the Coalition were forced to absorb a four-fold increase in the price of crude oil.  From listening to the then Opposition spokesmen one would think that the Arabian Gulf was represented by the National Coalition, so great was our blame for that situation.</P>
    <P>Now this Government are the recipients of further bad news from the same part of the world.  This will undoubtedly have an adverse effect on our rate of inflation this year.  In my view we should anticipate an inflation rate in excess of 12 per cent as a result of yesterday's decision.  The secretary-general of that organisation when asked what he believed would be the final price level reached as a result of yesterday's decision&mdash;it is noted that there was a two-tier arrangement in that decision &mdash;spoke about the market finding its own maximum price, very ominous words in terms of the prices we will be paying.  I will return to that aspect later.</P>
    <P>It is fair criticism to say that those who devised this budget were unheedful <Col N="648" /> of the consequences on inflation of the decisions taken in the budget.  It will be recalled that prior to the budget they had added their own twist to the inflationary spiral by abolishing the first phase of food subsidies.  In the budget they added to that spiral of inflation; they did not do sufficient to lighten the burden of the PAYE sector and they sharpened the already bad industrial relations situation. As a result the Government, allowing for external causes the blame for which cannot be laid at their door, are the major authors of the rise in the consumer price index and in domestic inflation during the first quarter of 1979.  In that sense they could be described as being unheedful of the impact of their budget on the home inflation situation.</P>
    <P>The main constituents of the escalation in price levels in the first few months of 1979 have been food, mortgage rates, fuel and the increasing rate of indirect taxation arising out of the budget.  People are becoming psychologically attuned once more, if not reconciled, to the prospect of rising prices throughout 1979.  A future which is dominated by rising prices carries an inevitable consequence for the level of wage expectations over the same period.  If the evidence is increasingly pointing to an annual inflation rate in excess of 12 per cent then the prospect of obtaining a pattern of moderate wage increases in 1979 recedes.</P>
    <P>Government Ministers have made it clear that they based their hopes for the success of the targets they are working towards in employment and so on on the budgetary measures and on attaining moderate wage increases.  The inflationary outlook will make that difficult to attain.  Government actions have not been directed towards bringing about a climate in which one might confidently predict support for moderate wage settlements from trade unions during 1979.  Wage earners have been offered very little inducement to settle for moderate pay claims.</P>
    <P>The budget evaded the task of income redistribution.  One would have thought that would have been a vital element to tackle in the budget as this problem needed to be tackled if a sane agreement was to rule in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> However, it was not tackled in the budget and any speeches made on this side of the House on that theme were treated with scorn as though it was economic madness to suggest that that problem needed to be confronted.  It is not possible to get a basis of agreement for moderate wage settlements if those to whom the lectures on moderation are addressed are not convinced that income redistribution and fairness in the taxation system are the goals of Government.</P>
    <P>Wage and salary employees have been the wealthiest people escape virtually all forms of capital taxation.  No serious attempt has been made to make our tax code more fair or just.  We are ruled by an administration which fails to see the connection between redistribution and incomes moderation.  From the first day of the life of this administration, wage and salary employees have heard extolled the good tidings of the manifesto.  I would describe the good tidings of the manifesto as a philosophy of the pig trough which, since it avoids the question of fair distribution, cannot provide a basis in which necessary consent for agreement on moderation in incomes can be anticipated.</P>
    <P>The inroads made by rising prices on the living standards of the low income groups are not fully reflected in the consumer price index.  Such families&mdash;all the research that has been done on this subject bears this out&mdash;spend a higher proportion of their income on food items such as milk, butter, cheese and bread and on heating and public transport.  As a result, the taxation and welfare concessions of the budget do not go anywhere near recompensing them.  The removal of the first part of the subsidies for the four child single earner family has added an average of £2 a week to their food bill.  They have not been recompensed to a like degree by the budget.</P>
    <P>If the criterion by which the budget is to be judged&mdash;a criterion by which I suggested it should be judged on the night it was presented&mdash;is its contribution to improving industrial relations, it has failed.  It failed to alleviate the position of PAYE wage and salary earners.  I am not saying this at a point when that message has been driven home by <Col N="650" /> marching feet throughout the country; I said it on the night of the budget and again two days later in a television broadcast on behalf of the Labour Party.  I believed then as I do now that the budget failed to tackle the great taxation scandal which sees wage and salary earners contributing £9 out of every £10 income tax collected.  The few employees who escaped the tax net in the budget will be drawn into it in the course of 1979 as rising inflation expands their incomes in a nominal fashion.</P>
    <P>If social welfare recipients were to maintain their position comparable with last year <i>vis-á-vis</i> the rest of society, they would have required an increase of 24 per cent.  In the event, they received between 12 and 16 per cent.  In the same way as the budget short-changed the PAYE sector, the majority of our taxpayers, a similar fate befell the social welfare sector.  However, a further bitter twist was given to the shabby treatment meted out to them.  Probably in the history of the State, no administration has succeeded in dividing our society as this one has.  Taking their taxation policies into account, their general views on how the economy should be operated, one can say that no administration has been so insensitive to the desirability of keeping the normal bonds of society in existence.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it comes as no surprise that this administration came upon a new division which they decided should be ordained to operate in the social welfare category.  They divided the unemployed into short-term and long-term recipients, a new class within a class, the short-term recipients to get an increase of only 12 per cent.  One does not know whose brainchild this division is.  It had the squalid purpose of saving money for the Exchequer which could be so generous under the banner of assisting the economy, which could be so meticulous in regard to the owners of capital, as to abolish their taxation with one stroke. The administration was meticulous when it came to saving money at the expense of the poorest.</P>
    <P>How short-term can the employment position be for the man or woman in his or her forties declared redundant&mdash;what a euphemism for a person facing the sad <Col N="651" /> experience of redundancy at the age of 40?  Does that employment term not become life-long?  This division into short- and long-term is more ironic, more inexplicable, unfair and unjust when one considers that 85 per cent of the money for all social welfare is paid by the employees themselves: there is no charity here.  Most of the money is contributed by those who work and who live in the State.  Those who have been declared redundant and who have been classed as short-term unemployed very often are the poorest in the community and suffer the worst living standards.</P>
    <P>When the budget was presented with such a fanfare this year, there was not such applause from the back benches opposite, but there was a general look of satisfaction on the faces of the 84 over there.  A lot has changed since then.  The headlined benefits have been analysed, the allowances have been examined, PAYE people have seen that the budget officially described as assisting their plight has done very little.  The capacity of the Government to deliver on undertakings solemnly given has begun to diminish seriously and we are faced with the strange situation that as the Government's capacity to deliver on specified targets declines, the rate of their promises increases in volume.</P>
    <P>The most marvellous exponent of promises in any Government since the war promised total solution not in this century but in the next decade.  I do not have to name him: the identity of the person whose style amounts to that of course is the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  As about other matters, there is a controversy about what has been achieved and what has not been achieved in regard to jobs. A person reading the manifesto would believe that last year we should have had a reduction of 20,000 in the unemployment register.  &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; says the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  &ldquo;Read more carefully&rdquo;. He would then make the point, as he has done so frequently, joined by other members of the Government, that when it comes to employment creation the Government, like ourselves, are lacking <Col N="652" /> knowledge, up-to-date material.  Their targets may have been achieved, but this Government have announced that one new job does not necessarily mean a decrease of one person in the unemployment register.  I accept that but there has not been the same diligence this year in regard to the exact implications of the unemployment figures as there was before the election.  Before the election the point was made by that Minister and others that an increase in employment of so many meant in layman's terms that the unemployment register would show a reduction of the same number.</P>
    <P>Whichever way you look at it, the 20,000 was not achieved in 1978.  We have a higher target for this year, in which all the omens now point to an inflation rate which will again reach double digits.  I believed late last autumn that the inflation rate for this year would be at that level, although at that time it was not the view of the establishment economists.  I do not claim any seer-like powers in the matter of forecasting how the inflation rate would go in any year, but I was banking on some of the things happening which indeed the Government were forced to do before the budget, when there were cuts of £57.7 million in public expenditure.  Of course if you could separate in time from the budget as much bad news as possible, the news is not so bad on budget day&mdash;it looks all the more palatable.</P>
    <P>At this point I do not want to enter into the controversy on the job creation question.  The Government have set a target of 25,000 new jobs this year as against 20,000 in 1978.  It does not give me great pleasure to say it, but on the basis of present policies and from what I can see on the inflation front, what we can see happening in economies around us and from the performance of manufacturing industry last year and the number of new jobs it was found possible to create there, I am faced with making the prediction that the 1979 job target will prove as unrealisable as that of 1978 and that the shortfall will be even more extreme at the end of 1979.  It gives me no satisfaction to say this.  Apart from the unemployment figures many more failures can be pointed to to assist the <Col N="653" /> Opposition case.  The employment policy of the Government will be seen to be the most severe casualty during 1979.  The Government utilised the public service to a very great extent in creating jobs last year but it will not be possible to continue doing that because the present borrowing requirement must be cut down.</P>
    <P>When the budget was introduced the Minister maintained that the kind of GNP growth we are expecting this year meant that we were on target in terms of the reduction in borrowing.  Like many more of the targets and the policy objectives, there is a good deal of controversy surrounding the growth figures for 1979. There has been criticism of the Government from the Central Bank and the ESRI, who predicted growth figures at variance with those predicted by the Government.  In political terms, growing numbers in industry are disillusioned with the effect of Government policy.  It is more important now for the Labour Party to intensify our opposition to the lack of Government policies.  This Dáil must be sensitive to the thoughts passing through people's heads, the real opposition that is growing throughout the country and we must respond to it.</P>
    <P>Government representatives cast about in every direction, in every weekend cumann meeting, in special RTE interviews and so on to explain the malaise in industrial relations and to explain who is responsible.  Apparently, nobody is responsible, least of all the Government.  Not a week passes without the Taoiseach or a Minister giving a homily on the practice of good industrial relations to some unnamed listeners, presumably the trade unions.  No Government have made as many speeches on the need for improved industrial relations.  They deal with industrial relations problems from a distance, in radio and television interviews, in the newspapers or in the cosy confines of a cumann organisation meeting.  From these vantage points they address themselves to the problems in industrial relations, yet there is the extraordinary paradox that the great difficulties that have arisen during the last year in industrial relations arose in the public sector.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is an answer to that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> The most congenial answer for any member of this administration when in difficulty is to blame the previous administration. We are almost half way through the parliamentary life of this Government, yet the previous administration are still a fertile source of explanations for difficulties encountered. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who has been dealing with the problem in that Department, will explain that the problem arose because of some shortfall during the term of the previous Government. The Minister for Finance recently explained that the difficulties in the public service have something to do with the ignominies of the National Coalition and have nothing to do with the present Government.  The manifesto which brought this administration to office made the bold claim that there would be an improvement in industrial relations in the postal service.  Recently, in one of those numerous interviews, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs claimed, apparently oblivious of the situation surrounding him and the shambles throughout the postal and telecommunications system for which he has administrative responsibility, that there had been an improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Obviously the size of the majority has led some members of the administration astray, the people who were once proud to call themselves the party of reality.  One wonders what their contact with reality is in the present day.  They deal with industrial relations as if it was not their concern, as if the troubles were due to the failures of others.  They address homilies to the nation on how it should <Col N="655" /> be improved without any recognition of the fact that the major proportion of disputes and difficulties arose in the public sector for which they have administrative responsibility.  They speak as if they have no responsibility for much of the muddle in industrial relations. The economic policy of the Government has a major influence on the state of industrial relations.  The taxation policy, for example, has a major immediate impact.</P>
      <P>At present the public service is experiencing a degree of militancy unknown for some considerable time.  It amounts to a cynical evasion of responsibility for the Minister to suggest, as he did on a recent RTE programme, that responsibility for the problems being encountered in the public service could be laid at the door of the previous Government. That was considered to be a sufficient omnibus explanation for the problems in the public service.  It would not do justice to the facts to ascribe that as a single comprehensive reason for the high level of conflict obvious between both sides in industry and throughout the public service at present.</P>
      <P>In a period marked by significant change from a recession to a growth pattern in the economy, the Government's handling of the taxation issue, the taxes to be collected, who is to contribute, the proportions and so on, tended to intensify the sense of grievance held by PAYE workers in general and by low-paid groups in the public sector in particular. There are low-paid groups in the public sector.  This grievance is a fertile ground for disputes and conflicts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can picture the grievance of many workers in the public sector who have seen other groups move ahead of laid-down norms while their own wages and salaries have been held back.  No Government policy has been announced on that matter.  It has been ignored. Homilies on moderation and the need to mend their ways addressed to the trade unions so frequently in weekend interviews with members of the Government come ill from an administration who, by their actions, have fed the sense of injustice felt by taxpayers.  They have fed <Col N="656" /> the sense of injustice felt because the tax load of the wealthiest was lightened while that of the PAYE sector was tightened, again a fertile ground for a sense of grievance.</P>
    <P>This Government's largesse to the wealthiest in our society when they abolished the wealth tax, and virtually abolished the other capital taxes, was mindless largesse from a Government who should have seen that the national interest required above all agreement on the need to stabilise incomes this year. They said their policies depended on acceptance of and willing support from the trade unions for wage moderation.  Yet they abolished the food subsidies before the budget, but as part of the general strategy of the budget, part of their general outlook for this year.  They abolished the food subsidies despite the arguments advanced against that decision.</P>
    <P>Arguments have been advanced in favour of that decision.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development explained that the wealthy were beneficiaries of the food subsidies as well as the poor, a very novel and interesting line of argument.  Strangely enough, it was not used when the taxes on the wealthy were abolished.  When they abolished food subsidies the Government ignored the immediate cut in living standards represented by that decision for the most submerged economic section of our population.  It certainly did not assist families.  As I said already, I calculate that for the three children family with a single wage earner, the effect of that decision is an increase in the family food bill of £2 per week.</P>
    <P>The Government also ignored the history of the subsidies introduced by the Government of which I was a member as part of a bargain with the trade unions.  On our part this was a deliberate action to turn down inflation in 1975.  We received the support of the trade unions for that June decision.  They voluntarily amended what was rightfully theirs in the closing stages of the national agreement.  That was intelligent budgeting.  The then Government knew the effect of one action on their part in return for a response from the trade unions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> This Government abolished the food subsidies and now they wonder why the trade unions point out quite legitimately that the previous Government introduced them in return for a particular action.  This is another illustration of the fact that the various policies and actions of the Government do not mesh.  It is an illustration of a very strange feature of this Government in comparison with previous Fianna Fáil Governments.  In Opposition we had learned to admire a certain style and co-ordination in their every action.</P>
    <P>This Government are composed of individual Ministers acting in an uncoordinated fashion.  Whether this has anything to do with the vacuum in leadership at the heart of this Government is outside the scope of this debate. Undoubtedly it is a fair surmise that the leadership vacuum and the jockeying for position in the Cabinet have a lot to do with the kind of dissonance in policies we see emerging.  They ignored the recent history of the food subsidies. Probably I have less reason to castigate them for ignoring another consequence of the abolition of the food subsidies, or the first phased reduction in the food subsidies.  The compensation for social welfare recipients for the withdrawal of the food subsidies on the basis of the cost of living figure from February to February was not an adequate substitute because the effect of the removal of the food subsidies would not be reflected in the official figures until March.</P>
    <P>Members of the Government would have been better employed in ensuring that the budget measured up to the grievances of the PAYE sector if the primary objective of policy this year was to encourage a climate for moderate wage settlements.  They would have done more to improve industrial relations if they had used the budgetary instrument to that effect.  That was the criterion I applied to the budget.  On the night it was presented I felt that on that criterion it had failed.  They cast about for all sorts of reasons to explain the industrial militancy: failings of the previous Government, human nature, British unions and the 101 reasons which have been cited for this extraordinary manifestation of militancy in the public <Col N="658" /> sector which is their administrative responsibility.  The Government would have been better employed in reviewing the effect of their own decisions as a contributory factor to the growing social estrangement observable throughout the society.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of their 84-seat mandate was won by the appeal of this Government to our young people.  Ours is a very young population.  We have the highest proportion ever of young couples seeking homes of their own.  Yet this Government presided over a period in which the cost of housing has become historically high.  Undoubtedly the cost of financing housing constitutes a significant element in the pressure for higher incomes from a population with so many young people in it.  There is a potent source of wage claims in the pressures on any young couple attempting to get a home of their own when one considers the amount required to finance mortgage loans and so on.  We can consider the astronomical rise in the price of houses and ask ourselves why the budget did not allocate more for housing.  The manifesto did not overlook that.  I am sorry to have to come back to that embarrassing document.</P>

      <P>Whenever the next election may come it will be helpful and even topical for the Opposition parties to ensure that every household in Ireland is furnished with a copy of that manifesto.  We could not think of more potent propaganda contrasting the promises of this administration with their performance.  If the Minister can tell me with as much confidence whose advantage it will be to cite that manifesto if we are both alive in two years' time, I hope he will say it.</P>

      <P>The Minister is a man who sticks literally to the first interpretation of his first statement, and he will agree that interpretations are necessary. His Delphic utterances need to be analysed and the usual sequel is that he has been misinterpreted or misunderstood. If we are here in two years' time, as I hope we both will be whatever our political fortunes may be, I hope the Minister will be able to say with as much confidence that the manifesto promises and undertakings can still be seen as of advantage to his party.  That toll of thousands of young people has become probably the most flagrant example of broken political promises of the decade.</P>
      <P>The country is bitter with this Government, and for good reason.  A period in which the economy was growing in company with other economies around us was not utilised to bond together the entire community behind policies designed to expand employment. As we absorb the news about the meetings of OPEC Ministers and what they may mean for our inflation rate this year we realise that that precious growth time was squandered by this administration as they went along dividing the community further by their taxation policies, unheeding of criticisms that they should do this or that.  If they are serious about employment targets and objectives, then it is necessary that their policies should mesh together and that the trade union movement looking at those policies could say, &ldquo;Here is a Government.  We may not agree with all they say, but they are serious about expanding employment and about getting the support of society generally behind them&rdquo;.  They squandered precious time. We do not know what the outcome of the OPEC Ministers' decision will be in inflationary terms for the economy this year.  I made the point earlier that it would push us to about the 12 per cent point.  I have in mind especially what the Secretary-General of that organisation said in today's <i>Financial Times</i>, that maximum prices would depend on the development of the market.  I have already noted that these were ominous words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other items which I would like to have considered, but before <Col N="660" /> sitting down I will say that I hope the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, who has responsibility in this area, will clarify the oil supply position as it faces this country with as little delay as possible.  We have here at present a form of unofficial rationing at certain petrol outlets.  The Minister should let us know the present supply situation and what it is likely to be in the near future.  One or two schools to my certain knowledge are experiencing difficulties in supply, and that may be more widespread than I am aware of.  If there is a shortage problem facing us the Minister should consider drawing up some guidelines regarding distribution.  It is too early to say what effect these OPEC decisions will have on the retail price of oil for domestic purposes, hospitals, schools or industry in general, but the news is not good.  It gives me no satisfaction to see this great trouble looming on the horizon.  We have many more home-contributed problems in the last year and a half and certainly in this budget.  We have seen precious time wasted.  Now this administration, confronting their first bit of really bad news from abroad in the shape of increased oil prices, are entering a very testing time indeed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what we are concluding because I am not sure if there is any budget before the House. There seem to be mixed views among the Deputies in the House as to whether this debate should be concluded.  One group say that because the budget has been, is being or may be totally dismantled as bearing no relation to that which the Minister introduced on 7 February, the most honest thing to do is to get it off the Order Paper and get rid of it.  Another group say that because the budget is still not completed and we still do not know exactly what it contains, it should be kept on the Order Paper until it has come to a final point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with the people who say that we should get it off the Order Paper as it is a waste of time to discuss it.  I do not believe that <Col N="661" /> any other Government have so early and quickly pushed aside the budget which they introduced.  Within six weeks this one apparently has been completely dismantled.  I hope the Minister will tell me whether there are other changes in the budget besides the most specialised and those which give rise to the most controversy.  I am thinking particularly of the about-face of the Minister regarding the farm levy.  As late as yesterday he described the Government's attitude as being unequivocal in this regard.  This is not strictly true. There is still doubt as to what he means by the farm levy being introduced on I May.</P>
    <P>I want to raise a point and I ask the Minister to take note of what I am going to say and perhaps he will find a solution within the next 48 hours.  The financial year comes to an end on 5 April and from 6 April changes notified in the budget as regards stamps and levels of taxes will apply.  Because of the postal strike employers and employees do not know what levels of tax will be applied to them or what deductions should correctly be made by employers in regard to the new pay-related stamps scheme, nor in regard to tax free allowances or the level of taxes from Friday week onwards.  I believe the Revenue Commissioners have telephoned a number of the larger firms, telling them that the necessary documentation was available if they wished to go round and collect it.  I am told also that when these firms went to collect that documentation&mdash;again because of the postal dispute&mdash;it could not be given them.  That is a matter of concern for every employer and employee in the next ten days because the first pay day of the new financial year will be Friday week.  I would ask the Minister to make some arrangements within the next 24 hours&mdash;because firms will start on Monday morning and indeed some computers, including that of the Minister's Department, will probably be working over this coming weekend calculating the amount of wages to be paid.  That cannot be done unless the employers know the amount of deduction to be made from each employee.  I do not know whether it can be solved by placing advertisements in the paper, or <Col N="662" /> whether there are some other means of solving it but the Minister should address his mind to it immediately.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about some aspects of the budget which are to be welcomed.  Oppositions are charged always with picking out the parts of a budget to which they object and for not paying tribute to the features which are good and are to be welcomed.  That criticism may be somewhat unfair, but it has been levelled at me personally. Perhaps the reason for this is that the matters to which we object in a budget receive publicity whereas those we welcome publicly do not receive the same publicity.  I should like to repeat somewhat my first reaction to the budget and to mention some features I welcome.  The first of these is the easing of the means test for the War of Independence veterans.  That is good and something that should have been done. There are fewer of these people remaining each year.  Anything the Houses of the Oireachtas can do to render their last years somewhat easier and put a few more pounds in their pockets is a good thing.</P>
    <P>Also to be welcomed are the VAT changes relating to record players and radios.  I can envisage the tremendous problems the old system held for traders, particularly those near Border areas. That they will now be afforded a better opportunity of competing with goods on the other side of the border will be helpful. I understand that this is an expensive undertaking and I regret the Minister could not see his way to doing it in regard to televisions and some other goods.</P>
    <P>The relief granted to one-parent families is generous and is to be welcomed.  There are also what are called the pre-1968 widows; the movement towards full parity of pensions for these widows is a step in the right direction.  I only wish the Minister could have seen his way to going the full distance instead of the five-sixths he has done.  But that at least he appreciates the problem and is moving in that direction is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I welcome particularly the extra money being allocated to the Arts Council. I understand the difficulties of any <Col N="663" /> Government providing money for bodies such as this.  There are very many calls even in the most affluent of times on any government in this respect.  There are different priorities and a government must be determined to ensure that some money is directed towards things of a cultural nature.  When Minister for Education I declared my intention, within the Department and the Government at that time, to steer as much money as possible towards bodies such as the RIA, the museums and three or four other comparable bodies under the control of the Department of Education. A nation is not really mature unless it appreciates the value of these for its citizens and demonstrates that appreciation in the amount of money it devotes to them.  Some years ago there was a scheme introduced by a former Minister for Finance which allowed artists living here a tax free income earned from literature or from the pursuit of their art. It was a worthwhile scheme which brought renown to this country.  It also attracted here many people recognised throughout the world as leaders in their own field in the arts.  Of course, it brought others as well who are not recognised but who have come here purely to avail of the facility.  However, one must accept that under any scheme one will have the rough with the smooth. I should like to see that scheme extended. I am not sure that it would be possible because, by definition, the people who receive relief under that scheme introduced some ten years ago by the Minister, Deputy Haughey, are those who have an income, or else they would not be liable to income tax.  There is another group of people struggling in what is broadly termed the field of the arts who have no incomes.  Therefore that scheme is of no benefit to them. Perhaps some scheme could be devised, through the Arts Council, the Department of Education or some other Department under which young and struggling artists&mdash;and every country needs them if only to prod our consciences from time to time, to make us stretch ourselves and broaden our minds; we all need the young struggling artist as much as the established, <Col N="664" /> renowned one&mdash;could be given cash grants, be they painters, writers, choreographers, musicians, ballet dancers or whatever, those who have not got means sufficient to warrant their paying tax thereby rendering them eligible for the tax free allowance for artists. Naturally one thinks first of helping those who are Irish, living here, who want to study and work in this country. But possibly the scheme could be geared so that we might attract other young people, not in the taxable income bracket, who are struggling wanting to build a career for themselves in the arts and to establish in this country an atmosphere and environment which encourages and helps young artists.  I put it no stronger than saying that it would be good for all of us here to have people of that type mixing among us, influencing our way of life, the values, standards and quality of life we all hope to build here, which is the only justification for having our freedom at all&mdash;that we can establish a different and more worthwhile quality of life here as opposed to the position when we were part of the British Empire.</P>
    <P>In introducing the budget the Minister said, at column 636 of the Official Report of 7 February 1979:</P>
    <P>It is my task to present today a budget which will promote stability, while also contributing to continued economic and social progress.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think now, some six or seven weeks later, that the budget he presented on that day promoted stability and contributed to economic and social progress?  A lot of what is contained in the budget and indeed the stance of the Government towards the people since they came into office has been seriously divisive.  It is ironic that we are now facing an oil crisis, because early in our term of office the Yom Kippur War occurred and at that stage we could see the effect the quadrupling of oil prices would have on inflation.  We visualised a downturn in world economies.  We knew the situation in our economy would be bad but we could also visualise the effect the oil crisis then would have on the economies of other EEC countries to which we were determined to export.  We <Col N="665" /> could see a danger of a rift between the various sections of the community if we did not act to minimise the effect on the economy of this ballooning inflation and the quadrupling of oil prices.  We were anxious that the effects of those problems would not greatly hurt those least able to afford to grapple with them.</P>
    <P>The situation now facing the Government is not dissimilar to that which we faced in 1973 and I will be interested to see what they do in this regard.  The OPEC countries yesterday announced an increase in oil prices of 9 per cent and the chairman of that body has stated that the price of oil should be able to find its market level.  That means that the price of oil will go up more than 9 per cent; it may rise by as much as 20 per cent.  Some of this morning's newspapers referred to this as a &ldquo;crisis situation&rdquo;.  I will compare what the Government do to deal with this crisis situation with what we did in 1973 to deal with a 400 per cent increase in the price of oil.  The Minister is fond of referring to 1974 and 1975 and to the fact that there was a 20 per cent rate of inflation then, the implication being that it was the fault of the Government; but he does not refer to the 400 per cent increase in the price of oil then.  Will we be told later this year that the hope of a rate of inflation of 5 per cent, as expressed in the budget, cannot be achieved because of the increase in the price of oil or will we be told that it cannot be achieved because of the Government's ineptitude in handling the situation?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Government have borrowed themselves into a corner and their freedom of movement in the face of the external winds that will affect us is limited.  I do not understand how the Government can expect to get the co-operation of those on PAYE in preparing an incomes policy in view of the statements made about an end of the year inflation of about 5 per cent.  A statement to that effect is contained in five different parts of the Minister's budget statement and has been repeated by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and other Ministers since.  The repetition of this, mostly in the context of the necessity for a moderate wage increase. <Col N="666" /> is an effort by the Government to persuade the unions that inflation will be down to 5 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>After some probing last week the Minister for Economic planning and Development told us that this 5 per cent end of the year inflation was got by annualising the figure of 1.25 per cent, the increase in prices between mid-August and mid-November next.  He told us that was a guess but later informed us that he was not a prophet and could not tell us what the annual rate would be.  Those negotiating with the Government on a wage agreement and those, like us, who say that the increases in social welfare benefits and income tax allowances in the budget were inadequate find it difficult to understand how the Government can arrive at an annual rate of inflation of 5 per cent.  According to the consumer price index for the quarter ending mid-February food inflation is now running at 28.8 per cent and the current annualised rate of inflation would be four times 4.2, or almost 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>A fortnight ago the Minister was defending the abolition of food subsidies here and by implication appeared to be saying that inflation was moving towards single figures.  That was within 48 hours of the figures I have just quoted being produced.  I do not know whether the Minister had those figures that night or whether he can get them officially before the rest of the country, but I am certain that if he can talk about an end of the year rate of inflation of 5 per cent in December he can make a better shot at the actual rate of inflation 48 hours before the official figures are released rather than telling us that we are moving towards a single figure rate of inflation.</P>

      <P>On the same basis, food inflation is running at 28.8 per cent. What did the Minister say in the debate on 13 March, volume 312, column 1315 of the Official Report?  He said:</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the social welfare payment increases of the kind announced in this year's budget will more than compensate the recipients for the effects of the reduction in the food subsidies.  In addition to the increases in social welfare payments, I also announced in the budget changes in the personal income tax allowances. These changes, combined with the social welfare children's allowances, will be sufficient to more than compensate all families, whether large or small, for the increases in food prices resulting from the partial removal of the subsidies.</P>
      <P>Two days after that those figures were produced.</P>
      <P>We all know that a far greater proportion of the income of social welfare recipients and of those on low incomes goes on food than that of those who are well off.  We know that food subsidies were abolished the first weekend of this year when the Government hoped that, as it was a bank holiday weekend, the matter would not be reported or read as fully as it would be any other time. When the Dáil resumed at the end of January both Opposition parties immediately started to look for a debate on the abolition of food subsidies.  We were put off by the Taoiseach, but eventually the debate was allowed 48 hours before those figures were out and when the Opposition could not have them.  Was it only coincidence that the debate on the abolition of food subsidies was arranged before those damning figures from the Government's point of view were produced?  Was the timing of the debate deliberately arranged so that the Opposition would not have those figures?  I do not know if the Government or the Minister for Finance had those figures before that debate took place.  I know they had them before they were available to the public generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the kind of cleverness which typifies everything the Government have done since they assumed office.  They <Col N="668" /> say one thing and then say afterwards they were misreported or that people did not understand what they said.  We have been told by them that they did not say they would reduce unemployment by 25,000.  They said they would put 25,000 in jobs, even though it is clear in the document referred to by Deputy O'Leary that they said they would reduce unemployment by 25,000. Anybody who is not a lawyer and who does not engage in parsing and analysing sentences for the sake of proving a legal point, the people who understand and speak normal English, know that reducing unemployment by 25,000 means bringing down the only measurement we have in this country, whether it is inadequate or not,&mdash;the live register&mdash;by that figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making the point I am trying to make, that this is the kind of clever legal talk which we get from the Government.  The only measure we have for assessing unemployment is the live register.  Most people understood by the phrase used by the Government that the live register would be reduced by 25,000, but that has not happened. The same can be said about end of year inflation of 5 per cent.  It is quite clear when we read the budget statement that end of year inflation of 5 per cent is what is meant, but most people take that to mean 5 per cent inflation for 1979.  The Minister came along later and said that that was not what he said, that he said that it would be end of year inflation of 5 per cent.  The Government are only making <Col N="669" /> a guess at what inflation will be between mid-August and mid-November next.  This is the kind of clever wording of phrases we get from the Government trying to cloak what is intended, but the people see through them.  It is because they see through them that 250,000 people marched last Tuesday week looking for increased tax allowances.</P>
      <P>The same thing happened with regard to the levy on farmers and a meeting between the Government and the farmers on 27 February last.  The 2 per cent levy was introduced in the budget.  I said then that this was anti-national and anti-farmer.  I said it was anti-national because it took the feet from under the Minister for Agriculture in Brussels who was trying to stop the EEC Commission and his fellow Ministers on the Council from imposing a levy on produce all over Europe.  How could he put his hand on his heart and say &ldquo;No levy&rdquo; when he was part of a Government who introduced a levy on their own farmers?  I said it was anti-farmer because it took no account of the ability of farmers to pay it.  No matter how small they were they would be liable for the 2 per cent levy.</P>
      <P>That was the position until the annual gathering of the Minister's party.  At that stage the Minister announced some readjustment of the levy to exclude people west of the Shannon, pig breeders and some others.  Within 48 hours the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture met representatives of the farming bodies. The following morning there were headlines in the papers stating &ldquo;Farmers write their own tax&rdquo;, &ldquo;Levy gone&rdquo;.  The Government were warned that this would provoke a backlash from the PAYE taxpayers.  The Minister came back and said that the Government would decide what tax would be paid. The day before that he attended a press conference at which the Minister for Agriculture said, on 28 March, according to <i>The Irish Press</i>, that he was pleased that the farming organisations expressed their willingness to work out an income tax system which would be equitable.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Cork Examiner</i> stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> The Minister for Finance, Mr. Colley, said after the meeting that the proposals had evolved from ones put forward by the farming organisations to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and himself.  Mr. Gibbons who was present with Mr. Colley at the meeting with journalists said he was pleased the farming organisations had expressed a willingness to work out an income tax system that would be equitable.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> said the same thing.  The Minister for Finance last weekend referred to the document as the most badly reported and misinterpreted document ever circulated in the country, but on reading it it is obvious it was carefully worded.  It is quite obvious what was agreed.  The Minister for Finance was present at the press conference and he heard the Minister for Agriculture make that statement but he made no effort to correct him.  The Minister for Agriculture was one of the people who drafted the document but now the Minister for Finance is blaming unfortunate people for misreporting it.  He made no effort to correct the Minister for Agriculture but allowed the impression to get out to the farmers that they were a special category and could devise their own tax system, although it is obvious from reading the document that was produced and circulated that that was not so.  The Minister for Finance allowed the papers the following morning to print something he thought would help to clam the anger of the farming community because of the levy.</P>
    <P>That impression was allowed to persist until there was the inevitable backlash from the PAYE sector and a week later the marches started.  Then, of course, it was pointed out that the Government would devise a tax system, that the farmers would only be consulted with the Revenue Commissioners, that the Government would have the last say and introduce a tax system.  However, the damage was done and they could not catch up with the original story, that one section was going to write its own tax bill.  This is the kind of divisive policy <Col N="671" /> that has set one section against another and the Government are directly responsible for it.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a query regarding capital allowances.  Has the Minister received representations from industry and from the IDA regarding this matter?  Is it true that this is not going to be part of the budget?  With regard to the proposal to tax people who have a preferential rate of interest from their firms, will the Minister state if that will be taken out of the budget also?  I do not know if the Minister's silence means it is or is not going to be taken out of the budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appeared to be inviting me to reply now.  That is why I said anything.  The Deputy referred to my silence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised the two matters and I formally asked the Minister to refer to them in his reply. Perhaps he will tell me if the items are still part of the budget or if they have been dropped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister spoke about the farmers' levy.  He said that people did not understand what had been agreed and that unless it was agreed publicly by the farming community to assist with <Col N="672" /> taxation the levy as announced in the budget would go ahead from 1 May. Does that mean that the subsequent reliefs offered are no longer on offer? Last night the Minister used the words, &ldquo;the 2 per cent levy as announced in the budget&rdquo;.  Was it a case of bad drafting or does the Minister mean that the reliefs announced at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis are no longer available and that the 2 per cent levy across the board will go ahead on 1 May?  Perhaps it was just careless wording last night; perhaps the Minister means that the levy, as proposed to be amended, will go ahead.  I should like clarification on that point.</P>
    <P>I have said on several occasions in the past 12 months that unless we export we cannot support the numbers coming out of our schools, we cannot give a decent standard of living to those at work or support old age pensioners.  We must export to live.  If we are going to export, the quality of our goods must be at least as high as those on offer from other countries and our prices must be at least as low as those of other countries.  If we are not competitive we will not sell. Nobody owes us a living.  A Government can make a contribution in this area in three ways.  First, they can make available to industrialists the highest expertise they can train or hire to encourage and help them to produce high quality goods.  Second, the contribution they make through the achievement of a wage agreement will ensure that our unit wage costs are lower than those of our competitors.  It will be accepted by both sides of industry that they have this right, and that they have this contribution to make.  The third is that they can help industrialists to open new markets.</P>
    <P>I will take the last point first.  I do not think anybody disputes what I have said. Nobody will dispute the dedication and patriotism displayed by the employees of Coras Tráchtála Teoranta, since its establishment, in helping Irish industrialists to get new markets.  Their contribution in this area has been enormous. Why are the Government not giving them this year an amount of money equivalent to that received last year? The amount set aside for CTT in 1979 is not 10 per cent more than the amount set aside for them in 1978.  No doubt the <Col N="673" /> Minister's answer will be that it is almost in line with inflation, as we understood it, in November or December, but CTT are not concerned with industrial inflation; they are concerned with costs in other countries.  They have to sell in Germany, France, the United Kingdom and America.  That is where their costs are incurred.</P>
    <P>If we are going to tie the amount for CTT to an inflation increase, which I think is the wrong approach, it is the inflation in those countries that should be taken into account, not ours.  To expect them to meet extremely though competition in world markets this year on the same amount of real money as they had last year, in Irish terms, is nonsense.  I beg the Minister to reconsider this matter because it is a serious mistake on the Government's part.</P>
    <P>We had the first indication of an increase in oil prices last December when the supplies from Iran were cut off.  It could be seen that the world economy would be sliding into a recession at the end of this year.  If that is so, it is the wrong attitude to expect CTT to pull in their horns and not to be as active as they were in the last few years.  We should give them much more money and tell them to be more active and aggressive and to go into the field and sell more goods because there will be greater competion this year.  Our goods will not sell themselves.  I have not spoken to anybody in CTT but I can imagine their attitude in the last few months since these figures were published must be one of deep worry.  As I said, I beg the Minister to reconsider this retrograde step of not giving them a great deal more money than they have already and encouraging them to sell more goods abroad.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in reply to questions put down by members of the Labour Party about the contribution the private sector made to the creation of jobs in the last year, the Minister in an aggressive tone said that last year was not the private sector's year; it was the Government's year for priming the pump of the economy which would be passed to the private sector this year.  He said that if they did not perform this year he would have something to do and say about <Col N="674" /> them at the end of the year.  Does he really expect private industry to react to that kind of semi-threat?  Does he not know the type of men who run businesses? We have a relatively small private sector.  Does he not know that the first thing they want is stability, not, even though they take them, grants and tax concessions?  They are all very welcome but the primary thing is the environment and their assessment of what the future holds.  Would the Chair say that this Government have contributed to a feeling of security among the business community in regard to what this year holds?  How long were they without telephones last year?  When we had post, how many Deputies got letters from the Department of Post and Telegraphs regretting that cables were not available to install telephones?</P>
    <P>We have not had any post for five weeks.  I do not want to go into that subject now because this is a sensitive area. I was glad to see from one of this morning's papers that something may happen over the weekend.  I hope so.  This Government cannot afford to adopt the intransigent, tough attitude they have already adopted.  Many people have sympathy for men earning only £53 per week.  They do not feel that is a reasonable wage.  I can understand the Government not wanting to break established procedures but the postal dispute is having a disastrous effect on the confidence of the business community, on the efforts of the IDA field men who are trying to encourage firms to establish new industries here, and on the plans for expansion of existing industries.  These are the points that matter to businessmen. Of course the tax levels and the freedom in which they are allowed to conduct their affairs are important, but far more important is their assessment of what the Government are doing to the general environment in which people live and work.</P>
    <P>It was reported in the foreign Press that one-third of our taxpayers took to the streets because they felt they were being unfairly treated&mdash;and we have not yet found out exactly what they mean by that.  The Minister referred to the improvements he had made in the tax system and how much better off people <Col N="675" /> were now on the books, than they were before he came to office.  If that is so, why were the people on the streets?  The Minister sought to deflect attention from the genuine grievances of PAYE taxpayers and to reduce the numbers of the march by accusing the organisers of being in the hands of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an idea that the Minister was trying to keep some supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party off the march by pretending that it was a Fine Gael-Labour organised march and they would be letting down the party if they joined it.  However, supporters of the Fianna Fáil Pary thumbed their noses at the Minister, joined the march and said that they had enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is the sense of grievance coming from and how will it affect the wage talks at present being engaged in by the Congress of Trade Unions, the employers and the Government?  The kernel is; what effect has the stance of the Government since this budget was introduced had on that wage agreement and what effect will a wage agreement that interferes with the competitiveness of Irish goods on world markets have on employment?  How much can be traced back to the stance adopted by the Government and the impression they allowed to be created that one section of the community could write its own tax bill?  The Minister deliberately allowed that impression to be created because he thought it would be of benefit to the Government at the time.  It was only when he saw that PAYE workers were incensed and outraged by this that he clarified the position and highlighted the fact that the Government would draw up the tax bill.  At that stage it had gone too far and PAYE people are now saying, maybe unreasonably, if A can get it, B can get it.  The Government and the Minister have nobody to blame but themselves for the present position.  I implore them to get down off their lecturing platforms and stop telling the people what they should do.  They should listen to what the people are saying and should not divide the country between urban and rural as appears to be what they set <Col N="677" /> out and succeeded in doing.</P>
    <P>When there was an oil crisis at the end of 1973 we foresaw a possibility of divisions of this nature arising.  We moved to correct them in many ways.  We introduced capital taxes.  They were not introduced for the amount of revenue they would bring in because they would have brought in less than 1 per cent of the total revenue collected.  I would refer the Minister to an article in yesterday's <i>Financial Times</i> dealing with capital taxes.  They are not used in any country in Europe as revenue collectors.  They are used for social reasons to ensure fairness to all taxpayers.  That is where this Government and this budget have failed.</P>
    <P>We will all pay the price for this Government's lack of sensitivity to the legitimate demands and aspirations of all the people.  Rightly or wrongly, intentionally or unintentionally, Fianna Fáil have given the impression over the last two years that they are in office thanks to, and to cater for, one part of the people, Unless they mend their ways there will be deeper rifts in society and a more divided community and we will all pay the price for that.</P>
    <P>The Government have not done anything to unite the people to the tough times ahead.  The have done nothing to get people to recognise that every section of the community must contribute if the country as a whole is to advance. The budget which they introduced did not help in that regard.  The Government's action since then has made the situation a great deal worse.  I would ask the Minister before it is too late to look after three sections of the community fairly and without threats, the old, the farmers and the PAYE section.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the social welfare reliefs given in the budget will not compensate for increase in the cost of living. It is obvious that the blunt form of taxation imposed on farmers, the levy, whether it is back to the 2 per cent or is a modified version, was unfair.  It is obvious that taxpayers, no matter what juggling of figures produces are contributing £9 out of £10 to the running of the country and they want that fairly distributed.  The Minister has a chance in the Finance Bill to make amends for this <Col N="678" /> divisive budget and I hope he takes it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we debated last night and will be debating again tonight the motion and amendment in regard to taxation i do not propose to spend very long on that area.  However, there are one or two things which are directly in response to what Deputy Barry said.  He said that the capital taxes imposed by the Coalition were introduced to create an element of fairness.  He was, of course, talking about the wealth tax.  He could not have been talking about the capital gains tax which was demonstrably unfair in the way it worked, and we have had to make it equitable.  He can hardly have been talking about capital acquisitions tax which, from the point of view of fairness&mdash;he was talking in terms of people who were less well off and their views of those who are well-off&mdash;is a tax which enables people to distribute slices of their fortunes valued at up to £250,000 to their spouses and their children and pay no capital acquisition tax.  That could hardly be held up as an example of introducing fairness into our economy.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he was obviously talking about wealth tax.  I dealt with that last night and I will not waste time on it again.  However, I should like to tell Deputy Barry and anybody else who is interested that in our economic circumstances as they were when he was in Government, and to a lesser but still important extent today, one of the greatest injustices is unemployment.  The first effort of any Government who are trying to remedy injustice must be to tackle unemployment. The wealth tax did a great deal of damage to the efforts to tackle unemployment.  Its abolition, combined with a number of other things done by the Government, has created the climate in which we have been able to make the greatest growth ever in the history of this State in tackling unemployment.  They are the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on the Financial Resolutions commenced on 7 February. Development of events outside the House since have introduced either new factors or have lent different emphasis to matters which could be regarded as the <Col N="679" /> fundamentals on which the debate was based.  I refer particularly to the discussions which have taken place and are taking place with farming representatives originating from the proposals in respect of the agricultural levy, and to the emphasis which has been placed on income tax, particularly PAYE, in the talks with the ICTU and the employers.</P>
    <P>However, in view of the separate debate on taxation which is going on, and to which I contributed last night, I propose to confine my remarks on the budget primarily to specific points made by Deputies in the course of the debate. When I refer to specific points, I will not be able&mdash;a Minister never is in a debate of this length&mdash;to deal with every point raised.  I hope to be able to deal with those of the greatest importance.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies have been particularly critical of the economic strategy underlying my budget.  Deputy Barry went so far as to describe it as being against the national interest.  Deputy FitzGerald said the Government have created a budget that does not bear any relation to our economic needs, that it is a budget for emigration, nothing less.  If one were to listen to those and to some other speakers during the debate one would imagine we are living in an economy in dire difficulty instead of one which is achieving the fastest rate of growth in the EEC.  Of course there is not anything new in these attitudes.</P>
    <P>Much the same sort of criticism was offered last year and I should like to recall some of them because the record shows they were completely groundless. Last year Deputy FitzGerald during the budget debate attempted to assess the extent to which the budget measured up to the requirements of the economy.  As reported at column 477 of the Official Report for 2 February 1978, he concluded, predictably, that it was a budget doomed to disaster.  In the same debate Deputy Barry stated:</P>
    <P>This budget is supposed to generate employment and expand activity. Where are the jobs?  Where is the expansion? The budget contains absolutely nothing for the job seekers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> Deputy O'Leary, at column 433 on 1 February last year, is reported:</P>
    <P>Nothing that we have heard today provides any firm basis for the belief that job expansion on the scale required will occur in 1978.</P>
    <P>That is what they said in the budget debate last year, but the record of the achievements of the budget last year speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>Government action raised the growth rate in 1978 to a near record level.  The net increase in employment was the highest in the history of the State, and while registering that progress we cut the rate of inflation substantially.  The relevance of all this to the present debate is direct: just as the Opposition were proved wrong in their assessment of last year's budget, I am quite certain they will be wrong again this year.</P>
    <P>The Opposition's criticism of the budget seemed to reflect quite a divided mind on the economic problems we faced and on the way we should tackle them.  I do not think any of the parties in the House would disagree that unemployment is a major problem.  As I have indicated, as far as the Government are concerned it is the major problem.  It therefore follows that the fastest possible growth must be aimed at because that is the way to make the quickest and the greatest inroads on unemployment. Deputy FitzGerald acknowledged that when he said it is only if we can keep our growth rate greater than 5 per cent that we can hope for more jobs.</P>
    <P>This Government have been tackling our growth and unemployment problems in a systematic and energetic manner. We are not dogmatic planners but we believe in the value of a programmed approach. So, too, I imagine do quite a number of Deputies on the other side. Nevertheless, Deputy FitzGerald asserted that the Government's hands are tied by their pre-election manifesto, that they have lost freedom of action in managing the economy in the way it needs to be managed.  I was surprised to hear the Deputy describe the setting down of what everybody would regard as desirable economic targets as tying our hands, or adherence to a desirable course of action as the loss of freedom of <Col N="681" /> action.</P>
    <P>What is economic planning, what is it for if it does not involve commitment to aims and methods?  Does anybody believe that economic planning can go ahead hand in hand with short-term opportunism? That was the difficulty with the previous Government&mdash;that was the way they governed.  It is not the way we govern or propose to govern.  We are all aware there are here deep-seated economic and social problems which can only be eradicated by long vigorous and patient effort, and that is the justification for the planning exercise the Government are engaged in.</P>
    <P>We know our goals and we will not be deflected from them by illusory attractions, the kind of short-term freedom of action to which the Leader of the main Opposition party seems to attach such weight.  This brings me to our objectives for this year.</P>
    <P>The background to them, both economic facts and the policy we intend to pursue, has been set out in our planning document.  I made our position crystal clear in my budget speech.  I described them as targets, not forecasts of what will happen which would be let to run their course without any real effort on anybody's part.  I acknowledge that, if the effort is not strong enough, the targets will not be reached. Whenever anyone sets an ambitious target there are always those, including many experts, both selfstyled and genuine, who say they cannot be achieved.  But history is full of examples of doubters being confounded.  I have no doubt that the targets we have set can be realised.  I am not saying it will be easy&mdash;far from it.  We will need to develop a much greater sense of communal purpose and discipline if we are to achieve them.  I believe in the abilities of our people.  If we can convey the aims and how they can be achieved, they are capable of demonstrating the qualities necessary to enable us to achieve these objectives.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald and others made much of the differences between the Government's targets and the economic forecasts produced by various outside agencies.  Opposition Deputies have gone very far in their language on this <Col N="682" /> issue.  Deputy Barry described the budget as being based on false figures. Deputy O'Leary described the Government as facing both ways in their budgetary calculations and Deputy FitzGerald said that in his period in Government they accepted that basically the country must be told the truth and that my budget marked the first time in his recollection that there was a departure from that.  The Deputy alleged that the figures were falsified to the point of absurdity and self-contradition, These are very serious charges.  I have no hesitation in rejecting them categorically. I am quite amazed by Deputy FitzGerald's charge that the figures in this budget were falsified.  I was careful in my budget speech to make specific reference to the basis for all the figures.  I indicated clearly that the macroeconomic figures are targets, that their achievement depends on a coherent communal effort and that if the effort is not strong enough the targets will not be reached.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald's departure from the standards reasonably expected from the newest backbencher in this House is one thing, but what is more important is the effect his statements could have on confidence and economic activity.  If some representative people continue to throw cold water on the Government's targets and say they cannot be achieved it may become more difficult to generate the national responses which are undobtedly needed to achieve these targets. A coherent national effort is required to meet the ambitious but realisable targets set by the Government.  It is hoped that the Opposition's unfounded assertions will not lead to any reduction of general confidence in the prospects for economic growth or to a reduced effort on anyone's part.  It is also hoped that responsible people abroad, making decisions affecting the well-being of our people, will ignore Deputy FitzGerald's reckless and unfounded allegations.</P>
    <P>I presented a budget which assumed that the Government's main economic targets would be met and which did all it could to ensure this.  This is the only sensible course of action.  Does anybody really think that a Government should set economic targets generally welcomed <Col N="683" /> by the social partners and then proceed to introduce a budget based on the premise that the targets will not be met, particularly after they had succeeded in meeting ambitious targets in the previous year?  If a Government frame economic targets that they believe are achieveable with effort, they have no option but to prepare their budget on the basis of the targets.  The relative size of the State sector in the nation's economic life is now so great that any other basis would ensure that the targets were not met.  Fast economic growth demands, for example, the provision of more infrastructure, a greater allocation to the IDA and other industrial development agencies, more money for housing and so on.  We have provided this.  The public capital programme this year shows an increase of 22 per cent on last year. Equally important, the net budgetary position, taking the revenue and expenditure sides into account, must be designed to give the appropriate degree of stimulus to the economy.  That is what my budget is designed to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald referred to forecasts for this year produced by the OECD, the ESRI and the Central Bank. The Deputy said that the Government are not convincing when they say that this year they will be right with the figures, that they are different from those offered by these three bodies.  I do not see much point in getting involved in a debate on whether the forecasting track records of these bodies is better than the Government's, but let us look at the situation for last year.  The latest estimates of growth in the economy for last year are: Central Bank, 5¾ per cent; ESRI, 6¼ per cent; OECD, 6½ per cent. Our forecast, produced later and based on more up to date information, including the upturn in consumer spending and industrial exports in the fourth quarter, is for a growth rate of about 7 per cent.  The other estimates underline the important central fact that the economy grew well above its trend rate in 1978 and that the Government's strategy of moving it on to a higher growth path succeeded.  The public are not interested in sterile arguments over <Col N="684" /> quarters, halves or percentage points. Some Deputies were very emphatic in denying that investment last year rose by 15 per cent as we claimed.  Indeed, Deputy FitzGerald said that investment is falling, not increasing.  If the Deputy is not aware of it, he might be interested to know that no commentator agrees with him on that.</P>

      <P>The reference can be checked.  It is at column 767 of the Official Report for 8 February 1979. Deputy FitzGerald said in that column in regard to investment that the 15 per cent figure was nonsensical.  The two most important indicators for investment are cement sales and imports of producers' capital goods.  On both, we have data that even Deputy FitzGerald will hardly question.  The volume of cement sales in 1978 rose by 15½ per cent, the value of capital goods imports rose by 30 per cent and the volume by about 20 per cent.  In the light of these figures it is probable that our estimate of a 15 per cent volume increase in investment is, if anything, too conservative.  The upsurge in business confidence, due to our enlightened and imaginative policies, resulted in a large increase in investment and capacity in 1978.  This has very important implications for the current year, because it means that we have the extra capacity to enable us to achieve our growth and employment targets.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is denying it. Before I conclude the Deputy will get the reference to it.</P>
      <P>In 1979, there are a number of reasons why the Government's forecasts should be superior to those of outside bodies.  First, they were prepared later and, therefore, there was more up-to-date information available on the current and prospective situations.  Second, they were prepared in the full knowledge of the Government's budgetary intentions. That is an important factor which is frequently overlooked.  Our economic forecasters do not live in isolation.  They make a much greater effort than most to be in touch with the climate of opinion in business and in the economy generally. Their forecasts are coloured inevitably to some extent by the prevailing mood.</P>
      <P>The expectation in many quarters that there would be a harsh budget no doubt is part of the reason why outside forecasters were less sanguine about the prospects for 1979 than I am.  Those expectations were well off the mark.  As I say, our forecasts for 1979 were prepared in full knowledge of what the budget actually contained and, to that extent, they are more reliable.</P>
      <P>The Government's targets for the economy in 1979 are realistic and achievable.  We have the labour reserves required to achieve fast growth, and we are doing all we can through the largest training effort ever to fully realise that potential.  We also have the manufacturing capacity.  I have already referred to the substantial increase in capacity stemming from investment in 1978.  This is borne out to a great extent by the January monthly industrial survey produced jointly by the CII and ESRI.  I picked the January one because it was before the budget and indicated what the situation was then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> They found that capacity utilisation in manufacturing industry was 66 per cent. That is far from being excessive.  They also found that business intended and expected to be able to mobilise this capacity.  The survey points out that in the months ahead the general level of activity was expected to improve and that production, exports, home sales and employment were all forecast to increase. As I said, this was before the budget.</P>
    <P>The budget has strengthened the climate of business confidence since then.  That is borne out by a survey carried out by &ldquo;Business and Finance&rdquo;.  A key finding in that survey was:</P>
    <P>...in terms of the perceived effect of the Budget on the national economic scene, the results indicate that there is considerable optimism by leading businessmen about prospects for industrial output, the investment climate and exports.  Certainly the optimists largely outweighed the pessimists on all these key economic factors.</P>
    <P>The survey went on to show:</P>
    <P>...probably most encouraging of all ... 75 per cent of these influential businessmen believed that the level of employment would be stimulated by the budget.  To sum up we have the labour, the industrial capacity and the spirit of business confidence required to attain the Government's growth and employment objectives this year.</P>
    <P>As well as attacking the Government's economic targets, Deputy FitzGerald went on to refer to the budget estimate of income tax receipts.  He is reported at column 778 of the Official Report of 8 February 1979 as follows:</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that this figure has been grossly inflated and once again it has been inflated by an amount beyond the tolerable margin of optimism or pessimism which a government may show in putting figures into the budget statement. There is a certain margin within which there can be legitimate disagreement and legitimate argument, but that figure goes beyond what is legitimate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> It is not an honest figure for revenue buoyancy.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald is reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> to have said that at a press briefing the following day, that is 9 February 1979, civil servants could have agreed to the revenue buoyancy figures because of a permissible margin of optimism. In other words, what was, to quote Deputy FitzGerald, beyond the tolerable margin of optimism or pessimism one day, by the following day apparently had become a permissible margin of optimism.  I wonder would Deputy FitzGerald care to explain that? I have already asked him publicly on a number of occasions to do it and he has not done it.  I would gladly yield to him for a moment if he would explain to us how within a space of one day what had been beyond a tolerable margin of optimism or pessimism became a permissible margin.  Would deputy FitgGerald care to explain that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Income.  In his speech the Minister said that an increase in unit wage costs in Ireland could be kept within such a figure&mdash;having cited the figure in EEC countries as 6 per cent &mdash;only if further increases this year were small.  He added that the increase in average earnings per worker in 1978 worked out at over 16 per cent and incomes clearly should not continue to grow in 1979 at the rate set in 1978. These two statements, as I endeavoured to make clear&mdash;I am sorry if I did not make it clear to the Minister's satisfaction&mdash;are incompatible with the <Col N="688" /> buoyancy estimate which implied an increase in incomes far beyond the level indicated by the Minister in the income section of his speech.  It is the incompatibility of the two sections of his speech and the lack of honesty as between the two which I have criticised.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy FitzGerald for that alleged explanation. Now, may I give him the facts?  The quotation I gave from what he said on 8 February 1979 in this House did not refer to income.  I will quote the whole paragraph now for the Deputy's benefit, as reported at column 778 of the Official Report of 8 February 1979:</P>
      <P>I note in passing that Ken O'Brien in <i>The Irish Times</i> today said that the income tax buoyancy figure is £50 million too high.</P>
      <P>Note that: the income tax buoyancy figure, not the income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the paragraph:</P>
      <P>Other economists have put it at £60 million.  There is no doubt whatever that this figure has been grossly inflated and once again it has been inflated by an amount beyond the tolerable margin of optimism or pessimism which a Government may show in putting figures into the budget statement.  There is a certain margin within which there can be legitimate disagreement and legitimate argument, but that figure goes beyond what is legitimate.  It is not an honest figure for revenue buoyancy.</P>
      <P>The figure referred to repeatedly by the deputy in that paragraph is, to quote his own statement, the income tax buoyancy figure.  That is what the Deputy was talking about.</P>

      <P>All right, the Deputy must wait his turn.  We have already dealt with one distortion&mdash;I am using a kind word&mdash;from Deputy FitzGerald. At least I have dealt with two, but that was the more blatant.  It is not all, because Deputy FitzGerald was reported also in the <i>Irish Independent</i> for the same press briefing on 9 February in respect of that as saying that the calculation of income tax receipts was difficult because of taxpayers moving between the various bands, and that he was being cautious, given the difficulty of making the calculations.  I have no fault whatever to find with that statement.  It is perfectly reasonable, but let us contrast it with what he said the day before. He said, &ldquo;There is no doubt whatever that this figure&mdash;&rdquo; the figure being the figure for income tax buoyancy&mdash;&ldquo;has been grossly inflated by an amount&rdquo; and so on.  The following day Deputy FitzGerald was talking about the difficulty of calculations because of people moving between the various tax bands and he had to be cautious, given the difficulty of making the calculations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy listen? He has told enough lies in this House. Deputy FitzGerald one day said that <Col N="692" /> these figures were undoubtedly distorted and false and the next day he said they were difficult to calculate.  I want to tell him something about them which I think he overlooked.  First of all, with regard to the PAYE receipts, there are special factors which will increase the 1979 receipts.  For example, there is the termination of remission for the public service on transition to the PAYE system which is operating this year.  Secondly, there is the application of PAYE to share fishermen and discontinuance of tax relief on social welfare contributions. That is being given instead by a reduction of the rate of contribution but it affects the PAYE receipts.  In the non-PAYE area, tax on farming profits was unduly low in 1978 because of the change in the date of payment of this tax, but 1979 receipts are expected to double the 1978 receipts.  Other Schedule D receipts rose very little in 1978, by less than 3 per cent.  These receipts tend to fluctuate and it is expected that this year some of the apparent shortfall in 1978 receipts will be made up, together with a substantial further increase in receipts in the light of the significant increase in profits and professional earnings in 1977 and 1978, and in the light of the tax evasion measures announced in the budget. Apart from this special factors, which together make a big difference to the overall total of receipts in 1979&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>How much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I indicated clearly in my budget speech that the tax revenue estimates assume firstly a continuation of the buoyant position of 1978, secondly a 6.5 per cent growth rate for the economy, and thirdly, additional buoyancy that will be generated by the budgetary adjustment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What increase in earnings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's estimate takes account of a 25,000 increase in employment, and this is much higher than outside forecasts, but the <Col N="693" /> same applied in 1978 when the Government's achievements in regard to employment confounded the most sceptical commentators who earlier were saying that it could not be done.  In addition, the Government's estimates for revenue buoyancy take account of the stimulus of growth resulting from this total budget package.  I mentioned this in the budget statement.  As outsiders, including Deputy FitzGerald, were not privy to all the budget's details, they could not have taken this into account.</P>
      <P>In addition, the revenue buoyancy estimates for 1978 fell far short of the actual outturn because there was a significant change in trend during the year compared with the previous year.  The elasticity of tax yield with respect to GNP shifted significantly upwards; that is, the percentage increase in tax yields adjusted for changes in tax rates in relation to the percentage increases in GNP was much higher than in previous years.</P>
      <P>All of these factors have to be taken into account and there are others but I am not going to waste the time of the House in going into all of them.  I merely demonstrate how much was left out of his calculations by Deputy FitzGerald when he came in here and made his baseless and reckless charges.  I regard the Revenue estimates given in my budget as perfectly resonable.  Indeed, the ESRI forecast for total revenue in 1979 set out in their December commentary is very much the same as that of the Government.</P>

I am merely saying that for a man who was a party to that to come in here and to say what he said about the figure this year is, in my view, indefensible.

      <P>How Deputy Barry or any of his colleagues can suggest that to say that is the same thing as to say 5 per cent inflation for the year passes my comprehension.  Obviously if you are saying that the inflation rate for the year is 5 per cent, that is what you say.  But if you say: 5 per cent end year, whatever you mean you mean something different from 5 per cent for the year.  That is obvious. How can anybody suggest, as Deputies opposite are now trying to suggest, that we said it was 5 per cent for the year?  We said no such thing and Deputies know we did not say it.</P>

      <P>As far as moderation in pay increases is concerned a number of Deputies, not least Deputy FitzGerald, said that the Government seemed to have given up all hope of negotiating a rational and reasonable incomes agreement for this year but nothing could be further from the truth.  The Government are committed to securing moderation in incomes development and my budget bears ample witness to this.  Deputy FitzGerald also said that the Government expect, and are encouraging, a substantial increase in public service pay later in the year on top of the 2 per cent second phase in the current national agreement.  That statement is totally without foundation as should have been clear to anybody from the relevant part of my budget speech.  We have been told that the increases in personal income tax allowances in the budget are too small to secure moderation in pay and Deputy FitzGerald said that the concessions I announced are insufficient to be of real assistance in income determination. Deputy Barry spoke of a failure to introduce a budget which would assist in achieving moderate wage claims this year and Deputy O'Leary said that the budget failed the test of whether it would improve industrial relations.  From those comments one would think I had introduced savage direct tax increases in the budget instead of granting reliefs.  Of course, this is understandable coming from people with the record of those opposite.</P>
      <P>I did all I could to pave the way towards moderate pay increases.  It will be recalled that as well as the tax reliefs I provided substantial increases in social welfare benefits, a new system of pay-related social welfare payments which will help the lower paid and a new arrangement for health contributions and entitlements to services will make our health services much more egalitarian. The emphasis given to job creation in the budget continues to be unusually strong.  Those steps are not only desirable in themselves but are in the direction in which the trade unions have favoured.  They ought, therefore, to weigh in their members' minds when they form their attitude to pay developments this year.</P>

    <P>The proposals from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which were put forward some time ago are now being examined by working parties.  It will be recalled that the Taoiseach, as far back as last January, called for a national understanding in regard to the whole range of economic activity here. As far as we are concerned the proposals from Congress are matters of considerable importance and interest.  As the House is aware, they are being examined by working parties following discussions between ICTU representatives, on the one hand, and the Taoiseach, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and myself on the other. The Minister for Economic Planning and Development has stated that the Government are encouraged by the positive attitude towards discussions and understanding adopted by ICTU in the statement they issued.  It is clear that there is broad agreement between Government objectives and those set out in the ICTU statement; for example, the aims of full employment and of full sharing of the growing national income with <Col N="703" /> the underprivileged.  The Government look forward to a constructive outcome from these discussions with the ICTU.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that at the same time there are discussions going on with employers and the farming organisations. I hope the outcome of all these discussions will be very close to what the Taoiseach called for as far back as January, a national understanding on how we go forward, where we are aiming and where we are to put the emphasis.  In achieving any aims there has to be certain priorities.  If we can reach a national understanding on the priority areas and what has to wait somewhat longer we can achieved in relation to employment, inflation and the development of our social services in the broadest sense.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be too difficult about remarks made by Deputy FitzGerald in the course of the debate but he made so many unfounded statements that it is difficult to avoid them.  I must return to another statement he made.</P>

      <P>With all the statements made by Deputy FitzGerald it is hard to know where to start.  According to the Official Report for 8 February 1979, column 772-774, Deputy FitzGerald referred to a traumatic change round in the relationship between exports and imports last year.  He also referred to that at columns 825 and 846.  I was puzzled by the suggestions made by Deputy FitzGerald that there had been some fundamental turn-round in our external trade performance last year.  He thought there was a significant speed-up in the growth rate of imports in the second half of the year while export growth was slow.  The growth in import volume in the two halves of 1978, compared with the corresponding periods of the previous year, show little change.  In the first half of the year imports grew by almost 13 per cent in volume while they increased by about 14½per cent in the second half.  More important, however, if <Col N="704" /> one examines the quarterly rates of growth in imports one will see that there was a slowing in the second half of the year in imports.</P>
      <P>The largest rise in import volume last year was that of 21 per cent in the second quarter over the same months of 1977.  In the third and final quarters the rate of increase in import volume slowed to 15 per cent and 14 per cent respectively. Furthermore, as I imagine the Deputy is aware, the fastest growing category of imports last year was the capital goods group, reflecting the buoyancy of investment activity.  This category, together with imports of materials for further production, accounted for about 70 per cent of the total increase in imports in 1978.</P>
      <P>Export growth slowed in the second half of 1978.  Much of this was due to a small rise in agricultural exports, which had been exceptionally buoyant in the early part of the year.  There was something of a temporary pause in the growth of industrial exports in the third quarter but they gathered strength again in the last quarter of the year, being 13½ per cent up in volume over the final quarter of 1977.  It is obvious that there was not, as the Deputy alleged, a traumatic change in the relationship between exports and imports last year. As far as the balance of payments is concerned, developments last year were quite favourable.  The balance of payments deficit recorded only a marginal increase from £120 million in 1977 to about £150 million in 1978 while our external reserves rose to the record figure of £1,252 million.  This was a much better performance than anyone had anticipated.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I must come again to some further statements by Deputy FitzGerald about growth.  When speaking in the Dáil on 8 February, as reported in the Official Report, volume 311, column 761, he correctly quoted the Central Bank winter bulletin as follows:</P>
      <P>There is some evidence that the economy reached a plateau at mid-1978; in other words, there may have been a pause in growth in the second half of 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> and later &ldquo;the outlook for 1979 appears to be somewhat less favourable&rdquo;.  He then went on to say that the real world is one in which:</P>
    <P>the Central Bank tells us that growth has been declining since the middle of last year and that in fact the short-lived consumption boom which Fianna Fáil imposed on top of the solidly based growth achieved by the National Coalition...came to a sudden sharp end within a year of their coming into office.  The economy is sliding down a slippery slope of declining growth.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald has, to put it no stronger, put a misleading gloss on the Central Bank's words.  The Bank's commentary is put in carefully guarded language.  They say that the economy may have reached a plateau, Deputy FitzGerald's gloss on it is quite different. &ldquo;The outlook for 1979 appears to be&rdquo; is what the Bank said but Deputy FitzGerald talks about the economy sliding down the slippery slope of declining growth.  Deputy FitzGerald said that statements from the bank cannot be made before the budget quite as bluntly as at other times.  The reason is that the data on which the tentative judgements were made by the bank are partial, they are not up to date and they are open to different interpretations.  They had to make this some months before.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald knows that growth never proceeds at a uniform or straight line rate through each year. Sometimes it is above trend and sometimes it is below it.  In the first half of 1978 it was well above trend because of Government policy to give a sharp upward lift to the economy.  It levelled off in the third quarter and it then took off again in the fourth quarter.  If the Deputy has any doubt about that I can give him a few figures which I believe will confirm that what I have said is correct.</P>

In one case he actually got up and half apologised.  Would he learn from that and not deny what he said.  Let him keep his head down or have the guts to acknowledge that he was wrong.  Let him have the manliness to acknowledge that he came into the House and made unfounded allegations. The following day, recognising the possible consequences, not in relation to me but in relation to civil servants and others, he ran to the press and tried to take back what he said.  At the same time, for political purposes, he pretended he did not.  Would the Deputy have the manliness to get up and say that we will forget the whole thing?  If not let him not be trying to cover up once more when he is being quoted fairly in relation to what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the volume year on year percentage increase in retail sales, we have figures for various months.  The latest one I have here is for October and it bears out the point I was making. September was 7.7 and October was 8.3 per cent.  Imports of producer capital goods in September were 23.6 per cent, <Col N="707" /> October 47.7 per cent.  Cement sales in September were 11.4 per cent, October 11.9, November 19.1 and December 19.8 per cent.  Industrial exports were 14.7 per cent in September and 21.4 per cent in October.  Industrial production, unadjusted, in September were 8.7 per cent and in October 9.2 per cent.</P>

I will make the Deputy a present of a little bit of information which he may not have.  There is a strange phenomenon about this.  For each of the last three years the figures in the third quarter showed a drop.  There may be some statistical reason for this.  The fact is that anybody who says, as the Deputy did, that we had the boom in the first half of 1978 and then things dropped is not speaking in accordance with the facts. That is the point I am trying to establish for the Deputy's information.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is found out. Let him not try to cover up.  I will tell him something else he said which is more of the nonsense which we have to put up with from time to time from the Deputy.  He said in the Dáil on 8 February last that they, meaning the Government, have reversed the upturn in economic growth which the National Coalition Government had achieved to almost 6 per cent in 1977 and succeeded within 18 months in pushing it down towards 4 per cent in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald earlier in his speech said that the growth in 1977 was <Col N="708" /> 5¾ per cent.  The official figure is 5½ per cent.  Both of them, Deputy FitzGerald's earlier figure or the official figure, are below this 6 per cent which it suddenly became when Deputy FitzGerald was trying to make that point.  Furthermore, he conveniently ignores the fact that about 1 per cent of this growth in 1977 was attributable to the change of Government and the policies of that Government in mid-1977.  All outside forecasters revised their growth rates between the second and third quarters of 1977 by this amount, 1 per cent.  The Deputy omitted that in his claim for the Coalition's alleged performance.  The official figure for 1978 is about 7 per cent.  The Central Bank figure is 5¾ per cent and the ESRI figure is 6¼ per cent. But whatever basis is taken there is an increase in the growth rate on 1977, not a reversal.  Even if Deputy FitzGerald's figure of 5¾ per cent in 1977 were adopted together with the lowest figure for 1978, there would not be a reversal of growth.  Deputy FitzGerald's statement in that regard is also untrue and unfounded.  I did not misquote him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a simple quotation from the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can keep hiding behind anyone he likes but he is struck with his own words.  He uttered them in this House in a careful and calculated manner intending to damage not just this Government&mdash;that would be reasonable enough within the political rules&mdash;but the Deputy was reckless and did not care what damage he did to the country internally or externally.  If anybody outside the country believed for a minute that there was any substance in the allegations the Deputy made, that the books were cooked and that the figures were falsified and distored, they would not deal with the country for one minute and the Deputy knows that.  He actually adverted to that in his speech. He made the statements but the following day he ran away from them.  He has had long enough to explain but he has not been man enough to explain the running away the next day or justifying what he said the first day.  It was a disgraceful performance by the Deputy and <Col N="709" /> it is one that I trust those who are interested in these matters will have noted carefully.</P>
      <P>I also find it difficult to understand what fiscal policy Deputy FitzGerald thinks would be appropriate this year. When speaking in this House on 8 February he said:</P>
      <P>The Government have created a budget that bears no relation to our economic needs.  It is a budget for emigration, nothing less.</P>
      <P>At another point he said:</P>
      <P>What has this budget done to boost our economy again, to get growth up from the 4 per cent to which it is now moving to the kind of figure that would yield a continued growth in employment and a further fall in unemployment?</P>
      <P>Later he said:</P>
      <P>The budget's main contribution to changing the economic situation lies in its impact on inflation, not on growth.</P>
      <P>He said also that action must be taken designed to moderate the unfavourable trend in exports and imports and in the balance of payments which the Deputy thought existed.  Of course it did not.</P>
      <P>The first two comments seemed to call for a more expansionary budget.  Of course they ignored the job-creation content of the budget.  What does the Deputy mean by his comment that action must be taken designed to moderate the unfavourable trend in exports and imports and so on?  Is the Deputy calling for a deflationary budget?  In an interview with <i>The Irish Times</i> on 10 February the Deputy is reported as saying:</P>
      <P>The measures introduced last week are on the deflationary side.  I suspect they will borrow more and, therefore, I would not over-stress the deflationary aspect.  We may well end up with a neutral budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the effect of the discretionary budget changes will be to add about 1½ per cent growth.  Secondly, how can a budget be described as deflationary when the borrowing requirement remains <Col N="710" /> at the level of 10½ per cent of GNP which is very high by international standards, when the volume of both current and capital expenditure is being increased and when additional taxation is modest?  The 1978 Budget was markedly expansionary because conditions warranted that, but since it succeeded it is not necessary that this budget should be quite as expansionary.  To describe this change in the scale of expansionary input as deflationary is a distortion. Deflationary budgets are introduced by Governments who wish to dampen down economic activity because some constraint has arisen or because inflation is becoming excessive.  At present inflation is not the major problem and there are no pressing constraints.  Furthermore, the policy of this Government is not to dampen down economic activity; rather it is to maintain growth at a near record level.  Therefore, the circumstances in which we find ourselves and Government policy do not call for deflationary action and the budget reflects this.</P>
    <P>In arguing that the budget is deflationary, is Deputy FitzGerald prepared to follow the logic of that argument and say that the borrowing requirement should be held at 13 per cent of GNP or even increased?  It would be interesting to hear the Deputy's views and no doubt we will hear them at some time.  He is fond of quoting independent economic commentators.  I should like to quote an independent economist, Dr. Kennedy of UCD, who wrote the following in <i>The Sunday Press</i> on 11 February:</P>
    <P>A number of economic commentators have suggested that the budget is deflationary simply because the borrowing requirement is reduced. This is simplistic and untrue.</P>
    <P>Later on she states:</P>
    <P>In so far as the borrowing requirement does affect the level of activity in a small open economy like Ireland, the composition of the expenditure for which the borrowing is undertaken is crucial.  Borrowing to finance public sector pay increases may simply mean more imports of consumer <Col N="711" /> goods while borrowing for increased house building, for example, may directly generate more employment.</P>
    <P>Of course Deputy FitzGerald is aware of the substantially increased expenditure provided for this year in the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>There has been some reference to emigration.  The Opposition have attempted to suggest that the unemployment figures are explained by massive emigration this year.  There have also been references to the absence of net passenger movement figures to enable an assessment of emigration trends to be made.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, in reply to a question in the Dáil on 20 February about air passenger movement figures, pointed out that because of an industrial dispute in Aer Lingus in March-April 1978 there was a delay in publishing net air passenger movement figures since February.  He also said there was a further difficulty in this regard because of staffing problems at airports and that the backlog was only now being cleared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Net passenger movement figures must be adjusted to take account of the relationship between net passenger movement figures and the level of emigration in the last inter-censal period, which was 1966-1971.  On this basis of calculation the estimated level of emigration for the 12 months period to April 1978 was 7,000.  Even if net passenger movement figures were available up to October last, as in the case of the net sea passenger figures, this would still be less than adequate for the purpose of calculating last year's emigration because of the need of a 12-month period which is not affected by tourist traffic flows.  The 12 months ending February is the best period to use for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would you expect it? Look what is happening to law and order.  Deputy Murphy, as reported on 15 February at column 1290 of the Official Report, said:</P>
      <P>We now borrow around £800 million a year, mostly from abroad.</P>
      <P>As I said at budget time the 1978 Exchequer borrowing requirement was £810 million, or 12.9 per cent of GNP.  The temporary increase in Exchequer borrowing which took place in 1978 was a necessary part of our strategy to boost growth, to increase employment and to reduce inflation.  In line with this policy Exchequer borrowing will be reduced to 10½ per cent of GNP this year and the reduction will continue in 1980.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy is mistaken if he is implying that most of the Exchequer's borrowing came from external sources in 1978, or indeed that it is the Government's intention to maximise foreign borrowing in 1979.  Of the £810 million borrowed by the Exchequer in 1978, only £23 million, or less than 3 per cent, consisted of foreign loans denominated in foreign currencies.  In 1978 this direct Exchequer foreign borrowing was in fact at its lowest level since 1972-1973.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely coincidental that the massive foreign borrowing happened during the years when Deputy <Col N="714" /> Murphy's party and Deputy FitzGerald's party were in government. You will note that I said that last year it was down to the lowest level it has been since 1972-73.  I hope the significane of that did not pass over Deputy Murphy's head.</P>
      <P>During 1978 in the region of £300 million of the money received from the sales of Government securities came from non-residents.  The indications are that a considerable proportion of this inflow may have arisen from the external insurance companies and pension funds covering their Irish liabilities with assets denominated in Irish pounds in anticipation of our joining the EMS.  There is also some evidence that a proportion of this inflow was speculative and while this was not actively sought by the Government, nevertheless it demonstrates the confidence foreign investors have in the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>There are many other points I should deal with, and one or two were raised by Deputy P. Barry this evening to which I wanted to refer.  The first was in regard to the PAYE situation and the post office dispute.  In accordance with their usual practice at the commencement of every tax year, the Revenue Commissioners will shortly be putting advertisements in the daily newspapers dealing with the question of how employers will deduct tax after 6 April, if they have not received tax free allowance certificates because of the post office industrial dispute. They will be asking for the co-operation of the public in dealing with the PAYE deductions by continuing the tax-free allowances now current.  Any over-deduction resulting from the procedure will be dealt with on the cessation of the industrial dispute while the cumulative system of PAYE, which has the effect of reviewing on each pay day the total liability to date&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have had an interesting budget debate, interesting from a number of points of view.  It was very revealing, first of all, of the degree of political desperation that Deputy FitzGerald is understandably suffering from.  There is no other explanation I can think of for his attitude and for what he did in his contribution to the budget debate.  His performance this evening simply highlights the appalling nature of what was done by him as Leader of the main Opposition party.  However, I will not pursue that matter, I am merely commenting on it in the political sense, that it illustrates the sense of desperation which he understandably suffers from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the public's point of view, one of the most interesting aspects of this <Col N="716" /> debate has been the virtual absence of any contribution from the other side of the House of any constructive or alternative proposals.  It is hard to blame Opposition Deputies for this.  After all, people still remember, and will go on remembering for a long time yet, what these men did when they were in government. Any alternative proposal they put forward is going to be measured in the public mind against the performance of these men when they have a chance to do something about it, whether it relates to PAYE, to jobs or both.  I think that is very significant.  I hardly ever hear a Fine Gael or Labour Deputy express any view about how we should be getting more jobs.  I just hear them cribbing about what we are doing or saying the figures are not right.  Does anybody ever hear anything constructive about how we should be getting more jobs.</P>

You need to have a coherent policy that works.  Whatever defects there may be in our policies&mdash;we are not supermen but we are getting the results&mdash;the message is that there is no alternative from the other side of the House.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann&mdash;</P>
    <P>Aware that the Government's income taxation policies have resulted in wage and salary earners contributing 87% of income taxation;</P>
    <P>Aware that the returns from income tax will increase by one third in this year;</P>
    <P>Aware that the abolition of the Wealth Tax by the Government, together with the virtual abolition of the Capital Gains Tax and the Capital Acquisitions Tax by the Government have caused further inequality in the system;</P>
    <P>Aware that the process of abolishing the food subsidies has increased inflation and added to the injustices of the taxation system; and</P>
    <P>Noting that these regressive policies have resulted in massive demonstrations and work stoppages throughout the country by tens of thousands of wage and salary earners in recent weeks;</P>
    <P>Calls on the Government to&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  provide substantial relief in the Finance Bill 1979 to the PAYE sector,</P>
    <P>(ii)  radically reform the present system of income taxation,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying last night that the Government's amendment does not commend itself to the House because of the many fallacies in its wording.  For instance, it states:</P>
      <P>takes note of the Government's active and continuing concern for equity in the tax system as evidenced in the Government's actions to date including action to increase substantially the personal tax allowances, raise significantly the farming sector's contribution to the cost of public services and strengthen considerably the campaign against tax evasion,</P>
      <P>During the concluding debate on the budget I asked the Minister for Finance to tell us if the acceptable farmers' tax system to be introduced on 1 May would yield the equivalent of the 2 per cent levy. I did not get an answer to that, and that is significant.  Perhaps the Minister's speech last night was badly worded.  I am beginning to wonder, therefore, if the farmers should not sit up and take notice because it seems that the 2 per cent levy proposed in the budget is what they will have to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course the people do not believe in Fianna Fáil's professed concern about the taxpayers, and they have demonstrated this by their activities in the streets.  The fact is that Fianna Fáil's tax gathering leopard has not changed its spots during the years.  In the 16 years before the National Coalition took office only once did Fianna Fáil change the level of taxation, but during those <Col N="721" /> years the number of taxpayers they sucked into the tax net increased from 175,000 to almost 250,000, the number we now have.  Fianna Fáil's attitude to the taxpayer always has been to get more and more people into the net, even those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the number of surtax payers dropped during the years when Fianna Fáil were in office.  There were far fewer surtax payers in 1973 than there were 15 or 16 years before.  Fianna Fáil introduced turnover tax and they applied it to food and clothing.  When we assumed office we realised immediately that taxpayers in the lower levels of income would benefit directly by the removal of VAT from food and clothing&mdash;we removed food for the specific purpose of ensuring a national wage agreement at a time when inflation was running high.  This Government removed the subsidies at a time when euphoria was running high during the new year holiday weekend, when they thought its effect would remain hidden. Immediately the Dáil resumed after Christmas, the Labour Party sought a debate on the subsidies but it was not allowed until 13 March.  I do not know if the debate was deliberately arranged to take place 48 hours before the figures were available to the general public or whether that was pure coincidence, but it is suspicious that the figures that would shatter the Government's defence of the removal of foods subsidies came out 48 hours after the debate on food subsidies was held.</P>
    <P>The Government's contribution to the debate on the food subsidies was to the effect that subsidies were only desirable when inflation was in double figures but that when it began to move towards single figures the subsidy should be removed.  The Minister made this point, giving the impression that inflation was moving towards single figures.  In the three months between mid-November of last year and mid-February of this year the price of food increased by 7.2 per cent and for the 12 months it increased by 17.9 per cent.  Last week the Minister for Economic Planning and Development admitted that the inflation figure of 10.8 per cent for the 12 months ending <Col N="722" /> mid-February would probably be higher in mid-May.</P>
    <P>I gathered from reading last week's debates that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development appeared to say that the 5 per cent end of the year inflation figure produced by the Government was arrived at by reckoning; it was no more precise than that.  By taking the 1.25 per cent inflation figure from mid-August to mid-November and quadrupling it they arrived at a figure of 5 per cent.  Using the same basis of calculation between mid-November 1978 and mid-February 1979 the figure would be 28.8 per cent.  If that is so, how is the removal of the food subsidies justified?  We have the removal of the food subsidies combined with the very obvious dissatisfaction of the PAYE worker with the relief he is alleged to have got in the budget.  Is it any wonder that the Government are faced with a tax revolt which is extremely dangerous for the country?</P>
    <P>There is no point in economic Ministers talking about the disciplines under EMS.  Whether there is EMS or not, disciplines are necessary.  The Government have not the moral authority to get that discipline when they appear to allow themselves to be pushed off any taxation problem they have.  The obvious example of that is the levy on farmers which was dismantled and rethought, evidently as a result, of pressures from a section of the farming community. The Minister did not say one way or the other when I asked him about it.  Another apparent example is the proposal that those who were getting a favourable rate of tax because of the positions they held would now be taxed. I asked the Minister earlier if this was being rethought as was the levy, but the Minister did not answer.  He said something to the effect that he had received a number of representations and that proposals in this regard will be contained in the Finance Bill.  The precise position is that the farmers were not told that they could write their own tax, but the impression was deliberately allowed by the Government to be created, to reduce the level of irritation of the farmers throughout the country. The impression was created that they would be able to write their own tax and <Col N="723" /> that, if it was acceptable, it would be implemented. That appeared to be the clever thing to do at the end of February, even if the document made it plain that the Government would introduce the tax.  However, it provoked a backlash.  The very night that the Government allowed this impression to get about it was pointed out that the PAYE people would not wear that&mdash;that any one section would be given the right to determine their type of tax and what amount they could pay.  It is against this background that the Government are in a very weak position to talk to unions and employers about the type of wage agreement we need.</P>

      <P>Since Deputy Barry has touched on a number of important points not directly related to the motion before us, I will deal with them while they are fresh in my mind.  The Deputy referred to trends in inflation and to food subsidies.  It is rather typical of the contributions to this debate so far.  Apparently the Opposition parties are so conscious of their awful record in this area of tax reform that they are quite happy to drag in any topic under the sun except taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to inflation we made our statements about the removal of the subsidies. There was a debate a fortnight ago on that topic, so there is no need to go over all that again.  The essential point made was that it is wrong to seek to pass any judgment on the merits or demerits of one action taken in isolation. If one wants to argue about what has happened to the position of various groups, people on various income levels or in various family sizes and so on, one <Col N="724" /> would need to look not alone at the change in the food subsidies but at the other changes that were part of the package associated with this year's development, namely, the improvement in social welfare, in children's allowances and so forth.  The overall set of changes was designed to bring about a more effective use of the moneys available to the Government.</P>
    <P>On the question of inflation, the reason for emphasising that the 5 per cent inflation target is attainable in the later months of this year is that we do not want people to assume that, just because we have suffered a temporary increase in inflation for one or two quarters, it must necessarily continue to be the pattern.  That was the type of defeatist mentality we associated with the Coalition days.  They seemed to assume massive inflation was some external event over which they had no control, and that the only thing they could do, the only course open to the Irish people, was to spend their time in lamentation and weeping and gnashing of teeth. As the eloquent words of the former Minister for Finance has it, Ireland was like a cork being tossed about on the international sea of inflation.</P>
    <P>We have consistently rejected that defeatist mentality and approach.  We have argued that, while undoubtedly there are external events over which we have no direct control, nevertheless a very substantial portion of what happens by way of price increases and other cost trends is within our own shpere of discreation, and can be influenced by what action we take ourselves, and what action is taken on our behalf by various groups in the community.  The purpose of the inflation target is to demonstrate that, by the pursuit of the appropriate policies, we can put an end very quickly to the high inflation which is experienced at present, get back down into single figure increases, not simply by the last quarter of this year but by the third quarter, and maintain that downward trend of inflation right through into 1980 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>It is important to invite people to discuss the manner in which cost and income trends might emerge later this year in a positive way, with the deliberate <Col N="725" /> purpose or aim of achieving that reduction in inflation at the earliest possible date, instead of lapsing back into the helpless dispair which was so characteristic of the Coalition's attitude in that area.  This evening we are not debating inflation as such.  We are here to talk about the question of reform in the taxation system, with particular emphasis on the PAYE aspects of it.</P>
    <P>Since I have taken up the point already in the reference to food subsidies, perhaps I may as well begin by saying that, just as with food subsidies, it would be wrong to pass any judgment in isolation from the other changes made in the budget.  When we are looking at taxation, it is important to look not just at one tax but at the effect of the whole taxation system.  Before we can pass any final judgment on the equity, or fairness, or justice of a particular imposition, we need to ask how the money is being used so that we can establish whether the combined effect of levying taxation on the one hand, and spending that money for various desirable social and economic programmes on the other hand, produces a fair and satisfactory balance for the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise how important it is to look at both sides of the account and not to enter into any hasty judgment based on looking at one tax or even one portion of one tax.  It may be that in some instances the easiest way in which to achieve a sufficient degree of fairness in the operation of the total budgetary system is to balance some imposition of taxation against some offsetting adjustment on the spending or benefit side to make what might appear to be a crude or ineffective tax more equitable.</P>
    <P>I make the general point about the attitude which is appropriate in my view in looking at this whole question.  Coming to the area of taxation, I want to repeat what the Minister for Finance said last night.  We are proud of the progress we have already made in this area of easing the burden of taxation.  The record shows quite clearly that, during the period of Coalition Government, the burden of taxation rose quite sharply from the 40 per cent level of national income which was operating in the last <Col N="726" /> year of Fianna Fáil Government, 1972-73, to the very oppressive figure of 46 per cent of national income in 1977, the last year happily, the Coalition were in office.</P>
    <P>We fought an election and took office committed to a very positive programme for reducing the burden of taxation.  The results of that programme are already quite clear and visible to all.  The effect of those reductions is that, for the current year, the burden of taxation is estimated to fall from 46 per cent to 41 per cent.  In effect, we have already wiped out virtually all of the additional burden imposed during the wasted Coalition years.  That is an important fact to emphasise and to bear in mind when we approach the question of taxation.  Then we can see quite clearly who is serious about the business of reform and who can point to any positive action in this area, and contrast that with the new but in my view hypocritical tears which are being shed for the taxpayers by Deputies on the Opposition benches.  During their period of office it was the taxpayers who were weeping with just cause because of the incredible series of tax impositions levied upon them.</P>
    <P>I have not got time to go into the priorities we set ourselves in this tax area in detail.  It is important to recall that there was a rationale for them and that they were justified.  The major tax reduction we brought about was the abolition of rates on houses.  Over the years, the tax had come to operate quite unfairly and had given rise to quite a number of harsh anomalies.  We had all become aware of circumstances, perhaps through sickness, in which the income in the household was reduced.  Perhaps the husband died and the widow was left with a family, or there were similar harassing circumstances in which rates were still operating as a very difficult additional burden on families whose incomes had been reduced drastically.</P>
    <P>For that reason we felt the priority was to abolish a tax rate which took no account of ability to pay.  In that sense, we are quite happy to endorse the notion that one of the requirements for an acceptable taxation system is that it should take account of people's ability to pay. That is what we are seeking to achieve. <Col N="727" /> The abolition of rates was a major step forward towards the achievement of that result in the operation of the taxation system.</P>
    <P>Another tax reduction which is frequently referred to in derogatory terms by the Opposition, but which it is important to stress because of its other characteristics, was the removal of car taxation on smaller horse-powered vehicles. The cost of transport had risen very rapidly in Ireland during the Coalition's years in office.  This had been associated with very substantial increases not only in the annual taxation on the vehicle itself but also in petrol duty.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the increase in taxation.  If the Deputy wants to fall back on the threadbare alibi that it was all the fault of the Arabs and that they shoved up the price of petrol, the record shows quite clearly that the Coalition Government increased the price of petrol far more by their taxation increases than the combined efforts of Sheik Yamani and all his colleagues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>We fully recognise and know we are in a period when there are likely to be increases in the price of oil and petroleum products. They will be price increases over which we will have no control, in contrast with the price increases which the parties opposite deliberately, as a matter of policy, inflicted on the Irish people.  It gave rise to that farcical piece of economic analysis from Deputy R. Ryan when he tried to inform us on one brilliant occasion that the reason he had upped the <Col N="728" /> tax on petrol so much was that people from Northern Ireland were coming over the Border and buying our cheaper. petrol and this was bad for the economy. If ever there was a classical example of a man demonstrating his incompetence and inability to operate successfully in the office he held, that was it.</P>
      <P>I make the point to emphasise that there was a <i>rationale</i> for reducing that burden of taxation.  Outside the major cities and towns many people must rely on their own transport for essential uses such as getting to and from work.  For many years the irony was that one of Deputy O'Leary's colleagues was consistently emphasising the need to take account of transport costs for rural workers.  All they did during their period in office was to take account of them all right, and to worsen them.  We then were making the point that if essential mileage was necessary for getting to and from work and so forth, it was better on balance to lower the basic cost of this essential mileage by lowering the cost of having and operating a vehicle and to leave the taxation on the petrol itself.  The better of the two approaches was the option of reducing the overall burden of taxation on private transport.  There was a very important <i>rationale</i> and it is associated with trying to hold down the costs of industry, especially in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those were two of the tax changes that were made.  Opposition Deputies are also unusually at great pains to emphasise concessions made to wealthy groups by the abolition of the wealth tax.  Another very important change is the switch-over to pay-related social insurance contributions. Up to this year a system of flat rate contributions operated which meant that a typical worker paid something like £3 a week in social welfare contributions. As a first step after the election, we reduced that by £1 a week for workers with pay levels of £50 a week or less in an attempt to adjust this contribution so that it reflected somewhat people's ability to pay.  Within the next few days we will be switching over to a full pay-related system so that workers with smaller pay packets will find that their contribution is reduced, and the contribution expected from all workers will be geared to the income which they enjoy. <Col N="729" /> This is a very positive benefit and represents another very important step on the road towards gearing the taxation system towards ability to pay.</P>
    <P>Two major tax changes which meet this requirement and take account of ability to pay are the abolition of rates and this switch-over to a pay-related social insurance scheme.  I mention those because there is a tendency on the other side of the House to behave as though these have not happened.  I mention them also to demonstrate that there has been a distinct lack of any statement at any time from either Opposition party as to their priorities in this area of taxation change.  If they think that our priorites are wrong or misguided and that they have a programme which would be superior in bringing about desirable tax changes, let us see their programme.  I have heard all their waffle, claptrap and humbug but I have never heard a succinct, clear statement from either party on the opposite side of the House as to the tax changes they would wish to see brought about.  From the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; we have had the courage of our convictions and have not been afraid to say exactly what we wanted to do and we have gone ahead and done it, which is more to the point.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the area of income tax itself and the PAYE system.  Yes, we recognised that there was need for change in that area also, and again we were not afraid to state our own priorities clearly.  Our two priorities were, firstly, to seek to improve the basic tax-free allowance as rapidly as possible, because quite clearly this would provide the maximum benefit to the lower paid worker; secondly, to improve the relative position of married taxpayers to take account of the greater needs of married as against single persons.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey's contribution last night was interesting.  He told the House about the sad plight of two pensioners who had called to see him last week and he explained how out of their small incomes they were required to pay income tax.  He quoted the figures and he gave their incomes, which was £21.45 a week. I did a quick calculation and assumed that they must have had some allowances other than their basic tax-free <Col N="730" /> allowance.  On the figures that Deputy Cluskey gave they would have paid £70 tax in the last year of the Coalition Government.  They are paying £30 in the year just ending&mdash;that was the figure he quoted&mdash;and from next year they will pay no tax, because the improvement in the basic allowances which we have introduced will ensure that people with small incomes such as that are not required to pay income tax.  Therefore, in two budgets we have succeeded in wiping out a tax liability of £70 for these pensioners and in making sure they are not required to hand over even a small fraction of their very limited incomes. Ironically, it was typical of the lack of clarity in Opposition thinking that they should seek to make the point of such a case such as that.  We were the ones who objected to the fact that in 1977 a married man was expected to pay income tax if he had the misfortune to earn something over £23 a week.  In two years we have succeeded in altering the situation so that, whereas two years ago a married man started to pay income tax on something just over a quarter of average industrial earnings, this year he can earn £44 before he has any potential liability to income tax.  We are not satisfied with even that progress.  We want to make further improvements as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>Those are our priorities in this area. We have stated them clearly and we are not ashamed of them.  We think they are the right priorities.  I invite anybody who disagrees to state the alternative taxation policy.  All we have had from the Opposition were the usual pious sentiments of hypocrisy rather than any firm commitment.</P>
    <P>I see Deputy M. O'Leary in the House.  I thought it fascinating that he should have the nerve to accompany the marchers last week.  Given his record as part of a Government who have inflicted such burdens on the taxpayers, I would have thought he should count himself lucky that he was not running away from the marchers and out of the country rather than being allowed to walk.  It is a tribute to the tolerance and civilised behaviour of our people that they are able to accommodate such <Col N="731" /> behaviour and to forgive it in such a generous spirit.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again the importance of relating taxation changes to ability to pay.  This brings me to another point overlooked very frequently but which it is vital to stress in these circumstances, that is, that relating taxation to ability to pay does not mean that two people with the same income should necessarily pay the same tax.  If we are to have a genuine regard to ability to pay then we must take account not only of different incomes but also of people's different circumstances.  For instance, we know that we make attempts already in our taxation system to have some regard to the special needs of particular groups.  People like widows are given some additional tax-free allowances to try to take account of the greater demands and burdens placed on them. Similarly, there are special allowances for elderly people because, from the same income, they may have to meet greater outgoings because they are no longer in the position to undertake the same number of services for themselves as might be the case with the younger household.  I could lengthen the list of examples but the basic point is clear: if we genuinely want to achieve a just tax system then it is not only necessary to identify different incomes, it is also necessary to adequately take account of the different circumstances in which people find themselves.</P>
    <P>That is where the really hard work needs to be done.  We are not going to resolve those sort of complex and difficult issues by slogans, by flag waving or rushing off and pretending to have instant solutions to problems which have taxed, in the best sense of the word, the ingenuity and talents of administrators not only in this country but in countries throughout the whole civilised world.  I do not think any country would claim that it had yet devised the perfect tax system.  All of us are modest enough to know that there is continuous scope for improvement and reform.  If we are to bring about improvement we need, first of all, to gear up our economy to produce the fastest possible growth in output because that will give us the <Col N="732" /> financial ability to afford change, then to have a clearly thought-out, sensibly-based series of practical reforms which we can identify and from which we can see positive results over a consistent period of time.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of programme the Government have set themselves.  I have indicated the very substantial start made already in areas such as rates and pay-related social welfare contributions as well as the substantial improvements in the income tax allowances themselves. The actual pace at which further change can be brought about must be geared to the overall growth and development of our economy.  I would suggest that the way in which change and reform can come about is by talking rather than by warping.  In that context it is important to remind the House that the Taoiseach some months ago said that he wanted the various parties, trade unions, employers, farmers and other groups, to come together and discuss the basis on which an understanding could be reached on the kind of action programme to deal with the practical, economic, financial questions at present confronting us.  Such an understanding, of course, would take into account tax arrangements as part, and only as part, of that programme.  We would need to have regard also to the question of arrangements for employment, the way in which incomes and other costs would develop, the manner in which people dependent on social welfare benefits would share in any overall progress.</P>
    <P>It is important also to remind the House that while taxation reform is legitimate and an important area for action in its own right, it is by no means the only area in which we want to see very substantial progress made in the months and years ahead.  We have committed ourselves to a programme designed to ensuring that other less fortunate groups can benefit.  I have referred already to the need for those who must live on social welfare benefits to be given adequate improvements and to have programmes designed catering for their special needs.  In particular we place great emphasis on the importance of a drive to achieve full employment because we know that there are thou <Col N="733" /> sands of our people, especially the young, who would give quite a lot for the good fortune of earning a steady income and being liable to income tax.</P>
    <P>While taxation reform is important in its own right, it has to be related to other equally desirable areas of social progress, forged as part of a programme for national development, setting that programme for taxation reform in this context of an overall programme for national development which can bring positive and lasting benefits to all our people, enabling not just those who are subject to any one form of taxation but those who, through their circumstances, may never be called upon to pay income tax feel also they are part of a society designed to cater for the weak as well as the privileged which has, as its purpose, not just material advancement but also the development of a society in which all of us would be proud to live and work.</P>

      <P>By now it should be clear that the storm of criticism which has arisen amongst PAYE wage and salary earners&mdash;directed against the unfairness of our present taxation system&mdash;will not abate until there is evidence of Government action to remedy the discontent.  That should be evident at this point.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion in the name of the Labour Party is to enable the Government to make that constructive response in the forthcoming Finance Bill by way of affording increased reliefs to PAYE wage and salary earners.  The purpose of this motion is to enable the Government to respond constructively to the criticism, to the demonstrations, the discontent which has spilled over into the streets.  No taxation system can be upheld in a democratic state if a general opinion that its provisions are unjust gains majority acceptance.  Recent events show that the general verdict that our tax system as it applies to the PAYE wage and salary earner is unjust and needs reform has been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regressive nature of our taxation system as a result of government policy has been reinforced over the past 18 months.  The cumulative effect of the actions taken in the last two budgets means that the full weight of the entire <Col N="734" /> Exchequer bill now falls almost exclusively on the shoulders of the average PAYE wage and salary earner.  We now have a very narrow tax base.  The wealth tax has gone, the capital gains tax has been virtually eliminated and any pretence that the very wealthy should pay their way has been abandoned.</P>
    <P>This administration are creating a tax system which requires an ever-increasing contribution from the PAYE wage and salary sector.  It is true that the immediate flashpoint which led to the present unparalleled discontent with the tax system was the partiality of the Government in their treatment of the farmers as this was perceived by the tax paying majority, the PAYE wage and salary earners.  It was that perception of theirs which was the immediate cause of the recent demonstrations.  The general message of the taxation policy of the Government is that the wealthiest, the owners of capital, should go free of tax while wage and salary earners and middle management should pay over the odds.  That is the general tenure of their taxation policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have his opportunity to add his quota of rubbish to the debate.  The overwhelming dissatisfaction with the present taxation system, especially as it bears on the PAYE wage and salary earners, is a fact which will not be waved away by any attacks on the previous administration and the period of economic recession over which it presided.  That is a fact which the Government are called upon to deal with at present.  It is a fact which the Government, or the Dáil, cannot ignore. The general opinion of PAYE earners that they suffer the major rip-off in our tax system is the more firmly held because of what is seen as the relatively fortunate tax circumstances of other sections of the community.  This administration, in the way they have deliberately narrowed the tax base and dismantled other forms of taxation, have wilfully and deliberately deepened divisions in our society and deepened that sense of their disproportionate contribution to <Col N="735" /> the national Exchequer which is so potent a cause of the discontent of PAYE wage and salary earners.</P>
      <P>It is against that background and the failure of the Government to make any serious concessions to the PAYE sector in the last budget that the present groundswell of discontent has arisen. For example, this year a married man without children on a gross income of £70 per week will have £13.42 deducted weekly from his income between tax and social welfare contributions, or 19.2 per cent of his nominal low income.  That is too much.  A married man without children earning £80 per week, which is about the average, will have his gross incomed reduced by 21.2 per cent in the same way.  The position has been reached that the proportion of income tax paid by PAYE wage and salary earners has increased out of all proportion to the rise in wages and salaries.  It is now a fact that the PAYE sector account for nine-tenths of income tax receipts while wages and salaries amount to only two-thirds of the national income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1978 PAYE receipts increased by about £80 million and this year the increase in PAYE, even after the budget reliefs are taken into account, will amount to more than £150 million.  This staggering increase of 30 per cent in a single year will further worsen the already present inequity.  All the elements of a serious urban-rural split are there in the present situation.  Leaders of the PAYE marches, the trade union leaders and others, did their utmost by way of public statements to avoid such an interpretation of recent events.  If, however, this division between urban and rural Ireland has entered the taxation debate, the Government are authors of that division; it is at their door that the blame must rest.  They bypassed Parliament and ignored the Dáil in their deal with the farmer leaders on a new taxation system.  Of that deal the Dáil has no details.  Yesterday I put some questions to the Tánaiste on the likely yield of the discussions and the kind of agreement that was being discussed between the farm leaders and the Government, but there was no information <Col N="736" /> available to me.  I asked the likely date of operation but I did not get any information, nor did I receive any information on the exact amount.  The Tánaiste has earned for himself that wonderful reputation for logic, but he could tell us nothing because there was no agreement.</P>
    <P>The Government are the main authors of any possible rural-urban split.  The demonstrations were provoked by the Government.  Certain members of the administration acted as unofficial cheer leaders and even distanced from this country, in Brussels, could not prevent them fulfilling that role.  If I remember the record correctly, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development was along as a sorcerer's apprentice to the unofficial cheer leader, the Tánaiste.</P>

      <P>Members of this administration have greater facilities at their disposal to command the time of the media for their important pronouncements.  They have every facility to explain the slightest misunderstanding that may arise from their statements in any part of the globe.  Such facilities are not open to a member of the Opposition, but I am not complaining. If the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and his erstwhile master, the Tánaiste, are misunderstood, ever after all weighty explanations, that is their tough luck, and, I suggest, part of their inarticulateness.  They are the guilty people when it comes to demonstrations and marches.  If the discontent with our present taxation system has spilled over onto the streets, the blame for it lies at the door of this administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Tánaiste was good enough to say that by my participation in the marches I had encouraged them. He wildly exaggerated any influence I had on those demonstrations.  He had <Col N="737" /> constituted himself grand marshal of the demonstrations as a result of his remarks.  I took part in those marches because I thought it necessary, as did others, to remind the Government of the political existence of the PAYE sector. The Government were in danger of forgetting that they existed.  We should remember that the Government had bypassed the Dáil and were discussing a deal with another section of the community on which this Parliament did not have any information.  The Government and the Ministers gave the example to anybody who wished to demonstrate elsewhere that Parliament should be bypassed if political expediency dictated that.  I regret that the PAYE agitation spilled over into the streets, but the demonstrations were orderly and peaceful.  It would be better for the democratic system that grievances find redress within our democratic State.  Tax grievances should find a remedy and we suggest that the remedy is that the Government make a constructive response in the forthcoming Finance Bill to the undoubted widespread discontent, to the thumbs down sign from the majority of taxpayers.  That Bill will be introduced soon and the Government should avail of that opportunity to grasp the nettle.  Unless they do it, the storm of criticism will not abate and we will find the overtaxed men and women, wage and salary earners, taking the only remedy available to them: a continuation of large wage claims rocking the economy and consequent disputes throughout the rest of this year.</P>
    <P>It is in the Government's interest and in the national interest that they should make a constructive response to the discontent existing at the moment.  No hunting for culprits for the present situation into the years of recession when the National Coalition presided over the fortunes of the country will succeed in putting aside their responsibility now for dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>The purpose of putting down this motion was to encourage the Government to make that response in order to heal the growing danger of a real division between urban and rural Ireland.  The Government can avoid that division by making the constructive response that <Col N="738" /> this motion calls for.  It is not the purpose of the motion to dine off the discomfiture of the Government, although to anybody who was in the House at a time when a previous administration presided over there in very difficult circumstances, the temptation is overwhelming.</P>
    <P>It is the purpose of the motion to encourage the Government to exercise leadership and to make a response in the present situation.  Never did a Government so richly deserve party political criticism as this Government do now because of the way they have handled this situation.  I recall when they dined off the efforts of the previous administration to make our tax system fairer.</P>
    <P>I have suggested that the immediate flashpoint of the unparalleled discontent which exists in the country was provided by the bad way the Government handled farmer taxation.  I must not forget the budget and the potent contribution it made to this discontent.  There were large claims made for the budget.  It was said that the allowances gave very big increases to wage and salary earners. The main defence utilised by the Government speakers is to cite the way they dealt with the allowances question in the budget.  In doing that they neglect to point out that the Minister for Finance in the budget indulged in what he referred to as a structural modification of the tax band when he abolished the 20 per cent.  That is a very significant omission because that meant that he scrapped the lowest tax band and those on low incomes were brought into a higher tax band much earlier.  This cancelled out the benefit of any increased allowances at particular wage bands.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Economic Planning and Development says that he gets no detailed remedies from Opposition benches.  I always thought that the place for detailed remedies was in Government. That may be an old-fashioned view.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development may be confusing Parliament with a university seminar. Government is the place for action and leadership and over here it is our job in Opposition to criticise as constructively as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> If the Government are to respond to the taxation problem that now faces the country as well as looking at allowances by way of relief to the PAYE earners, attention must also be paid to the question of the income bands within the income tax system.  We have made too sharp an ascent in income bands.  People on relatively modest incomes are being taxed at too high a rate much too rapidly in our system.  It is not sufficient simply to deal with the allowance.  If the Government deal with the allowance question, expected inflation will largely negative the benefits of allowances in the year ahead of us.  The OPEC Ministers' decision yesterday must mean an inflation rate this year well in excess of 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>We cannot deal with one without the other.  We meet the Government, when calling for wage moderation, in the guise of Jekyll.  When it comes to the revenue side, they have almost a vested interest in increasing inflation so that revenue buoyancy is maintained.  If there is to be a constructive response, then as a general principle we have to look at this question that there is too sharp an ascent in income bands and too heavy taxation for those on relatively moderate incomes.</P>
    <P>The Government have had a submission from at least one organisation who met them before the budget, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  They looked for a relief of £100 million and received £27 million.  On the day the budget was announced, the day many people thought it was a good piece of work, the Labour Party pointed out that it appeared to be an unsatisfactory response to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. The significance I see in the present taxation system is that as long as there is this discontent, the feeling of grievance by PAYE wage and salary earners, they will take their remedy on the industrial front.  That is the failure of the budget which neglected this important aspect of what should have been the main concern of the Government in a year in which we wanted, in the national interest, to ensure that wage and salary earners would be encouraged to settle for moderate wage claims.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> Those people were not given any such encouragement by the Government.  The taxation provisions in the budget were unsatisfactory.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have given leadership through this period, but they received only £27 million.  It is against the background of the failure of the Government to make any serious concessions to the PAYE sector in the budget that the present discontent has arisen.  This year a married man with no children on a gross income of £70 per week will have £13.42 deducted from his income between tax and social welfare contributions, which amounts to 19.2 per cent of his income.  PAYE wage and salary earners feel that they continue to pay a disproportionate amount in income tax and they see other sections of the community get off very lightly.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Government, in the Finance Bill, look again at the allowances and income bands and consider the question of indexation.  If we incorporate the principle of indexing allowances this year in the Finance Bill we will at least ensure that their value is maintained next year.  We will ensure that we will not have the Minister for Finance or someone else in his place next year wrongfully claiming the advantages of giving extra allowances when more people will be dragged into the tax net as a result of increasing inflation. I suggest that we consider incorporating the principle of indexation itself, indexation of the allowances and the bands.  In our system a person on a moderate wage or salary has to pay at a relatively high rate in a very short time.  I suspect there is less graduation in our tax bands as compared with other systems and this is part of the reason for the present discontent.  We abolished the higher tax bands and this was probably a correct move but we also abolished the lower bands.  It is at that end that we need to give considerable relief.</P>
    <P>It is important that an intelligent response be made and that is why I have suggested various elements that should be involved in the Government's response.  In any review of the situation I hope the Government will examine the tax base to see if it is too narrow and if it bears too heavily on one section.  I <Col N="741" /> believe it does.  If the Government say, as many of their spokesmen have been saying lately, that changes will take time, one could say that it did not take very long to dismantle certain taxation provisions that had been in existence.  It did not take very long to abolish the wealth tax.  That was abolished without even a reference in the manifesto.  Apparently no group had come officially to Fianna Fáil and sought removal of the wealth tax but mysteriously it was gone overnight. One does not know the power and influence of those who called on the Minister for Finance and got his so willing consent.  Usually one hears of special interest groups coming to the Government before a budget and making submissions. Who went to Government Buildings seeking abolition of the wealth tax?  Who phoned whom?  I instance this as what can be done if the will is there.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  I have just mentioned it as an illustration that if there is a will on the part of the Government to reform the present system it can be done.  They do not need a great length of time to come to conclusions about what is wrong with the present tax situation.  It would not require extraordinary research to remove some of the anomalies that exist.  I would be the first to say that no section of the community like tax but they like it still less and their ordinary dislike of it boils over when they see a Government who narrow the tax base quite deliberately and then bypass Parliament when dealing with another group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the previous administration, so rich an area for the present Government in providing excuses for their inaction, attempted to tax the farmers Fianna Fáil attacked us.  The word was passed down the line that no taxation would be put on farmers if Fianna Fáil were returned to office.  Now Fianna Fáil are dealing with the farmers and I hope a good arrangement will be arrived at.  However, the <Col N="742" /> message is clear.  The Government must also arrive at an agreement with the PAYE people.  That is the logic of these events.  The purpose of this motion is to get from the Government the kind of leadership warranted by their majority. They have 84 seats, the largest mandate in the history of the State.  So far there is a great contrast between their promises before the election and their actions afterwards.  Before the election they promised there would be no price increases but now there is nothing but news of price increases every day. Before the election there was a solution for every problem.  Now the Government are in office with the largest mandate ever.  Now they have a problem with regard to taxation and they are called to deal with it.  There is no use in blaming the National Coalition.  They are gone and Fianna Fáil are the sole victors because they won the election conclusively. Now they are being asked to rule the country.  Unlike our Government they do not have to worry about whether they have sufficient votes to put measures through.  They have a super abundance of votes but now they must deal with people outside Parliament as well who are looking to this Parliament and to the Government for a remedy.  They will not go away.</P>
    <P>In the next few weeks we invite the Government to answer the call that has come in unmistakable fashion throughout the country, from the hinterland of Fianna Fáil support.  These people have marched.  They have not done so as a result of trade union or Labour Party persuasion.  They have come out spontaneously.  Admittedly they had the assistance of the Minister for Finance.  I do not know if he can be shut up the next time they march but certainly he was of assistance the last time.  The purpose of the motion is to get a response from this administration in the forthcoming Finance Bill to the undoubted discontent that exists among the PAYE sector regarding the present tax system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In this motion we have asked the Government to do a number of things that are open to them to do.  If they have the will they can introduce <Col N="743" /> major anti-evasion and antiavoidance measures.  If they have the will they can assure that all taxpayers pay tax on the basis of their assessment for the current year.  If they have the will and the political commitment they can increase the yield from capital taxation measures, from farm accounts and can increase the yield from non-manufacturing corporate bodies.  If they do these things they can collect between £150-£200 million in extra taxation per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this basis there would be no need to indulge in a cutback in public expenditure <Col N="744" /> to finance relief for PAYE people. In the past ten years in question after question and in many contributions in this House I emphasised the inherent inequities and injustices in the tax system. I hope by now that some of the messages have got through to the Government. If Fianna Fáil introduce the taxation remedies mentioned and restore food subsidies they can still finance the claims of the Garda, the nurses and the post office sector.  The Government can meet these extra costs without cutting back on other essential services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the time being made available to me tonight.  I asked in all eight questions today to the Minister of State, Deputy Wyse, in relation to the role of architects in the Office of Public Works and the volume of work the Government are currently undertaking. I was very dissatisfied with the response I got from Deputy Wyse. Perhaps he has other things on his mind such as Wood Quay.</P>
      <P>As an architect I have no hesitation in raising the question of the role of the one architectural office, the Office of Public Works, that the State itself has.  The position appears to be that because of the attitude of the Office of Public Works and, by extension, the Department of the Public Service towards remuneration, the status of this architectural resource and its allied professional skills will be progressively reduced and diminished.  If that is the case, it behoves the Minister and the Government to state clearly what their policy is towards the architectural and design staff in the Office of Public Works.  Has the Government a particular view on the role of the professional design staff in the Office of Public Works and, if so, has that role and their perception of it changed from previous administrations? To put it in a more political way, do the Government propose to hive off to the private sector this aspect of our economy just as noises are being made about hiving off other areas to the private sector?  Is the refusal by the Department and the Minister of State to pay a reasonable relative salary an indication that, by stealth, they are going to drive out of the public sector workers who do very good work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State in reply to my questions stated that the capital employed at the moment was £39 million, an increase of £9 million on last year, and that 90 per cent of the work was in the process of either going on site or would very soon go on site.  By inference, one could take the view that we are not talking about long-term projects or people sitting at drawing boards and designing something that might never be built.  We are talking about work that will be done in the immediate future and that is likely to go to tender.  The Minister of State went on to say that even though they were one-third short of their complement of architects and their building programme was such that 90 per cent of it was likely to take off in the immediate future, he did not see any difficulties in meeting the overall timetable they had set themselves.  Either the Minister is running his Department so efficiently that he does not need the extra staff or the way in which he presented the information at Question Time was, to say the least, misleading.  Perhaps the <Col N="747" /> Minister would take this opportunity to remove any misinterpretation I might have taken from his reply.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the Minister to the comparative position in terms of remuneration that his professional staff have with other architects in the public sector.  I am not comparing architectural employment in the Office of Public Works with the private sector because the constraints of the market and so on are different in both areas.  In a submission that was made by the Institute of Professional Civil Servants on a claim for an increase, reference number C159, a table is given on page 4 which indicates that they have fallen behind architects employed in other public sector agencies such as Aer Rianta, the NBA, the ESB and Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>As one who was employed as a public service architect and derived a lot of benefit from it, I would like the Minister, whether tonight or at some future date, to say in some detail how he and the Government see the role of the Office of Public Works design staff.  A government of any political complexion, either a mad right-wing government, towards which this Government have displayed certain tendencies, or a government of any other political persuasion, must have an architectural staff to do certain basic work.</P>
    <P>I seriously suggest to the Minister that if the same levels of remuneration are not retained in the Office of Public Works, with a proper career structure, the morale of those employed will be so undermined that the best of them will leave and the not so good will have no option but to remain.  That will not be doing any service to the Office of Public Works, the building industry or the other State Departments which the Office of Public Works purport to be serving.</P>
    <P>There is a great need in the Office of Public Works for a corps of top-class well qualified and adequately remunerated professionals who can maintain for the offices of State a suitable range of skills and experience that will enable the Government, whatever their political complexion, to carry out a basic building programme <Col N="748" /> such as that referred to by the Minister at Question Time earlier today.</P>
    <P>I am not a trade union negotiator and I will not attempt to involve myself in the details of salary negotiations.  Neither is the Minister in such a position.  He can say this is a matter between the representative organisations and the Department of the Public Service. Therefore, putting aside details of negotiations, let us turn to the real issue involved.  There is a need for some degree of relativity so that the reasonable claims that have been presented can be seen in their proper context, but what is of more relevance to the House is my suggestion that the Department should enunciate clearly the role to be played by the architects and the design staff generally.  It must be clearly established that there will be in the Office of Public Works a career structure for talented and able designers who want to work in this part of the public service.  The impression must be killed that this part of the public service is not the place for a talented young architect because the level of remuneration is so much below that in any other State agency.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for having allowed me to raise this matter.  The Minister has said that 90 per cent of the work programme is ready to go on site but that there are vacancies equal to one third of the full staff.  Is it the Government's policy simply to run down the Office of Public Works design staff to such an extent that the vast bulk of the work will have to be hived off to the private sector?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Wyse) Pearse Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat amazed at the statements made by Deputy Quinn.  He seems to be very far removed from what is going on in the Office of Public Works.  I can relieve his mind straightaway by telling him that there is no change of attitude towards architects or design staff in that office. There is no intention to have their status reduced.  Indeed when I was appointed to that office I set about building up the architectural, engineering and all the other sections in that office which had been allowed to run down because of an <Col N="749" /> embargo imposed by the previous Government.  I appreciate that the Deputy was not a member of that Government and that he did not have any part in it.  I am not being political when I say that.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that it is my intention to ensure that every section within the Office of Public Works will be geared to meet the many demands on it and to give opportunities to young people in the Board of Works.  Within a month I set about appointing between 30 or 40 apprentices, to provide openings for young people, career opportunities in other words.  I hope that will relieve the Deputy's mind immediately.  I am sorry that I was misinterpreted today, but that is becoming a nasty habit in the House. Today I went out of my way to give the Deputy an idea of what I am doing.</P>
      <P>The 28 vacancies arose largely in the last year because of increases in authorised numbers to meet the bigger demand.  I deally, the Office of Public Works would wish to handle all its architectural work with its own staff but this, as I have explained, is not always feasible.  We must handle the peaks of demand and deal with any temporary shortages of staff by commissioning architects in private practices.  In this way, the Office of Public Works can manage to keep its building programme on target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over a number of years it has been necessary for the Office of Public Works to commission private architects to assist in the design work associated with the building programme which is a major function being undertaken by that office for other Government Departments. The programme is a very extensive one covering a wide range of buildings, such as schools, telephone exchanges, post offices, garda stations, office buildings and many other types of buildings.  The Office of Public Works employs a large number of architectural staff both for the building programme and for the repair and renovation of some 2,000 State buildings.  As can be appreciated, however, with such an extensive programme a variation in the numbers of buildings required can regularly occur with little notice.  The new programme of buildings for <Col N="750" /> telephone development announced by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is a good example.  That programme comprises building projects estimated to cost £70 million which will have to be undertaken at short notice and within a limited period of years.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, the aim of the Office of Public Works to employ adequate staff to cope with the programmes of building and maintenance work, but constant variations make it difficult to adjust the cadre of staff to meet fluctuating requirements.  The recruitment of architectural staff in accordance with long accepted legal requirements is effected by means of open competition conducted by the Civil Service Commission, but even with frequent competitions it is difficult to provide a regular inflow of staff to meet the requirements of such a large organisation as the Office of Public Works which has an authorised architectural staff of 280, including 115 posts of qualified architect.</P>
    <P>Thus, a degree of flexibility is essential if the Office of Public Works is to meet the peaks in demands for building services from the various Departments whose needs can vary from year to year, and the most satisfactory way of attaining the flexibility is to assign some of the building projects to private architectural firms on a commission basis.  This arrangement has worked adequately for many years and has served to maintain progress with the State's building requirements.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the recruitment of staff for the Office of Public Works is an ongoing process which depends on a number of factors such as the output of graduates from colleges at particular times of the year and the normal movement of architects in the early stages of their career.  Steady progress has been made with recruitment, and it is expected that it will be maintained and may be improved with a revision of salary scales.  The Office of Public Works architects are paid the standard salary scale applicable to architects in the civil service, and that scale is at present under review.  The review is not, of course, a matter for the Office of Public Works; it is being processed through the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme by <Col N="751" /> the Department of the Public Service and I hope that the increases which may be agreed to will help to speed up recruitment and bring serving staff to the number authorised.</P>
    <P>The numbers authorised were greatly increased in the last year to meet the additional requirements of the expansion of the building programme and the increase in staff also included a number of senior posts which are filled by promotions, which in turn gives rise to consequential vacancies which must be filled by recruitment.</P>
    <P>It is important that it should go out from the House that there is no change whatsoever in any of the structures in <Col N="752" /> the Office of Public Works.  I think I have proved beyond doubt that it is my ambition to ensure that every section of the Office of Public Works' staff will be geared up to meet present requirements, and they are many.  I want to ensure that employees will have a future in the Office of Public Works.  On many occasions we have come in for unfair criticism.  I hope we will be able to rid ourselves of this in the coming few months.  I can assure the Deputy that the changes we are about to make will be in the interests of all those employed in the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available.  Table 4 of the Pre-Budget Tables 1979 sets out the State expenditure in relation to agriculture in this country for each year since 1975.  On the basis of an estimated 155,000 full-time farmers this works out at an average expenditure of £984 per farmer in 1978.  I would point out, however, that not all of the expenditure shown in the table to which I referred <Col N="632" /> can be regarded as direct resource transfers to farmers although benefiting them indirectly.</P>
