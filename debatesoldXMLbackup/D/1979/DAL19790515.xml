      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>My visit to London on Thursday last arose from an invitation which I accepted on 26 February 1979 from the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple to be their guest at a dinner on that day.  I availed of the occasion to pay a courtesy call on the Prime Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it would not be customary to go into the details, I can say that our conversation touched on a wide range of subjects such as Northern Ireland, including North-South economic co-operation, <Col N="524" /> EEC, EMS, and other bilateral matters.  The meeting lasted half an hour and was warm and cordial.  We agreed that a further meeting could be envisaged for a suitable occasion in the future to discuss matters of common interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The newspapers reported the Taoiseach as saying that he was mildly optimistic.  What is he mildly optimistic about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know I did not talk about mild optimism.  I am not responsible for that phrase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was reported in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had better ask the newspapers about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Without going into the details of the discussion, can the Taoiseach indicate whether the subject matter of the Tánaiste's speech calling for a new British initiative was part of the discussions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the progress, if any, made in eliciting from Aer Lingus the figures for net passenger movement out of the State since February 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the figures for the gross passenger flows inwards and outwards by air for 1978 have now been received by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="526" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister of State tell the House what these figures are because it is only two or three weeks since we were told that the most recent figures related to February 1978?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only three weeks since we were told, I think by the Minister who is now on his feet, that he had no figures subsequent to February 1978. Up to what date have we now got complete figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's difficulties.  My reply states that most of the figures for the gross passenger flows inwards and outwards by air have now been received.  The problem was that we were not getting the figures for the inflow and outflow from Cork Airport.  As a result of a commercial dispute at Cork Airport, we still have not been given the figures for the period May to October of last year.  We have the figures for November and December of last year.  In the economic series covering to the end of May we propose to publish all of last year's figures with the exclusion of the Cork figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Central Statistics Office got any figures for 1979?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an ongoing matter. The supplying of details has resumed.  I am in a position to give the Deputy figures of the net passenger movements by air and by air and sea up to the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister oblige the House with the figures for the net passenger outflow, if it is an outflow, from all airports bar Cork for the period in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought to be pleased to learn that the position for 1977 has been reversed.  As an indicator <Col N="527" /> of emigration or immigration, the figures show a net immigration figure of 12,000 whereas the previous figures show an overall net emigration of 12,000.</P>

    <P>In view of the relatively substantial change in pattern in the figures between 1977 and 1978 and the particular problems raised by the interruption of the air statistics during 1978, the Central Statistics Office is conducting further inquiries into the background of the data.  In interpreting the figures as a crude indicator of the level and trend of net migration it is therefore necessary to treat them with more than usual caution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>) asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that local authority tenants, including old age pensioners living alone, have had their rents substantially increased and if he will make a statement explaining the increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that local authority tenants, including old age pensioners living alone, have had their rents substantially increased under the revised rents scheme which came into operation from 1 March last.  On the contrary, an old age pensioner living alone whose only income is the maximum rate of contributory old age pension is required to pay only the minimum rent of 10p per week under the terms of the differential rent scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be cases where such old age pensioners are living in fixed rent dwellings, the rents of which have been increased by 25p per week.  However, I would like to take this opportunity to point out that pensioners and other <Col N="542" /> tenants on fixed rents have the right to opt to have their rents assessed under the terms of the national differential rent scheme which in many cases can result in a substantial reduction in the rent payable.  In fact, I understand that a number of old age pensioners have already exercised this option and have had their rents reduced accordingly. Furthermore, it should be noted that the revised rates of pension applicable from 6 April were not taken into account when rents were being reviewed.</P>
    <P>In the case of other tenants, I wish to emphasise that there has been no change in the basic method of assessing rent payable under the differential rent scheme.  Maximum differential rents have been increased to compensate for the increased costs of providing, maintaining and managing local authority dwellings.  However, an actual increase in rent will arise only in the case of tenants whose basic incomes, after deduction of income tax, social welfare contributions, personal, children's and other allowances, justify an increase.  In order to cushion the lower income group of tenants against the effect of rent increases which would otherwise arise because of the rise in their incomes, the personal allowances in the graded scale were increased by 15 per cent over the 1978 level and the allowance for each dependent child was increased by 24 per cent.  Finally, in cases of hardship, a local authority may agree to accept from a tenant for a specified period a lesser sum for rent than that applicable under the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Is it not a fact that the increases in question arose because of a ministerial order which came into operation on 1 March?  Would the Minister be surprised to know that in Cootehill, County Cavan, old age pensioners living alone have been asked to increase their rent by £1.05 per month, that they were exempt from rates before the Minister's scheme came into operation and that they are now worse off than before derating?  A great number of local authority tenants are now worse off financially than before their houses were <Col N="543" /> derated.  Can the Minister explain why on this occasion the rents were raised without any discussion with the tenants' organisations as was the case in the past?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a grant requirement in respect of new houses provided for sale that a CRV be issued approving the price being charged and I am satisfied that such a requirement is desirable in order to ensure that public funds are used to assist and encourage the provision of reasonably priced houses.  House purchasers have been repeatedly advised of this requirement and have been strongly recommended to see the CRV before committing themselves to purchase.  There is no legal obligation on <Col N="545" /> builders providing new houses for sale to obtain CRVs and there is no precise information in my Department as to the number of such houses for which CRVs are not sought.</P>
      <P>My Department exercise no direct control over the structural standards of non-CRV, non-grant aided houses. However, houses in this category that are registered under the national house building guarantee scheme are inspected at three stages&mdash;foundation, roofing and completion&mdash;by my Department's housing inspectors under the inspection service provided for the guarantee company. In areas where building bye-laws operate, such as Dublin city and county, there is an independent inspection procedure to ensure that building standards comply with bye-law requirements.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from various interests regarding different aspects of the CRV system and I have already indicated that I am not happy with all aspects of the present position. Accordingly, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1979, which has been circulated to Deputies, will provide for a comprehensive overhaul of the statutory framework for the system of certifying reasonable value in respect of the prices of new houses and flats.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is a ludicrous position to have a CRV system which is not in some way legally mandatory or obligatory? One of the questions specifically asked is why it is that the Minister's Department do not feel obliged to try to assess the number of people evading or eluding the certificate system, which is making a mockery of the whole scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy refers to the number evading or eluding.  Grant-aided houses have to have a CRV.  Also the building societies, with the exception of one building society, have been looking for CRVs up to a certain level of loan.  It has not been obligatory.  One cannot make a builder apply for a CRV but at least people who are buying houses should look for a CRV if they are looking <Col N="546" /> for a grant, before they pay a deposit on any house.  With regard to builders eluding it if they do not apply for a CRV they are on the market without one.</P>

      <P>There are two points here.  The Minister spoke about builders on the market without a CRV.  Those people, as he knows, have no difficulty in selling their houses.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the people who are suffering are the purchasers who are not getting the full benefit of the various grant schemes which are available to them?  Secondly, and specifically in regard to Question No. 12, how can the Minister seriously expect the average builder to comply with this scheme when members of his own Oireachtas party are deliberately avoiding applying for CRVs and the purchasers of those houses are subject to major financial loss as a result?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> I am aware that there have been complaints about failures of cylinders fitted in houses in certain areas.  It has been alleged in some cases that the nature of the public water supply in these areas contributed to the failures.</P>
    <P>Since 1 September 1975, all copper hot water cylinders used in local authority or grant-aided housing and manufactured in the State are required to bear the appropriate standard mark of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, signifying that they conform to the requirements of Irish Standard 161: 1975.  Where imported cylinders are used they must conform to the requirements of Irish Standard 161: 1975 or to an equivalent standard prescribed by the appropriate authority of a member state of the European Communities. I might add that Dublin Corporation regulations, made under Dublin Corporation Waterworks Acts for the purpose of preventing the waste, undue consumption, misuse or contamination of the domestic water supply, lay down similar requirements for hot water cylinders installed in their area.</P>

      <P>Regarding the cost of building land, I indicated in my reply today to Question No. 7 from Deputy Quinn that this general issue is under active consideration in the Department.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I <Col N="560" /> propose to take the three questions together.  This country is particularly affected by the present oil shortage, which affects all Western countries to one degree or another, by our unusually high growth rate.  We have no oil resources of our own.  We must, therefore, by careful and prudent use of oil, especially petrol and gas diesel which are the products in most demand, stretch the supplies available to us to the best advantage. The Government have, therefore, decided that I should make an order to the effect that the minimum amount of petrol which may be purchased at any one time should be £5 worth, except that in the case of cars with tank capacity of six gallons or less the amount shall be £4 worth.  We have also decided that the maximum speed limit on any road shall be 55 m.p.h. and the Minister for Justice is taking immediate steps to have this new limit very strictly enforced.  The necessary orders will be made today.</P>
      <P>I also wish to state that the insurance companies have agreed that the position adopted by them towards car-sharing during the January 1979 bus strike will apply in present circumstances.  In other words, payments made by passengers towards running costs as part of a car-sharing agreement would not invalidate the motor insurance cover.  I hope this opportunity for car-sharing will be fully availed of.  There are serious oil problems and it behaves each and every one of us as best we can to co-operate in ensuring that available supplies are not wasted.  We can all play our part by the various means open to us, including the elimination of unnecessary motoring.  I am confident that if we all pull our weight the problems which face us will be largely overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that at the forthcoming Energy Council meeting on 17 May I propose to draw special attention to oil supply problems in Ireland.  I do not subscribe to the view that the introduction of rationing, as envisaged by Deputy Kelly, would be appropriate in present circumstances.  I have already told the House why I consider rationing would not be suitable.  Deputies may, however, wish to know that we have an adequate number of ration coupons, application forms and so on available to us in the <Col N="561" /> event that rationing of petrol or other oil products might have to be adopted at a later stage.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated on a number of occasions, the supply situation for petroleum products is under daily continuous review with a view to dealing in the most effective manner with whatever problems exist.  It is, unfortunately, a position which varies from day to day and because of the volatility of certain factors at the producer end one cannot predict precisely what the future may hold.  However, on the basis of our present information I am satisfied that there is no need for panic measures such as rationing.  It may well be that in the next couple of weeks our position will have improved substantially and certainly the Government will do whatever they can to secure our supply situation.  We are acting in close co-operation with the operating companies, with whom all aspects of the situation are being reviewed, and I am hopeful of some improvement in the supply position reasonably quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three or four questions to put to the Minister and I hope, in view of the gravity of the matter, that the Chair will allow them go through. While I agree that the speed limit which was announced is an excellent idea, and while welcoming also the arrangements the Minister proposes to make in regard to insurance, I should like to ask him whether he regards the rule relating to a minimum amount as an adequate response to a situation in which most people are worried not about a minimum amount but whether they can get £5 worth of petrol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, many of the troubles and difficulties, especially in Dublin, in regard to queueing which cause problems for genuine people are caused by people buying, as recently as yesterday, amounts of petrol costing as little as 50p, 90p and £1.  I do not suggest that any one of these things on its own would solve the matter or be in itself a major contribution but I can see a situation in which after these steps are taken today it may well be that certain <Col N="562" /> further steps may have to be taken tomorrow or the following day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not recognise that the number of people who are behaving in this anti-social way by topping-up with small amounts is small compared with the hundreds of thousands who are desperate for a tank full of petrol for their ordinary business and social occasions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is constantly represented to me by people who are in a position to know, including garage owners, that they are constantly being asked to supply very small quantities. This is causing long queues which are distressing and wasteful for people who genuinely need petrol for their business and important purposes.  I see this as a contribution towards helping to alleviate in some way certain aspects of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Minister's statement about the forthcoming meeting of Energy Council Ministers in Brussels this week I should like to ask him if he has any basis of hope that additional supplies can be obtained for this country since alone of the EEC states we appear to be experiencing this shortage in a more extreme form?  I agree that it is more oil supplies we need rather than rationing, but I should like to ask the Minister whether he has any basis of hope that we can get these extra supplies and whether the Minister can take steps to ensure that when a price application is pending from the companies an artificial shortage does not appear to occur at about the same time?  It appears to me that an arm-lock is being applied in this situation and the shortage appears to coincide with the price increase application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the EEC are concerned I should like to state that we already have had a good deal of contact with them.  They are aware of the fact that we have particular difficulties.  They pointed out to us&mdash;and I have verified this from some other countries&mdash;that the cutback by the major companies seems to be approximately the same as it is in <Col N="563" /> our case but the big difference is that the other countries of the EEC for the most part have either no growth rates or negligible growth rates while we have a particularly strong growth rate. Therefore, it is not sufficient for our needs for the companies to offer us 100 per cent of what were our needs in 1978. That situation leaves us short by 10 per cent or more in respect of some products thereby causing pressure and panic.  For most other European countries 100 per cent of the 1978 needs is reasonably adequate and does not cause anything like the pressures and difficulties that are being experienced here.  I am satisfied that there is not now any withholding of stocks by the oil companies in anticipation of a possible price rise later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The shortage appears worse on the eve of a price increase application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so but we monitor very closely the companies' stocks and in fairness I do not think one could say that stocks have increased substantially in the past week or two.  I am glad to note, though, that there has been an increase in the stock of diesel oil held by the companies.  Hopefully, the stock of this product will continue to build up during the summer because we will need it during the winter.  However, the stocks of motor spirit are at a lower level this week than they were last week despite the fact that the deliveries seem to be continuing from the companies at a rather higher level.  What may be the case is that in some instances people other than the oil companies are hoarding limited amounts but I trust that is not a widespread phenomenon because it would be very unfair to the public.  Suggestions that there is such hoarding must be checked out but it is not easy to deal with such a problem in a short period.  In addition, there is no law, as of now at any rate, against people not selling the stocks they have.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;before that order was made I had constant representations from organisations such as the IFA and from others speaking on behalf of farmers.  There are no longer global complaints or representations but we still receive complaints in respect of individuals who for one reason or another have fallen short of their full needs. However, in general terms agriculture, like the various other priority categories, is being catered for but if there are individual cases that come to the Deputy's notice, we would be prepared in the Department to investigate them if he lets us have the details and then we could arrange to have the necessary supplies made available to those people.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of making fuel supplies available to car hire companies catering for tourists coming into the country, the position is that tourists arriving at the airports have been catered for fully in this respect except for two days in three weeks.  There was one day a few days ago when unfortunately the Aer Rianta station at Shannon became empty and another day about three weeks ago when there was the same situation for part of the day.  In both instances the situation was rectified quickly. I have given instructions that people coming into the country and hiring cars be facilitated to the greatest degree possible.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister added the fishing industry to his priority list especially now that we are approaching the salmon season and when there may not be stocks of fuel to hand?  Is the Minister aware that the quotas as designated by the various suppliers to the retailers were miscalculated in that the months of April, May and June were taken together, the total supply divided by three and reduced by 15 per cent resulting in a quota, particularly in the tourist areas, of more than 100 per cent of last year's supply but leaving us with a probable cut of up to 40 per cent in June?  Apparently, this was a genuine mistake but a situation that the Minister should bear in mind.  My last question relates to our refining capacity.  In the long-term view should the situation in this respect not be reconsidered despite the fact that the EEC are saying that there is over capacity and, consequently, that there is not to be an extension of refinery facilities whereas we have the capacity for refining only about half our needs?</P>

      <P>In regard to fishing, the Deputy will be aware that in the order I made a month ago, fishing is designated as one of the priority <Col N="566" /> categories.  To the best of my knowledge there have not been serious difficulties in this area with the exception of two trawlers in Donegal in respect of which there was serious difficulty but in those cases the problems did not arise necessarily from the shortage of supplies but because of certain other reasons.  I notice the Deputy is smiling but if he has details of any individual case in which there is difficulty I would be glad if the people concerned would communicate with the Department so that the problem might be dealt with quickly.  So far as the monthly or quarterly allocations are concerned I am aware that some of the companies allocated on a quarterly basis.  This can be unfair particularly in tourist areas where the monthly or quarterly fluctuations can be very marked.  I have asked the companies to allocate on the basis of the monthly allocations for the previous year rather than on a quarterly basis.</P>

      <P>While making it clear that I regard the £5 minimum rule as likely to be inadequate to deal with this crisis, has the Minister contingency plans in mind to deal with shortages which have arisen already in respect of diesel fuel for the road haulage business?  Has he analogous or better plans to deal with shortages both in that sector and in the other diesel fuel consuming areas and possibly also in the domestic heating sector for next winter when the situation may become acute again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Haulage contractors are among those classified as priority users.  They are under the general heading of commerce in the order I made and, consequently, are entitled to have their needs met in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, as in other sectors, there may be individuals who may be having difficulty and if the Deputy would give me their names, or if they would get on to the Department themselves, I am confident that I shall be able to rectify that position, as we have done in hundreds of such complaints.  It is not right to postulate from one or two individual difficulties that it is widespread.  Very little diesel oil at present is being supplied to people in the home heating sector.  It is <Col N="567" /> only being supplied to hardship cases, which are quite a small proportion.  I think people would generally agree that that is only fair and reasonable, since the home heating sector of diesel consumption amounted to nearly one-third and in fact a full third in the case of some companies; therefore there is ample diesel available for these priority users, since two-thirds of the users are now able to use the complete supply.  While I accept what the Deputy says about individuals having difficulties, I cannot accept that it is a general thing.</P>
    <P>So far as hauliers are concerned, there is one category where there are special difficulties, where, say, a Dublin haulier has to go to the far end of Kerry or Galway, or anywhere like that.  He fills his tank before he leaves Dublin; that brings him to his destination, but he has not enough diesel to get back and because he has no local arrangements made with suppliers in that area, he sometimes runs into difficulty.  We are examining ways whereby that problem might be overcome.</P>

      <P>The Minister may recall that I was dealing with the question of the likelihood of family planning clinics having to close down as a result of this legislation.  Subsequently I find there has been an amendment in the name of the Minister which makes it appear likely that the family planning clinics will survive. The main point I am making is that they have provided a good service and that their ability to continue to provide that service depends on their right to sell contraceptives.  This would help to finance their activities.  That appears to be unlikely in the original Bill, but under the Minister's amendment it seems likely that they will be able to sell contraceptives, in which case they will be able to continue, assuming that they are operating within the regulations laid down by the Minister, which is as it should be.  I shall leave the argument that I was making and ask the Minister if my interpretation of his amendment is correct.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (4), line 31, after &ldquo;practitioner&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or of trained family planning personnel&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of this amendment is to seek to establish that in addition to general practitioners it will be possible for suitably trained and suitably informed advisers&mdash;nursing personnel, paramedical personnel&mdash;to provide the same service as is proposed under subsection <Col N="616" /> (4): &ldquo;Information, instruction, advice or consultation in relation to the use of contraceptives shall not be provided . . . except under the general direction and supervision of medical practitioners or of trained family planning personnel.&rdquo; A very good case could be made and has been made for suggesting that family planning clinics can be adequately catered for by individuals who are trained in these techniques. There is no great need for the restriction of information in relation to family planning to medical practitioners.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that training in family planning methodology in the average undergraduate's training course is very limited indeed and that there are, according to the IMA, very few doctors capable of giving informed advice on family planning. It is generally accepted that the training in contraceptive procedure of people who want to get the service is very time consuming, especially in relation to the Minister's favoured method of natural family planning which is particularly tedious and time consuming, requiring a considerable amount of co-operation between the doctor and the persons looking for the information. Further, a general practitioner's job is very time consuming and he is involved in dozens of other activities in pursuance of his practice and unless he is particularly interested he will not have the time.  In the context of the situation where trained personnel are so thin on the ground, will the Minister agree that in order to provide this service as quickly as possible he should allow for suitably trained personnel to carry out the service side by side with doctors or in place of doctors where doctors are not available?</P>
    <P>This is a complicated problem because some doctors are opposed to the idea of family planning.  In rural areas there would be no family planning service unless some paramedical professional persons decide to establish the service within the regulations established by the Minister.  It is worth remembering that the Supreme Court laid stress on the ready availability of family planning to those who want to use it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> A number of conferences decided that broadly speaking a doctor is not a good person to administer this service, leaving aside individual weaknesses and other circumstances.  A conference in Istanbul in June 1978 which involved a number of European countries agreed that the medical profession, especially obstetricians had been the greatest obstacle to the development of family planning services all over the world.</P>
    <P>A Council of Europe report says that the provision of family planning services through medical channels only can limit accessibility.  A number of surveys carried out in Ballinteer, County Dublin, concluded that because of the time consuming nature of family planning advice and services doctors were not the best people to give this kind of advice.  Nurses can afford to keep up to date with the most recent developments in family planning, they are less expensively trained and are obviously completely competent to carry out the work and they have time to consult with social workers and so on.  No case can be made for not extending the right to other individuals in the professions to carry out this service.  In his letter to the IMA asking them to provide the service the Minister said that if a family doctor is not prepared to undertake this responsibility then clearly it will have to be laid on someone else.  I imagine that in ordinary professional terms most of these services are predominantly staffed by personnel other than doctors so it is not an extravagant expectation that the Minister include this amendment to the Bill.  In the same letter the Minister said that he had the power to arrange for education and training in family planning for doctors and other professional people.  I cannot see why the Minister cannot look to this enormous reservoir of individuals and personnel.  There are less than 20 doctors trained in family planning methods and counselling techniques.  I cannot see why the Minister is so restrictive in this regard.</P>
    <P>In reply to the Minister's letter the IMA said that doctors should not be the only route by which non-medical contraceptives should be supplied.  The essence of the Minister's problem is to try to bring about as quickly as he can a <Col N="618" /> family planning service which is widely available.  The key to the Minister's problem is the question of personnel.  In those circumstances it is a reasonable proposition that the Minister should include the words as suggested by me in my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that Deputy Browne is on the right track. Section 3 (4) is intended to deal with the supervision of family planning clinics or places where family planning services are provided; it does not say that trained personnel cannot be fully involved in the provision of the service.  In fact we would envisage that there would be, for instance, a nurse who is the obvious person that comes to mind.</P>
      <P>The general principle enshrined in this Bill is that family planning services are a medical matter, that we are entrusting them to the medical profession and that in so far as they are provided anywhere it should be on the basis of a general practitioner dealing with them on a doctor-patient basis.  If they are provided in some clinical setting they should be under the supervision of the medical practitioner.  This is not to say that clinics must be manned totally by doctors&mdash;nobody would expect that&mdash;but that in any case where family planning services are provided it should be under the general direction, supervision and control of a medical practitioner.</P>
      <P>That is all that is involved in subsection (4) as it stands.  I do not think Deputy Browne's amendment is necessary. Of course these places will be able to avail of the services of trained personnel but it will be under the general supervision of a doctor.  The whole principle of the Bill is that artificial contraceptives can be supplied only on the prescription or authorisation of a doctor.  In so far as a family planning service would involve the advice and use of contraceptives, a prescription or authorisation of a doctor must be necessary.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I have not been following Deputy Browne as he would wish but I find a certain confusion in his approach between the family planning function and the medical function. The question of family planning must be divorced from the question of the <Col N="619" /> methods used to implement a family planning programme.  This is very important. Throughout the community, in all camps and in all persuasions, it seems to be accepted that family planning is something to be considered in the modern world.  Perhaps there is a good reason for this, namely the rapid increase in population in our time.  So far as this Bill is concerned, family planning is a question of advice to people as to how to have a programme for family planning.  General advice and what is set out in section 2 of the Bill do not require medical personnel as such.  Some knowledge of human behaviour and human physiology would be necessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Very generally I am referring to section 2.  Probably a knowledge of human psychology is just as important as a knowledge of human physiology.  It is an unfortunate fact that when one comes to details one is immediately involved in medical matters which concern the health and well-being of the individuals concerned.  One comes back to the medical profession in one way or another.  I will leave for the moment the interesting suggestion of Deputy Browne regarding nurses who might work in certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of talking around matters in general terms let us talk about them specifically.  What are the methods by which one would implement a family planning programme using contraceptives? In an earlier amendment Deputy Browne spoke of voluntary tubal ligation or voluntary vasectomy.  As I understand it, both of these operations are tying off, isolating certain organs.  It is said that the operations are reversible but my information is that that must be qualified and that complications are not unknown. Whatever the pros and cons for these operations, in plain language they are surgical operations.  Is it not wise that that should be restricted to the medical profession?  I would shudder at the thought that anyone could come along and perform such operations.  I am <Col N="620" /> not for a moment suggesting this is what Deputy Browne had in mind and I hope he does not misunderstand me.  History will testify to the necessity for reputable, well-established medical practitioner bodies.  It is accepted that practitioners must be properly trained and skilled, must be properly registered and subject to certain professional controls. Quackery flourishes in all areas where there is likely to be remuneration and one of the things we must be careful about here is the commercialisation of sex.  The operations I mentioned involve surgical attention and this area must be under the control of registered medical practitioners.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with the area of drugs. The contraceptive drugs mainly in use are steroids.  These chemical compounds seem historically to have been the subject of a certain amount of euphoria. They are the miracle drugs when discovered but, given a little time, the snags were found.  I remember when cortisone was discovered in my young days and it was supposed to do everything.  It is a very useful drug and can do much good, but the medical profession learned the hard way that cortisone is a steroid that must be carefully applied under the control of a medical practitioner who knows what he is doing.  I do not know if there is any physiological significance in the fact that contraceptive drugs are chemically very closely related to cortisone&mdash;and cholestrol&mdash;which had for a while become the devil of popular medical literature and was said to be ruining our hearts.</P>
    <P>I freely concede that the contraceptive pill is to some extent variable, depending on the mixture of steroids and their proportions.  However, when it was first introduced it was said to be the answer to the contraceptive problem.  Given a little time, contra indications were discovered, as in the case of cortisone.  I will not inflict on the House a list of these indications because I am not a medical doctor.  One has only to look in the <i>Journal of Gynaecology</i> where, because of American law, all these horrific warning and details must be given, just as in the case of tobacco.  As a converted sinner, I share Deputy Browne's worry about tobacco.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact that under American law when these things are advertised, particularly in medical journals, a list of these points must be published.  These drugs have their uses in legitimate medicine but they are to a large extent regarded as belonging to the dangerous drugs category.  They must be controlled as drugs, quite apart from the issue before us.  On the other hand, they must be allowed their legitimate uses and I freely concede to Deputy Browne the right to construe the word &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; in any way he likes.  These drugs should be controlled and should be dispensed to human beings only through the medical profession essentially, with the proper relation to the pharmacist who is specifically trained.  There is a dual tandem relationship between the two professions which has worked very well. These drugs should be dealt with by doctors and not by family planning personnel, no matter how well trained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now refer to intra-uterine devices, known as IUDs.  Subject to whatever Deputy Browne may tell me&mdash;and I bow to his authority&mdash;I am informed that the introduction of these devices <i>in situ</i> does not require any particular medical skill.  I am also informed that a number of cases require subsequent medical and surgical attention as a result of irritation and complications involving infection.  These devices seem to be twisted pieces of metal which act by a scouring motion. The number of cases requiring medical attention is such as to warrant medical supervision at the beginning to determine, as in the case of drugs, whether the person concerned is a suitable subject. Too many cases come within the knowledge and competence of the <Col N="622" /> medical profession because of the malfunction of these devices.  Are these devices to be allowed to be used by people who are not fully trained and fully medically oriented?  Surely they are dangerous in the same sense as drugs to an extent which warrants the same kind of control.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with surgical methods, drugs methods and this mechanical method, I submit to Deputy Browne that in all reason it would be highly imprudent to allow anything falling into these categories to be used for medical or contraceptive purposes or for any other purpose without the control and supervision of a qualified medical practitioner in association, where necessary, with a qualified pharmacist.  There is a very good reason for both these professions and here is a very clearly defined function for them.</P>
    <P>I can think of only two other methods and I should be grateful to Deputy Browne if he would draw my attention to any I have missed.  These other mechanical methods are the condom and the cap.  I concede that these are two mechanical methods where Deputy Browne can make a case.  Any fair-minded person, I think, would have to say that these appear to be free from the medical dangers to that ex-tent&mdash;whatever about the moral side which is another story.  I simply ask Deputy Browne if that is what he is advocating, that these family planning people will be the dispensers of these rubber or plastic commodities.  I think that disposes of the question.  I fear when it comes to that one is dealing essentially with the question of public morality&mdash;I mean as far as we are concerned&mdash;with the question of the perverted use of these things for gain or propaganda purposes but I must concede that I cannot say in all honesty that they command the necessity of medical supervision that the other methods command.</P>
    <P>I am back now to the main point.  We must not confuse two things, family planning and the control of these other methods.  Looking at everything, I think that the structure of this Bill is the best to suit our circumstances unless one is to take the view that free contraceptive devices should be available without <Col N="623" /> restraint to everybody.  If one takes that view I have no answer but from the point of view from which I personally would look at it I think the structure of this Bill is such as to strike a proper balance.  I may correct that to say the best balance that can be struck at the moment in a very difficult situation.  The proposed amendment in a very subtle way would strike at one of the principles of the Bill and for that reason I cannot agree with the mover.</P>

      <P>I approach this as a very urgent problem and one which it is very important from the point of view of our society should be dealt with as rapidly as possible.  I do not want it to be mis-construed but it is something in the terms of a Third World country attempting to achieve an objective as rapidly as possible.  I suppose there is some comparison with what I am suggesting here and the principle which is accepted in some countries of, say, assistants where a nurse is allowed to do a certain job which is ordinarily considered to be only permissible for a dentist to do.  In New Zealand the marvellous advance in its dental services was achieved in this kind of way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy de Valera's interesting contribution, I would say that we may be at cross purposes&mdash;we do not know.  In my opening remarks I asked if the Minister would tell us what kind of a service we shall get: he has not yet told us.  I am trying to assume from his amendment No. 12 that we are going to get a service which broadly is the service at present made available in family planning clinics.  But I have no right to say that because in fact the proposals I made for tubal ligation and vasectomy were thrown out by the House and <Col N="624" /> therefore do not really arise in the Minister's proposals here.  Even if they did, they are minor operations&mdash;certainly vasectomy is.  I take Deputy de Valera's point that this is something which might be restricted to the medical profession but my suggestion is one which would mean that the people in charge of the service would for instance under section 3 (4) have to provide information, instruction, advice or consultation in relation to the use of contraceptives and so on.  Really, none of these things, fittings of IUDs or giving medicines, pills, tubal ligation or vasectomy are to be made available under Deputy Haughey's Bill.</P>

      <P>The whole Government; <i>déja vu.</i>  If we held to the present Bill there is no reason why my amendment could not be accepted.  Deputy de Valera went into some interesting arguments into which I do not propose to pursue him on this section because I think they will come up later on and I shall be glad to deal with them then.  I was interested in his&mdash;I wonder what position it will lead him to take up later on&mdash;remarks about the doctor deciding about having the right to write prescriptions.  He appeared to differentiate between abstention and what he calls natural family planning and the various pills, ligation, sterilisation and the IUD.  He makes the case which is frequently made about that, its abortifacient and carcinogenic possibilities, which it certainly has, I understand. Incidentally, I do not want to claim knowledge I have not got.  I am a general practitioner at best and a specialist in quite a different training to the one involved here.  I do not wish to appear to be an authority on the subject; I am not.  He then came to two points, the question of the cap and the condom. <Col N="625" /> He seemed to think it would be permissible to allow these two to be provided by lay people, effectively, nurses or paramedical personnel.  That is a very interesting concession because it is the one we will be trying to establish in a later amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to make to the Minister is that he is certainly right in relation to condoms, although not necessarily&mdash;there is a fairly good case for a certain amount of education in respect of the use of the condom, oddly enough&mdash;but in relation to the cap, it is necessary that there should be a certain amount of instruction because there are various sizes, the question of how to fit them, and the use of spermacides with them.  I do not think there would be any difference between us on those two, conceding the other ones, my case being that under this Bill it is simply an information service which is being provided by the Government.  I will be very interested to see whether Deputy de Valera will take up that position in relation to the condom and the cap at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my attitude to family planning I am not claiming any loyalty to any method. I am attempting to establish a position for the Minister in a pluralist society who is asked to take on the responsibility of providing an efficient, easily available and safe service, with a multiple choice because of the various different needs of the persons presenting themselves.  I am trying to establish the point that the Minister's own attitudes, his ethical attitude, his moral standard of values, and his religious beliefs are completely irrelevant.  He has a responsibility to provide the best possible service. Despite remarks by Deputy de Valera about the kind of people we are, and about the social and ethical attitudes we have, we are a pluralist society.  There are people who do not agree with the natural form of family planning and who are perfectly happy with various other forms.  I have not yet said whether I agree or disagree with sterilisation.  It is not important.  It does not matter.  A lady may be a Jewish lady, she may be <Col N="626" /> Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, atheist, agonstic, or Muslim, or any kind of person living in our society. She will ask for the most efficient service and my answer will be: &ldquo;This is the most efficient service&rdquo;, and privately I might not agree with it but the decision must be hers.  I wish we could establish that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not dwell on it. Reference is made to &ldquo;natural&rdquo; and &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; methods of family planning. Both are wrong, but it is of interest that we never got from the Minister an explanation of the enigmatic &ldquo;secure&rdquo; and &ldquo;provide&rdquo; in section 2.  We did not get an explanation of what he meant by the use of those two different words.  Section 3 (2) provides:</P>
      <P>A person other than a health board may make available a family planning service for the provision of information, instruction, advice and consultation in relation to methods of family planning that do not involve the use of contraceptives.</P>
      <P>There is no question of regulations or no question of medical supervision there. Presumably this service can be carried out by nursing personnel and paramedical personnel.  Why?  Some of the methods used in, let us call it, unnatural family planning without a shadow of doubt do not need skilled medical advice for their use.  Why is there this distinction which runs right through the Bill making one kind of service relatively inaccessible and another freely available with all the force, power and wealth of the Minister behind it in order to promote it?  These are questions which will arise on other sections and I should like to hear what the Minister feels about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I really have not a great deal to add.  I do not think Deputy Browne has established a case for his amendment.  We are talking here about clinics which provide a family planning service involving the use of artificial contraceptives. The principles on which this <Col N="627" /> legislation is based are quite clear.  It is a fundamental principle that a family planning service must be firmly anchored to the medical profession.  Rightly or wrongly, that is my approach to the Bill. This is more appropriate to a family doctor context than anything else.  That is my approach, and that is what is involved in subsection (4) which provides that if there is to be a clinic of any sort it has to be under the general direction and supervision of a medical practitioner.</P>
      <P>That is all it says.  It does not say everyone in the clinic has to be a medical practitioner.  Many people will be employed in these clinics who will not necessarily be fully qualified medical people.  In so far as any clinic is set up to give advice and information about family planning matters, I want to ensure that it will be under medical supervision. I do not want family planning clinics springing up all over the place under people who are not qualified to run such institutions.  If we were to adopt Deputy Browne's amendment we would be leaving it open to anybody to establish a clinic of this sort.</P>
      <P>His amendment asks for trained family planning personnel.  What does that mean?  A medical practitioner has a clearly identifiable standard of qualification. Whether you agree with it or not, the principle of the Bill is that family planning services are being placed under the general jurisdiction, control, supervision and direction of the medical profession. That is my approach.  That is how I think this matter should be tackled.  I would not be prepared be consider the establishment of family planning clinics other than under the direction and supervision of a medical man or woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland asked me to elaborate on what I mean by general direction and supervision.  In this subsection those words would have their normal meaning. Time and again in the health services we talk about institutions, or bodies, or agencies, or clinics, being &ldquo;under the general direction and supervision&rdquo;.  It does not necessarily mean that the medical practitioner will have to be there 24 hours a day.  How he or she manages the general direction of the clinic is a <Col N="628" /> matter for her or him, but the meaning is quite clear.  The manner in which the place is conducted, the activities carried on, the type of instruction, advice and consultation provided will be prescribed by the medical practitioner in charge.</P>
    <P>There is the subsidiary argument that in so far as family planning services would involve the use of artificial contraceptives, the prescription of a general medical practitioner will be necessary.  It is impossible to think of the clinics without a GP being involved in their running and supervision.  In so far as there will be family planning clinics, I regard them as very important places.  I will ensure that they will be licensed first of all, and they must be up to a certain standard, and the way in which we will ensure that they will be up to a certain standard is by putting them under the general supervision and direction of a fully qualified medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>I should like here to make a point in reply to various criticisms of this legislation inside and outside the House, particularly by those prolific writers of letters to the newspapers.  I often wonder do they have anything else to do apart from writing letters to the newspapers. This Bill places family planning services in the context of family medicine.  If I had brought in a Bill which did not do that, can Deputies imagine the volume of criticism there would be?  The cry then would be that family planning should be a medical matter, that the persons who should have control of family planning are the doctors, not policemen.  If we had left this legislation in the Department of Justice, for instance, can Deputies imagine the outcry: &ldquo;This is a medical matter and nobody in the country is better qualified to look after family planning matters than the family doctors&rdquo;.  That would be the outcry all over the place. But because I have done that, there is another outcry.  Apparently it is a detrimental thing to ask the best qualified people, trained people with the most wisdom and experience in these matters, to take control and direction of this service.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I despair of trying to achieve some sort of sensible consensus, but out of all the arguments, and allowing for all the disadvantages involved in <Col N="629" /> what I am proposing, I suggest that it is the best system, the sensible system.  We are asking the right people to take charge, the family doctors.  It is for that reason that subsection (4) is in the Bill and it is for that reason that I do not want to accept Deputy Browne's amendment. I do not want to have the family planning clinics under the general direction of anybody except fully qualified medical practitioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will keep strictly to the Minister's last argument.  He made the point, which I share, that family planning clinics must be kept up to a certain standard by fully qualified medical practitioners. I accept that, but the Minister is proposing that a family planning service will be set up throughout the country, a comprehensive service providing consultation and advice in relation to methods of family planning that do not involve the use of contraceptives. Is that not the position?  There is to be a widespread family planning service of that kind without any medical supervision and, as far as I know, without any specific regulations laid down by the Minister.  Why is there this dual provision in relation to two aspects of family planning?  I take the position that there should be all forms of family planning available and that individuals should be able to make their choice, and that all the services should be of the highest standards laid down by the Minister and the Department.  I fail to see why the Minister did not make any attempt to clarify that point in the discussion on the Bill so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has taken up the position that there must be a prescription.  I will not deal with that now because I hope we will be dealing with it on a later amendment.  He said a prescription will be necessary.  I accept that a prescription will be necessary for certain drugs and medicines, as mentioned by Deputy de Valera.  However, Deputy de Valera <Col N="630" /> made a distinction between two kinds of contraception.  On one matter I would go along with him.  Then there is the question of the diaphragm and the condom. He did not think a medical certificate would be needed in relation to these&mdash;I hope I am not misconstruing him.  He did not seem to think that these had anything like the seriousness of the other three or four that he mentioned&mdash;I am sure he knew what he was talking about. Does the Minister take up that position, because it is a most important one?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would take the amendment in the context of subsection (6) which reads &ldquo;. . . this subsection shall not be construed as restricting the discretion of a registered medical practitioner in his clinical relations with a patient.&rdquo; The Minister appears to be attempting to direct the medical profession as to what they will do in the provision of a family planning service.  There appears to be a conflict. <Col N="632" /> Under subsection(5) the Minister is attempting to direct the medical practitioner to provide the kind of service that he does not agree with.</P>

      <P>If that were involved, Deputy Browne would be right in removing the subsection.  The Deputy will note that the subsection refers to a health board or other person making available a family planning service.  The section is designed to ensure that in so far as a family planning service is provided there must also be provided access to information and advice on natural family planning methods.  In other words, to ensure that the patient will have access to natural family planning advice as well as to advice on other methods if they so wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's explanation but it still brings in the point I made that the emphasis on the natural family planning method to the exclusion of other methods referred to by Deputy de Valera, which were not referred to by the Minister, is a strange preoccupation with natural family planning.  Must a doctor who does not agree with it and who thinks that it would be wrong for his patient provide advice on this method, even if his patient comes to him for a IUD or the pill and so on?  Instead of the Minister telling the general practitioner to do something, the Minister is saying that the board must tell him to do something, that is, to provide this service within the services provided by the health board.  Is that the Minister's intention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no such intention. The principle is firmly enshrined in the Bill that nothing interferes with a doctor's clinical relationship with his patient.  The doctor is free to give his patient whatever advice he or she wishes.  Furthermore, the patient is entitled to seek any sort of advice or service. The Bill was designed to make artificial contraceptives available to those who require them for <i>bona fide</i> family planning purposes, so there is no question of interfering with the choice of the individual.  This section says&mdash;and I wish Deputy Browne would accept it on <Col N="633" /> its face value&mdash;that in so far as there is an agency or a health board providing a family planning service in a clinic, there shall be available in that clinic advice and information on natural family planning methods as well as other methods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that point.  The Deputy suggests that it is inefficient. I have just quoted some figures which say that natural family planning methods can be 98.5 per cent efficient. There is a large volume of medical opinion which favours natural family planning methods and a large number of people will avail only of such methods no matter what Deputy Dr. Browne or anybody else may think.  That is their outlook and approach to life.  I respect that.  I am making it mandatory on any family planning clinic providing a family <Col N="634" /> planning service to make available, side by side with any other method, information and advice on natural family planning.</P>

      <P>A doctor who finds himself in a family planning clinic will have to make available a service or give advice on a service with which he is not in clinical agreement.  There seems to be a contradiction in this subsection.  The section would be strengthened by leaving out this homily to the doctor that he need not do anything which is in conflict with his own clinical judgement in respect of any case.  Under subsection (5) it is mandatory on him to give advice that he may not agree with.</P>

      <P>There are medical practitioners who conscientiously could not advise natural family planning.  The necessity for the safety of the method, its simplicity and efficiency and also the multiple choices I have mentioned are pre-conditions involved in giving a woman advice which may be a matter of <Col N="635" /> life and death to her.

      <P>In the McGee case the lady was not allowed to plan her family. A question of death was involved.  There had already been a mistake in relation to one of the methods used.  She could not afford another mistake.  The question involved in contraception is efficiency, simplicity and safety.  In the McGee case tubal ligation would probably be the correct solution.  If a doctor is faced with a person coming to him for advice on what he thinks is the most efficient method and if he is working in a clinic which says he must tell her about this other form of family planning which is not as efficient, what is his position?  He is convinced there is a simple solution to her problem, for example that it is tubal ligation, the pill or IUD, use of the condom by her husband or a cap by herself or spermacides.  What is the purpose of asking a man to provide a service he does not agree with, on the one hand, and, on the other, telling him that nothing in the Bill will impose on him a commitment to give advice that he does not believe in?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is arguing for retention of the words his amendment proposes to delete.  Nothing in my approach to the Bill, and furthest from my mind, is any suggestion that a doctor should have to give advice in which he does not believe.  Deputy Browne stresses one side of that.  He asks why a doctor who does not believe in natural family planning methods should have to give advice on them.  The answer to that is that he will not have to.  The other side of the coin is that there are many medical practitioners who will not advise on family planning methods involving artificial contraception methods.  I know a number of such doctors.  They also are entitled to their professional freedom not to advise artificial contraceptives just as another doctor is equally free not to advise natural family planning methods if <Col N="636" /> that is his belief.  There is no compulsion in the legislation to compel a medical practitioner to advice anything he does not believe in and that cuts both ways.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any medical practitioners who have total animosity to natural family planning as Dr. Browne says some medical practitioners have. However, there may be some and, if there are, these words protect them fully from advising in favour of such methods.  Equally, and far more common, would be the case of medical practitioners who do not wish to advise their patients to use artificial contraceptives. They are also protected by these words. Everything points to the retention of the words in the subsection.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not see a contradiction?  I tried to take subsections (5) and (6) together because the contradiction appears to arise from the mandatory use of the words:</P>
      <P>shall ensure that the service includes information, instruction, advice and consultation in relation to methods of family planning that do not involve the use of contraceptives.</P>
      <P>If the doctor is the only doctor working in a clinic he must give advice that he may not believe in.</P>

      <P>The point made by the Minister is an interesting one because it is in complete conflict with the whole tenor of the Bill.  The Minister now says that it is possible to run a family planning clinic in which somebody will be giving advice on family planning other than a medical practitioner.  Although that other person will be an authority he will presumably not be a doctor.</P>

      <P>In any piece of legislation all sorts of artificial, hypothetical absurdities can be created; it does not take a very clever person to do that.  The essential thing here is that a clinic providing family planning services will be under the general supervision and direction of a particular general practitioner. It will be his responsibility to see to it that people coming there have access to advice and information about natural family planning methods whether or not he believes in them.  He does not clinically have to give that advice but if he is in charge of the clinic it is his function to make sure it is provided by some other person, another doctor or a trained person.  It is as simple as that.</P>

      <P>I want to make just one point.  Is the Minister not now accepting an important basic point?  The Minister is becoming a little bit anxious and a little impatient of the fact that we are examining this Bill seriously.  On the one hand he gets angry with the main Opposition parties because they did not examine the Bill and he is now getting angry with me because I am attempting to examine it seriously to the best of my ability.  The Bill is so full of contradictions and so capable of many interpretations. I am simply giving some of them here.  The final point which concerns us first is that a Minister's undertakings are worthless in a court of law.  What is going to be important is, for instance, a medical practitioner who is appointed to one of these clinics who happens to be a Jew, a Presbyterian, a member of the Church of Ireland or some other religion or simply a doctor who has none of these religions or a doctor who happens to believe that there is a particular planning service which should be made available for a particular lady in her situation; it is mandatory on him in this <Col N="638" /> clinic to give advice which he knows is worthless to the lady in the circumstances, or to appoint somebody else to give her advice which he knows is worthless.  How could he be considered as being in charge of the clinic if he makes arrangements for giving advice which he knows is worthless?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Browne is missing the point.  A family planning service within the meaning of subsection (6) can be a health board or any group that is authorised by the Bill to give it.  The doctor comes in in relation to the use of contraceptives and if he looks at subsection (4) he will see that.  It is in relation to the use of contraceptives that the medical profession is particularly involved. Subsection (6) is as the Minister explained.  I do not wish to delay the House by going into it.  Subsection (6) is the saver for the medical profession here: it does not compel them to give advice on anything else.  The fact is that the supervision of the registered medical practitioner is required in the restrictive case where there is advice or consultation in relation to the use of contraceptives and nothing else.  It is not general family planning at all and I think that disposes of Deputy Browne's point.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (6), line 40, after &ldquo;patient&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or of a pharmaceutical chemist in relation to the provision of information, instruction or advice to a person to whom he is selling contraceptives in accordance with this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has been put down at the suggestion of the pharmacy profession who are anxious to ensure that the terms of the Bill would not prevent them giving advice across the counter to persons to whom they are selling contraceptives <Col N="639" /> in pursuance of a prescription or authorisation.  I am not sure that they would have been prevented anyway as the Bill is framed but just to make sure that they will not be so prevented from giving that type of friendly advice for which they are invaluable in the community I am putting these words in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a new dimension introduced in the Bill now. We have discovered that pharmacists are being invited to give friendly advice in relation to these matters to their customers.  On Second Stage I asked the Minister whether he was satisfied that the provisions of the Consumer Information Act would not inhibit doctors or indeed others in relation to their dealings with people who went to them and who were not going to get advice or information in the normal medical way.  I wondered whether these two savers, the one in the original Bill under subsection (6) which Dr. Browne has been discussing and this amendment would have the effect of being savers in relation to groups or professions in so far as the Consumer Information Act is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say this about it.  This is tied to the fact that pharmacists can only be involved where there is a prescription.  It is exactly the same as when a doctor gives a prescription for drugs which the pharmacist provides; he will very often tell the patient he should not take something else with the particular drug, or drink too much or drive a car while taking it.  That is the type of advice that the Minister means and let us remember that there must be a prescription and the pharmacists are not free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point at all.  Deputy de Valera has not grasped the fact.  The doctor will not be empowered to issue a prescription or an authorisation; this is a new piece of doctor&mdash;pharmacist or doctor&mdash;patient jargon and there is no such authorisation mentioned in the various Acts regulating the medical profession or the pharmacists, but the pharmacists will now <Col N="640" /> have to act on an authorisation from the doctor who will now be required to write an authorisation as opposed to a prescription.  But the Consumer Information Act of 1978 states at section 6:</P>
      <P>If a person, in the course or for the purposes of a trade, business or profession&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) makes a statement which he knows to be false, or</P>
      <P>(b) recklessly makes a statement which is false&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>or a statement recklessly made which turned out to be false in relation to any service or convenience,</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>It goes on in subsection (3):</P>
      <P>In relation to any services consisting of or including the application of any treatment or process. . . the matters detailed in subsection (1) shall be taken to include the effect of the treatment, process or repair.</P>
      <P>The point was made on Second Stage that another similar provision in relation to a profession was not included in that similar section because of the difficulty for professions in giving advice which might turn out to have the effect or to have a contrary effect or to have effects which were not in the interests of the person to whom the advice was given.  I asked the Minister to clarify at that stage whether or not doctors would be affected by the provisions of the Consumer Information Act.  I did not deal with pharmacists at the time but the point arises now because of the Minister's amendment.  Would the Minister's amendment be a saver that would exclude them from having an aggrieved person seeking to take action against them under this Consumer Information Act?  That is the reason I ask the Minister this question and I hope he will deal with it.</P>

As it was suggested that the restrictions and the provisions of the family planning service might possibly prevent a pharmacist from dealing with one of his clients who <Col N="641" /> applied for contraceptives giving the sort of across-the-counter advice which he normally gives about the medicines he supplies, this amendment is to make sure that he will not be so prevented.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of objections to this section, some of which have been outlined by Deputy Browne in the course of the discussion on the amendment.  I do not propose to delay the House unnecessarily by reiterating those reservations.  It seems strange that all clinics will be obliged to provide information about natural family planning methods but clinics which apparently are exclusively to deal in natural family planning methods will not be in a position to make available advice or information on methods other than natural family planning methods.  I hope the Minister will clarify, in relation to this section, whether the advice and information which he proposes will be disseminated through health board family planning clinics will also contain information relating to non-natural family planning methods.  Although that is presumed in the Bill, I do not see it spelled out clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (1) of this section the Minister will make regulations to see that health boards provide family planning services.  In relation to those regulations a point which was raised on section 2 arises also on this section, how it is envisaged family planning clinics might be set up through the health boards.  Can the Minister indicate if there will be an even provision of services in different parts of the country, especially in the rural parts where I suggest the services might be more urgently needed than in some of the urban areas where may people have already made their own arrangements? I believe that in many rural parts of the country there are many poor people who are in urgent need of advice <Col N="642" /> in relation to family planning matters generally and who find it difficult to avail of such advice and services even under the present set-up because most of those centres are in large urban areas.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to clarify his intention in relation to the regulations which he will be obliged to make under subsection (1).  It would really be too bad, with all the other deficiencies in the Bill, if we were to discover in five years that some of the health boards were not operating a family planning service because they had not sufficient trained medical and other personnel, that they had no premises or had difficulty in their budgets.  It is important to have a procedure laid down under which the services are available on a nationwide basis within a reasonable length of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the general trend of what Deputy Boland is suggesting I believe I have taken care of it in section 2(1) where there is an obligation on the Minister to secure the orderly organisation of family planning services throughout the country.  That would be my approach.  We rely, first of all, on the general practitioner to supply a family planning service but should it appear that it is necessary to supplement that, then the health boards will be able to establish clinics where the need for them can be demonstrated.  These clinics will provide a full-scale family planning service in the sense that they will give information, advice and so on about artificial contraceptives as well as natural family planning methods.  It is my obligation to ensure that family planning services will be provided on an equally acceptable basis to all families throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that.

The Minister will appreciate that the type of service is not spelled out specifically in section 3.</P>

      <P>It is implicit in it, but if it were not contained in the regulations it might possibly be used afterwards by some of the health boards to provide a restrictive form of service.  There are two other matters of major concern.  The first is in relation to the scale of activities which the non-health board clinics could provide.  The section as it stands is very objectionable but there is a ministerial amendment in relation to 4 (1) (b) (i) which we may assume will be passed.  If that amendment is passed it will radically alter the position in relation to the clinics as set out in section 3 (3).  It makes it rather difficult to dicuss this section because the amendment in question is an amendment to a subsection of a later section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 as it stands will not allow any of the family planning clinics, no matter how satisfied the Minister is about their operation or about the responsible attitude they might adopt, to actually provide contraceptives. They may provide information, advice, instruction or consultation in relation to family planning methods but they will not be allowed <i>per se</i> to actually provide methods of contraception in the clinics.  People who go to one of those clinics will only be entitled to get advice. They will then have to leave the clinic to <Col N="644" /> get a prescription from their family doctor, if there is not a doctor in attendance in the clinic.  They will then go to a chemist to have the prescription dispensed or the authorisation fulfilled as the case may be.  It would appear from the later amendment, if it is accepted, that in a roundabout way the clinic will be allowed to distribute contraceptives through the involvement of a chemist or through the clinics acting as agents or servants of chemists.  The House is being invited to speak about this section in a vacuum.  I assume the amendment will be accepted and we can discuss the matter more fully at that stage.  The amendment would improve many of the unpalatable aspects of section 3.</P>
      <P>The other point under section 3 concerns me greatly.  It is becoming increasingly obvious that there is a need for trained personnel in the field of providing information and advice on family planning methods generally. Everybody, the Minister included, has accepted that.  It has become even more obvious that there is a need for a high level of training and skill on the part of the people dispensing information about methods of natural family planning.  The imparting of information about natural family planning methods, especially in connection with the Billings method, must be of the highest standard, because there can be a radical difference in the success of the method.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have been at pains to include in this section a requirement that where natural family planning advice was being disseminated, the people giving that advice were trained to a certain degree, presumably as specified in regulations to be made by the Minister.  That is not included in section 3.  Even at this stage I invite the Minister to consider amending section 3 on Report Stage by the inclusion of that requirement.</P>

Even in the limited way in which advice is disseminated at present, all those involved accept that there is a need for a high degree of skill.  I would have thought it very necessary that the obligation to have trained personnel disseminating that information should be included in the Bill and this is the appropriate section to do it.  I invite the Minister to comment on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister standing by his statement for providing family planning services?  He is on record as saying that the contraceptives prescribed would have to be paid for&mdash;appliances, condoms and so on at the health clinics. I would like him to clarify this point and I suspect this is the right section on which to do it.  What is his attitude to the card-holding person who goes to a family planning clinic for advice and is advised that he or she needs a particular form of contraceptive?  The Minister knows that at present a considerable number of women attend these family planning clinics, or their doctors, and can be provided with cycle regulators&mdash;I understand 38,000 women use the pill on prescription every month and this is a considerable number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My attitude would be in the light of the many social problems which we have failed to solve, such as unemployment, bad housing, lack of recreational facilities, the terrible prospects of jobs for youngsters and so on.  The urgency of these problems make it imperative that the service should be free to everybody who wants to use it. However, I suspect that is something that does not appeal to the Minister. There is a sector of the population, the lower income group, people who are eligible for free services and free facilities under those services and, as far as I can see, they will have to pay for these different kinds of contraceptive devices&mdash;from the pill to the condom. This is a retrograde step because under the Acts as they are at the moment the Minister can provide for family planning services, in certain circumstances, in the lower income group and they do not <Col N="646" /> have to pay.  Whether that is so or not, it is a fact that many of these 38,000 women are being prescribed the pill as cycle regulators and are able to get it free of charge.</P>
    <P>People with medical cards are predominantly the most needy, the people we should try to help before all others, because they are the unfortunate ladies who frequently live in overcrowded conditions, have difficult conditions in unemployment and employment, have money difficulties, already have too many children and, as I said on Second Stage in my own practice in working class areas, spend most of their lives in fear of the next pregnancy.  They are the kind of people who should be facilitated in every way possible.  Obviously the motivating force as far as I am concerned, in advocating contraception is, first, the protection of their health&mdash;this is agreed by practically everybody: the United Nations, the World Health Organisation and many other institutions and authorities in the world and, secondly, the availability of family planning or easy access at any rate to family planning and obviously easy access.  If you are in the lower income group it is quite possible that the cost of contraceptives, the IUD's&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy, we have discussed this rather extensively on section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am attempting to point out to the Minister that the statement that contraceptives prescribed would have to be paid for would impose a very great hardship on a very important sector of society: the lower income group for whom the general principle has been accepted in our legislation under all Governments that they must be assisted by the rest of the community.  They themselves pay for their health contribution. The employer pays to some extent. Therefore, the Minister insists that it is desirable that this service is provided by medical practitioners because it is a medical need.  Then why is it differentiated from other kinds of services that are provided as a result of a patient going to a doctor and getting a prescription for some kind of kidney complaint, <Col N="647" /> liver complaint, stomach complaint or the different kinds of ills that affect the human body?  Why should we restrict the free service to this kind of patient? Why should she be able to come along and get her prescription to get any kind of drug or appliance from the most innocuous to the most dangerous if it is in the opinion of the doctor medically desirable that she should have them?  In this situation, as was pointed out on a number of occasions, it is a matter of life or death for her that she gets some form of contraceptive protection, that in certain circumstances there is a hazard to her life, it is something which, if she does not have easy access to it, can subject her family to distress and disruption.  As we know well from dealing with this kind of person, it can endanger the security and happiness of her marriage.</P>
      <P>These three conditions are, of course, the three points made in the McGee case by the Supreme Court in attempting to establish&mdash;as was established&mdash;the right of ready accessibility to family planning contraceptive methods.  There is no doubt that for certain income groups this is no problem.  We should not impose on the lower income group the impediment of having to pay for this service which is sometimes quite costly.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell us what his attitude is?  Is any kind of service provided by these family planning clinics?  May such a person continue to have access to the pill freely?  May she have access to IUDs which would be quite expensive between fitting and supplying, to diaphraghms, spermacides and condoms?  Does she have any right at all to these services free?</P>

I have already explained on a number of occasions what exactly the position is.  If a medical practitioner prescribes any form of medicine or drugs for a patient for medical reasons and that patient is a medical card holder the GMS provisions apply.  In so far as a medical card holder goes to his or her GP for advice, consultation and information on family planning, in so far as the visit to the GP is concerned that visit comes within the provisions of the GMS. In so far as the person requires artificial contraceptives that person has to go to a pharmacist to procure those artificial contraceptives on the basis of a prescription or authorisation and to pay for them.</P>

      <P>There appears to be a conflict in what the Minister is saying. He must not become impatient.  On a number of occasions Deputy O'Connell and I during Question Time tried to get a simple statement on this from the Minister and we failed to do so.  There were some heated exchanges.  What we got was an assurance from the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He said &ldquo;When we are dealing with the Bill I will make the position quite clear in relation to the card-holding people who want to go to the family planning clinics.&rdquo; As a result of prescriptions which they get at the family planning clinics will these people have the right to be supplied with whatever the doctor there may order?  May they have a right of free access to these appliances, medicines, drugs or whatever he may authorise in his prescription?  Do the medical card holders have these free?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why the Deputy keeps referring to clinics. Basically this Bill provides that the availability of family planning services will be from the general medical practitioner. A person will go to the general medical practitioner for advice and information about family planning matters and, if it is called for, for a prescription or authorisation.  That person will then proceed with that authorisation or prescription to the pharmacist who will supply in the the normal way whatever is specified for which the person will pay. On the other hand, if a person is prescribed any drug or pill for medical reasons by the doctor and the person is a medical card holder, that person will have that provided free under the GMS as heretofore.  There is no change in that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify the position once more on this? For medical reasons he talks about going to a doctor and says that if a contraceptive is prescribed for medical reasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a distinction?  I presume &ldquo;medical reasons&rdquo; would be where a lady is worried, like in the <Col N="650" /> McGee situation, about becoming pregnant because she may lose her life.  Is the Minister making a distinction between the kind of situation where a doctor may say that a lady may lose her life if she has a child and the kind of situation where a lady states that she does not want to have more than one or two children?  Will the latter person, even though she is in the card-holding class and is at present getting the pill free as a cycle regulator, have to pay from now on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Any general medical card holder who has access to contraceptive drugs or pills is doing so for medical reasons.  Otherwise, these things cannot be prescribed.  In future, if a doctor prescribes any of these things for reasons other than family planning reasons, they come within the general medical service and will be supplied free. If they are supplied on prescription or authorisation under the terms of the Bill the patient will have to pay the pharmacist for them.  I am certain that Deputy Browne does not like that position but we can go on <i>ad infinitum</i> with this argument.  However, we always come back to the simple proposition which is involved here.  I believe that contraceptives should be available for family planning purposes and that their availability should be controlled and limited.  That is the manner in which I propose to control and limit them. Deputy Browne does not agree with that.  He wants contraceptives made available in an unlimited way, and everything we say comes back to that central argument.  Can we not, once and for all, dispense with it?  Can he not understand where I stand, what I have in the Bill and what my approach is?  He should vote against my approach or for it, as he sees it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has established that family planning is a medical need because he insists that a doctor be there to provide family planning advice.  It is wrong to say that I am looking for unlimited provision of these services.  I said I would like it, but I restricted my case to the medical card holder.  Therefore, I am not suggesting that there should be an unlimited supply of these, even though my views are otherwise.  In relation to medical card holders the Minister is attempting to establish that a prescription would be needed.  The prescription usually implies the provision of something which is medically needed by the patient.  Any other prescription given by a doctor to a patient under the medical card scheme would be paid for by the State.  I should like to know why that does not apply in relation to family planning, which in certain instances according to all the authorities, the WHO, the UN and all parties here, should be a facility readily available?  Those services should be provided for card holders free of charge <Col N="652" /> and I should like to know why the Minister does not accept that in respect of family planning services?</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that he will examine the question I raised in relation to ensuring that the personnel who will give information in relation to the natural methods will have sufficient training and expertise.  I find it difficult to follow the Minister's logic in allowing a doctor to charge for the giving of information and advice to a medical card holder or the writing of a prescription against the general medical services and not allowing the cost of dispensing the prescription or filling the authorisation.  I could follow the Minister's logic if he decided that the making available of contraceptives was not a medical matter, but to follow that logic through he would also have to state that a medical card holder would be obliged to pay a doctor for a visit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>My simple logic is that the provision of advice by a family practitioner under the Bill is permissible under the normal general medical service provisions but the supply of contraceptives will not be borne by the taxpayer under that service.  It is a simple and clear-cut principle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would think that the Committee of Public Accounts or the Comptroller and Auditor General would find it difficult to follow the fact that I must pay a doctor for advice and signature on an authorisation for condoms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would give me the name of a doctor who will do that for nothing.  I would have to go to a doctor and pay and then go to a chemist and pay. However, a medical card holder will not pay the doctor but must pay the chemist. I cannot understand the logic of writing an authorisation within the GMS as a charge against the GMS.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that puzzles me.  A woman who is a medical card holder can have the pill prescribed for her as a cycle regulator which also happens to have the effect of inhibiting conception. If a doctor decided that she no longer needs the pill for that purpose and she then asks to have it prescribed so that it may continue to inhibit conception she must pay the chemist.  It is even more difficult to follow the fact that if she decides to discontinue the pill and her husband decides to commence using condoms, he must visit the doctor where he gets the advice and authorisation free but must pay the chemist for them.  Does the Minister envisage a situation where a doctor within the general medical service might decide to prescribe the condom as a prophylactic.</P>

I am assuming, for instance, that the fact that a doctor will be obliged to write on a prescription that it is being <Col N="654" /> written in accordance with the Family Planning Bill, 1978, is to allow the pharmacist to distinguish between a prescription written in accordance with this Bill and which does not qualify in terms of a general medical service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The first half of the amendment is designed to meet that request.  The second half arises because during the course of discussion on the Bill it appeared that in certain circumstances it would be desirable, if a health board is providing family planning services in the clinic, that a pharmacist would attend there and supply the contraceptives in <Col N="659" /> response to prescriptions or authorisations made out by medical practitioners.</P>
    <P>My approach to sections 3 and 4 of the Bill is that family planning services in future will be supplied principally by the general practitioner to his patients as an integral part of our family doctor service. There is a need to supplement the service provided by the general practitioners and this situation can be met through clinics established under the health boards.  There is also provision whereby other persons or bodies may be authorised to provide a family planning service.  When I speak of family planning services being provided in clinics, whether they are under the control of the health board or otherwise, this does not include the sale of contraceptives at such clinics.</P>
    <P>Anybody who wishes to organise family planning services not exclusively related to natural family planning will, under section 3 (3), be controlled in the provision of services and cannot organise those services except with the consent of the Minister in accordance with the regulations he will make.  Under that subsection my consent will not be given unless I am satisfied that it is in the public interests to give it and that the service is reasonably required to meet a need.  Any organisation providing family planning services under the section will have to comply with the provisions. They will be required to see that the service is under the general direction and supervision of a doctor if it involves the use of contraceptives and they will also have to ensure that the service covers natural family planning methods.  Any organisation providing family planning services in the future will have to comply with section 7 of the Bill under which the advertising of contraceptives or contraception or the display of contraceptives and so on will be controlled.</P>
    <P>Any organisation involved in family planning services under health boards or other bodies will not be allowed to go into the business of selling and providing contraceptives.  This section clearly limits the sale of contraceptives to pharmaceutical chemists.  It also sets out the limitations as to the circumstances and <Col N="660" /> places in which contraceptives may be sold.  It is essential that those agencies involved in providing family planning services should not have a commercial interest in the sale of contraceptives.  The medical practitioners and clinics will issue authorisations or prescriptions for contraceptives but the pharmacist will supply them.  This amendment will allow pharmacists to sell contraceptives at a place where family planning services are organised.  This is simply for the mutual convenience of pharmacists and the general public and will not cut across the principles which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is enacted I will consider in detail whether there is any need to organise clinics under section 3 (3) for the operation of family planning services outside the health board system.  This will have to be done in the context of the legislation with full consideration being given to those who wish to adopt natural family planning methods and will have to conform with the ordinary organisation of the family planning service provisions of this legislation.  If any clinics are to be authorised they will be subject to the provisions of this legislation in regard to the sale of contraceptives and advertising.  If any organisation now providing family planning services wish to continue to do so, they will have to apply for a licence.  I will examine any such application under section 3 (3) and, if it is clearly established that it is in the public interest that it should be authorised, they will have to comply fully with the provisions of the legislation mainly in regard to doctor's prescriptions or authorisations, sale through pharmacists only, medical supervision, natural family planning advice being emphasised and provided, and control of advertising.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this amendment as framed might make it possible for a particular clinic to become the agent of a pharmacist and therefore to be able to supply contraceptives.  That is not intended.  If on further consideration that appears to be so, I shall have to introduce a further amendment on Report Stage to make the position absolutely clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of people will be either very vexed or very pleased by the Minister's explanation of the intention of this amendment.  When I first read it my interpretation was that the Minister had put forward a device whereby the existing family planning clinics could continue to supply contraceptives through acting as agents for a chemist, or where they entered into some suitable arrangement with a chemist and that chemist is satisfied that the clinic is operating in a responsible manner.  During Second Stage the point was made to the Minister that before a clinic could operate under section 3 (3) it would have to obtain a licence from him. Obviously that would not be forthcoming unless the Minister was satisfied as to the manner and make-up of the clinic and unless he was satisfied that the personnel operating the clinic were doing so in the public interest and in a manner consonant with his thinking in relation to this legislation.  The point was made forcefully, especially by Deputy Browne, that at the present time the clinics derive much of their income from the sale of contraceptives following the imparting of advice in relation to them and that if they were to lose that revenue it would have serious financial consequences for their future viability.</P>
      <P>All of us appreciated the Minister's difficulty in that he was almost certainly experiencing a degree of difficulty and opposition from within his own party in relation to how far he might go in the licensing of clinics or how he might authorise them to operate in the future.  I must confess that when I read this amendment to section 4 I thought the Minister had come across with a rather clever device whereby he could allow clinics to be licensed, that by adding this amendment to section 4 the clinics could make an arrangement with a pharmaceutical chemist whereby they would act as his servant or agent and dispense contraceptives and perhaps in certain instances the chemist might attend at the clinics in order to conduct that sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears now from what the Minister has said that his intention was not as far-reaching and, on the face of it, his device by way of the amendment was not as devious and clever as I had <Col N="662" /> thought.  The Minister is claiming it is not his intention to allow the clinics to operate the sale of contraceptives but merely that they might make an arrangement with a pharmacist so that he could dispense contraceptives at the clinic for the convenience of the public.  I am presuming the Minister is saying he wanted to get over the objection that I and other speakers raised of a person going to a clinic for advice, of then going to a doctor, leaving him to go to a pharmacist in order to get the contraceptives, and that in order to short-circuit that route he is hoping a doctor and a pharmacist would be in attendance at the clinic at all times.</P>
    <P>The Minister now appears to be at pains to point out that it is not his intention to allow the clinic to act as a servant or agent of the pharmacist.  If that is so, the guarded welcome that some people were giving the amendment will be even more guarded.  Irrespective of whether or not that is the Minister's intention, there is no doubt in my mind that that is the effect the amendment would have and that is the effect in law that the amendment would have when read in conjunction with the subsection.  If passed the section would read:</P>
    <P>4. (1) A person shall not sell contraceptives unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b) (i) he is, or is a servant or agent acting as such of, a pharmaceutical chemist, or a dispensing chemist and druggist, who keeps open shop for the compounding and dispensing of medical prescriptions in accordance with the provisions of the Pharmacy Acts, 1875 to 1977, and the sale is at the place where he so keeps open shop or at a place where family planning services are made available under section 3 of this Act.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that, if a family planning clinic were to persuade a pharmacist to appoint them as his agent or servant, under a strict interpretation of that amended paragraph they would be entitled to carry out the dispensing of contraceptives. Of course the profit, if any, would accrue to the chemist unless he wanted to make some private arrangement to forego it and to devote it to the clinic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> It is difficult now to know the full intent of the Minister's amendment.  He is saying now that his intention in the amendment was less than we envisaged when we read it and that, if the amendment has the effect that it appears to have on the section, he will further amend that amendment on Report Stage.  That makes this already complicated Bill even more difficult to deal with.  It would be helpful if the Minister in the course of this discussion made his intention clear to us as to whether he thinks the amendment will have the effect which I have stated it will have and, if it is going to have that effect, whether we are to assume there is to be a further amendment on Report Stage.  Certainly it leaves the House in a very difficult position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the amendment is simply intended for the convenience of the pharmacist and his clients.  It has been pointed out to me that an interpretation of it might mean that a clinic could be deemed to be the agent of a pharmacist and therefore would be entitled to actually supply contraceptives. That is not my intention.  If on further consideration that argument appéars to be sustained, I shall have to bring in an amendment on Report Stage to make sure that what I intend is given effect to fully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Boland, I assumed that this was an amendment which was intended to make it possible for the family planning clinics to survive. Their source of financing stems from their capacity to sell contraceptives. They have provided an excellent service. It appears now that the Minister is positively vindictive about these clinics and, lest they might be able to come to some arrangement with the chemist by acting as his agent and in that way earn enough money to keep their doors open, the Minister is deliberately going to circumvent that possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the Minister's intention it seems to be an extraordinarily vindictive approach to adopt about a service which all of us must admit was way ahead of <Col N="664" /> its time.  It was provided because it was needed and not, as this Bill appears to have been provided, simply because of a Supreme Court decision.  The service provided in the clinics is remarkably economical.  They are well run and administered. Nobody could fault them on the quality of the professional standards maintained on the nursing, social welfare and medical sides.  They give psychosexual advice and provide services for examination of breast and cervical cancer; there is pregnancy testing.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister reach out in this way to prevent these people from providing this very valuable service when it does not appear that he would be able to provide a service for a very long time?  The service provided by these people is recognised by his Department. Training carried out by them in their clinics is recognised by the Minister's Department in regard to the recoupment of the cost of fees and so on of medical and other personnel taking the recognised course of the Joint College of General Practitioners and the College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  Even accepting the Minister's strange provision that there must be a medical practitioner prescribing for medical and non-medical contraceptives within a clinic, why is it that he will not facilitate these people in keeping existing services going by allowing them to come to some arrangement with the chemists?  A financial arrangement could be worked out between them, possibly in the form of an agency, which would allow them to carry on.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that he will bring in an amendment to his own amendment is a window on the Minister's mind which indicates he is particularly anxious that these clinics should cease to provide a service.  If this is so and the rest of the Bill stands and existing clinics are put out of action, the situation will be completely hopeless.  It is very difficult to understand in any terms why the Minister is doing this.  It has not been suggested by anybody in the course of this debate that these clinics are not providing a very fine service, within the limitations of their facilities and their financial situation. In addition to the service provided for the 11,000 or 12,000 who visit the <Col N="665" /> clinics, there is a postal service, when such is possible, and various other facilities.  Why should the Minister set out to close these clinics, as appears to be his intention?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not setting out to be vindictive to anybody in this legislation. I am bringing in the legislation to meet an urgent social problem, even a medical problem.  In dealing with that problem I have enshrined in this legislation certain principles.  One of these principles is that contraceptives shall be made available only on a doctor's prescription or authorisation and then shall be available only through pharmacists. That is the basic principle of the Bill and all the huffing and puffing here in the Dáil will not change that approach. If I were to change that principle I would have to abandon the legislation entirely and come forward with some completely different set of proposals.</P>
      <P>If it is necessary for a health board to establish a family planning service clinic they will have to adhere to that fundamental principle.  If it transpires that some other group of persons, organisation, body or hospital feel that there is a need for the provision of a family planning service in a certain area or in a certain way and they wish to establish a clinic, they will have to get a licence and conduct that clinic in accordance with the principles of this legislation.  I do not believe that it is in any way difficult for any family planning clinic to conduct their affairs in future under the legislation in accordance with the principles of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> I do not think it is desirable that we should have a clinic supplying or purporting to supply important medical services supported only on the sale of contraceptives. I say this <i>en passant</i> because it will not be relevant once the Bill comes into effect.  Does anyone think it is desirable that in order to supply a range of fundamentally important medical services a clinic comes into existence and is enabled to do so by the sale of contraceptives, which nobody else can sell because the law prohibits it?  I do not think that is a desirable situation.</P>
    <P>This Bill will bring about a situation where family planning services will be provided comprehensively for all people as they are needed and provided in accordance with the principles of this legislation.  If any group of persons, whether running an existing clinic or not, wish to provide any service in the family planning field they will have to get a licence and conform to the provisions of this legislation, which make a clear distinction between the provision of family planning services and the sale of contraceptives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's extraordinary statement in introducing this amendment, it would be far better to consider withdrawing it.  He tells us that he will almost certainly have it amended and that seems to be confirmed by the remarks of Deputy Vivion de Valera. Apart from our acceptance or otherwise of the Bill, it might be better for our comprehension of how it will finally turn out if the Minister were to withdraw this amendment and tell us what he intends. It appears as if the Minister made an attempt at meeting some of the case that was made and is now being made to withdraw from that position once again. It might be more helpful to the House to withdraw this amendment and introduce an amendment which he thinks he can successfully put before the House.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, aware that 1979 has been designated International Year of the Child and that in the Republic of Ireland four Ministers are currently responsible for the position of children in Irish society, calls on:</P>
      <P>1. <i>The Minister for Health for:</i></P>
      <P>1.1 an early final report from the Task Force on Child Care Services and the introduction of new children's legislation before the end of 1979.</P>
      <P>1.2 the establishment of a Child Care Development Unit in the Department of Health, following the Government's decision to assign primary responsibility for child care services to the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>1.3 the establishment of a National Council for Child Care Services to report to the Minister for Health on the operation and development of all child care services.</P>
      <P>1.4 the referral of the following issues to receive top priority in the new Child Care Development Unit,</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) the planning of a national campaign for the recruitment and support of foster parents,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) a review of the staffing and financing of residential child care facilities.</P>
      <P>1.5  provision to meet the grave need for central and regional planning in relation to the educational and day-care needs of pre-school children.</P>
      <P>1.6 the expansion of opportunities for pre-service and in-service training and support for non-residential social workers and residential care staff working in the area of child care.</P>
      <P>2.  <i>The Minister for Education for:</i></P>
      <P>2.1  an immediate reduction in the size of infant classes National Schools, as a matter of urgent priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> 2.2  the extension of the Schools' Psychological Services to cover all primary schools.</P>
    <P>2.3  the expansion of the Free School Meals Scheme and the Free Books Scheme, and the rationalisation of eligibility procedures.</P>
    <P>2.4  a major review of the Department's role in relation to troublesome children.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>The Minister for Justice for:</i></P>
    <P>3.1 the immediate closure of Loughan House as a children's prison.</P>
    <P>3.2 considerable improvements in the pre-service and in-service training of gardaí to facilitate them in dealing with children and young people.</P>
    <P>3.3 the immediate abolition of the highly discriminatory concept of illegitimacy.</P>
    <P>3.4 an extension of the scope of the proposed constitutional referendum on adoption to include a provision to ensure the primacy of a child's welfare in any disputes affecting his care or custody.</P>
    <P>3.5 the funding of research on adoption and the introduction of statutory minimum standards of practice to apply to adoption agencies.</P>
    <P>3.6 the introduction of a system of independent, though not necessarily legal, representation for children involved in judicial disputes affecting their care or custody.</P>
    <P>3.7 easier and more frequent access for children to parents who are in prison.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>The Minister for Social Welfare for:</i></P>
    <P>4.1 the immediate introduction of realistic children's allowances to combat child poverty.</P>
    <P>5.  <i>The Minister for the Environment for:</i></P>
    <P>5.1 greatly increased investment in local authority housing and improved access for families with children to other forms of housing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> 5.2 stricter and more extensive requirements by planning authorities for the provision of recreational facilities for children in new and existing housing estates and near their homes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This motion is based on the manifesto issued by CARE and it is a list of the legislative and other proposals for reforming the area of child care which we feel would bring about a situation which would improve the condition of children in Irish society.  We are in 1979, International Year of the Child, the 20th anniversary of the UN declaration on the rights of the child, a declaration which sought to provide for children the right to affection, love and understanding, to adequate nutrition and medical care, to free education, to full opportunity for play and recreation, to a name and nationality, to special care if handicapped, to be among the first to receive relief in times of disaster, to learn to be a useful member of society, to develop individual abilities, to be brought up in a spirit of peace and universal brotherhood and to enjoy these rights regardless of race, colour, sex, religion, nation or social origin.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that the International Year of the Child aimed at affording each country an opportunity to examine the special problems of children within the area of that country's jurisdiction. It aimed at affording an opportunity to adults to put the children of our State in their rightful place in the centre of national concern.  It is worth mentioning a recent statement by Peter Ustinov which I happened to hear on a radio programme during one of his many visits to this country when he told us that the world spent in one and a half hours as much on armaments as it spends on its children for a full year.</P>
    <P>This places in perspective the sense of values we have at international and national level.  Four months of 1979 have now elapsed and we see very little progress in this area.  It is because we see so little progress and because we are not satisfied with what progress there is in the area of legislation and Government activities generally that we have tabled this motion.  The Minister opposite, the <Col N="670" /> Minister for Health, is the co-ordinating Minister for the purposes of the Year of the Child.  He has established a steering committee.  At the outset I can say that there is an impressive calendar of activity for the year and I should like to give credit to charitable and voluntary organisations that have taken on themselves the task of trying to highlight the plight of children and improve their condition during this year and to increase the awareness of both legislators and the general public of the condition of children particularly children in greatest need of assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister in launching the International Year of the Child in a statement on 18 December 1978 said that at present nearly one-third of our population is made up of children.  This is the best part of one million people.  This proportion is high compared with other European countries.  On the same scale Ireland had the highest birth rate compared with its neighbours.  This means that we have a very large segment of our population which is totally dependent on the remainder for its well-being.  The important question for the future is: how do we cope with this challenge?  He said it was hoped that the International Year of the Child would further stimulate us all to meet this challenge so that we can better plan for the future.</P>
    <P>First, I should like to say that I am sincerely hopeful that in the period of less than eight months remaining of this year an effort will be made to make up for the lack of activity in the first four months.  Indeed, some Government action in that four months has been in the reverse direction.  There has been very little in the way of law reform or in the area of children's rights so far.  On the economic side, there has been action which has been completely detrimental to the interests of children, particularly the children of people of lesser means. There has been no increase in children's allowances.  There has been the removal of food subsidies which has militated very much against families with children&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy say that there was no increase in children's allowances?</P>

    <Col N="671" />
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected there.  I am sorry; I confused that with tax allowances.  I withdraw that.  In the area of children's allowances we could come up with far greater increases because the increases in that area, as in the case of social welfare allowances, have never borne and do not now bear any relationship to what it costs to maintain a child.  In the removal of food subsidies action was taken which I think was detrimental particularly to families with a large number of children at the lower end of the financial scale.  I noted at the time, and I repeat it now because milk is a commodity consumed largely by children, that the purchase by a family of three or four children of six bottles of milk per day results in increased expenditure of £1.47 per week through the removal of the subsidies alone.  This militated against families with children and against the interests of children.</P>
      <P>Many people with large families live in local authority rented accommodation and a recent action by the Minister for the Environment in introducing a new graded rents scheme, a revised scheme, also militated against children to a great extent&mdash;but not a very much greater extent because the schemes in the past were not very much in the interests of children.  The rent allowance, as of now, is of the order of £1.30 per child.  One gets an additional allowance on one's rent of £1.30 for every additional child in the family.  As a local councillor, I worked out that a family living on a very modest wage of £50 per week with no children would pay a rent of £7.10.  If that family had four children they would pay £6.10.  So, a concession of £1 per week is made for the sustenance of four children of a family occupying a local authority house.  The situation has not been improved of late while all the rents have been increased of late and therefore I suggest this is another area where on the economic level the condition of children has been worsened rather than improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have tabled this resolution which we hope provides a list of improvements we feel can and must be made during the coming year if we are to improve the conditions of the children of this State. We ask the Minister for Health to <Col N="672" /> provide an early final report from the Task Force on Child Care Services and the introduction of new children's legislation before the end of 1979.  I understand that the Minister has gone on record as saying he intends to have that legislation introduced in the very near future.  It is reasonable for us to express concern because the task force has not yet reported.  I do not say that as a criticism of the task force.  I am quite prepared to accept that there may be difficulties. Perhaps they have not got adequate staff or adequate facilities.  I am not sure.</P>
    <P>I know Government committees sometimes have problems but, there are undue delays in publishing reports of this nature.  Unless this task force reports at a very early stage, the Minister will find difficulty in introducing the legislation which he has promised in the area of children's rights before the end of 1979.  We are now into May and in two months the Dáil will be going into recess.  That means we will have about five months to enact the legislation we feel must be enacted before the end of 1979.</P>
    <P>We believe the changes we call for in sections 1.2 and 1.3 of this resolution are fundamental, necessary, structural changes.  If they are implemented they will lead to lasting improvements.  In the Department a unit will be operating, and outside the Department there will be a National Council for Child Care Services which will be free to make recommendations, to put on pressure, and to educate public opinion.  They will also be available to the Minister for consultation. This would be a basic, fundamental, structural change which would lay the framework for improving the lot of children in the future.</P>
    <P>In section 1.4 we talk about a national campaign for the recruitment of foster parents.  About 2,500 children are in public care, mostly in residental care. There is a very grave need for foster parents for those children.  It is reasonable to suggest that the health boards could do more to promote the idea of fosterage and to sell the idea to couples who could undertake it.  It may <Col N="673" /> be that they need extra staff, extra funds and extra help to get this idea across.  It is a very valuable and useful idea for the welfare of children in residental homes.</P>
    <P>In section 1.5 we talk about provision to meet the grave need for central and regional planning in relation to the educational and day-care needs of pre-school children.  This is a vital service for deprived children and for all children. There are no national standards for private health care.  Anyone can set up a créche or a play group.  More and more mothers have to take up paid employment outside the home because of economic necessity.  It is vital that we develop this service properly.  We cannot settle for less than proper State supervised standards in this area.</P>
    <P>We are looking for the expansion of opportunities for pre-service and in-service training and support for non-residential social workers and residential care staff working in the area of child care.  There is no nationally based monitoring of child care courses.  This is a new educational area which will help to determine the shape of the service for many years to come.  There is also a need for advanced courses for people who are already in the service, people who have already done the basic courses necessary.</P>
    <P>We move on to another Minister who is concerned with child care.  We ask the Minister for Education to provide an immediate reduction in the size of infant classes in national schools as a matter of urgent priority.  That speaks for itself. Children leave a personal relationship with their parents and have to adapt to a school situation.  That is difficult and traumatic for a child, but in overcrowded classes it is much more so. A child who is deprived educationally or intellectually does not get fair play in an overcrowded classroom.  We must try to eliminate overcrowding in infant classes.</P>
    <P>We also call for the extension of the schools' psychological services to cover all primary schools.  A preventive service would be beneficial to all deprived children and it would also be beneficial to society.  We call for the expansion of the free school meals scheme and the free books scheme and the rationalisation <Col N="674" /> of eligibility procedures.  Everybody knows the free school meals scheme is inadequately financed, under-funded and operates in specified areas only, defined urban areas.  There are large urban areas where there is a need for the scheme and sometimes in rural areas perhaps there is an even greater need for this scheme.  It is very much a hit and miss scheme and it is missing a great number of our children.</P>
    <P>The free book scheme is also underfinanced and operates in such a way that many of the teachers involved are not very anxious to administer it.  The Minister for Education should expand and improve this scheme in the interests of our children.  We also call for a major review of the Department's role in relation to troublesome children.  Has the proposed centre at Lusk been put on the long finger?  There is an urgent need for it and no impetus should be lost in providing it.</P>
    <P>We move on to the area of responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  Many requests and demands are made to the Minister for Justice in the area of child care.  In this lengthy motion which we are proposing to the House we ask for the immediate closure of Loughan House.  There was a lengthy debate in this House and outside it on the subject of Loughan House.  At the time it was proposed we were completely opposed to this concept, and we are still totally opposed to it.  It was implemented in spite of the best advice of all the caring organisations at the time, which was freely forthcoming.  The Minister's proposals differed from the recommendations of the Task Force on Child Care.  The great concern of all of us was that money was expended on the conversion of that house which could have been well spent on child care services throughout the community.</P>
    <P>The excellent document submitted by CARE at that time suggested that the sum spent on the conversion and equipment of Loughan House would have provided 30 places in special schools recommended by the task force in Dublin.  It was suggested that the cost of maintaining the 40 boys in Loughan House, at an estimated cost of £6,000 <Col N="675" /> each, would have paid for one social worker or one youth officer per boy. Those objections at that time have been sustained since.</P>
    <P>We in this party appreciated at that time that bad environment, bad housing, inadequate education and appalling unemployment conditions all contributed to the problem of youth delinquency. This problem had been brought about by many years of neglect of the problems of the underprivileged, child neglect in particular. We appreciated that one-third of all the children in the State depend on parents who themselves are dependent on the State for maintenance and who have inadequate living conditions.  Our call in the motion for the closing of that children's prison is in keeping with the stand we have taken on this subject.</P>
    <P>We also call for the immediate abolition of discrimination in regard to illegitimacy. I draw the attention of the House to the Labour Party's Private Members' Bill to amend the Constitution which, in addition to making sound, constitutionally, existing adoption orders, sought to eliminate the concept of illegitimacy from our society, to make child welfare paramount and to amend Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution by deleting the words &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible&rdquo; as they apply to parents' and family rights.  The Bill sought to remove doubts as to whether Irish adoption laws making the child's welfare paramount contravened the Constitution.  It will be remembered that the courts had decided that the family is a family based on marriage.  Such a situation discriminates against children born out of wedlock.  Our proposal in that Bill included the words &ldquo;equality of rights under the law shall not be denied to any child on the basis of status of birth or parentage&rdquo; and sought to bring about a situation in which the concept of illegitimacy would be abolished.  That is included in this motion.</P>
    <P>Also in that Bill we sought to extend the privilege of adoption to children whose parents may have abandoned them or who no longer care for them or who abuse them in any way.  It was a very sad reflection on the stand taken by the <Col N="676" /> Minister and the Government that, having decided to have a referendum on adoption, these highly desirable changes on children's rights, the one to abolish the shameful concept of illegitimacy which nobody would stand over, which denies the child born out of wedlock the right to succession, the opportunity given in our Bill was not taken.  We now repeat our request to the Minister concerned to include such provisions in legislation and in a referendum in order to redress the discriminatory situation that exists as far as children are concerned.</P>
    <P>This motion also asks for independent representation, not necessarily legal, for children involved in court proceedings.  It is being assumed wrongly that in all cases the interests of the child are synonymous with those of the parents in questions of conflict, of violence, of child battering and many other areas in which the child's interests are separate from the interests of parents.  We therefore seek independent representation of some kind in cases of children in judicial disputes.</P>
    <P>There is also a request in the motion for easier and more frequent access for children whose parents are in prison.  I understand the Minister has taken some action in this area and that there is provision for visits.  Such visits from their children should be in addition to any other visits prisoners might get from any other source.  It is a minor matter which the Minister could implement without difficulty.</P>
    <P>That brings me on to the Minister for Social Welfare.  We are seeking the immediate introduction of realistic children's allowances in order to combat child poverty.  We have never had any realisation in our social welfare legislation of the real needs of children or what it costs to maintain a child.  We have had varying rates of child allowances.  I do not know what such rates are based on but they do not reflect any real appreciation of what it costs to maintain a child. We should make some effort to combat the want and the suffering and the poverty which are the lot of so many children here.</P>
    <P>In so far as possible, there is a need for co-ordination of services for children on a national basis.  The Minister for the <Col N="677" /> Environment could do a great deal to try to eliminate the extraordinarily bad housing conditions in both urban and rural areas.  They militate mostly against children.  A great deal of the tensions which result in violence, in unhappiness, even in breakdowns of marriages, have their origins in bad housing.  I say that deliberately from my widespread experience of the needs of my constituents, both urban and rural.  There are tensions created by living with in-laws, in overcrowded conditions.  A little more space, not to mention comfort or amenities, would eliminate such tensions. Some of the hardships would never have arisen or could have been redressed if we were to mend the bad housing conditions which apply generally. I know of the position in Cork city and I am sure they are worse in Dublin. In Cork there are families of four and five still awaiting rehousing even though they have been three years on a waiting list.  As elsewhere, there are marriages in that city on the verge of breakdown because there are no prospects of early rehousing.  Money spent in this area would be an investment in the future health and happiness of the people.</P>
    <P>We are also calling for better facilities for people generally and for children in particular.  The tendency is to develop large council and private estates without providing for the needs of the people who will live in those estates.  We are now thinking of providing necessary facilities for children in some public and private estates.  By the time the facilities are provided the children will have outgrown them.  Our planning laws should be firmer in this regard.  Builders are able to present plans for estates leaving one-tenth of the total area as an open space. These areas are often beside roads and are often used for road widening purposes. We are still developing estates without providing community halls, youth centres and open spaces.  Young couples who move into new houses after a long waiting period are not in a position to choose and often take the first house available.  Some of them become vocal after a while about the lack of facilities.</P>
    <P>The onus is on us to provide a proper environment in which children can <Col N="678" /> develop into responsible human beings. In this the International Year of the Child we are seeking to make an impact in regard to these matters.  In the time available to us it is not possible to explain in detail all our legislative proposals.  We are seeking to highlight the plight of children who have been denied their rights, the plight of children who, in extreme cases, are the victims of tension and violence in their homes, the plight of children who are condemned to spend their formative years in institutions. Steps should be taken to improve the lot of all our children.  The children are the vulnerable members of the community and they are also the future of the State.  There will be no lobbying and no concerted public demand in respect of children other than the demands of the caring societies.</P>
    <P>We are here to represent the adults who voted for us and we are morally obliged to provide a better environment for the weak, the underprivileged and the children.  The Government should utilise the remainder of the year to introduce a charter of rights which will lay a foundation for a better deal for children.  We are seeking the approval of the House for this motion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;approves of the continuing action being taken by the Government to improve the quality of life for Irish children.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Labour Party to table this motion in the terms in which they have is difficult to understand.  It does not afford the House an opportunity of dealing realistically with the various matters involved.  Because of the rules governing Private Members' time I will have an opportunity to reply now and the Minister for Justice will have an opportunity to reply tomorrow, but neither the Minister for Education nor the Minister for the Environment will be able to deal with the various matters raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> The Labour Party have simply taken the manifesto of CARE and put it down as a Private Members' motion, which is an unsatisfactory way to deal with this important matter.  It would have been more advantageous if they had selected some items, brought them forward as positive proposals and asked the House to discuss them as such.  At best, we can only have a quick run through the various items in the CARE manifesto. My colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Education, would like to be able to talk about their plans under the various headings but they will not have an opportunity of doing so.  Therefore, a great deal of this CARE manifesto will have to go by default.  However, we may get another opportunity of dealing with the various items included in the Labour motion.  I award a very high priority, both in a personal and official capacity, to improving the quality of life of children who, for one reason or another, cannot enjoy a happy and stable childhood.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to repeat that the United Nations designated 1979 as the International Year of the Child.  It is important that we all agree that making progress in the area of the welfare of children in this year must occupy a central position in planning activities in all Departments.  One of the objectives of the year is to review and evaluate existing policies and priorities in services for children.  Deputies will agree that it is important that that review should not be confined to this House or to Departments but should extend to all agencies and voluntary organisations and all those who have a function and role in dealing with children either at local or national level.  If we examine existing services and explore new ways of helping deprived children we would make an important contribution to the year.</P>
    <P>We should keep an open mind on how best the needs of children can be met.  In doing that one of the essential elements is to promote and encourage a spirit of co-operation between the different agencies and personnel working in different areas.  That is of crucial importance.  It would be very detrimental if we had occupational <Col N="680" /> jealousies or institutional conflicts in this area.  One of the first objectives we must set ourselves is mutual co-operation and a helpful attitude throughout the different bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the items in the manifesto for which I have specific responsibility, I am happy to report that developments have taken place and others are planned.  The first item mentioned by Deputy Mrs. Desmond was the Task Force on Child Care Services.  I assure the Deputy that I am anxious to get the final report because it will be the basis of many things, including new legislation.  I am committed to introducing legislation this year and hope to adhere to that commitment although it is becoming a little uncertain at the moment. The task force are working very hard at their job and at endeavouring to complete the report.  An enormous amount of progress has been made but there are real, fundamental difficulties.  It is as well that the House and the public should know that this is one of the most difficult and contentious of all public administrative and legislative areas.</P>
    <P>In reply to a specific point made by Deputy Mrs. Desmond, I have made available all the staff needed to ensure the work is processed as quickly as possible. I have three full-time officers in the Department of Health allocated to the task force.  There will be no hold up in that regard.  I asked Judge Séan Butler, who is a very active and committed member of the Judiciary, to undertake the chairmanship of it.  I know from my personal contact with the situation that they have devoted themselves to the task.  As soon as I receive the report there will be no delay whatever about bringing forward the legislation.</P>
    <P>There are central questions which have to be decided.  Although we are all impatient to get on with the work it is important that the decisions made should be the right ones.  What we decide to do will have a fundamental influence on the welfare and happiness of many children for many years to come.  I do not feel justified in crowding the task force.  I would like them to get the report out as quickly as possible but it is important that they do their job well and come <Col N="681" /> up with decisions, policies and proposals which will stand the test of time.  Other countries have made serious disastrous mistakes in this area and we do not want to follow that line.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for the establishment of a child care development unit in the Department of Health.  At present the welfare division of the Department have responsibility for planning the development of child care services.  The staffing of the division has been improved to enable them to deal with the interim report of the task force and to service the International Year of the Child Committee and also in a general way to prepare for further development of child care.  Before taking final decisions about organisation and staff, it is necessary to wait to get the report of the task force. Only when we see what the job is and the extent of the work that has to be done will we be able finally to decide what the appropriate structures for dealing with it are.</P>
    <P>I have a primary responsibility for maintaining liaison with other Departments. It is a pity all Ministers cannot come in and deal with the different aspects of the motion but the rules do not permit it.  The development of child care services is one area where the right structures and the allocation of responsibility are very important.  There are areas of administration where it does not really matter as long as somebody does the job.  This is not one of those areas. Only if we have the right structures and allocations of responsibility will we be able to respond to the individual needs of each child which is the overall objective. It is easy enough to create a job or allocate a central responsibility but it is much more difficult to ensure that whatever is created, the structure, organisation, development unit and so on, will be in a position to respond directly, immediately and effectively to the needs as they arise.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to think in terms of children in need in isolation.  Even some of the most dedicated and committed people in this area talk about children as if they were a disembodied <i>quantum</i> of people, a section of the community which can be looked at in isolation. Anyone with knowledge of the problems <Col N="682" /> knows that this is not so.  The vast majority of children are members of families and one cannot think or plan for children in isolation.  Very often the child in need of care is a family in need of care.  This must be kept in mind.  Child support services must, <i>ab initio</i>, be integrated into family support services.  I fault some people for their academic preoccupation with children as children as if they were a disembodied and isolated category of people in our society.  Child services must be planned and developed as an integral part of our community care services.  That is axiomatic and I hope it will be accepted.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for the establishment of a National Council for Child Care Services.  I am not too clear what the functions of that council will be. However, I assume that its responsibility will be to draw together all the people who are involved with children in the different fields, health, education, environment, justice and so on, whether voluntary or statutory, and also the different functions, research, advisory, training and support services.  I do not know if that would be the right way to do it.  It arises from erroneous thinking that children are something different and separate.  The right approach is to have child welfare and child support services as part of family services and community services.  But these things will become much clearer to us when we get the report of the task force.  We will see then specifically what has to be done and what is recommended, what the proposals are, what the policies are. Then we will be able to think much more accurately and effectively and to decide what are the forms and the structures, who should have the responsibility for policy formulation, who should be responsible for planning and co-ordination and who should be responsible for the delivery of the actual services.</P>
    <P>Another reason for awaiting anxiously the report of the task force is that the motion asks for the planning of the national campaign for recruitment and support of foster parents and asks for the improvement of staffing of residential care facilities.  The motion asks that these things should have top priority.  I want to assure the House that the <Col N="683" /> development of fostering services will continue to be a priority in the Department and in the health boards.  The development of fostering is an increasingly important option open to health boards to provided care for children for whom they are responsible, and in 1978 we provided additional funds to health boards to enable them to increase the boarding-out allowance by an average of about £2 per child.  Health boards were also able to increase the rates payable in the case of special and difficult cases.  We are supporting the Eastern Health Board in the running of special fosterage campaigns to recruit more foster parents.  Money has also been made available to the board to enable them to have this campaign evaluated and when that evaluation is carried out the results will be made available to all the health boards so that potential foster parents will be identified and encouraged to come forward and make their homes and lives available to those who need them.  The capitation rate has been adjusted for certain homes but some of them have run into difficulties. However, I can assure the House that homes which have had financial deficits will be sympathetically helped until such time as major decisions on long-term financing have been taken.</P>
    <P>It is intended also later this year to have discussions with authorities of the residential homes about staff ratios.  The recent survey by the Association of Workers in Child Care showed that we are reasonably well off in regard to staff ratios.  We have one head of staff for every 4.5 children.</P>
    <P>The motion also asks for central and regional planning in relation to education and day school care for pre-school children.  That is a responsibility of mine particularly so far as deprived children and parents under stress are concerned. The health boards are encouraged to develop facilities for children and families in need of special support.  They include single parents, children whose mothers have been deserted or widowed and who have to find employment because of economic circumstances and <Col N="684" /> who because of illness or similar circumstances are not able to cope.  There is also, of course, the children of travelling people and some Deputies may have seen that I announced considerable improvements in the facilities which we are making available in Galway and the importance we attach to the pre-school and day care facilities for these children. These provide a very important bridge between the travelling life and the life of the settled community.</P>
    <P>The motion also calls for an expansion of facilities for training of and support for staff working in child care areas. I am aware of the needs here.  It is an area to which my Department have recently been giving a great deal of attention. We have discussed with the conference of major religious superiors the role and training of needs of different levels of staff employed in children's homes.  As a result of these discussions I am making funds available for a three-day residential course later this month for managers of residential homes.  This will be the first in a series of training courses for these managers and for prospective managers.  The survey by the Association of Workers in Child Care to which I referred shows that the existing level of staff in these residential homes is very good.  The association have been invited to discuss their training needs with my Department and we hope to be able to meet them this month and to start meeting the training needs of staff by special non-residential courses.  The first training date for such staff was held on 9 May and was followed up by training sessions in different aspects of work with troubled or problem children.  We have identified the training needs and it is now a question of meeting those needs in an orderly fashion over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The CARE manifesto also refers to the children's allowances and there are calls for increases in these and the introduction of realistic children's allowances to combat child poverty.  Of course children's allowances are a very important element in our welfare services generally.  In fact I am sure that Deputies interested in this area know that there is now a fair volume of thinking to the effect that the most important <Col N="685" /> aspect of all welfare is our children and that poverty usually is associated with families.  The help is really needed for the families through family allowances and children's allowances and so on.  But our children's allowance scheme is fairly widespread.  The latest figures for 1978 show that we have 1,196,000 children from 439,000 families and the total expenditure was £51 million.  I suppose everybody would wish children's allowances to be greater but at least it is a comprehensive scheme covering all families, and in the last budget coming into operation now we made fairly substantial increases on a percentage basis.</P>
    <P>It is easy enough to call for realistic children's allowances without defining precisely what one means by &ldquo;realistic&rdquo;.  The percentages which we brought in in this year's budget and which should now be fully operative but which unfortunately, because of the disruption of the postal services are not completely operative yet, look fairly healthy.  In the case of the first child the increase was 52 per cent, in the case of the next child 40 per cent, and so on down to the case of the family with ten children, for instance, where the increase in the case of the tenth child was 17 per cent.  The overall percentage increase is around 28.  The figures are quite substantial and the cost to the Exchequer of those increases will be £11.7 million in 1979 and £14.6 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to the fact that in previous years the children's allowances came into operation in July, but this year, because we were anxious to alleviate as far as families are concerned, particularly large families and lower paid families, the effect of the reduction of food subsidies, we decided to bring them in on 1 April.  They have been operative from 1 April so, all in all, I think that was a reasonable attempt to increase children's allowances substantially. I am not too sure whether it would be termed &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; within the terms of the CARE manifesto and of the Labour Party motion, but any reasonable person would accept that in the context of one year that was a very real attempt to improve <Col N="686" /> greatly the situation of children and particularly those in large families. It was an indication of a wish to come to the aid as quickly as possible of those type of families that we brought them in in April, as distinct from the normal June date.</P>
    <P>As far as the affairs of my Department are concerned, the only other matter of particular significance with which I have time to deal is the question of school meals.  This is a vexed topic.  I do not believe that anybody has really found the answer to the type of service which will be provided.  Our school meal service is not one we could all stand back and look at with great pride or satisfaction.  One of the first things I did when I came into Social Welfare was to look into the question of school meals because I had an idea from my experience and knowledge that the provision of a meal for a child at school could be a very important thing from the point of view of the general welfare of the child but, equally important, from the point of view of his education.  I am sure many Deputies share the feeling that a child who is hungry or malnourished cannot really get down to the business of learning.</P>
    <P>I set up a working party to look into the school meals scheme to see what they would suggest.  The present scheme is quite haphazard and applies in certain areas but not in others.  Even where it is applied it is not very satisfactory, although in some cases it is reasonably satisfactory.  I have received a report from the working party and it is under consideration at the moment.  It is, however, a costly business.  It is not something that one can undertake casually in the course of a year because it has very important budgetary implications if one is to do anything satisfactory. Any examination of it has to have that in mind and has to have a very clear-cut realisation of the financial implications. There then comes a point when one has to pose the question: &ldquo;If I have this amount of money available from the Exchequer, if the Minister for Finance is prepared to make it available to me, is this the best way to spend it?  Is the provision of a satisfactory school meals system the highest priority we <Col N="687" /> have at the moment or should we put the money into some other important support service, either a family support service or a children support service?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any final assessment of the situation or to say anything conclusive about it to the House at this stage.  I want to say that it is something which is still under examination and being considered from all the different points of view.  My colleague, the Minister for Education and the Minister for the Environment, will not be able on this occasion to deal with all the matters which are of interest to them in connection with the International Year of the Child or in the course of their normal departmental duties.  Deputy Desmond asked about Lusk.  There is no question about it being abandoned.  The planning of it has been proceeding and it is now entering its final stages.</P>
    <P>I would like, in conclusion, to say that in the Department of Health and in all the agencies which operate under our aegis and all our voluntary bodies, we are totally committed to the International Year of the Child.  We recognise it as something of great significance and importance.  It presents us with the need to review what we are doing, to look at all our policies, to look at our programmes to see if they are effective, if they can be improved.  If there is any doubt, we must ensure that not alone will particular things be engaged in and particular activities undertaken during the International Year of the Child but it is up to all of us in the House and outside it to ensure that we will avail of the occasion of the International Year of the Child to bring about lasting benefits, things which will be there permanently so that when the International Year of the Child is over there will be in the country policies, programmes and activities which will remain for the benefit of Irish children in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in supporting the comprehensive motion before the House.  Deputy Desmond has outlined excellently many of the elements of concern.  I listened carefully to <Col N="688" /> the Minister and it is clear that he also agrees with the spirit of what this motion tries to comprehend.  The letter of the motion is probably exceeded in breadth of vision by the spirit which is behind it because there are things omitted from the motion which are also very relevant and germane.  Nevertheless, it gives us an opportunity in this vital year to achieve something substantial and something concrete in the motion.  This motion which is a replica of the CARE manifesto offers us a clear charter on which achievement may be satisfactorily, or otherwise, reached.</P>
      <P>I have certain fears about the International Year of the Child, 1979, as anybody would have about naming a year, a month or a day for a specific purpose.  My principal fear is that once past, and after a certain amount of acclaim, the therapeutic need of appearing to have done something would have been met, and that would mean we had made progress in that area, whereas the glitter and glamour of the public regalia on such occasions may very well cover a deficit of ideas and a lack of action.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister for Health and Social Welfare is a man who will honestly endeavour to make progress in this area.  I want to take this opportunity of saying that I admire the efforts he is putting into his Departments, the vigour and professionalism he is bringing to them and the dedication, in terms of hard endeavour, which is clearly going into this area.  I wish him well in all his efforts, particularly in the context of this motion.  I have confidence that what is in the motion will be achieved by this Minister if it is humanly possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children are important because they are our future.  This is a difficult age for children.  Gone are the Dickensian images of unfortunate children being pushed up chimneys, but other evils and ills have replaced that.  I am a father of two young children and it is very difficult to explain to a five-year-old the concepts of violence, avarice, competition and so on which would seem to be the hallmark of the age, an age where simple childlike words, such as &ldquo;gay&rdquo; and &ldquo;fairy&rdquo; have all kinds of surreptitious connotations.  The child does not <Col N="689" /> understand when the adults present snigger or giggle when these words are mentioned. I find it sad to see this assault on childhood which is so prevalent throughout the &ldquo;ad&rdquo; culture, the Coca Cola culture of the day.  I feel something valuable is being lost.</P>
    <P>Maybe I am being unduly pessimistic about that but as a teacher for a number of years I was conscious of the essential dichotomy, the essential contradiction, of saying to a child, on the one hand, that the boy or girl sitting next to you is the person you are to love and look after in this life but, when the bell rings and the religion class is over, the child is told that the boy or girl who was sitting next to him would be competing with him for the one job which may be available at the end of it all.  This problem exists and is eating away at a lot of what should be good in childhood.</P>
    <P>The facts and difficulties facing children growing up today are elusive and hard to find, because up to now a great deal of attention has not been given to children, as the Minister said, in isolation.  Perhaps one could go too far in that but, in fairness, there are obvious areas which need attention and research. Some of this research is being done.</P>
    <P>An analagous organisation to CARE, a body called Hope, today presented a report to the Dublin Youth Services Council of which I happen to be chairman, which gives us food for thought.  It was carried out in an effort to achieve some statistical data on the needs of young persons in our city.  It is regrettable that that organisation had to come to us for the necessary funds. Money is a scarce commodity.  One of the things we could do this year, along with what is in the motion, is try to allocate a certain specific fund, which should not be interfered with detrimentally, for future research in the area because figures are hard to get.</P>
    <P>There are probably 150,000 children in this State who are dependent for their very existence on social welfare payments of one kind or another.  We all know social welfare payments are not the kind of which luxury is made and I am sure people on all sides wish they could be more.  What saddens me is that <Col N="690" /> it is probably the children who are suffering most in these circumstances.  On the streets of Dublin, and in my own constituency in particular, we see sad scraps of humanity with dirty faces and very little future in some cases.  That would sadden any humane person.  It is easy to forget that this problem exists because as soon as people establish themselves they move out of the city. The problem is therefore out of sight and often out of mind, not through deliberate neglect or act of omission but just through the nature of things.  I ask people who have not done so for a long time to take a walk through some of these mean streets in the city and look at the children whose parents did not have a great deal and tragically are not likely to have a great deal themselves.</P>
    <P>The way we treat children is a mark of civilisation.  I do not know how we rate on that; I suspect no worse or no better than other nations.  This is the International Year of the Child.  One of the things the motion does not refer to is Ireland's impact, small though it may be, on international children's affairs.  In other countries children are abused and exploited in many ways.  In Brazil there are 14 million children many of whom are being exploited sexually.  We can make a contribution on the international stage trying to motivate people to ensure that children all over the world get a better deal.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to refer in detail to the areas covered by Deputy Desmond but the area of child labour is not mentioned in the motion.  There is a tendency in some areas where children are abused in this way.  When they should be at school and having the affection and warmth of home life, they have to do menial jobs late in the evening.  This is not what childhood is all about.  Sometimes there are good reasons for children having to be put in that situation.  As a member of a school-tenants' committee I recall the futile tasks of these committees on occasion calling before them parents who would almost plaintively explain that the child of 12 had to go to work because they needed the money.  There is not a great deal one can do with that argument.</P>
    <P>There are not any overnight, easy <Col N="691" /> answers to these problems.  There are some things we can do.  It would be wrong if we were to paint a picture of not just total pessimism but of total futility or hopelessness.  We have a duty to be optimistic and to dedicate ourselves to achieving concrete, tangible, visible progress in a certain length of time and to be able to monitor it.</P>
    <P>The housing area is clearly one which could be said to be the crucible of a child's life, the environment in which a child's character, attitude, moral values and standards are fashioned.  We have severe overcrowding in our cities.  I marvel at the wonderful children who emerge from one-and two-roomed flats, but unfortunately some children suffer along the way.  An indication of the resilience of children is the number of them who make an excellent contribution to life and live a very fulfilled life later on.</P>
    <P>Overcrowded houses, of which we have many, are a matter on which a Government should wage war when it comes to the question of children and children's affairs.  I am worried about the growing number of overcrowded homes. Despite all the attempts and the desire for goodwill in this area, the amount of money spent on local authority housing is going down and the number of people on the lists are going up.  Sometimes this is outside the Government's control, but the children are the sufferers whether it be in the small, inner-city flats or the wall-to-wall housing of the suburbs where the children's suffering is slightly different but they do suffer.  They suffer because the structure of Government that we have may be in need of review. The basic concept of national, parallel departments operating nationally, sometimes consulting most loosely and informally and not responding to regional needs on a basis which is integrated and comprehensive is what we have.  They do their own thing, and in the middle of all this we have the spectacle of an estate of a thousand houses quite close to the Minister's constituency which until very recently was without the basic social care services which one would assume to be part of the total of a community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> This overcrowding gives rise to another matter which is difficult to talk about.  In the overcrowded homes we have an increase in what can only be referred to as sexual abuse of children, or incest.  One does not hear a great deal about it, but in my own inner-city constituency evidence&mdash;circumstantial in almost all cases but sometimes stongly so&mdash;crops up of an unhealthy atmosphere prevailing in the home.  We should not be surprised at this where there are families with three or four children in tiny quarters and cramped conditions, and in some cases the families are much larger than that.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in replies to questions in the Dáil over the last couple of years, has on occasions given a clear indication that there are health problems for children in the inner-city areas.  One does not have to be a doctor or a scientist to see the evidence of malnutrition and of lack in diet and bad diet.  I can give an instance of a family of ten children whose basic diet is fish and chips.  I am partial to a one-and-one myself now and again but I am fortunate in that I can vary the diet a little.  Many children have to exist on this kind of meagre, basic diet with deficiencies of some kinds of vitamins and as a result they suffer physically, mentally, educationally and in every other way.  We have a great deal to do there.</P>
    <P>In education there are areas at which we do not merely throw up our hands in horror but where change can be brought about relatively quickly without great expenditure.  To try to pursue the traditional educational pattern in city areas in some cases is futile.  In parts of this city as many as 75 per cent of the children do not go on to secondary school and their primary schooling is erratic. In many cases it is fairly pointless, apart from the marginal social advantages of giving the child an opportunity to mix with his peers.  In terms of achievement and of helping the child to develop a self-image and so forth the schooling exercise is largely a waste of time.  That is because the traditional form of structure of school, the red- or grey-brick building to which he goes every morning and from which he comes <Col N="693" /> home every evening, has never been part of his environment and is alien to his culture and ideas, and probably also to those of his parents.</P>
    <P>We will have to look again at different modes of education and informal approaches to education in these areas.  We should consider changing the curriculum in order to get rid of the system which sees that curriculum not so much as useful and good in itself but as a badge of achievement to which many of these children cannot aspire.  Apart from the question of motivation, there is the basic question of sheer ability to compete and to study.  We should try to bring about inner-city study centres where the children can go in the evenings away from the often hostile&mdash;not deliberately so&mdash;home environment to study or read under the care of interested parents and/or teachers.  There are problems in such a scheme but the advantages are very strong.  They would include the possibility of a child getting away from the one room with the television in one corner, the baby in another and the father in another corner perhaps complaining about the waste of time book-learning is and so on.</P>
    <P>The self-image of young people in this area, and of children in many parts of our cities particularly, does not include achieving any sort of academic distinction or standard.  Only those of us who have been through the educational process will realise the dignity which can be achieved by a person who sets himself an academic task and achieves something.  We must give such children a chance to do this and they cannot do it in their present environment.  We will have to make changes in education, in some cases quite small changes.  There are the possibilities of changes in the curriculum, for example.  A proposal has been put forward to Dublin Corporation which would involve the use of mobile buses in city centre areas to attract the children.  Some sceptics might be concerned about the fate of the buses, but if the worst came to the worst the capital expenses would not be all that enormous. This is well worth trying in an area where children simply do not go to <Col N="694" /> school, refuse to go to school, are not interested in school and see it as alien to them in every sense of the word.  Obviously, certain things could facilitate that effort, including the involvement of parents and so on in structures of management.</P>
    <P>On the question of the curriculum, I might mention that I was invited to a teenage wedding some months ago.  As the invitation arrived on a Saturday and the wedding was that day I could not go. On the following Wednesday I telephoned a local hostelry to inquire how the couple were faring, only to find that they had broken up on the previous day.  In other words, the marriage lasted three days.  It put me in mind of the way in which many teenagers in some areas rush into marriage and into having children.  Obviously, on some occasions the child is not a deliberate act but an unfortunate by-product, but the child suffers.  I tell of that incident to indicate that it might be worth while to consider the introduction of some sort of education in the schools which would be much more relevant to the experience of these people than is some of the stuff which I as a teacher had to dole out.  It could include for the women and men perhaps qualifications in child-rearing and child-minding which they probably never got but which would be of greater benefit to them than would being able to decline a Latin noun, although that is fast fading also.</P>
    <P>A problem which probably will not be dealt with in the context of this discussion is that of itinerant children.  Last weekend in Galway the Minister did say some heartening words.  Nevertheless, the problem of itinerant children is a particular one.  Although there are agencies responsible for coping with many parts of the spectrum relating to children, there is a part of the mesh through which these children seem to slip because they seem to be the responsibility of nobody. For example, there is the situation where the itinerant parents would be committed to prison and where there would be nobody responsible in a particular way for ensuring that there were no children left behind.</P>

      <P>I do this in a spate of anger because, for the first time since I became a member of the local authority for County Donegal, moneys are not available for anyone in this financial year to commence the building of new houses.  I would prefer had the Minister for the Environment been present for this debate rather than his Deputy, the Minister of State.  I do not mean any disrespect to the Minister of State because I have the greatest personal regard for him but this is a matter of extreme importance to Donegal and I would prefer the Minister who has full authority at Cabinet level to be here to listen to my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Donegal County Manager has found it necessary to notify all members of the county council of the crisis which now exists in the county as a result of the lack of funds to finance local authority house-building.  The county council have listed 188 single houses, advertised and ready to build, but they do not have any money to carry out that work with the result that that scheme must be postponed.  The county council have also listed, advertised and have contractors ready to be appointed for the creation of 21 houses in Carndonagh, 40 houses in Falcarragh and 16 houses in Convoy.  There is not a penny to start any of those houses and the manager states that these tenders cannot be accepted.  The manager went on to list 60 houses in Donegal Town; 37 in Moville; 13 in Carrigart; six in Pettigo; two at Trentagh; 22 in Ballyshannon; eight in Clonmany; eight in St. Johnston; 27 in Lifford and 48 private sites ready to be purchased in Donegal town.  That work cannot be pursued.  The manager concluded his letter by stating that these schemes could not be advertised <Col N="696" /> for the time being.</P>
    <P>Those houses are ready for advertising. We have on the books three categories, those which have been advertised and for which tenders have been received, those advertised but for which tenders have not yet been received and those houses ready for advertising.  To complete that programme we need £9,760,000 but the Department of the Environment have given us a meagre £275,000.  According to the county manager that amount would build 15 single rural cottages.  That is an appalling situation.  I should like to recall that less than two years ago Fianna Fáil, in their general election manifesto, declared that they had an action plan for national reconstruction and informed us that they would build sufficient houses.  They told us that they would build more houses than the National Coalition.  In case people think I am making up figures I should like to give details of the situation in County Donegal, as detailed in a handbook produced by Donegal County Council for 1976-77.  According to that handbook in 1969-70 143 houses were built in the county under Fianna Fáil. Other figures are: 1970-71, 99 houses; 1971-72, 167 houses; 1972-73, 183 houses; 1973-74,&mdash;under the National Coalition&mdash;308 houses; in the nine months of 1974 calculated on figures representing one year, 230 houses; 1975, 351 houses; 1976, 245 houses; 1977, 326 houses.  After that Fianna Fáil returned to office and in 1978 200 houses were built and we will not be able to build one house in 1979.</P>
    <P>That is an outrageous insult to the people of Donegal, to young mothers living in rat-infested houses, in unhealthy overcrowded conditions and often without water or toilet facilities.  In some cases such people are living on the second floor of an old tumbledown shack. Owners would prefer that such tenants would leave the buildings but because they have no place to go they are condemned to live in rat- and insect-infected, unhealthy, leaking, smelly and overcrowded dwellings and we expect those parents to bring up healthy children.  It is a downright disgrace.  The Government stand indicated on the <Col N="697" /> promises they made in 1977 and the atrocious record they have for building local authority houses.  In the period from 1969 to this year the total number of houses built in Donegal under Fianna Fáil was 792 while during the four and a half years the National Coalition were in power 1,461 houses were built.  In spite of that members of the Fianna Fáil Party tell us that the National Coalition was not a success.  Those figures are not mine; they were given by the Donegal County Manager in the 1978-79 hand-book.</P>
    <P>It appears that there is no commitment on the part of the Government to build local authority houses.  They do not have any concern for the people living in caravans, in demountable dwellings, in squalor and unhealthy conditions.  They do not give a tuppenny damn whether those people end up in hospital, whether mothers break down and end up in mental hospitals or whether there is a breakdown in marriages because husbands cannot find jobs to provide better living conditions.  They are the stark realities of this problem.  It is not good enough for a Government who have been in office for two years.  As a result of the Government's first budget we were in trouble.  It was a gamble and the gamble went wrong.  The Tánaiste told us that it was a one-off borrowing that might not work but they intended making it work.  It has not worked.  The gamble has gone wrong and it will not be the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach or the Minister for the Environment who will suffer and will have to live in bad houses; the poor unfortunate people living in Donegal, a county with the highest unemployment rate in the State&mdash;18 per cent&mdash;will suffer. The amount of money being given to unemployed husbands is inadequate to help them to get a loan to build a house.</P>
    <P>Is this the type of society we plan to build?  Is this what independence meant? Is this what Padraic Pearse and the other signatories of the Proclamation of 1916 gave their lives for?  Did they give their lives for a Government to deny the people of Donegal the right to proper living <Col N="698" /> conditions?  I cannot condemn strongly enough the record of the Government in regard to local authority housing.  It is appallingly bad.  It is no different in other local authority areas but it just so happens that the Donegal County Manager saw the red light flashing so hard that he decided to get this hot potato from his desk and notify the members of the county council.</P>
    <P>A discussion took place on this matter at yesterday's meeting of the council and it was remarkable that only two members of the official Fianna Fáil Party were present for it.  Apparently, even the members of Donegal County Council are embarrassed.  I do not blame them because this would embarrass those in darkest Africa.  I am sure there are people in the bush in Africa and Australia and in undeveloped countries who are living in better conditions than some people in Donegal.  It is a shame that our native Government have not done anything.  I do not know why the Government are treating the people of Donegal like this but I can assure them that I will embarrass them as much as possible and I will lead the people of Donegal in protest marches about it because this cries to Heaven for vengeance.  Young mothers plead with me for proper housing.  They tell me of having lived in caravans for up to five years, that they cannot have any more family and that their marriages are under stress.  They tell me of leaking caravans, mobile homes that are falling apart and of site owners wanting the site back.  Such people have told me of being afraid to shift their mobile homes for fear of them falling apart.  Young mothers have told me of having to live in a single room where they cook, eat, sleep, wash clothes and attend to their children.</P>
    <P>Is there any sense of social justice in such a situation?  Have the Government lost all sense of conscience about these matters?  When the National Coalition were in office I told the then Minister for Local Government that we did not have enough money in Donegal for house building but at that time we were building twice as many houses there than are being built now.  Is it any <Col N="699" /> wonder that there is despair among those parents who are waiting for houses in Donegal, Lifford, St. Johnston and other places?  How will the Fianna Fáil candidates explain to the people of Donegal town where there is already a grave housing shortage that the county council do not have the money to build the 60 houses planned?  The same applies to Moville, where there is not the money to build the 37 houses that should have been built some years ago, and to such towns as Carrigart, Pettigo, Ballyshannon, Clonmany and others.  At a time when the Government are buying jets to fly their Ministers to the cities of Europe there is not money to build houses.  In addition, we have been cut back in respect of expenditure for sanitary services and road improvements. Fianna Fáil should become honest for once and tell the people that because they thought they would be defeated badly in the last election they produced their manifesto in order to hold four or five seats and be elected. That was their strategy but it went wrong though Fianna Fáil succeeded in bluffing the people into returning a Government with a greater majority than was ever experienced before in the history of this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>He is hardly shaking his head in defence of the Minister for the Environment.  The actions of the Government as a whole are indefensible. I often wonder what the Taoiseach means when he talks about North-South co-operation because in my everyday life I see clear examples of the lack of such co-operation.  If, for example, a girl from Lifford marries a man who lives in Strabane she can be assured of having a house to live in if not immediately, at most within a month of her marriage. The housing programme of Strabane District Council which caters for a population of less than a third of the people of Donegal, results in the building of twice as many houses as is the case in Donegal.  Conversely, the Strabane girl who marries a man from Lifford has a poor chance of getting a house in Lifford. That is why I use the phrase &ldquo;a shower of hypocrites&rdquo; when I hear talk of North-South co-operation.</P>
      <P>It upsets me when people from Donegal, who are living happily in houses in Strabane, ask me why we cannot build houses for our people in Donegal.  The people do not realise that the necessary moneys must come from central government.  There is a housing crisis in County Donegal.  During the term of office of the last Government there was a housing need there but I used go to Deputy Tully, who was then Minister, and plead with him to have regard to the problem.  As chairman of the county council in 1977 I was involved in a study with members of the housing construction committee and we pointed out that it would not be possible to rehouse all those people on the waiting list&mdash;some of the people being rehoused were unemployed&mdash;unless the necessary moneys were made available from central government.  During that time some of those waiting to be rehoused and who were unemployed saw contractors building single houses when all of that lost energy should have been harvested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put a proposal before the Department then but it has not been considered since the change of Government.  My regret is that, confident that we would be re-elected, I did not make an issue of <Col N="701" /> that proposal with the then Minister.  The sooner the people are told the real situation the better.  Unless the Government change their attitude and realise their responsibility, the people on the waiting list in Donegal will never be housed. There is a moral responsibility on the Government to provide homes for people who are not in a position to provide homes for themselves.  One out of every four people approaching me at my advice centres has a housing problem. These people plead with me to bring some pressure to bear on the Government. If one tries to tell them the real situation they are not interested in hearing it because it is a story of despair.  For how long more must we tolerate a Government who are so close to the building industry that people who build private houses have such a vested interest in Fianna Fáil as to have Government policy designed to their wishes? The result of this is the policy that by not building local authority houses a shortage is created which in turn results in increased prices for houses in the private sector.  I am referring to the people whom Deputy Liam Cosgrave called the Tacateers, those people who used pay £100 subscriptions at Fianna Fáil dinners.</P>

      <P>Work in progress is continuing at a high level.  Eight thousand six hundred and seven dwellings were under construction at the latest date for which returns are available, with nearly 6,200 men employed.  Eighteen thousand one hundred and sixty-seven houses were comprised in schemes at various stages of planning.  A reserve of over 55,010 further sites were available. The Government provided a record £86 million for the local authority housing programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and for low-rise mortgages in 1979.  This generous provision is sufficient to maintain the level of progress achieved in 1978.  While 1978 was a little disappointing in the number of local authority houses completed&mdash;6,073 as compared with 6,333 in 1977&mdash;this shortfall was more than compensated for by the impressive national housing total ourturn of 25,500 houses completed in 1978.  But the short-fall in local authority completions in 1978 was counterbalanced by the high level at which work in progress and employment on the programme continued <Col N="704" /> throughout the year.  Work was in progress on an average of 8,636 dwellings throughout 1978 compared with 8,702 in 1977 and 8,195 in 1976. Despite the lower level of completions in 1978, average monthly employment was considerably higher in 1978, at 6,504, than the corresponding figure of 6,295 in 1977 and a mere 5,635 in 1976.</P>
      <P>The outlook for local authority housing in 1979 is good.  The £82 million available for direct building by the authorities (which is over and above the £4 million provided for under the low-rise mortgage scheme) together with the working overdraft of 10 per cent allows an expenditure within this year of over £90 million.</P>

      <P>This amount will keep the levels of work in progress and employment high, while allowing an increased output of completions.  One would get the impression, from the reaction and statements of some Deputies opposite, that there is a serious shortage of money for the programme, because all demands of local authorities for money for new work are not met instantly. A major programme costing £90 million in a year needs careful management and close control on expenditure.</P>

      <P>Practically 100 per cent of the expenditure on the programme is ultimately recouped by the State.  It is simply impossible in the circumstances to meet all the demands of all local authorities who naturally look for more than they can use.  The considerable resources made available by the Government must be apportioned between authorities on a fair and equitable basis.  The bulk of the funds go each year on paying for commitments arising on existing schemes in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to Donegal.  These latter allocations covered the full programme of each authority but are, of course, also subject to review during the year.  I am quite satisfied that the allocations made to authorities were more than generous, and already it is apparent that many authorities will make substantial savings on their allocations for commitments. Allocations made so far this year for new work, amounting to over £6 million, only cover work to be started by 31 July 1979 or earlier.  I will be reviewing expenditure generally during the summer and will make supplementary allocations for more new work later in the year.</P>

      <P>While some authorities will not be able to start all the new work they would like immediately, I do not foresee any great delay and at worst, most authorities will be able to start any outstanding work by late autumn.  I sympathise with Deputy Harte in his anxiety to get more money for Donegal, but he should not get or give the impression that Donegal is being hard done by.  The county council got no less than £2,020,500&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This compared with £1,581,000 in 1977, £1,881,500 in 1976 and £1,476,230 in 1975.  I know that the council want even more money for 1979&mdash;what council does not, will you tell me?  For 1979 they have already been allocated a total of over £2 million for work in progress and for new work to be started before 31 July 1979.  I have no doubt that, following the mid-summer review, they will get a further substantial allocation.  In the meantime, they have full authority to spend any savings made on expenditure on existing commitments. They have sought only £383,000 to date from the local loans fund.  Their actual expenditure in the first quarter of 1979 was just over £400,000.  On this basis it is possible that their savings on existing commitments to date may be quite substantial.  Certainly they should have no difficulty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Companies liable to Income Tax.</P>
      <P>In the White Paper dealing with Company Taxation in Ireland which was laid by the Minister for Finance before each House of the Oireachtas in November 1972 it was estimated that the number of active companies in Ireland in the period 1930-1940 was 2,000 and in 1967, 9,300.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the number of companies liable to income tax in 1938-39 was about 1,000.  The corresponding number in 1973-74 was about 7,000.</P>

      <P Just="Center">The following table shows the number of assessments made to corporation profits tax (including excess profits duty) and corporation tax.  These figures relate also to bodies other than companies and would include more than one assessment raised in respect of a corporate body in the same year.</P>

      <P>The information which would be required to give complete answers under all of the numerous sub-heads for all of the 30 years covered by this question is not available.  It is not considered that there would be justification for deploying staff to undertake the considerable research which would be required in order to arrive at the information particularly as it is by no means certain <Col N="577" /> that the records would be sufficient to provide a satisfactory outcome to such research.  The number of cases dealt with by an inspector of taxes will vary by reference to his experience and capacity and to the complexity of the cases.  Furthermore the deployment of staff at any given time depends on the needs of the various sectors and the availability of staff.  Arrears of work may fluctuate by reference to the availability of staff, seasonal pressures and the growth in complexity of work and in the numbers of taxpayers.</P>

      <i>Notes:</i>

    <P>(1) A breakdown of the net receipt of Income Tax under each Schedule is not available.  For the years up to and including 1962-63 figures showing the estimated net produce of Income Tax under each Schedule have been given.  Net produce of tax is the estimated ultimate yield for the tax assessed in the year, whether actually collected in that year or later, after deducting all discharges and remissions and setting off all repayments.  Net produce figures are not available for 1963-64 and subsequent years in consequence of the introduction of the system of &ldquo;one taxpayer, one charge&rdquo; in 1963-64 following on recommendations in the Second Report of the Commission on Income Taxation.  However, it is possible to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the net receipt of Schedule E tax.  The estimated net receipt of Schedule E Income Tax has been given for the years 1963-64 to 1978.  The balance of the net receipt for those years is regarded as referable to Schedule A, B, C and D up to and including the year 1968-69, and Schedules C and D thereafter.</P>
    <P>(2)  Net receipts for the years are shown.</P>
    <P>(3) Does not include the abatement estimated at £4.15 million provided for under Section 14 of Finance (No. 2) Act, 1959.</P>
    <P>(4) Includes Schedules A, B and C from 1963-64 up to and including the year 1968-69 and Schedules C and D thereafter.  Schedules A and B were abolished by Section 65 Schedule 5, of the Finance Act 1969, with effect from 1969-70.</P>
    <P>(5) The reason this figure is so low is that the second instalment of Schedule D tax for 1974-75 was payable on 1 January, 1975.</P>
    <P>(c) The other sources of Revenue on a categorised basis and the percentage of total net revenue represented by each source is shown on the following table:</P>

      <P>The Control of Fishing for Salmon Order 1977 prescribes the maximum number of each type of salmon net fishing licence which may be issued each year for each fishery district. In that regard the order prescribes that up to 16 draft net (special tidal waters) licences may be issued by the Ballyshannon Board of Conservators in respect of fishing in the Erne Estuary and that number has not been altered.  However, because of the critical state of the salmon stocks of the Erne system the arrangements as regards the duration of the fishing season are at present under examination in my Department in consultation with the fishermen concerned.</P>

      <P>There has been a significant excess of unused tanker capacity on the world market for some time and the consequential depression in freight rates has caused serious losses for tanker operators.  In these circumstances neither of the two State shipping companies has any plans at present to acquire tankers.  However, the acquisition of new tonnage is kept constantly under review by the companies in consultation with my Department and should the situation change the question of acquiring tankers would receive fresh consideration.</P>

      <P>I am not aware.  Presumably the Deputy is referring to the normal new house grant of £275 payable in 1966, plus a supplementary grant of a similar amount which may have been paid by a local authority.  On the basis of figures published by the Central Statistics Office in relation to the purchasing power of the £1, the value of the State new house grant of £275 in 1966 was less than £1,000 new house grant paid in 1978.</P>

      <P>In the Road Development Plan for the 1980's I have indicated in Table No. 1 the major improvement schemes proposed for the Dublin region including the improvement of the Dublin/Belfast road in the next decade.  I have also provided in the plan for a programme of normal improvement works to be financed by road grants.  In addition the annual road works programmes of the road authorities in the Dublin region will provide for improvement works to be financed from their revenue resources.</P>
      <P>While I have indicated in the plan the anticipated level of Exchequer investment in the coming decade, the execution of the improvement works referred to and other works is dependent on the state of preparedness by the road authorities concerned in respect of individual projects and the Government's assessment of the priority ratings which should be given in any year to the many and varied competing demands for public funds.</P>
