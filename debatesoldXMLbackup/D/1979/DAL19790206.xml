    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he was advocating institutional changes in our industrial relations system when he referred to the Government's willingness to improve ways of resolving industrial disputes, or whether he was advocating new procedures for the resolution of industrial disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion in question, I said that there were ways of resolving industrial disputes without irreparable destruction but that if these were inadequate the Government were only too willing to improve them.  The industrial relations machinery is at present under review by the Commission on Industrial Relations.  The Government will give the most careful consideration to the committee's recommendations. However, there is no doubt that a considerable improvement in industrial relations would follow if the existing procedures were used to the fullest extent in a general effort to avoid confrontation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the intention of the Government to postpone any or every action in the industrial relations area until the committee report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, the Minister for Labour is reviewing the situation actively, especially in the areas of his Department in which he considers <Col N="362" /> that an improvement or an extension of services would bring about a better climate.  That will be done as he thinks necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his recent public appeal to union employees and other interests to come together to consider with the Government the best way in which the country can move forward, had received any response; and if he will indicate the character of the joint action he sought from employers and unions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Federated Union of Employers have expressed a willingness to participate in discussions with the Government and other interests. No response has been received from other sources but this was to be expected, as those concerned would probably wish to examine the forthcoming budget before responding.  In my appeal I gave a general outline of the type of joint action which might be appropriate. Possible lines for this action are under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In the kind of joint action sought by the Taoiseach, was it envisaged in regard to any agreement on wages and salaries that machinery leading to such agreement would be set up after the expiration of the present national wage agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated what was envisaged was a fresh start in which all the interests involved in procuring industrial peace and fair economic advances&mdash;by that I mean a fair distribution of economic advances&mdash;would come together and work out a means of achieving what I had in mind.  I spelled this out in some detail in the speech which I expect the Deputy has read.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the fact that the money was voted in December but that the factory had to close less than a month later, on 30 December, what is the reason for the discrepancy?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>To reassure the Deputy and the House, the situation was that the decision to advance the money was made by the Government as far back as September.  The money was advanced then in order to help ensure that the factory continued in production and in order to explore every avenue to ensure the firm's continuance as a working unit. That decision was confirmed in December but the money had been granted on 8 September.  I trust that puts that aspect in perspective.  The further aspect is that we are satisfied and that the IDA, who are responsible for finding a new project for the factory premises, are satisfied that having regard to the structure of the old Irish Board Mills Limited Company and having regard to the manner in which the firm's business was being conducted there are now much better opportunities for a new owner to go in in the present situation. Several inquiries are being considered by the IDA in this connection.</P>

There was the question of damage to fisheries either from oil or from the dispersants. Could he give us any indication as to what the state of preparedness was in advance of the disaster?</P>

Is he aware that the relationship between the officials from his Department who visited Bantry to inquire into the fishery damage and the fishermen was not too amicable?  The fishermen were not too satisfied with the consideration they got from the officials. Is the Minister aware of that fact?</P>

      <P>During the 1978 salmon season the Naval Service, with the assistance of a fishery officer of my Department, inspected 11 fishing vessels in each of the fishery districts of Waterford and Lismore.  As illegal fishing activities were not detected in the course of these inspections no prosecutions have arisen.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>I have just made a bye-law excluding sea-trout from the scope of the regulations made earlier which provide for a shortening of the season in respect of angling for salmon.  Because of the urgent need for stringent conservation measures in regard to salmon I do not propose in their regard to make any revision of the regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister responded very quickly to the question. Is the Minister aware that so far as salmon are concerned this will cause serious hardship in the tourist industry especially in the Waterville, the Brandon and the Laune districts?  Is he prepared to compromise and meet members of these organisations who have the well-being of the salmon industry at heart just as much as the Minister has?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation with regard to salmon is very serious.  We are facing the extinction of the species unless <Col N="387" /> we do something about it.  I can see the distinction in the case of sea trout.  There are reasonably good sea trout stocks and we decided to exclude them. Heretofore, as the House may be aware, sea trout were included in the definition of salmon.  I have now excluded them, and excluded them also from the regulations dealing with salmon.  In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question, I am a great believer in the efficacy of parliamentary questions.  They have an effect irrespective of where they come from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the normal practice to protect stocks of spawning sea fish by means of closed seasons.  Different varieties of sea fish spawn at different periods of the year and even for stocks of the same variety the spawning <Col N="392" /> period can vary around the coast.  A closed season is not therefore practical in mixed fisheries such as ours.</P>
      <P>From a biological point of view the management and conservation of sea-fish stocks are best achieved by the observance of a scientifically calculated total allowable catch and the enforcement of minimum size limits for fish and nets.</P>

      <P>The Air Services Authorisation (Amendment) Order, 1976 (S.I.

As I have said, discussions can take place and are about to take place at this time between my Department, the Office of Public Works and CIE, and a lot of practical work can be done before legislation comes into this House.  Many Deputies will be aware that a lot of technical work is involved as regards where the divide is between the canals and railways.  There are water rights and various other things to be negotiated and staff to be transferred.  All these matters take a considerable length of time, but progress will be made in the meantime before legislation comes into the House.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill amends the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.</P>
      <P>The 1921 Act provides the statutory framework for the holding of sworn inquiries by means of special tribunals and has been the basis for many important inquiries since the foundation of the State.  It is a general enabling statute providing for the establishment of a tribunal for inquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance whenever it is resolved by both Houses of the Oireachtas that it is expedient to do so.  In pursuance of such a resolution, a Minister may by instrument appoint a tribunal and the appointing instrument may provide for the application of the Act to the tribunal so appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Government have already decided to set up a tribunal to inquire into the tragedy which occurred at Whiddy Island on 8 January last and it is intended that the <Col N="429" /> necessary resolutions will be moved in both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Over the years, certain defects in the 1921 Act have become apparent and it is necessary that they should now be rectified so that the tribunal to be appointed to inquire into the Whiddy Island disaster can function effectively.  The main flaw in the 1921 Act was identified by a decision of the Supreme Court in 1971, though the decision did not directly relate to the 1921 Act.  It related, in fact, to an Act of 1970 dealing with the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts entitled Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann (Privilege and Procedure) Act, 1970 (No. 22 of 1970).</P>
    <P>Part of that 1970 Act was declared to be unconstitutional and, as the part in question followed in certain material respects the provisions of part of the 1921 Act, that corresponding part of the latter Act must be assumed to be unconstitutional also.  The provision in question is in section 1 (2) of the 1921 Act.  It purported to enable the chairman of a tribunal to &ldquo;certify&rdquo; to the High Court the offence of any person who did any one of a number of things such as refusing to attend as a witness.  The inference to be drawn from the Supreme Court decision is that the law must either allow trial by jury in respect of the offence or else make it a minor offence with penalties restricted accordingly.  Section 3 of the Bill will rectify the defect by providing that offences alleged to have been committed will be tried summarily&mdash;that is to say, in the District Court&mdash;and on conviction the offender will be liable to a fine not exceeding £500 or imprisonment for up to 12 months or both.</P>
    <P>The section also specifies the offences in question, some of which are new.  Taking those which are being re-enacted first, it will be an offence to refuse, without just cause or excuse, to obey a summons to attend; to refuse to take an oath; to refuse to produce documents legally required by the tribunal or to answer questions to which the tribunal may legally require an answer or act in contempt of the tribunal.  In re-enacting these provisions, the Bill uses substantially <Col N="430" /> the same terms as the 1921 Act but the opportunity has been taken, for the sake of completeness, to make it an offence to refuse to make an affirmation&mdash;this is additional to the existing offence of refusing to take an oath.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the new offences are those listed in section 3 of the Bill. Subsection 2 (c) makes it an offence to give false evidence to a tribunal.  This is necessary because of the uncertainty that exists as to whether the offence of perjury applies to the giving of false evidence to a tribunal.  Subsection 2 (d) makes it an offence to obstruct or hinder the tribunal in the performance of its functions.  This provision will strengthen the powers of tribunals to deal with any attempts that might be made to interfere with evidence.  Subsection 2 (e) makes it an offence for a person to fail, neglect or refuse to comply with an order made by a tribunal.  This provision strengthens the powers of tribunals to enforce compliance with their orders.</P>
    <P>In connection with section 3 it is my intention to move on Committee Stage an amendment of a drafting nature to subsection (2) (b).  This will be circulated as quickly as possible.  In view of the possibility of taking all Stages today I thought it would be appropriate to advert to it at this stage.</P>
    <P>Doubt has also been expressed in the past as to whether a tribunal appointed under the 1921 Act had general power to make orders corresponding to those which the High Court or a judge of that court could make.  The 1921 Act vested in a tribunal the powers of the High Court but only in relation to the specific matters set out in section 1 (1) (a), (b) and (c), of that Act.  Section 4 of the Bill will remove any such doubt and a tribunal will be able to make such orders as it considers necessary for the purpose of its functions and will have all the powers, rights and privileges that are vested in the High Court in respect of the making of its orders.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that statements or admissions made by a person before a tribunal or by a person being examined on commission or abroad&mdash;the power to examine on commission or abroad is contained in section 1 (1) (c), of the 1921 <Col N="431" /> Act&mdash;will not be admissible against that person in any criminal proceedings other than proceedings for the offence of giving false evidence to a tribunal.</P>
    <P>Under the 1921 Act, section 2 (b), tribunals have power to authorise the representation before them by counsel, solicitor or otherwise of any person appearing to them to be interested.  It has, however, been a matter of some criticism in the past that tribunals have had no power to award costs either to or against persons appearing before them and the Bill now proposes to empower tribunals to do that.  Certain criteria by reference to which this would be done are specified, namely, that the tribunal is of opinion that, having regard to the findings of the tribunal and all other relevant matters, there are sufficient reasons rendering it equitable to do so.  An important aspect of this is that costs may be awarded against the Minister for Finance, even if that Minister is not involved, but of course this is, in effect, a provision that the State will be liable to pay.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill making necessary or desirable changes in that law in relation to the operation of tribunals conducting sworn inquiries into matters of public importance.  It is a matter of great sadness that the immediate necessity for the measure arises from a very tragic happening and I take this opportunity to extend again my sympathy and that of my colleagues to the relatives and friends of all those who lost their lives. The changes that are being proposed are, however, desirable in themselves and would have had to be undertaken at some stage anyhow.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is tragic that the urgent necessity for this Bill should arise in the circumstances of the catastrophe which occurred at Whiddy Island on 8 January last.  I should like to take this opportunity to place on the record of the House my sympathy and that of my colleagues to all those bereaved in that disaster. It is, fortunately, rare that an event such as the Whiddy Island disaster occurs in the State.  I accept that when <Col N="432" /> faced with such an event it is important that we should have the machinery available to enable a proper and efficient inquiry to investigate all aspects of it. The Government have already announced that they intend to move a resolution in both Houses of the Oireachtas to establish a tribunal of inquiry into the disaster.  So far we have had no indication as to the composition of the tribunal or as to its terms of reference other than that Mr. Justice Costello will be its chairman and that he will be directed to inquire into the events that occurred at the Whiddy Island terminal on 8 January last.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an amendment to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, an old UK statute passed in the reign of George V.  It is a fair comment that we are and have been somewhat lax in this Legislature in our approach to law reform.  The process of law reform should be on an on-going basis.  This comment will be relevant in the context of some worries I have about the Bill to which I will refer at a later stage.  The statute has been found to be defective not, as the Minister said, directly but indirectly because of a corresponding provision in an 1970 Act which was declared to be unconstitutional.  This was the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann (Privilege and Procedure) Act, 1970 which was passed in haste.  It has been obvious since the Supreme Court decision in June 1971 that amending legislation would be necessary. Yet, it is only now, eight years later, in the aftermath of a catastrophic occurrence, again in haste, that our minds are concentrated on remedying the defect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that I am not making this point in any political sense in that for half of those eight years my own party were in Government.  The Fine Gael Party and I, as spokesman for law reform and human rights, are very concerned that the inquiry into the Whiddy explosion should (1) have the widest possible terms of reference; (2) the fullest possible powers consistent with the due process of law and (3) commence at the earliest possible date.  As a constituent Deputy for the area involved, <Col N="433" /> knowing the location and the people, including some of the deceased and their next of kin, my personal commitment to that aim will be appreciated. The people of the locality and the bereaved are in agreement with my views.  Arising out of the views indicated to me privately and expressed publicly by public representatives and community leaders in regard to this Bill and to the tribunal, I should like to make a strong plea that this inquiry be held in Bantry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that that would be more appropriate to the resolution when it comes before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am concerned about is that a decision may have been made by that time.  I realise that I am possibly straining the terms of the Bill to allow me to make this plea and I believe the Government will listen to it.  I am aware that local representatives in the Minister's party have made the same plea.  In Dublin, away from the scene of the disaster, there may not be full appreciation of the shock and trauma experienced in the area by the bereaved and the community.  A major contribution could be made towards alleviating the grief of the bereaved and the numb shock of the community by holding the inquiry in Bantry.  As was highlighted earlier, there are adequate facilities there and there is no reason why it should not be held in Bantry rather than in a strange and remote location.</P>
      <P>Justice is for the people and not for the convenience of lawyers.  Any suggestion of reluctance on the part of lawyers to travel from Dublin to the country should not be taken into account.  The result of holding the inquiry in Bantry would be to allow a community catharsis, a lifting of the heavy cloud of shock, worry and concern which has descended on the area.  I leave the plea with the Minister.</P>

I referred to the question of the terms of reference of an inquiry which will be established under this Bill and I would refer to the need for the widest possible terms of reference.  I hope the Minister is satisfied that any inquiry set up under the Act will have the widest terms of reference.  The terms are not yet known and we are told that they will be announced as soon as this Bill is law.  Is the Minister satisfied that this Bill will have sufficient powers to make sure that the Whiddy inquiry is conducted with the widest possible terms of reference?</P>
      <P>Many questions arise because of this disaster.  It is not appropriate now to go into the problems in regard to where the fire started, the distance of the escape routes, the time factors and so on, but I hope that all these things will be fully investigated by the tribunal.  Another factor, although I wonder whether it is possible to deal with it within the scope of the tribunal, relates to the problems of the situation at sea, the laws that need to be made, the protocols that need to be ratified in relation to the terms of ships entering into harbours, the question of substandard tankers and the question of certification and training to seafarers.  As the Minister is aware, there have been international moves in these areas in the recent past following the disaster of the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> off the Brittany coast, the <i>Cristos Bitas</i>, the <i>Andreas Patria</i> and now the <i>Betelgeuse.</i>  I am concerned as to whether the broader type problem to which I referred can be covered by a tribunal set up under this Act, hopefully to sit in Bantry.  If these broader issues are not covered in such a tribunal they will have to be faced in some other way, possibly ultimately by debate in this House.  The point at issue here relates to the powers and functions of the Bantry Harbour Commissioners, how such a commission should operate in the future and how they should contribute towards controlling a disaster such as that which occurred at Whiddy on 8 January last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to ensure the effectiveness of the inquiry and my worry is that, in our haste to put this Bill through, we may leave some loophole.  I have had the Bill for approximately 24 hours and I am <Col N="435" /> concerned that I am not able to make a full constructive contribution, which, in the general terms of parliamentary democracy, is expected from an Opposition spokesman.  Unfortunately, the time factor obstructed me from making a detailed analysis which would enable me to comment constructively and possibly make some suggestions to the Minister as to how the Bill might be improved.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the 1970 Act and here perhaps we should look at the sequence of events.  On 1 December 1970 it was resolved by Dáil Éireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I merely mention the history of a similar Bill which was passed in 1970, the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann Privileges and Procedure Act.  On 1 December 1970 it was resolved by Dáil Éireann that the Committee of Public Accounts should make a special examination of the expenditure of certain moneys.  Two weeks later, on 15 December, the Committee presented and interim report to the House in which they reported that in considering the adoption of procedures to govern their proceedings they had encountered a difficulty of a fundamental nature, that was the extent of the application of the provisions of sections 12 and 13 of Article 15 of the Constitution.  Two days later, on 17 December, the new Bill was circulated and all Stages taken, in, to judge by the length of the Official Report, ten minutes.  On 24 June 1971 it was found in the Supreme Court in the Hall case that a subsection of the Act violated Article 38 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> It is important that we note the sequence of events.  In December in this House concern was expressed about Article 15 of the Constitution and a Bill to deal with the problem was presented to the House and taken very quickly.  Six months later it was found to be unconstitutional under Article 38 of the Constitution. It is perhaps relevant to note that in the short debate on the 1970 Act, Deputy O'Donovan raised the point in column 1436 of Volume 250 of the Official Report that in his opinion the method of drafting was defective and in column 1437 said that the Bill was an example of hasty legislation.  How prophetic his words turned out to be.</P>
    <P>I raise the point of haste, so that the errors of the past will not be repeated.  I wish to see the Whiddy tribunal sitting as soon as possible in Bantry with the widest possible powers, but I also wish to ensure that the legislation under which the tribunal will be set up is completely watertight.  It is no harm to remember that, while the legislation is passed here in the aftermath of the Whiddy disaster, it is legislation which will deal with other matters which may arise in future which would warrant a tribunal.  We are not just legislating for today but for years ahead.  Subject to these concerns the Government have the full support of the Fine Gael Party for this legislation.  We are all agreed on the need for it.  Our real worry is whether the Bill will answer that need in full.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that this legislation is before the House arising from the Whiddy disaster.  I will avail of this opportunity to express my sympathy and the sympathy of my party to the relatives and friends of the victims, both at home and in France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has informed us that this legislation is necessary to close loopholes in legislation which was passed in 1921 and in 1970.  Let us hope that it will fulfil its purpose so that we will not find ourselves in the middle of the inquiry with counsel on one side or the other making submissions ascertaining that the tribunal's authority is not what it should be.  We must take into account that this inquiry will be watched <Col N="437" /> by oil companies from all over the world.  I am sure that oil companies, tanker companies and so on will be anxious to ascertain what happened in Whiddy on the morning of 8 January. We owe it, not only to our own people in south-west Cork but to the people of France, to ensure that the inquiry will be as comprehensive as possible and that its terms of reference will be sufficiently wide so as to cover all aspects that might arise.</P>
    <P>The Bill indicates that the tribunal will be given power to impose punishments on reluctant and untruthful witnesses.  I am sure it is only right that that power should be given.  The Bill gives the tribunal power to refer misdemeanours to another court so that appropriate punishment may be meted out.  I hope that there will be no need for this measure to be utilised by this tribunal. So far as the Irish people are concerned, I am sure they will freely give a truthful, factual account of what happened, so that there will be no need for the presiding chairman, any counsel or any other member of the tribunal to doubt their statements.  We want the truth, and I am satisfied that the Irish people will give the truth.  I expressed our sympathy to the French people who lost 42 people. I have no doubt but that any witnesses from France or other places will give balanced statements about what happened. People who were not present or in the vicinity at the time of the disaster will not be able to help such an inquiry.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy for the Gulf Oil Corporation. We welcomed them to Bantry because they gave us much needed employment at standards above those obtaining in any other type of employment here.  I am aware that the Irish chairman of the corporation and the Gulf executives are most distressed about this unfortunate calamity.  I am not endeavouring to attribute any blame to the corporation or to anybody else; that is the task of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn earlier posed an important question in relation to this inquiry when he asked who was in charge of it to date.  I should like to know who is responsible for the preliminary arrangements. <Col N="438" /> Deputy Quinn mentioned that he had correspondence from relatives of the French victims who were anxious to be made aware of the name of the person from whom they could obtain information in relation to the inquiry or whether they should address their comments to a Government Department.  Surely it is necessary to have a person in charge of arranging the inquiry.  I should like to know who is responsible for compiling the list of witnesses.  The Minister should give us all the relevant information in relation to this exceptionally important matter.  He should tell us the name of the person responsible for summoning witnesses and whether the list of witnesses will be a comprehensive one.  People with the slightest amount of information concerning the disaster should be called to give evidence irrespective of the distance they have to travel.</P>
    <P>We all agree that the terms of reference of the inquiry should be wide and the Minister has indicated that he will bring a measure before the House at a later stage establishing the inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that such matters are relevant to the resolution that will be brought before the House later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a Member of the House long enough to realise that once a Government introduce a Bill it is not changed, particularly when that Government is composed of Fianna Fáil Members.  Once the legislation is introduced establishing the tribunal we will not be in a position to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important matter and I am anxious to impress upon the Minister the desirability of making the terms of reference wide enough to enable a comprehensive investigation to be carried out into the disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During Question Time the Minister was asked about the venue for this inquiry. <Col N="439" /> We were told by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick, that the venue will be announced when the Bill is introduced.  In my view the most suitable venue would be Bantry town.  If it is held there those local people affected by the disaster will not be greatly inconvenienced. It would be much more difficult for the people in the Bantry area to travel to an outside venue than it would be for the personnel of the tribunal to travel to Bantry.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to examine this question closely.  At Question Time today Deputy Quinn asked the question, and I also want to know, who is in charge of the preliminary arrangements for the inquiry?  Who is compiling the list of witnesses?  Who will get any reports that may be required?  Who will be in charge?  Will it be the Department or will an individual be charged with responsibility for the work of the inquiry?</P>
    <P>I regret that we have this legislation before us today and hope that the measures contained in it will never have to be enforced.  I hope also that we will have a free and comprehensive inquiry, that there will be no need to bulldoze anyone into giving evidence against his will and that we will have complete co-operation from every witness who has anything to say which will help the tribunal to determine the cause of the unfortunate Whiddy disaster which occurred on the morning of 8 January with a loss of 50 lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government's decision to set up this tribunal to inquire into the tragedy which happened at Whiddy Island.  I hope that this inquiry will ensure that such a tragedy will not happen again, not only in Ireland but anywhere in the world.  I urge the Minister to have the inquiry set up as quickly as possible and to give the tribunal as wide powers as possible so that the findings of the tribunal will ensure that this type of tragedy could never happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that the inquiry will be held where the tragedy <Col N="440" /> occurred, that is in Bantry.  I have looked into the possibility of the location and the facilities there and I am satisfied from the representations I have made to the Government that the inquiry will be held in Bantry.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to give me an assurance that the findings of the inquiry will be made public and that there will be no question of the inquiry being used for the exclusive use of any one person or group.  As I said, I welcome the decision to hold the inquiry and I hope that it will ensure that this kind of tragedy will never occur again.  I am certain that the people from Whiddy and Bantry will co-operate fully with the tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The object of this Bill is to amend the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, and to give any tribunal which will be set up under that Act more teeth to make it more effective and to give it the necessary machinery properly and effectively to carry out an inquiry into any matter submitted to it.</P>
      <P>Sections 3, 4 and 6 of the Bill particularly seek to strengthen any tribunal set up under the 1921 Act.  It is very regrettable that the immediate reason for the introduction of this Bill was the Bantry Bay tragedy.  I would like to add my voice to the voices of the other Deputies who have spoken in extending our profound sympathy to the families of the 50 brave men who lost their lives in that disaster.  Those men were discharging onerous work and duties which were necessary to the continuation of our economy.  They were providing energy to keep the wheels of industry turning and to ensure that during the bad weather we would have domestic warmth.  While discharging that responsible and necessary work they gave their lives.  I share with other Deputies who say that any tribunal set up should have the power and authority to make an in depth inquiry into this tragedy.  It would be improper of me to go into the details of the disaster at this stage but it is common belief that it should never have happened, that it was quite unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order that we may be sure that the <Col N="441" /> tribunal will have the necessary powers and that it will not be held to be unconstitutional, we must have a careful look at this Bill in the light of the Constitution. It is true to say that the judges in this country, particularly in the Supreme Court, are becoming more and more jealous of their rights and the rights of the courts under the Constitution.  That is as it should be because in the last resort the only real protection that the ordinary citizen has against the Executive or the Government are the courts.  If the power of the courts is eroded in any way it be to the disadvantage of the ordinary simple citizen.  That is why I say it is a good thing the Supreme Court is so jealous of the rights of the courts under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Keeffe I have had this Bill in my hands for only a short time. He got his copy 24 hours ago but I got mine this morning.  The relevant articles of the Constitution appear to be Articles 34 and 38.  Strange as it may appear I will deal with Article 38 first because it has relevancy to section 3 of the Bill. That section sets out a list of the things which will be offensive.  It will be an offence for a person not to obey a summons to appear before the tribunal; it will be an offence for him not to take an oath and give evidence; to give evidence which he does not believe to be true; by any act or omission to hinder the tribunal; if he fails to comply with the provisions of any order made by the tribunal or does or omits to do any other thing and if such doing or omission would, if the tribunal had been the High Court, have been contempt of that court. The end of the section states that those offences will be punishable on summary conviction and that a person convicted in the summary court thereof may be fined a sum of £500 or sentenced to 12 months imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I did not have an opportunity of researching those particular penalties and the jurisdiction of a District Court to impose those penalties in a summary manner.  A learned gentleman I contacted was not prepared to give me an off-the-cuff decision, so it would be hard to expect me to do so.  Article 38.1. of the Constitution stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="442" /> No person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2. of that Article states:</P>
    <P>Minor offences may be tried by courts of summary jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court upheld that a fine of £500 may be imposed by the District Court but that does not mean that the offence is not a minor offence fit to be tried summarily.  It has also been held by the Supreme Court that a sentence of six months imprisonment may be imposed by the District Court on that summary conviction but that does not mean that the offence is not a minor offence fit to be tried summarily.</P>
    <P>Has a 12 months sentence been adjudicated on by the Supreme Court? Has the Supreme Court held that a sentence of 12 months imprisonment does not remove the offence from the category of minor offences which may be tried summarily?  If the Supreme Court has not had this question before it, there is doubt about it.  If the Supreme Court has adjudicated on the 12 months sentence and has held that it does not remove the offence from the category of minor offences, that is an end of it.  If the Supreme Court has not so adjudicated, there is real doubt here and, even at the risk of letting a man off, it would be better to substitute six months for the 12 months and be sure about it.  I am sure the Minister will be able to clarify my mind in relation to that matter.  I know that the Supreme Court is jealous of the right of the citizen to trial by jury unless in minor offences.  If the Supreme Court has any doubt that an offence is anything other than a minor offence then the accused person is entitled to trial by jury.</P>
    <P>Article 34.1 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution, and, save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law, shall be administered in public.</P>
    <P>We must be careful to ensure that a tribunal which, presumably, will be composed <Col N="443" /> of judicial and non-judicial people, is not asked to administer justice.  If it is held that it is administering justice and is doing otherwise than inquiring into an occurrence, then any orders made by such a tribunal will be held invalid under that Article of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Section 4 proposes to give to the tribunal all the rights, powers and privileges which are vested in the High Court or a judge of that court in respect of the making of orders.  I did not have time to discuss with others what functions, duties or jurisdiction a tribunal might exercise under that section.  It appears to me to be wide enough to enable the tribunal to do things that might amount to the administration of justice.  If that is the case that section will be null and void under Article 34 of the Constitution.  I would like the Minister's views on that.</P>
    <P>I am not a practising lawyer and the last thing I want to do is to object to any right being inserted in this Bill which would enable a tribunal to award costs. It would be unnatural for me to be against such a section.  Will the tribunal not be administering justice when it acts under section 6 of the Bill?  The section states:</P>
    <P>Where a tribunal, or, if the tribunal consists of more than one member, the chairman of the tribunal, is of opinion that, having regard to the findings of the tribunal and all other relevant matters, there are sufficient reasons rendering it equitable to do so, the tribunal or the chairman, as the case may be, may by order direct that the whole or part of the costs of any person appearing before the tribunal by counsel or solicitor, as taxed by a Taxing Master of the High Court, shall be paid to the person by any other person named in the order.</P>
    <P>The tribunal, exercising the rights given to it under that section, will be acting in a judicial manner and will certainly be administering justice because it has to weigh up, having regard to the facts established and to the evidence and to its <Col N="444" /> findings, whether it is right and equitable to award costs.  We know from heresay only because it is not inserted in the Bill, that this Bill, which we are passing to deal with this tribunal, will deal with all future tribunals that are set up.  We know that in this case the chairman is to be a distinguished judge of the High Court.  He, as chairman of the tribunal, will be exercising this power.  Is he doing that as a judge or as a member of the tribunal?  Those are questions that have to be answered.  I do not think that the chairman of the tribunal under the 1921 Act must always be a judge and I have no doubt that coming to a decision under section 6 of this Bill will mean that the exercise will be the administration of justice by the person who comes to that decision.  I am fully conscious of the fact that the drafters of this Bill were well aware of the point that I am making and they sought to get around that point by not enabling a solicitor to lodge the tribunal's Order with the Sheriff and to tell him to go and collect them.  They were very conscious of the point I am making but they sought to get around that by saying that the person who has been awarded the costs can recover the costs in any court of competent jurisdiction.  That is the way that they are taking of saying that the tribunal is not administering justice.  I doubt very much whether that will hold water because as I see it whether the taxing master has power to tax on a certificate of the tribunal or not, once the tribunal awards costs, the amount will then be due and it will not be open to the defendant or the Minister or anybody else to come into court on the action that will be brought later on for the recovery of those costs to dispute the amount due. That will be due on the decision of the tribunal and this other provision in sub-section 2 of section 1 is merely an attempt by the draftsman and his advisers to get around the point I am making. They will not get around it in this way because it will not be the District Court or the Circuit Court or the High Court that will be adjudicating on whether the amount is due or not.  That will already have been certified as being due by the tribunal and it will not have any option other than to rubber stamp the amount <Col N="445" /> due.  What would be the defence?  There would of course be a constitutional defence that the tribunal had not a constitutional right to award costs under section 6 as it purported to do.  That is also a very real question.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to take up the time of the House any longer but I seriously recommend that the Minister would not ask for all stages of this Bill today.  We are all anxious that the Whiddy Island disaster be inquired into and steps taken as a result of that inquiry to ensure that the like will never happen again but we would not necessarily be expediting the holding and the findings of such an inquiry if we pass legislation here today. That is very likely to end up in the Supreme Court.  I would ask the Minister to have a serious look at the points I have made on sections 3, 4 and 6 of this Bill.  He has far more machinery and advisers than we could possibly have.  I would ask the Minister, having considered these points, to give us the benefit of his opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would strongly support my colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick of Fine Gael, in his request that the Committee Stage and subsequent stages of this Bill be taken and finished tomorrow because the longer I am in this House and the more often we are asked to pass legislation very quickly, the more unhappy I get about it.</P>
      <P>It was said in this House last week that the Labour Party was fully committed to a prompt holding of this inquiry. An extra 12 hours' delay is not going to endanger that prospect and the House will be given an opportunity to do its job more effectively and properly.  In so far as this side of the House is in any way responsible for legislation we will have produced better legislation as a result of that delay and reconsideration.  I do not know how the Minister is tied in this regard but I would certainly urge him to sympathetically consider Deputy Fitzpatrick's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very sorry that Mr. Collins is here taking this legislation and I am very sorry indeed that the Minister of State who is going to be involved in the procedures relating to the tribunal for <Col N="446" /> which this legislation is now before the House does not appear to have sufficient interest to sit in at the Second Stage debate.  Perhaps the Minister of State feels that having participated inadequately in Question Time he has given the House enough of his time today.</P>
    <P>One cannot&mdash;and I wish to conform totally with the rules of the House in this regard&mdash;seriously talk about this legislation without in some way referring to the background which has made it the necessity that it is and has given it the urgency that it now has.</P>
    <P>Let me preface my remarks by saying that it is unfortunate that politicians, and in particular opposition politicians, are placed in the position of appearing to capitalise or make publicity out of the tragedies and miseries of individuals; that is certainly not my intention or the intention of any of my colleagues in this House.  We have a democratic function to perform and it is in pursuit of that function that I would ask the Minister to explain why it is that the Government only subsequently indicated to the public that a public inquiry would be taken under this legislation.  My information, orally from one of the Assistant Secretaries of the Department of Tourism and Transport, was that the inquiry would be under the 1894 Merchant Shipping Act.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain why for some initial period of time the Government proceeded along the lines that the machinery of that antiquated piece of legislation, which is as much related to sailing boats as to oil tankers, was adequate to provide the framework for such an inquiry.  It was only when myself and others pointed out that there were extreme limitations to this legislation and indeed when the cobwebs were dusted off it in the Department of Tourism and Transport that they realised that it was not adequate.  Mr. Collins has more than enough to do besides preparing and presenting to this House enabling legislation for a Government Department, that is, the Department of Tourism and Transport which is probably unique for its incompetence. That may seem harsh and perhaps not necessarily relevant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister now in the House is not responsible for anything in that Department, but because the matters involved in this inquiry will be of enormous significance to those directly involved in terms of consequential claims that may arise, and because the inquiry will create a framework whereby the cause of the disaster may have considerable repercussions on the installations at Whiddy and on the engagement of the various companies there, it is essential that the compulsion clauses in the Bill, if I may so describe them, will be looked at with a fine tooth comb.  That is why we on these benches are strongly supporting <Col N="448" /> the request that the Committee Stage be postponed until tomorrow.  It is to the shame of the Government that so far they have not been able to publish the terms of reference of this inquiry.  We should not have to speculate about the possible effects of this legislation, and if the terms of reference had been published some of the fears we have in regard to this legislation would have been allayed and we would not be concerned to the same extent with the effectiveness or otherwise of some of the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to make some points on a purely hypothetical case, without implicating anybody.  The penalties to be imposed by this Bill are a fine of £500 and, or, a prison sentence of 12 months&mdash;if you take Deputy Fitzpatrick's reservation, the prison sentence would be six months.  I should not like to have to incur either of these penalties, but we must look at them in the context of multinational oil companies and of the revelations we have had in the last couple of years about the machinations of these companies.  These penalties are chickenfeed in that context.  When we talk in terms of the entire disaster and of money sums of enormous amounts in compensation, we must ask if the instrument through which the Minister seeks to compel people to attend the inquiry is sufficient to meet the possible extreme situation that may occur.</P>
      <P>I again qualify what I am saying by pointing out that it is hypothetical, but our function on this side of the House is to attempt to make good law, and in the absence of these terms of reference one is left to speculate as to how effective this legislation will be.  The Chair has said the terms of reference will come before the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Chair is not aware that they will.  What the Chair said is that when the resolution establishing the tribunal comes before <Col N="449" /> the House the question of the terms of reference may be discussed.  They are not relevant on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I propose to speak for only 15 minutes.  I am making relatively short, to-the-point observations and as an Opposition Deputy I do not see how I can do that without referring in some shape or form to the inquiry.  I am asking the Minister if he can give us an indication when he is replying of when the terms of reference will be published.  Can he also indicate where the inquiry will be held?  That could provoke the excuse by some people that they would be unable to attend, that they would be unable to get away to attend an inquiry in a place like Bantry or in some alternative venue which may be considered by the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  We are not asking these questions for the fun of it, not because it happens to keep the journalists and civil servants busy.  We have been getting serious sustained representations from all over the country from organisations anxious to know what is happening.</P>
      <P>How is it that four weeks after this disaster we still do not know what will happen?  We still do not know where the inquiry will be, we do not know the terms of reference and until this legislation has been passed we do not know the provisions of the legislation under which the inquiry will be held.  If this is the product of a sound executive Government with 84 Dáil seats, I should like to know what a spancelled Coalition Government could do in regard to similar circumstances.  We have here total Government inactivity.  The House is entitled to know which decisions the Government have made, when we will be told when the inquiry being set up by this legislation will take place.  I accept that the Minister for Justice is carrying a bag for another Minister who should have been in a position to tell us a couple of days after the tragedy that the legislation under which the inquiry will be held would not be the Merchant Shipping Act but this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil was called back on the Thursday before Christmas.  It should have been recalled again some days after <Col N="450" /> the disaster to give us adequate notice. The drafting of this legislation did not stretch the resources of the Minister or his staff, but here we are in the second week after the Dáil resumption debating this legislation.  That is not good enough and I should like the Minister to tell us why people in this country have been kept in the dark.</P>
    <P>If anybody in this House had relatives in Irish Shipping who happened to have been involved in a disaster, let us say, in France, and if four weeks after the event a person or persons were still missing and the Government in France had not indicated that the body or bodies had not been recovered, and if the responsible French Minister was unable to say where the inquiry would be held, if he was unable to say what the terms of reference were, and so forth, every Deputy in the House would be besieged with representations.  Surely this Government feel some responsibility to the unfortunate relatives of the 40 or so French sailors who lost their lives, and surely out of courtesy and humanity to them without further delay they should give the information I have been seeking. Must one conclude that at this stage the Government still do not know what they are doing and that they are &ldquo;flying by the seat of their pants&rdquo; in this regard?</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated, too, with the expressions of sympathy to the relatives and friends of those who lost their lives in this tragedy.  I welcome the legislation and trust that it will have a speedy passage through the House.</P>
      <P>I support what Deputy Quinn has said and join with him in asking why the legislation was not introduced sooner so as to enable the tribunal to be set up much earlier.  When there are major disasters abroad, especially in Britain, inquiries begin within a matter of days.  In the case of the Whiddy disaster time has been allowed to slide.  However, I trust that the legislation will prove fruitful and that, if it should contain any defect, it will be put right within the next day or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has given us food for thought in indicating three or four likely flaws in the Bill.  Only three or four <Col N="451" /> years ago we dealt with a piece of legislation which, if it had not involved snags, would possibly have meant that this disaster would not have occurred.  I refer to the legislation setting up the Bantry Bay Harbour Authority but that legislation would not appear to have been effective.  I trust that this Bill will not lead to any lengthy court case or to any similar delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the flaws in the 1921 and 1970 Acts.  It is disquieting to note that those flaws were discovered as far back as 1971 and that it is only now we are attempting to rectify them.  If the sections concerned should have been contested, steps in this regard should have been taken long ago so that the legislation could have been amended at a leisurely pace instead of rushing it through the House now.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I visited the Whiddy area.  I was struck not only by the grief of the relatives and friends of those who died but also by the hardship being borne by a large section of the community in the area.  Other matters have come to light which had led to people there living in fear of losing out greatly as a result of the disaster.  I refer to the fishing community in the immediate area.</P>

I should like the Minister to tell me whether this allegation is correct.  If there is any foundation for it, it will be a cause for much public disquiet and concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members for their general welcome for the Bill.  Despite the reservations that were expressed and teased out by Deputy Fitzpatrick in respect of one or two sections, I trust that the House will agree to give me all Stages of the Bill today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal in detail with the points raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  The request from Deputy Quinn that the Bill should not conclude today intrigues me because, although I listened extremely carefully to everything said by the Deputy, there was not as much as a hint from him as to any reason for the Bill not being put through all Stages today. Deputy Quinn has been hitting the headlines in certain newspapers since this unfortunate tragedy.  He has been making statements that to my mind were not at all accurate, but I would remind him that the Taoiseach visited the location of the disaster within hours of the event.  I understand also that the Minister for Labour went there on the same day. After visiting Whiddy and talking with departmental officials, with the Garda and with representatives of Gulf Oil, the Taoiseach announced that there would be a full formal inquiry into the disaster. He did not say, however, under which legislation the inquiry would be held, because obviously that was a matter that required careful examination.  In the event it was necessary for the Minister for Tourism and Transport to assign an inspector from his Department to engage in a preliminary investigation.  In addition the Minister for Labour, having regard to his statutory responsibilities, arranged for two inspectors from his Department to go to the area to investigate the position.  It should be remembered that these people were on <Col N="453" /> the spot within hours of the disaster.  It must be remembered, too, that in order to have an effective inquiry it is necessary to collect evidence.  Indeed, even the most simple court inquiry requires the procuring of evidence, of statements and so on.  Deputy Quinn's approach to the whole issue is totally unrealistic.  Any acrimony that was introduced into the debate was done so by Deputy Quinn who, in the course of his contribution, had nothing whatsoever to say on the contents of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is fear and concern perhaps Deputy Quinn might examine his own conscience in this area. I deplore his remarks with regard to the presence or absence of Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick during the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>With regard to the remarks made by Deputy O'Keeffe at the start of the debate, I am sure he knows that I cannot comment on the terms of reference of the inquiry during the course of discussion on this Bill.  The Deputy knows too, that when the Minister for Tourism and Transport brings forward the resolution for discussion in both Houses there will be ample scope for debate on the terms of reference.  The concern expressed by Deputies O'Keeffe, Murphy and Walsh, the three west Cork Deputies, with regard to having a full inquiry into the disaster is a concern which I and the Government fully share.  The Deputy will also understand that I cannot comment at this stage on the location of the inquiry or say where it will be based.  I can assure the Deputy that full consideration will be given to the points raised by Members of the House and also to points raised in direct representations to the Government by people who are genuinely concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of his contribution Deputy Murphy asked who was looking after the preliminary arrangements for the inquiry and who was compiling the list of witnesses.  The Deputy probably knows that a preliminary notice has already been published by the Department of Tourism and Transport inviting <Col N="454" /> persons to participate in the inquiry and to get in touch with an official of that Department.  I am not sure whether Deputy Murphy said that it seemed to him that the tribunal could punish a witness but, if he should have that impression, it is not correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  A witness can only be punished under the Bill by the District Court following the normal trial procedure.  Deputy Walsh was anxious about the findings of the court. Under section 2 (a) of the 1921 Act, which remains unaffected by the Bill, the tribunal shall not refuse to allow the public to be present unless, in the opinion of the tribunal, it is in the public interest expedient to do so.  The Act does not say anything with regard to non-publication of the report.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick in relation to the constitutionality of section 4 and the power to impose a 12 months imprisonment sentence in the District Court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to point out to Deputy Fitzpatrick and others who raised the point that the tribunal will be a fact finding body only and there is no question of it exercising judicial powers.  It can only make orders in relation to its functions and will not be able to make orders of a nature that would be made by the High Court.</P>

If he is trying to convey the impression that the Government and Parliament are not concerned about this issue he is doing a grave injustice to Parliament, because nothing could be further from the truth.  It has been clear since that unfortunate day on January 8 <Col N="456" /> last that the whole nation, and not just Deputy Quinn and whatever newspaper he was helping along the way, were truly shocked at and deeply concerned about such a tragedy.  The Government are very anxious that this tribunal of inquiry should be got under way as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to make provision in the Defence Acts for the commissioned Army rank of Brigadier-General, which rank is not provided for at present.  On the seniority scale the proposed new rank comes between the ranks of colonel and major-general. The Bill also provides that the existing naval rank of commodore shall correspond to the new Army rank of brigadier-general and for the creation of a new naval rank of rear-admiral corresponding to the existing army rank of major-general.</P>
      <P>As to my purpose in introducing the Bill at this time, I have had the rank structure at senior level in the Defence Forces under examination recently and I have found that certain changes are necessary.  Arising from this examination, the ranks of the three principal military offices, namely chief of staff, adjutant-general and quartermaster-general, have, as Deputies will be aware, already been upgraded&mdash;from major-general to lieutenant-general in the case of the chief of staff and from colonel to major-general in the case of the adjutant-general and quartermaster-general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> It is also my intention that the ranks for the appointments of assistant chief of staff and officers commanding commands will be upgraded from the present rank of colonel to brigadier-general. These upgradings, together with those already effected to which I have referred, will, having regard to the relative levels of responsibility, result in a more rational rank structure at senior level in the Defence Forces and will, in particular, rectify the anomalous situation hitherto existing in which officers in the rank of colonel held appointments at three different levels of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The situation in this respect has been that a brigade commander reported to an officer commanding a command who, in turn, was subject to controls exercised by the adjutant-general and quartermaster-general.  The rank for all those appointments was colonel until the recent upgrading of the appointments of adjutant-general and quartermaster-general. The provisions of this Bill will enable me to complete the task in relation to the appointments of officers commanding commands and the assistant chief of staff.  Officers commanding commands are, of course, also subject to directions issued by the chief of staff but, in that case, the rank for the appointment of chief of staff was normally higher than colonel.</P>
    <P>In the Defence Forces, more than in any other organisation, the badge of authority is a most important factor. The House will, I am sure, agree that it is not just a matter of superficial title or adornment but is a very necessary and serious accommodation under military law to the requirements of command, authority and discipline.</P>
    <P>The new rank structure will also provide a better promotion progression for military officers.  A further bonus is that it will provide a pool of officers of general rank from which can be drawn officers for certain senior appointments with United Nations forces.  Under the present structure, any such officer has to be promoted exceptionally if he is to enjoy the rank appropriate to the appointment.</P>
    <P>I trust that the purpose of the Bill is now clear to all Deputies and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Col N="459" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I compliment the Minister on making the changes he had made.  There are a few points on which I should like clarification from the Minister.  As he said, we have always been at a disadvantage in that the rank structures in our Defence Forces have been different from those in western European nations.  This new rank structure will bring us into line with them and with UN forces.  As the Minister said, when we send missions abroad we usually have to promote one of our senior officers.  To my mind that is quite wrong.</P>
      <P>I thought the Minister would have dealt with pay structures to a certain extent. We are introducing a new rank of brigadier-general and I am surprised that the Minister has not stated what his salary will be.  I looked through the State Directory, 1979, and I have come up with no figure for a brigadier-general.  I am also concerned about the different rates of pay between the Army and the Garda, not the Army versus the Garda. Senior Army officers should be on the same pay scale as senior Garda officers. It is disquieting to me to notice that even though the new general will have many more men under his control than the Commissioner of the Garda, his salary will still be more than a couple of hundred pounds less than that of the Commissioner.</P>
      <P>If we compare the salary of the Assistant Garda Commissioner with the salary of the new major-general&mdash;and I take it that this is a fair comparison&mdash;we find that his salary is £200 lower.  We can go right down the line.  For example, we could compare the salary of a chief superintendent at £7,619 with the salary of a colonel at £7,560.  I cannot understand why they are not paid at the same rate.  When a garda finishes his training he receives £56.49 as against the pay of a private, grade 2, which is £48.44, a difference of more than £8.  I know from talking with them that many men in our Defence Forces are concerned with their rate of pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should inform us of the salary of the new brigadier-general and he should tell us why there is a difference between Army and Garda pay.  There <Col N="460" /> are 15,000 members of the Garda Síochána at present and the FCA and the Defence Forces combined have in excess of 30,000 men.  I am not saying that the gardaí are not entitled to over-time but the members of the Defence Forces who have had to work long hours on border duty should be given an incentive bonus.  It is also important to remember that the Garda Síochána are awaiting a pay increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister will ensure that the members of the Defence Forces are given a similar increase in pay.</P>
      <P>We welcome the creation of the new posts, particularly the change in the rank of colonel.  Up to now a man in charge of a divisional area was given the rank of colonel.  Is the Minister satisfied that a change is not needed in the structure of the air corps?  I cannot understand why he did not change the rank of commandant to the rank of major as this rank is in general use throughout Europe at present. It may be too late to add this to the Bill but it should give us an opportunity to bring our rank structure in line with the structures in use in other western States.  I take it that the Minister has no intention of changing the structure of the FCA.  At present the highest rank in the FCA is the rank of commandant.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope the Minister will consider the points I have made.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the Bill.  Its adoption will give greater recognition to the importance of the present-day role of our Defence Forces at home and on security duties in different parts of the world. Since 1960 we have always answered the call of the United Nations and many of our soldiers have given their lives in the service of world peace.  We can be proud of their ultimate sacrifice and we should not forget them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill can be described as a watershed in the affairs of our security forces because of the creation of new senior posts in the Army and Naval Service. <Col N="461" /> It is the launching pad for a new deal for all members of our Defence Forces from the new rank of brigadier-general to the rank of private.  At this stage I should like to pay a special tribute to the Minister for his recent decision in connection with our men who are serving in the Middle East.  I have received genuine complaints from the parents of some of the soldiers in regard to the inadequacy of the overseas allowances and I called for an investigation.  I felt strongly about this issue because our men are serving in the most delicate war situation in the world.  At the outset these complaints were denied by the Minister, the Department and the Government Information Services. However, I persisted with my complaints knowing them to be genuine. Shortly afterwards, when he was touring the Middle East, the Minister confirmed my original complaint and almost immediately increased the allowance for soldiers operating in the area.  I compliment him on his speedy action which was very much appreciated by the soldiers.</P>
    <P>Because of his concern for our Defence Forces I am asking him to continue the good work by initiating an overall examination of their needs.  Not having a strong lobby, they rely on the Government, the Minister and concerned Members of the Oireachtas for the improvement of their conditions.  The Minister should involve himself in an in-depth study of pay, living conditions and the antiquated attitudes of the executive towards discipline.  Above all, the security forces should be granted greater independence from the tentacles of the Irish &ldquo;Pentagon&rdquo;&mdash;the civil service in Parkgate Street.  Perhaps I am being too ambitious, but these are my priorities. We should ensure that our Defence Forces are proud of their role and capable of their destiny.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the overall salary structure, especially to the recruitment campaign which uses the slogan &ldquo;Join the Army.  It's man's life.  Earn £55.85 per week.&rdquo;  I regret to say that I consider this propaganda effort a &ldquo;con&rdquo; job and a fraudulent campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has done so far but I should like to mention some aspects of the pay and conditions in our Army.  The point I want to make is that the men are earning their money.  Most of these men are single and their take home pay is nearer £35.  Again, it is the income tax problem. From my knowledge of my own area where there are barracks I can say that there are young men who are not at all happy with the situation in regard to what they can put into their pockets.  I had a recent case of a boy on this so called £55.85 a week, taking away £24.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall conclude on that. The difference between the apparently high pay and the actual take home pay is a matter of concern for many Army men and in my opinion will affect the intake of recruits.  The situation may arise where young men will not stay in the Army.  I ask the Minister to examine this aspect of the matter because it is a matter of great concern to Army men and their wives.</P>
      <P>We are giving our Defence Forces the most up-to-date equipment and weaponry but we are living in the past in the area of discipline.  Detention areas which unfortunately are still known as &ldquo;Spike&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The relationship between officers and rank and file is not what I should like to see in 1979 when the Army is such an important factor in the well-being and security of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to compliment all those serving in the Naval Service, the Army and the Air Corps.  The number of ships and planes available may not be sufficient but they are performing a wonderful service in protecting our fish stocks from marauding ships from inside <Col N="463" /> and outside the EEC.  In the case of a matter discussed a short time ago here, the Whiddy disaster, the Defence Forces were in the forefront in the operations connected with this terrible tragedy which hit Bantry Bay.  I hope that the EEC grants promised for more ships and planes will not involve long term planning in ten years from now.  We need them now.  With the added responsibility of protecting our off-shore oil, which I hope will be on stream in the next couple of years, our Defence Forces will need more ships and planes and the best of equipment.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the recent announcement of the alteration in the structure of the FCA and its importance and role in our Defence Forces in the future.  These men dedicated their time voluntarily over the years to the well-being of our people and our country and we are now recognising their work and their contribution.  I shall have more to say later on the Defence Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join Deputy White, spokesman for Fine Gael and Deputy Ryan, spokesman for the Labour Party, in congratulating the Minister on the introduction of this short Bill.  I shall not go into many details because I think the real content of the Bill was mentioned by the Minister when he said:</P>
      <P>In the Defence Forces, more than in any other organisation, the badge of authority is a most important factor. The House will, I am sure, agree that it is not just a matter of superficial title or adornment but it is a very necessary and serious accommodation under military law to the requirements of command, authority and discipline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quote that because I am an ex-Army officer and I realise the importance of that badge.  That is why I join with the Opposition parties in congratulating the Minister on this Bill.  May I also compliment him on bringing out the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service when they are called upon at times to come to the aid of the civil power.  He has <Col N="464" /> brought the Air Corps more into association with the public, not alone by means of the helicopter service to hospitals but also by means of the new move made in consultation with the Government in buying a jet and allowing Army personnel to pilot and service it&mdash;in other words, giving more training to our Air Corps pilots.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall confine my remarks to the Naval Service.  I see that the Minister intends to create a new rank of Rear Admiral, and I welcome that, but the position of the Naval Service in relation to the Defence Forces as a whole is very rarely examined by the House or by the public and it deserves consideration.  I suppose any Army is inclined to complain that it is dominated and over-governed by the Department of Defence or whatever Department deals with the Army of the State in any country.  Despite whatever complaints our Army may have about the preponderance of civil servants in the Department of Defence and the fact that they may feel that civil servants can exercise too great an influence on the activities of the armed forces, the position of the Naval Service is particularly strange because not only does it have to contend with the bureaucracy of the Department but in order to get improvements within its ranks or in its recruitment it must first convince the Army of the necessity for any change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time past there has been a feeling in the Naval Service that it should be allowed to operate as a separate service and deal more directly with the Department rather than have to go through the Army chain of command in its dealings with the Department. Perhaps there have been recent improvements in that regard, and if so I should be interested to hear of them, but I know this is a real bone of contention among naval personnel.  They feel that not only have they to fight the civil servants, as it were, but also the hierarchy of the Army.  Naturally, the Army chain of command is a hierarchical structure which has Army men as chiefs of staff and this means there is a natural influence or bias in favour of the Army as opposed to the Naval Service.  I make <Col N="465" /> that point especially in view of the proposed improvement in the size of the Naval Service and the additional ships which are supposed to come into commission.</P>
    <P>I understood that the Minister promised some time ago that the Naval Service would shortly have an enlistment of 1,000 men.  Would he say what the present enrolment figure is and is it anywhere near that figure?  One of the difficulties in the Naval Service especially for technical officers and particularly engineer officers, because these are men with special qualifications in engineering and marine engineering, is that the scale of pay available to them is dreadfully unattractive compared with equivalent rates for men with the same qualifications if they were to go either deep sea or into the home trade.  Consequently there is very little incentive for qualified men, especially in the engineer officer grade, to go into the Naval Service and very little incentive for men in the Naval Service at present to remain there because there is a very limited structure of promotion.  They are constantly attracted towards the far better conditions, time off and rates of pay offered by concerns like the B + I, Irish Shipping and other operators on the commercial side. For that reason it is necessary to pay particular attention to the rates of pay in the Naval Service.  Deputy White has already spoken about the disparity in pay rates between the armed forces in general, the Garda and other areas. Because the Naval Service must be experiencing great difficulty in recruiting skilled personnel at that level or in holding on to the skilled personnel already there, there should be a special examination of rates paid to the men in the Naval Service, especially if we are properly to man these additional ships which, hopefully, are to arrive in the near future.  I ask the Minister when he is replying to give some attention to that aspect of the Naval Service, and also to deal with the question of the enlistment of men within that service and the idea that the Naval Service should be allowed as a separate power to deal with the Government of the day and the Department of Defence without having to go <Col N="466" /> through the Army for every nut and bolt that they need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the various Deputies for their contributions and for the compliments which they have paid to the Defence Forces for the exemplary manner in which they have carried out the many onerous duties they have been called upon to perform in recent years.  I am glad that the House has given a clear welcome to the Bill which, simply stated, merely establishes a new rank in the Army, the rank of brigadier-general and that of rear-admiral in the Naval Service. It may have been an omission on my part not to have mentioned the pay of a brigadier-general, but I can now put that on the record.  The pay for the new rank of brigadier-general will be £9,700 a year which, including a responsibility allowance of £894 is at present the pay of a person holding the appointment OC of a command.  Those persons who hold the appointment of OC in the four commands, whom it is my intention to promote to brigadier-general if the House agrees to the Bill, will not receive any increase in their rates of remuneration because of the relationship of the pay of a brigadier-general to the rate of pay of which they are presently in receipt plus the allowance for the appointments. Therefore, what I am doing is merely amalgamating the salary and allowance of the command OCs into one salary figure for a brigadier-general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether it is true that the ranks here are different from what they are in other western nations, as Deputy White has said.  In nearly all ranks now we equate to the ranks as they exist in most of the other western nations except in the one he mentioned, that of commandant, which is the equivalent of major in most other armies.  There are historical reasons for the retention of the rank of commandant in the Irish Army which go back to the War of Independence.  It was an Irish Volunteer and Old IRA rank.  Subsequent Governments deemed it appropriate that for that historical reason it should be retained as a link with the past.  It is unique to the Irish Army to have the rank of commandant and <Col N="467" /> because of these historical connections it would not be my wish to do away with that rank, particularly as the founder of my party held that rank in the IRA of those days, as I am sure many friends of Deputy White's party did also.</P>
    <P>Deputy White drew comparisons between the Army and the Garda.  I do not intend to follow him down that avenue because it is not strictly related to this Bill.  Possibly the matter will come up on another occasion and I might have an opportunity of dealing with it in an Estimate perhaps.  I do not think it is possible to make direct comparisons of the kind which the Deputy attempted.  It is a complex issue and if the Deputy would raise it on another occasion I would be happy to let him have more accurate equivalents with regard to the pay of persons in the Garda and the Army. The pay structure is different, the responsibilities are different and the duties are not altogether the same.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed that there would be any change in the rank structures in the FCA, as Deputy White inquired.  That will not arise as these ranks will, as far as one can see, continue in the future to affect only the Permanent Defence Force and the officers holding the principal military posts in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>On the question of pay, in general the Defence Forces receive increases in line with whatever increases are granted from time to time to the civil service. Notwithstanding that, it is my intention that the rate of remuneration to all men serving in the forces should be kept under review, and that where improvements are deemed to be necessary, steps will be taken to bring about those improvements. As well as the basic rate of pay there are various allowances for security duties, Border duties and other forms of exceptional duties.  I have attempted to keep these under review. Nearly all of them have been increased during my short term of office, and I hope to continue to seek to ensure that the remuneration of the men who give such loyal service to the Defence Forces would be such as would befit the excellence <Col N="468" /> of the service which they have given.  I would always agree with those who state that possibly they are not being paid enough, and it would be my job to seek to have improvements brought about in the conditions of service and in the remuneration itself.  There already have been improvements and it is an ongoing matter which will receive continuous attention from me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan mentioned the question of overseas allowances paid to those serving with the United Nations in southern Lebanon.  He referred to statements he made some months back.  It is unfortunate that he made those statements because they were not accurate, they were very misleading and were not very helpful to the families and friends of those men who were serving abroad.  I did not get any notice that he was going to raise that issue, but I recollect him making statements of the kind which conveyed the impression that the men did not have enough money to buy food and that kind of thing.  This is totally inaccurate and it was most unfortunate that he made those statements.  It would have been much wiser if he had consulted with the Department, checked these matters and then made his comments. I would advise Deputies always to do that especially in regard to any group of our soldiers who are serving overseas.  It is wrong that inaccurate information about the conditions should get out.  A statement of that kind can create uneasiness for the families, friends and girl friends when their loved ones are away serving a difficult mission abroad.  I appeal especially to public representatives to contact my Department where they will always find a willing ear and will be given the exact position. My Department seek at all times to keep up to date with the situation, and on a day-to-day basis we know what is going on out there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan also unfortunately made some criticism of the recruiting campaign which is going on at the moment. I had hoped that there would be words of encouragement from both parties on the Opposition side of the House to young men to join the Army, rather than inaccurate criticisms.  I do not <Col N="469" /> know where Deputy Ryan got the figure of £24 per week.  It is inaccurate and most misleading, and it is unfortunate that he should make this kind of statement. The rates of pay can easily be made available.  Income tax applies to all citizens who earn an income, according to their circumstances.  We know that the allowances for a single person are not as generous as they are for a married person who has the care of a wife and possibly children to look after, and as one's family increases the allowance increases. One must take these matters into account.  No matter what his marital status is, there is no soldier, single or otherwise, in receipt of the sum of only £24.  Again it is unfortunate that people get up and make this kind of statement. It does not help.  I am sure the spokesmen on Defence on the other side of the House are aware that when one is dealing with the Defence Forces the morale of the men is of great importance and this type of statement does nothing to help boost that morale.  I am glad that Deputy White did not resort to that type of statement.  He has all along given me very encouragement and support for whatever moves I have sought to make to improve the conditions for the men in the Defence Forces.  I hope that that happy relationship will continue to exist between Deputy White, the Fine Gael Party and myself.  I appeal to Deputy Ryan to step into line because it is in the interest of all of us that morale and discipline in our Defence Forces should be nothing but the very best.  If there are matters disturbing any Deputies they can always come to me for information if they are having difficulty in getting it elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland who is an intrepid sailor himself referred to the Naval Service and he made some pertinent points. I suppose it is true that the situation to which he referred will continue to exist in regard to the Naval Service and the Air Corps as people are inclined to regard them as being separate forces.  They are not.  They are Corps within the Defence Forces.  They are not a defence force in their own right but are part of the Irish Defence Forces which are made up of the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> In my time as Minister I have not found any of the resentment that was mentioned by Deputy Boland in regard to the necessity for Naval Service personnel to make their case to senior officers in the Army who then present the case to the Civil Service or possibly to the Minister.  I seek to take a personal interest, on a week-to-week basis, in the affairs of the Naval Service, the Air Corps and other branches of the Forces.  I try to keep myself up-to-date and informed and as close to the situation as is possible for any Minister.  I think I would be in a better position to judge if there was any need for attention in this area in regard to resentment between the Naval officers and the Army officers.  I have not found it.  The Naval Service are under great strain.  In a very short period of time they have been asked to take responsibility for patrolling a vast area of water since the introduction of the 200-mile limit.  This necessitates the rapid expansion of the Naval Service in regard to the number of ships and the personnel to man them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan got it wrong in the sense that he was saying we would need more ships and planes.  So far as equipment is concerned, we will be able to supply the ships and planes.  Our difficulty might be more in getting personnel to man the ships.  The training of huge numbers in a short period presents great difficulties but everything possible will be done by me and by my Department to ease those difficulties.  We are aware of the extra burdens falling on senior officers in the Naval Service. They have our support and I am confident that the force will be able to continue to give the first-class service it has given up to now and to give it in the expanded service.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Naval Service is increasing year by year.  In the next few years it is hoped to reach the figure of 1,000 and it will be necessary to exceed that figure to a considerable extent.  One can see that by the mid or late 1980s possibly there will need to be 4,000 or 5,000 personnel in the Naval Service. When I took over there were approximately 700.  One can appreciate the difficulties that have to be overcome in the <Col N="471" /> way of training officers and NCO's of all ranks to ensure that the service carries out its duties efficiently in the enlarged area.</P>
    <P>The question of pay of technical officers in the Naval Service has been presenting us with a problem, and this was mentioned in the debate.  The matter has had my personal attention and is continuing to have it.  I appreciate that the comments made by Deputy Boland were made in the best faith and certainly I shall do everything I can to improve the position.  The reality is that we are competing with outside services.  We are competing with the various shipping companies, who are offering more and more attractions to men to serve on their vessels, and to match that presents obvious difficulties.  Our conditions of service must relate to the armed forces and to the entire public service.  I ask for the goodwill of Members of this House in trying to deal with this problem and in ensuring that we gain adequate technical officers for the Naval Service.  We must ensure that our ships are manned with the number of engineers that are necessary.</P>
    <P>At all levels of command in the Naval Service there is need for more men and there will be vacancies in the service for a long time.  I appeal to any Irishman who holds the qualifications necessary, such as marine engineering certificates, to consider joining the service.  There are vacancies and the conditions of service at the moment are good.  We hope to improve them so that the personnel will have a satisfying life at sea and at home. There are also vacancies for executive branch officers in the Naval Service and I appeal to young men to consider making their career at sea in a modern navy and in modern vessels.  They will have a good future and a satisfying career.</P>
    <P>I do not think any other points were raised that warrant comment from me.  I wish to thank the House for the welcome given to this move to create a more rational rank structure in the Irish Army.  I hope it will improve the career structure for those officers who have chosen the Army as their career and that <Col N="472" /> they will find it a rewarding and satisfying life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I moved the Second Reading of the Health Contributions (Amendment) Bill, 1978, in the House last March, I mentioned that it was the Government's intention to replace the present flat-rate social insurance and health contributions by a pay-related scheme of contributions and indicated that it was proposed to commence the new scheme in April 1979.  The Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1978, provided for the conversion of the existing flat-rate and pay-related social insurance contributions and flat-rate occupational injuries contributions into fully pay-related contributions and the arrangements for this conversion are now proceeding.  In speaking on the Second Stage of this Bill <Col N="474" /> on 7 November 1978, I outlined the advantages of the pay-related system of contributions over the present arrangements for social welfare benefits.  The main advantage in the change lies in departing from a regressive system, as the scheme of flat-rate contributions is, to a system where contributions are related to income.  This, of course, benefits the lowly paid.  I also mentioned the greater convenience and security in collection of contributions under the new scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House proposes similar changes in the scheme of health contributions which has been a feature of the financing of our health services since 1971.  The case for changing to income-related health contributions is much the same as on the social welfare side and I need not repeat all the arguments for this case in detail.</P>
    <P>Under the present Act, health contributions are paid by persons who have limited eligibility for health services, with some specified exemptions.  These are, broadly speaking, persons who have not medical cards and who come within the income and valuation limits specified under the Health Act, 1970.  Under the Bill now before the House, liability for the payment of health contributions will extend to all individuals over 16 years of age who have an income.  Again, there will be some exceptions from this to which I will refer later.  This decision that health contributions should be paid by all income-earners is a necessary corollary of the Government decision to extend entitlement to certain health services&mdash;in particular hospital services&mdash;to the entire population.  Clearly, if there is a major extension of services to cover all, then such entitlement must carry a liability to pay health contributions. I will shortly be bringing before the House a draft of regulations to allow for this extension of eligibility for services.</P>
    <P>Broadly, the new arrangements will offer free hospital services at public ward level to the entire population, with the reservation that, those with incomes above the &ldquo;ceiling&rdquo; for paying health contributions, which I will refer to later, will pay consultants' fees.  Similar arrangements <Col N="475" /> will be made for out-patient services and the drug refund scheme will also be extended to cover all who have not got medical cards.  In designing this change, I am aiming to bring much greater simplicity and equity into our definitions of eligibility to the services. Coupled with improvements in the schemes offered by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, the new arrangements will ensure that no one will be denied hospital care through inadequacy of means and that each will be able to make a reasonable choice between public and private care.</P>
    <P>The exemptions from liability to pay health contributions to which I have referred are set out in section 11 of the Bill.  The specific exemptions for pensioners and others provided for in section 11 (2) are identical with those listed in section 5 (6) of the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1978.  Persons with full eligibility for health services will also be exempted from liability to pay health contributions, but the existing liability of the employers of such persons for the payment of health contributions in respect of them will be continued.  This employers' liability will also extend to persons with agricultural employees and female domestics in private employment. In effect, this means that in accordance with the present practice the employer will pay the appropriate health contribution in the first instance but he will not deduct the amount paid when the employee provides evidence that he is entitled to a current medical card.  An exemption to the general rule is provided for in section 11 (1) (a) under which a health contribution will not be payable by the employer of a medical card holder who is also in receipt of a widow's pension or other like payment as listed in section 11 (2) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In common with other developed and developing countries we have been experiencing very considerable increases in the cost of providing health services.  I have stressed on many occassions that, taking the longer view, a considerable impact can be made on the level of demand for services if people can be persuaded to adopt a healthier life style.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> Continuing attention will be devoted to the fields of health education and prevention, but it will take time before we will experience concrete results in the containment of the growth of health expenditure.</P>
    <P>The question of health care costs was discussed at length at a meeting of Ministers of the EEC countries last November.  It was clear that none of the countries represented at the meeting has found a simple formula for cost containment and that further cost increases cannot easily be avoided.  Common factors emerged to which a major proportion of the overall cost increases can be attributed, such as the pay and price inflation which has taken place in recent years and improved conditions of service for health staffs.  Health services are labour intensive and are extremely sensitive to developments in pay levels.  Advances in medical technology involving increased sophistication of services and staffing have also had a significant influence on overall cost.  Public demands are being constantly made for extensions in the cover, scale and standards of services and the take-up rate for services is increasing all the time.  The inevitable result of all the pressures which I have mentioned is additional cost.  There has also been a considerable increase in the welfare dimension of the health services such as in the payment of allowances to certain disadvantaged groups of the population and in the extension of child care and community care services.</P>
    <P>In the context of the growing expenditure on health services which has resulted from Government policies there has been a growth in the rates of the present health contributions.  When introduced in 1971 the flat-rate was £7 a year, or 15 pence per week, and it is now £24 per year or 50 pence per week.  The amount which these contributions subscribe by way of appropriations-in-aid to the Health Vote is by no means insignificant as far as the Exchequer is concerned but it meets less than 5 per cent of the total cost of the services.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer contribution in 1979 towards the cost of non-capital services, as provided for in the Book of Estimates, is about £419 millions which is about <Col N="477" /> £79 millions more than was provided for in the Estimates for 1978.  This represents about 93 per cent of the total estimated net cost of services in 1979.  The estimated income from health contributions in 1979, including the additional yield from income-related contributions commencing in April, is £26.6 millions or about £10 millions in all more than in 1978.  The estimated total yield from health contributions in 1979 represents about 6 per cent of the estimated total net cost of the services in 1979.  This year, despite the competing claims of other public services, about one-fifth of current expenditure goes to the health services.  This compares with about one-tenth in 1971.  It is not unreasonable in all the circumstances that the amount to be found by way of health contributions should be increased, especially since most people will agree that not only should the level of services be maintained but that, in addition, there should be provision for development.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the rate of contributions will be 1 per cent of income and that the &ldquo;ceiling&rdquo; for the calculation of contributions will be £5,000, which is of course the same as for the new scheme of pay-related social welfare contributions.  As for social welfare this ceiling is to be confirmed or varied before the scheme commences.  These matters are dealt with in sections 5 to 9 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The present flat-rate contribution, as I have said, is £24 a year.  It would probably have been necessary, as has been customary, to increase the flat-rate of contribution in April 1979 to offset cost increases in the health services due to the impact of inflation and the extra costs arising from the commissioning of new units of accommodation and other developments in hospital services.  If the increase in the flat-rate contribution were to be of the same order as last year then the new annual level from April 1979 would be £32.  Thus, under the income-related scheme as proposed, persons whose income would be less than £3,200 per annum will pay less in contributions in 1979 under the Bill now before the House than they would have if the existing flat-rate had been increased <Col N="478" /> to £32.  Persons over that level will of course pay more.</P>
    <P>Section 9 also provides for the variation of the contribution rate and the ceiling from time to time after the scheme comes into operation.  It is intended that the ceiling will be varied from time to time in line with the income ceiling for social insurance contributions purposes, taking into account the latest information available regarding the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries.  Any change would have effect from the beginning of an income tax year subsequent to the year in which a variation is made by way of regulations approved by the House.  It is very desirable that the ceiling should be the same for both health contributions and social insurance and redundancy contributions.  It could involve serious collection problems and might result in some disruption of the administration of the social insurance system if it were to be otherwise.</P>
    <P>The collection system for health contributions is being designed to mesh in fully with the system for the collection of social insurance contributions and the PAYE system.  This will facilitate the proper functioning of the collection machinery.  This involves the classifying of the population into three specific groupings for collection purposes, namely:</P>
    <P>&mdash;individuals who are liable for income tax under the PAYE system and who are insured under the Social Welfare Acts;</P>
    <P>&mdash;individuals liable for income tax under the PAYE system who are not insured under the Social Welfare Acts;</P>
    <P>&mdash;individuals with income which does not fall within the categories mentioned such as farmers, the self-employed, persons with investment income and so on.</P>
    <P>When I was dealing with the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1978, I explained that in the case of employees the new pay-related social insurance contributions would be collected through the PAYE system for tax collection.  This <Col N="479" /> meant that the arrangements for the collection of these contributions would need to conform as closely as possible with the PAYE system and not conflict with the tax collection function.  It is necessary that the collection arrangements in the case of health contributions payable by employees, which are at present collected through the social insurance stamp, should follow the lines of the arrangements made in relation to the social insurance contributions.  Some of the advantages that flow from the close linking-up of the collection arrangements for the different contributions are that the collection of health contributions in association with social insurance contributions does not impose any additional work of consequence on employers and it simplifies administrative procedures that would otherwise flow from having to implement two different collection arrangements. There certainly would be no justification for establishing two separate systems for the collection of social insurance and health contributions based on a similar income-related base.</P>
    <P>Similar considerations apply in relation to the application of the new health contribution arrangements to persons who are not insured under the Social Welfare Acts but who have income which is liable for income tax under the PAYE system.  These are mainly occupational pensioners and proprietory directors who are in receipt of fees. These persons pay their income tax through the PAYE system and will have their health contributions collected in this way.  The Revenue Commissioners will also collect health contributions from the self-employed and certain farmers who derive part of their income from professions or trades.  The collection of income-related health contributions renders it necessary to have as comprehensive information as is possible in relation to such income.  The income tax machinery offers the only practical method by which the proposed income-related health contributions could be collected and the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>The regulations to be made under the <Col N="480" /> Bill will provide that the obligation to collect health contributions from farmers will remain with health boards, except in the case of farmers with other trades or professions.  In the latter cases the Revenue Commissioners will collect the health contributions in conjunction with the collection of income tax.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1971 provides that in the case of farmers generally, the contributions would be related to the rateable valuation of the farms, from which their income is derived.  The most readily available, practical solution for the purposes of assessing the liability of the farmers for health contributions is to have a notional assessment of income using a suitable multiplier for each £1 of rateable valuation.  I should mention, however, that farmers will also be required to declare other sources of income, such as from investments, or from conacre, or from other employment and so on.  It is on the basis of total income from all sources that their liability for the payment of health contributions will be assessed, subject of course to the upper contribution limit of £50 in relation to any particular contribution year.</P>
    <P>I have explained to the House the general scope and intent of the Bill and the general arrangements which will be made for the collection of health contributions, but, of course, if Deputies wish for further information on points which I may not have mentioned or which are not covered in the explanatory memorandum, I will be glad to deal with these in my reply.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years it has been the policy of this party to press for a comprehensive hospital insurance scheme based on a nationwide concept of providing hospital cover through an insurance scheme.  This Bill goes a fair distance along the road towards achieving that objective and, in so far as it does that, I welcome it but a few things need to be made clear about it.  The Bill does not provide free hospitalisation for all, nor does it provide a comprehensive health service.  Amongst the many attributes of one type or another that the <Col N="481" /> Minister possesses is an adroit skill in being able to persuade the media to portray the image which he wishes portrayed.  Sometimes that is a little rosier than the actuality of the situation. During the summer the main details of the Bill were announced by the Minister at a press conference and, subsequently, were outlined to the general public.  One newspaper used a headline, &ldquo;Hospitals Free To All&rdquo; while another stated, &ldquo;Free Hospitalisation For All; Part Of New Welfare Scheme&rdquo;.  This is not a free hospitalisation scheme and I do not think it should be.  It is an extension of the insurance scheme to provide hospital cover for a greater section of the population, something which we have been looking for over the years.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he envisaged that the scheme would be self-financing.  I do not object to that.  The whole concept of any insurance scheme should be to have it self-financing.  However, I must query whether this scheme will be self-financing or whether it will result in a surplus or deficit in its operation.  I understand that the amount obtained through the limited insurance scheme which is in operation at present was in the region of £16 million and the Minister envisages a total collection from insured persons in 1979 of £26 million. That is a large scaling down on the figure he announced last summer when he suggested then that there would be a take of £30 million as a result of the introduction of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be a full year this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister checks he will see that he was reported as suggesting that during 1979 there would be a take of £30 million.  The situation still is, and it is important that this should be pointed out, that as a result of the introduction of this scheme, certain categories will be paying more than they do at present in return for the same services; certain categories will be paying more in return for less cover than they have at present; certain categories will be brought within cover who do not have it at the moment and a very small <Col N="482" /> number will pay less in return for the same services they enjoy at present.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking the population can be divided into three categories.  For those in receipt of medical cards, under 40 per cent of the population, there will be no change.  At present insured people pay 50p a week, or £26 a year, and in return they receive hospitalisation free at point of user.  That situation will be changed.  All insured people earning less than £5,000 a year will pay 1 per cent of their income.  It is very simple to do that sum.  If £26 is translated into 1 per cent it means that all people at present insured and earning more than £2,600 a year will be paying more for the same services they enjoy at the moment.  That relates to all manual and non-manual workers earning between £2,600 and £5,000 a year.  It also relates to farmers in the band of between approximately £30 and £60 valuation.  At present they pay £24 a year and under the new scheme they will be paying more than they do at present, depending on the size of their valuation, without any improvement in the level of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who will benefit, and it is high time they benefited, are the non-manual workers who earn between £3,000 and £5,000.  They were not included in the insurance scheme and resented the fact that their manual equivalent was.  This party have repeatedly asked that non-manual income earners should be included in the hospitalisation insurance scheme and I am glad to see the scheme is to be extended to cover them.  In relation to those earning over £5,000 a year, the non-manual worker will be covered&mdash;in almost every case this will be cover for the first time&mdash;to a limited degree. Farmers with a valuation of over £60 will also be covered for the first time to a limited degree.  Manual workers earning in excess of £5,000 a year have a right to feel aggrieved by the introduction of this scheme because they will experience a real drop in the level of services which they enjoy at present.  They will be asked to pay almost twice as much as they do at present for the privilege of less cover. A manual worker earning over £5,000 is at present covered for all hospital services. <Col N="483" /> In return he pays 50p a week or £26 a year.  From the time this scheme is introduced he will pay 1 per cent of his income up to £5,000, in other words, £50 a year, almost twice what he is paying now, but he will find he is no longer eligible for consultants' fees and maternity services, for which at present he has insurance cover.  Perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong about that because some of the less palatable aspects of this scheme did not receive much attention from him at his press conference.</P>
    <P>From next April the skilled manual worker earning in excess of £5,000 will no longer be covered for maternity services or consultants' fees.  He will have to insure with the VHI for that aspect of hospitalisation.  In return for the privilege of losing that cover he will be asked to pay twice as much as he does at present. That is a very regressive aspect of the scheme and we as a party are very disappointed with it.  We are particularly disappointed that the Minister should have decided to pitch the upper ceiling at that level and to discriminate against the highly paid manual worker.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about encouraging industry, particularly the highly skilled technological industries which the IDA appear to be seeking to bring into the country, there is a need to have highly skilled trained workers to staff that industry and attract foreign investors.  We have to be able to persuade them that we have a highly skilled manual workforce. Yet the Minister is suggesting that these people will have to pay double the amount they pay at present under a hospital insurance scheme which will give them less service and less benefit than they have at present.  It is hardly to be expected that these people will welcome such a change.</P>
    <P>There is also to some extent a rather illusory notion about the amount of improvement in real terms that will accrue to people who are not within the State's insurance scheme at present but who will be brought in as a result of this Bill.  Let us take the example of a husband, wife and two children.  At the moment all the benefits which the Minister proposes to <Col N="484" /> make available to them under the State insurance scheme would be covered by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board for a gross premium of £117.  Assuming the standard rate of income tax&mdash;before tomorrow&mdash;is 35 per cent, by claiming the VHI contribution as a tax deductible allowance, they would be £59 in benefit, and the net cost for that family is £76. Under the Minister's proposed scheme they will have to pay £50 into the State fund.  They will also have to take out VHI to cover maternity benefit, if the Voluntary Health Insurance Board will provide that cover&mdash;which is less than clear&mdash;and they will also have to cover themselves with the VHI for consultants' fees and possibly other services.</P>
    <P>What has not been clear from the Bill so far&mdash;perhaps the Minister will clarify this, although I think I know the answer&mdash;is whether the £50 contribution which everybody will be obliged to pay from now on will be a charge allowable against person's earnings in the same way as the VHI contribution is a charge allowable against tax.  I do not see any great benefit to certain people in the middle income category with an average size family if they have to pay £50, which they cannot charge against tax, and also pay a contribution to the VHI for the areas of comprehensive hospital coverage which the Minister is excluding from them.  They will be no better off than they are by paying their gross VHI premium at present less the tax allowance which they are given at the standard rate.</P>
    <P>Let us look at another example.  A husband and wife with no children at the moment are covered by the VHI for a sum of £59.20 after tax allowance.  The Minister is suggesting that they pay £50 and pay a cover, which has yet to be assessed by the VHI, which I am sure will be more than £9.20.  That family under the Bill will find themselves paying substantially more through having been brought into the State net.  A single person at that level of earning will find that it costs him a sizeable amount extra to insure himself for comprehensive cover through the combination of State insurance and VHI.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the real <Col N="485" /> losers, the manual workers who are earning in excess of £5,000, who will get less service and pay twice the amount. There are varying figures for the number involved in this.  I tried to get the exact figure from the Minister's Department but nobody was either able or willing to give it to me.  There appears to be, according to some assessments which I have seen, about 25,000 manual workers and their dependants earning in excess of £5,000 a year who will now find themselves worse off as a result of the introduction of this service.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware of the serious reservations expressed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in regard to the limited nature of this hospital insurance cover.  They feel that the ceiling of £5,000 is at far too low a level.  They have objected strenuously to the removal of certain areas of benefit from the manual worker earning in excess of £5,000 a year.  Those limited benefits will be the only benefits available to the non-manual worker earning over £5,000 a year or the farmer with a valuation of over £60 who for the first time will be brought into the State insurance scheme.  Those people will also have to pay £50 a year but they will find they will have to pay afterwards for consultants' fees and maternity costs.  Those people will have to go to some private agency to obtain that cover.</P>
    <P>The Minister may tell us that he has made certain arrangements with the VHI to bring those manual workers into the VHI without the usual waiting period or the usual exemptions in regard to certain types of illness.  An attractive scheme could then be offered to manual workers earning over £5,000.  It is very important that the Minister should tell us if the non-manual worker and the farmer with over £60 valuation will be able to avail of this new offer the VHI will make for the first time to the higher paid manual worker.  Can the non-manual worker and the farmer with over £60 valuation go to the VHI and say: &ldquo;I have to pay the State £50 a year but I am not covered for maternity services or consultancy fees; may I obtain from you the same type of insurance cover as you are offering to the manual worker?&rdquo;  As <Col N="486" /> far as I know, such an offer is not being made by the VHI.  The Minister should make that crystal clear when he is replying.</P>
    <P>We are talking about approximately 15 per cent of the population when we talk about the people earning over £5,000 a year.  It appears that those people will still have to go to the VHI or some other insuring agency in order to get through the State and other sources a comprehensive hospital insurance cover.  The State should provide a fully comprehensive hospital insurance cover for all sections of the community.  People at all wage bands and all income levels should be able to avail of such a cover to the same degree, no matter what they are earning.  People earning over £5,000 a year will not be able to avail of this cover under the Bill to the same degree as people earning less than that figure.</P>
    <P>One good aspect of this scheme is that it removes the dreadful anomaly which exists between manual and non-manual workers.  However, it is replaced with another equally objectionable anomaly. Up to this a manual worker earning over £3,000 a year was not covered and a manual worker earning less than £3,000 was covered.  Under this scheme we find that all workers earning over £5,000 a year are not insured for consultancy fees whereas all workers earning under £5,000 a year are insured.</P>
    <P>We will now find that a husband and wife earning £4,999 will be covered for consultancy fees and maternity costs by paying £50 to the State.  A family earning £5,001, a husband, wife and four children, will find that in return for paying the State £50 they have not got cover for consultancy fees or maternity services. The likelihood of maternity services may lessen but consultancy fees are more likely to occur in a larger family than in a smaller one.  The larger family will now find under this Bill that they will have far less hospitalisation insurance cover than the smaller family who are earning marginally below them. This is not what one would expect in this Bill from a Minister anxious to remove the anomalies in the level of benefit and the level of cover.  I should like to hear from the Minister the estimated number <Col N="487" /> of people in the category earning over £5,000 whom he feels will receive only this limited cover and also the number of manual workers who will suffer a reduction in the level of State cover.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters which the Minister did not deal with in his opening statement which would have helped us in our understanding of the new scheme.  I hope he will deal with them when he is replying.  This scheme is in essence the same scheme as our Government intended to introduce in the last three or four years but did not succeed in doing because we failed to receive the co-operation of the medical profession.  There has been a suggestion in certain quarters that the Minister persuaded the medical profession to accept the introduction of this scheme in return for the negotiation of a common contract. Perhaps the Minister would clarify what the position is in relation to the common contract at present.</P>
    <P>There were other far less palatable suggestions which I find difficult to believe and I find it difficult to accept that the medical profession would operate in such ways.  There were suggestions that if this scheme were introduced all the beds in State hospitals would be made available to consultants operating in those hospitals for their private patients and that there could be an element of queue jumping with consultants moving their private patients into beds over which they would have control at the expense of the medical card holder or at the expense of other persons who were intending to go into hospital under the full cover aspect of this scheme.  I find it very disturbing and I am not prepared to believe that the medical profession would operate in that way.  I would like the Minister to deal at length with any suggestions that have been made in this regard and to say whether he believes that there is any validity in those suggestions or any likelihood that, under the terms of the scheme he intends to introduce, the medical profession would be able, if they wanted to stoop so low, to discriminate as between patients not on the basis of the degree of their illness but on the basis <Col N="488" /> of the extent of their fees, to discriminate in favour of one set of patients or another.  I would like the Minister to indicate that that sort of thing could not happen, not that I accept that it would happen.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of this scheme which intrigues me.  I would like the Minister again to deal with it by way of reply.  That is the concept of extending the limited refund of the cost of drugs to all sections of the population.  It merits separate handling, separate treatment and separate costing because it is a very cumbersome scheme.  It is a scheme which those who benefit from it at present find annoying; they must collect receipts and send them in to the health board and receive the payments, less the deduction of the first £6.50 per month, back at some later stage.  There are certain cases where health boards are sent receipts totalling £8 for a month and they must deduct the first £6.50 and send the person back £1.50.  I have no doubt that the manual handling and processing of that claim, the drawing of the cheque by way of refund and the issuing of it to the person concerned is costing at least as much as the amount of the refund.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister whether there have been any exercises done by any of the health boards in relation to the cost of this operation.  Some of us are inclined to suggest that there should be more exercises done by the health boards in relation to the cost of many of their operations. I am given to understand that some of the health boards have the greatest reservations about the amount of money it is costing them to process the existing claims under the existing limited scheme and it seems quite likely that the Minister, the health boards, the State, eventually this House and the tax-payer are going to discover that when this scheme is extended to the population at large the actual cost of its processing will be a dreadful financial millstone around the taxpayer's necks and around the neck of everybody involved in it at each step along the way.  I also wonder how we can reconcile the concept, from the health point of view of a Minister who is proclaiming the merits of preventive medicine and health education, and <Col N="489" /> proposing to extend this scheme to the entire population.  If one reads the paragraphs in relation to health in the White Paper, in the absence of a concrete plan or concrete proposals, one might be forgiven for saying, especially when one takes into account the Minister's intentions in other fields, that he has now decided to ban sickness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister thought of it.  If the Minister thought he would get a headline in tomorrow's paper he would announce it this evening. There is no doubt about that.  Here we have a Minister putting the entire emphasis on education and preventive medicine and at the same time he is now suggesting that he is going to extend to the entire population the concept that they can recover the cost of any drugs they get, which cost them more than a certain figure per month, from the State. I am not at all sure that that is not going to encourage the idea of a pill-popping society.  I am not at all sure that it is not going to bring about a situation where people will be more inclined to go to their GP and seek a renewable prescription. The Minister will appreciate that there are certain people who believe that drugs are the panacea for all ills.  They are not, of course.  But I am not at all sure that many an overworked GP will not now be more inclined to issue prescriptions of a continuing nature to patients who have been continually pestering him for drugs of one sort or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another very dangerous aspect to this scheme which I wonder if the Minister has investigated.  I hope that he has.  It is well known that the cost of drugs on average from the drug firms here is anything from 15 to 20 per cent higher than the same drugs in Britain.  It is well known that one can go to two different doctors and they can prescribe equally effective drugs for an illness and there can be a difference of ten times the cost between one drug and another.  To some extent up to the present the GP has been influenced by his own personal assessment of the financial circumstances of his patients and he may not have been <Col N="490" /> so inclined to prescribe the drug that costs £25 if by rooting around in some of the medical publications that come out regularly and advise doctors in relation to the up-to-date positions of drugs &mdash;I am sure we could hear a lot more about it if Deputy O'Connell wished to enlighten the House&mdash;he could find a cheaper drug that could do the same job. Now under this extended drug scheme there is no longer an incentive to the GP to take the trouble to look for the cheaper and equally efficient drug to prescribe for his patient because he knows that his patient can go in with the chit and get the dearer drug and get a refund from the State eventually.</P>
    <P>From that point of view I do not believe that the eventual cost of that scheme having regard to the processing of refunds and so on has been fully taken into account.  There has been a restriction in the personal attitude of the GP and he has taken his patients' financial circumstances into account.  He is not going to be under that restriction from now on.  There has been a restriction from the point of view of applicants for treatment; they may often have felt that to go to a doctor and have costly drugs prescribed was more than they could afford at a particular time.  That type of restriction will not apply now.  I am not sure that a combination of that and what I believe will be mammoth handling costs at health board level may not turn out to be the financial millstone that may upset the entire costings of this insurance scheme.  I hope I am wrong because the concept of an insurance scheme is one that is very dear to the heart of this party and the fact that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board is there at all is due to the attitude this party took so many years ago in relation to hospital insurance cover.  For that reason, having looked at the cost of this scheme, I am less than impressed first of all at the cost benefit to the State and to the individual, and second, by the possibility that the scheme will be self-financing. I am making these remarks not in a political way but sincerely because it is an aspect of the scheme that frightens me.</P>
    <P>In so far as the scheme extends <Col N="491" /> hospitalisation insurance cover to the non-manual worker in the £3,000 to £5,000 band, we welcome it sincerely, and in so far as it extends cover of a limited nature to the non-manual worker earning more than £5,000 a year and the farmer with more than £60 valuation, we also welcome it in a limited way. However, in so far as it provides far less cover in return for payment of twice the amount, it is a scheme that cannot be welcomed by the manual worker who earns in excess of £5,000.  Because of the anomaly between the levels of benefit of all of those in the above £5,000 category as opposed to those who earn less than £5,000 a year, this cannot be welcomed as a comprehensive scheme.</P>
    <P>I had hoped for a comprehensive insurance scheme covering hospitalisation. This is certainly not a free scheme.  I do not think anything is free in this life except advice&mdash;and I have often found that to be a very costly thing, especially to administer.  If I were to give free advice to the Minister it would be that he should examine the ceiling as he has pitched it in the Bill, and if he wants to keep that ceiling on a par with the social welfare and redundancy schemes, he should do it if he thinks that is the best way, but he should give the same level of insurance cover to those in the upper bracket as he is giving to those in the lower bracket.  Otherwise he will be creating new anomalies in exchange for the old.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's dilemma when faced with the whole question of hospitalisation and the anomalies involved in the question of who is entitled to what.  It must have exercised the minds of the best experts in the Department and elsewhere to try to devise a measure that would bring about a more equitable and just system to help those who have been suffering grave hardships because of the demarcation in regard to who was and was not entitled to free hospitalisation.  The former Minister, Deputy Corish, when he first mooted free hospitalisation, was confronted with correcting the anomalies. He should have been concerned with <Col N="492" /> primary health care and given greater priority to certain matters.</P>
      <P>Our health services are costing 6.3 per cent of our GNP, £419 million, and the EEC Ministers have decided that it should not go above 6 per cent.  I totally agree with that.  If we were to pour £100 million into the health services we would not make a healthier society.  First of all, we would be lucky to get another £100 million from the Minister for Finance, and I am afraid the consequences would not be a healthier society tomorrow.  Far from it.  It would be like putting paper on a massive fire: it would be consumed as rapidly as it was put on.</P>
      <P>That is what has been happening.  In 1971-72 we were spending £65 million a year, and it has jumped now to £419 million, but our society is not any healthier.  Therefore we have got to ask ourselves where we should be spending the money.  I am afraid the money is being spent wrongly, that it is not going directly to the consumers of our health services.  First of all, it is being gobbled up by a massive bureaucracy within the health services and, two, it is going on pet schemes and ideas of people who have not the welfare of the patient at heart.  This is becoming more evident every day.</P>
      <P>I had hoped that the Minister would have given a place of priority to the family doctor service.  The cost of the family doctor service at the moment can be considerable in the case of husband and wife and a young family, because illness can be recurrent and distressing. The cost to such a family can be enormous and those outside, or barely outside, the range of eligibility for medical cards suffer greatly.  Therefore I had hoped the Minister would have contributed 60 or 70 per cent of the cost of the family doctor service.  In such a situation he would have saved in terms of hospitalisation costs, because many thousands of people who now have great anxiety in regard to the cost of family doctor care opt for hospitalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are talking about the cost of hospitalisation we must realise that a bed in a teaching hospital in Dublin is costing the State something like £250 a week.  That is a lot of money for a bed in <Col N="493" /> a teaching hospital, and what we are doing is encouraging more hospitalisation because of the severe restrictions we are putting on the family doctor service.  We have got our priorities lopsided.  If I were looking at the entire range of health services I would be putting money into health education and preventive medicine and, second, I would be putting money into the family doctor service, making it available to a greater number of people, those with large families who have the greatest demand for doctors. Thus I would be relieving the pressure on the labour intensive area of hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Minister had a dilemma.  It certainly had not been resolved before he came into office.  I do not agree for a moment that the doctors thwarted the previous Minister for Health.  I believe the approach was wrong&mdash;that is a personal opinion.  I believe the previous Minister could have won the doctors around in the matter of free hospitalisation if consultation had taken place, as is normal trade union practice, if he had explained to them the need for a system of free hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>What the present Minister is offering now will not solve the problem.  He is extending the hospitalisation programme and he is posing a serious ethical problem for doctors.  If you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I were to require hospital beds at the moment, and I had less than £5,000 a year and you had more than £5,000, there is a natural temptation for consultant surgeons or physicians to give priority in the matter of hospital beds to patients with incomes in excess of £5,000 because the consultants would have a greater assurance of being paid hospital fees whereas they will not be paid consultants' fees by a person with less than £5,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister is posing a serious ethical problem for doctors.  It may mean that the person earning less than £5,000 per year will be put at risk. Although the indications for admission may be similar in respect of two people, there is a greater risk that if one person is earning less than £5,000 his need for a hospital bed will be left in abeyance.  I <Col N="494" /> am not saying that any doctor will fail to honour the Hippocratic Oath but doctors all over the world are merely human beings.  There have been instances in America under the Medicare system where it has been shown that the disadvantaged sections of the community can be at risk in terms of health.  There is no point in saying that the Hippocratic Oath determines totally a doctor's behaviour, because that is not so in every case.  Therefore, it is grossly unfair to doctors to put the onus on them in regard to treatment.  A doctor with an income problem, for example, might be tempted to act in a way that would put a lower-paid person at risk.</P>
    <P>That is why I say we should not put temptation in the way of doctors in this regard.  To illustrate what I have in mind I shall take a simple case of a tradesman who receives two calls to houses where there are burst pipes.  If that tradesman knows that in one case there will be no question of his being paid for his work but that in the other case he is assured of payment, it does not require too much imagination to guess which of the two calls he will answer.  There is no point in talking about dedication to duty.  We are living in a very mercenary age, as is obvious from the various industrial disputes, demands for extra remuneration and so on, although people are only seeking extra remuneration in order to keep up their standard of living.</P>
    <P>There is a great danger, then, in providing that people earning less than £5,000 will not pay consultants while those earning more than that will pay.  I might understand that provision if there were no other way of dealing with the situation but there is an alternative.  The Minister is creating an enormous bureaucracy in order to administer this system.  The late Mr. Childers said here in October 1971 that he, as Minister for Health, was abolishing the 10/- a day payment for hospital beds because the administrative cost far exceeded the return.  That was an admission that the administrative costs were too high for the operation of the scheme.  Consequently, the Minister introduced the Health Contributions Act.  What we are doing here is establishing another massive <Col N="495" /> bureaucracy and bureaucracy is the curse of our health service.  It is gobbling up the massive amount that we provide for the purpose of the health services. There are three bureaucrats for each person administering health care.  We might ask how much of the £419 million actually goes to the beneficiaries of the health service.  The answer is very little.</P>
    <P>I realised the problems that the Minister faced and I had some sympathy for him in that regard.  It was for him to devise a solution.  What he introduced was a good deal better than what went before, because in the past people were faced with massive hospital bills if they were non-manual workers and their incomes were more than £3,000.  I had a constant stream of people approaching me with demands they had received for very large amounts and with solicitors' letters from hospitals.  However, if instead of what he has done, the Minister had said that what he was proposing was an interim measure, I would have supported him fully.  If he had said that he was setting a target for free hospitalisation, maintenance and treatment, I would have voted for him even at the risk of expulsion because I was aware of the problems he faced but, instead, the Minister is creating further problems by way of this measure.</P>
    <P>I am condemned by some people in my party for agreeing with the Minister on the question of health education.  We must curtail the amount we spend on health services and endeavour to get the best value possible for the amounts we spend.  I am not saying that health education is the panacea for all medical ills, but a good health education programme is going a long way to help in this direction.  In the first place it educates people to help themselves in cases of temporary and trivial illnesses which should not require the attention of a doctor.  Many illnesses are self-imposed. I would go so far as to say that more than 50 per cent of illness is self-engendered. I am thinking of the areas of psychiatric illnesses, respiratory ailments, heart diseases and so on.  Our way of life contributes to many of these illnesses, but by way of a process of <Col N="496" /> health education we should succeed in persuading people to change their lifestyle, to live a more healthy life.  Last year I suggested an expenditure of £1 million in the area of health education and I note that there is an increase in this regard.  I should not be surprised to learn that the Minister had been seeking £2 million for this purpose.  If I had responsibility for apportioning finance I would not consider a sum of £5 million to be excessive for this purpose.  That would be a drop in the ocean in terms of an expenditure of £419 million but it would be very beneficial in terms of results.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the labour-intensive service.  I agree with him on that but there are other areas that need to be considered in this whole question of hospitalisation.  There should be set up a proper cost-benefit analysis team on the utilisation of extra equipment.  There is the expensive diagnostic equipment, for instance, which closes at 5 o'clock and which becomes obsolete long before its utilisation period has expired. Laboratory services operate from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m.  Why do they not operate 24 hours a day and reduce the patient's stay in hospital?  I saw this operating in America where I worked: the best services were provided for people.</P>
    <P>Before we invest money in sophisticated equipment we must have a cost-benefit analysis carried out.  For example, we have coronary by-pass surgery which is a major operation.  The chances are it can extend the life of a person who is suffering from heart disease, but the cost is phenomenal and the benefits are few and equivocal.  It has not been established that the results justify the operation as such.  If I found that I was suffering from angina and heart disease warranting this operation I would without hesitation refuse to have it. Furthermore, I would advise my patients to refuse such an operation because the risks are enormous, the benefits few and the cost phenomenal.  By ploughing a fraction of the cost of this operation into health education and preventive medicine and by encouraging people to eat the right diet and to take exercise thousands of pounds could be saved. <Col N="497" /> This is but one area where we are spending money and wondering whether we are getting results.  If the money that is poured into sophisticated, diagnostic and other equipment was spent in starved areas of our health services like St. Brendan's Hospital, where people are condemned to live in appalling conditions, and other mental hospitals, then I would understand the extra expenditure. The money is there but it is like money being thrown on a furnace: it is burning up fast.</P>
    <P>We have some eccentric individuals with eccentric ideas who see vital areas of our health service starved of resources but which do not fit in with their plan of action.  They stand indicted before society for ignoring these areas that are crying out for help.  These people should be brought before us to explain their eccentric actions because no matter what way we look into the future to see what should be done in these services we cannot ignore people in need or people who are not treated as human beings.  People should not be treated as subnormal for the sake of visionary ideas.  That is wrong.  No matter how much we want to plan our services we cannot ignore people in need.  That is what is happening in St. Brendan's and in other mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>It was said that I was exaggerating about conditions in St. Brendan's Hospital.  I was not exaggerating when I saw a wild bird flying around the kitchen with its droppings on the food or a patient's bed being pushed everytime the door was opened.  People were sitting there as if in a state of catalepsy. Anyone who condones or approves of that stands indicted before society.  To say that money should be diverted into better community services is wrong.  If these conditions are taken care of then I will support the other services, but we cannot ignore those people.  They are human beings and must be treated as such.  Cattle are treated better than they are.  This is not just the position in one hospital; it is the position in all our mental hospitals.  If I were the Minister I would make a tour of our mental hospitals, not necessarily a preannounced tour, because establishments <Col N="498" /> have a habit of making things nice.  I remember going to St. Ita's Hospital and being brought into the parlour for tea.  I strayed off the beaten track and that is when I first became aware of the terrible injustices being meted out to our fellow human beings.  I would ask the Minister to withdraw some of the money that is spent on sophisticated equipment and appliances that have equivocal benefits and divert it into essential needs.</P>
    <P>At the risk of offending my friends and my party I will support the Minister in his health education programme, because I know he is right.  However, I would ask the Minister to consider the mental hospitals and the people who are getting a raw deal with no voice speaking on their behalf.  If the Minister does that he will go down in history as one great Minister.  They need the Minister's help and support and they are crying out for it at the moment.</P>
    <P>The family doctor service must be looked at because borderline cases give rise to great hardship.  The health boards, while uniform in their set of guidelines, are not uniform in their approach to hardship cases.  The Minister has said to me on many occasions that the chief executive officer is prepared to consider hardship cases on their merits. In the health board area in which I am involved that is not happening.  A person who may be as little as 90p over the margin is being deprived of a medical card.  Some health boards are operating with a great degree of humanity, but in the Eastern Health Board the approach is too rigid.  If a medical card were given to these borderline cases there would be an enormous saving on hospitalisation costs.  There was a case two weeks ago where a person could not afford to pay the doctor.  The doctor was coming every day and it was costing £5 a day. The person concerned said they would go into hospital because they would not have to pay there.  Hospitalisation is free, but it is costing the State £250 a week. The Department could save money if the Minister looked seriously at these cases. I would ask the Minister to ask the Eastern Health Board to operate the hardship clause properly.  Other health boards have great sympathy for such cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> When manual workers whose incomes are in excess of £5,000 a year joined the social welfare scheme they were given certain rights to free hospitalisation, including maintenance and treatment.  That was embodied in the Health Acts.  The decision to withdraw from 25,000 to 30,000 people their right to full free hospitalisation is a very serious legal matter.  If I were a skilled manual worker earning in excess of £5,000 a year I would take the Minister to court for depriving me of my right. That will happen. When you gain rights under the social welfare scheme they cannot be taken away.  That is what you are paying your insurance for, and your right cannot be taken away from you.  I would ask the Minister to check the legality of what he is doing.  He is taking away rights which he is not entitled to take away.</P>

      <P>Rights.  When a manual worker joined a social welfare scheme, no matter what his income, he was entitled to full free hospitalisation.  I am convinced 25,000 skilled manual workers with incomes in excess of £5,000 a year have a case against the Minister.  I should like to see them challenging the Minister.  They have a duty to do so.  You have to buy rights from people.  The Minister will have to look at that aspect.  If you take a right from an employee you have to buy it from him or compensate him for it in some way. Under the Health Contributions Bill he is not being compensated for it in any way.  If there were compensation for him I would say that was all right.  If the Minister said: &ldquo;We will do it for such and-such a time.  We will phase it out and in return we will give such-and such&rdquo;,  I would say that could be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The collection arrangements for the health contributions are a source of great annoyance to me.  The PAYE worker, the civil servant and the ordinary worker cannot evade, but the farmers owe the health boards millions of pounds in health contributions which <Col N="500" /> have not been collected from them.  The PAYE worker is being fleeced again.  He has no option.  The contribution is deducted at source.  The last time I questioned this matter the farming community owed over £7 million in one year. It would be interesting to know what the up-to-date position is.  This is a serious matter.  The Minister says he would like a simple collection agency for the health and social welfare contributions.  Has he considered amalgamating the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare?  This would streamline the service.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous overlap between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health. If before he leaves his Department he were to amalgamate those two Departments he would streamline them and produce a much more effective service. This would be of benefit to the community at large and make the Minister's task much simpler.  I know he was in favour of this when he was in Opposition. As the Minister knows, in Britain they operate a Department of Health and Social Services.  Amalgamation of the Departments may pose administrative problems but the Minister should consider it.  He is trying to make them slot in together and, if he were to go that one step further, there would be a great rationalisation of the health and social welfare services and that is what is needed.</P>
    <P>At the moment social welfare pensioners with very small incomes are being sent demands by the Revenue Commissioners for health contributions. They are told they must pay and this causes them great anxiety.  When I approached the Revenue Commissioners at first they said these people had to pay and then they admitted that they had not.  Their income does not bring them into the tax bracket, although there is very little income at the moment which is not brought into the tax bracket.  I would ask the Minister to make a firm statement that social welfare pensioners with £20 a week, or something like that, do not have to pay health contributions. I dealt with quite a number of these cases and, when I queried them, in every <Col N="501" /> case it was decided that they did not have to pay the health contributions. Someone somewhere in Revenue is sending out these demands.  The Minister might have a look at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of them would have medical cards anyway, and therefore should not be paying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, but the demands are being sent out.  This is all new to them.  They have been on pension for years, even since before 1971, and they do not know anything about health contributions.  As I said, £490 million is being ploughed into our health services this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, and it is an enormous sum.  It works out at £3 per week for every man, woman and child in the country.  I have no hesitation in saying that, for that amount of money, we have the worst health service in Europe, the worst health service within the EEC. More galling is the fact that visitors from the EEC can come here and enjoy full free medical services, whereas an usher in the Dáil has to pay.  The managing director of a big company in Britain came over here.  I heard his income was £30,000 a year, or £600 a week.  He could enjoy free hospitalisation, free health services, free family doctor service while he was here.  That is grossly unjust.  Ambassadors can enjoy our health services free under the terms of the EEC regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the health service.  An usher in the Dáil has to pay out of his limited income while a man with £600 a week gets it free.  That is unjust.  An old lady, a non-contributory old age pensioner with a pension of £11.70 a week, had to go to France to visit her daughter.  She could not get a free health service in France. She got a bill for £870.  I brought this case to the Minister's attention.  An ambassador <Col N="502" /> can come here from France and enjoy a full free health service while she had to pay £870 in France.</P>
      <P>The system is wrong.  The right amount of money is being put into the service but it is being gobbled up by the bureauracy.  We have the worst structured health service in Europe.  The injustice becomes all the more apparent when an EEC visitor can have the full benefit of the service at no cost while families are having to pay for hospitalisation and for the services of their doctors.  We should be trying to put our services on a par with the services in other member states.  All member states are spending the same percentage of GNP on their health services.  The money is being put into the health service but the benefits are not being distributed fairly.  There is something wrong.</P>
      <P>When the former Minister for Health Deputy Corish, spoke of 50 per cent of the people in his area having medical cards, he said they were the wrong 50 per cent.  The valuation of a farmer's land is not necessarily the best guide.  A farmer whose land has a valuation of £60 is entitled to a medical card.  A lady from Dundalk wrote to me about a farmer who drove a Mercedes.  He was entitled to a medical card while she, who was struggling to rear a family on £40 per week, could not get one.  We are giving free treatment to the wrong people. We should introduce a more equitable system of eligibility for medical cards. Eligibility for medical cards should not be based on farm valuations because farms in Munster are more productive than farms in the west.  We should ensure that those who are most in need receive the benefits of the health service. I would ask the Minister to look at these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has extended hospitalisation but has produced serious ethical problems for doctors.  A common contract could have been devised to benefit the hospital consultants and to introduce hospitalisation for all.  The Minister's ingenuity in winning the support of the profession is beyond comprehension. I pay tribute to him when I say that he has won over the medical <Col N="503" /> profession with his Family Planning Bill. If he can do that with his Family Planning Bill, he could just as readily win them over to the idea of a full free hospitalisation scheme.  Deputy Boland referred to an insurance scheme but the Minister pointed out that such a scheme would contribute only 6 per cent of the total cost of the health services.  I have no hesitation in saying that the Minister should be able to produce the right formula for a comprehensive hospitalisation scheme.  If he were to say, &ldquo;This is an interim measure.  I will work it for three years and then bring in the other scheme&rdquo;, I would support him against all odds.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at this problem again.  The consultants will have to realise that we cannot have inequities in the hospitalisation scheme.  An ethical problem will be created by the fact that a person earning under £5,000 per year may not get a hospital bed.</P>
    <P>It has been argued by Deputy Boland that the extension of the drug subsidy scheme to the entire population will cause problems.  There was merit in what he said.  If we were to argue against a scheme on that basis we would not introduce anything.  The answer to the problem is to use the services of the Health Education Bureau.  The Health Education Bureau fulfil their role by advising people to lead healthy lives and not to depend on drugs.  We must dispel the myth that there is a pill for every ill.  I would like to see the Minister going to RTE to talk about programmes, not just advertisements.  RTE could play a valuable role in society by producing programmes on all aspects of health. RTE have a duty to co-operate in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing the public should realise is that there is no such thing as a safe drug.  All drugs produce side effects.  Sometimes the side effects produced by drugs exceed the benefits so that every drug must be taken with great caution.  That is the first <Col N="504" /> thing we must get across to the public&mdash;that there are foreign substances going into the body that can create great problems.  All the great drugs that have been discovered over the years have been found after a time to have side effects.  The function of a doctor is to weigh up the advantages of the drug as against the side effects and disadvantages and where he feels the advantages far exceed the disadvantages, then he prescribes it.  But sometimes the patient does not realise the great responsibility he takes in deciding this.  Perhaps the doctor does not explain sufficiently the many disadvantages of the drug, that one must be careful of it, because he does not want to create anxiety in the patient.  It is a problem for every doctor when he prescribes a drug to know that it has great disadvantages&mdash;it may cause stomach bleeding and all sorts of other problems, so many of them.  The public do not know this; they must be informed that the consultation with the doctor should not necessarily end with the prescription.  There is a vicious circle here: the patient thinks he must get a prescription after the consultation and the doctor feels the patient wants a prescription and automatically obliges. Advertisements themselves do not bring home this message as forcibly as we would like.  Perhaps discussion programmes with patients, chemists, doctors and all involved would help.  With a little honesty from doctors and patients possibly many ailments could be managed reasonably without drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a clinic in America operating for insomniacs, a specialised clinic.  They found patients were taking an average of six sleeping tablets a night.  The number went as high as 12 tablets.  They did a little research on the chronic insomniac patients attending the clinic, patients who had been all over the place and had come to the clinic as a last resort.  Having investigated their dietary habits they found that these people were drinking eight, ten, 12 and up to 20 cups of coffee in the evenings.  The coffee with its stimulant property was keeping them awake and they were taking tablets to put them asleep.  When these patients were taken off the coffee there was no need for the sleeping tablets.  That is a <Col N="505" /> simple lesson but it took a specialised clinic to discover it.  Two nights ago I saw a person drinking a large mug of coffee and ten minutes later taking a sleeping tablet, one neutralising the effect of the other.  People do not realise that they are doing this.</P>
    <P>Sometimes advertisements do not get across that message.  People &ldquo;turn off&rdquo; for advertisements even if they are most beneficial.  They do not need a remote control; it is a psychological &ldquo;turn off&rdquo;. Therefore, I should like to see greater emphasis on discussion programmes about this, perhaps a visit to a clinic like that.  A Dublin doctor has decided not to supply tranquilisers and has set up a relaxation clinic.  He and his colleagues are encouraging people to relax.  The benefits can be enormous at no cost to the patient.  This doctor is doing great work for the health service and a great service to the patients.  This is a new and healthy approach.  That is why I praise the Minister's health education programme. This is the right concept.  These programmes will not pay dividends overnight and people who expect miracles from them will be sadly disillusioned and he will not see the benefits of his work. But he is starting it and doing it and even if it is described as a publicity stunt it will get people thinking about exercise.</P>
    <P>Patients complain about obesity or over-weight and look for tablets. Sometimes it is hard to explain to them but this is the kind of education they need, that if they walk a little more they would not be obese: if they eat fruit instead of sweets and so on they will not be too heavy.  It is a life-style pattern they must change by simple things like that rather than seek anti-obesity tablets or appetite suppressants which are doubtful although psychologically, perhaps, they work.  I suppose you could give &ldquo;Smarties&rdquo; or placebos and they would be just as effective because nobody can actually prove that they have mobilised the fat in the body and helped one to become thin or that they suppress the appetite sufficiently.  Here, we see an enormous amount of money used.  If we had such a gross national product that we could afford to spend lavishly on luxury drugs I would not <Col N="506" /> mind but it is unfair to subsidise such drugs when we get people with severe rheumatoid arthritis that is so crippling that they need good drugs and are deprived of them by virtue of this scheme.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider seriously the whole matter of divorcing the medical card from the drugs.  The medical card should be for doctor service. The Minister should consider providing a free doctor service under the medical card and then we should look at drugs separately and have different categories of drugs.  If you took the drugs scheme away from the medical cards, you could give the medical card to up to 60 per cent of the patients and operate the drug scheme separately.  The medical card holder can go to the doctor and get his advice and may not need drugs.  If he does need drugs these should be categorised as (1) life saving drugs, (2) essential drugs, essential to making life tolerable and (3) luxury drugs, drugs which one could manage quite well without.  If you want them you should pay for them.  A medical card patient who opts for luxury drugs should pay for them because they are not essential. That is how I would change the system bearing in mind that there will be overlapping cases but that will not pose enormous problems.  By arranging things this way you could overcome all the hardship clause cases&mdash;make the medical card service available in a free doctor service and have the drugs as a separate thing.  You could extend the range of the free drugs scheme for these special illnesses that need them.</P>
    <P>The purposes of a health service are (1) to help those who are suffering, (2) have research into illnesses, (3) create a healthy society by educating people who are abusing their bodies.  That is my concept of a health service.  People who opt for luxury drugs should pay for them and the public should not have to subsidise these drugs.  Such a scheme could save the State money and we could provide a family doctor service for a greater proportion of the population.  I know the Minister is caught in a kind of pincers with the contract with the family doctors for the GMS but I do not think <Col N="507" /> it is beyond his capabilities to cope with this.  There is a borderline of 40 per cent, that if over 40 per cent are entitled to the medical card, he must re-negotiate the contract.  That should not daunt him in any way.  To be put off by that would be cowardly, craven, and he is neither.</P>
    <P>I do not care what party the Minister is in, I give credit where credit is due.  He is trying to change the health service for the better and it is not an easy task. However, he could, with a little vision, tackle it completely differently.  He could look at it again.  I remember it being said that to extend the eligibility by £1 would cost £1 million.  Of course Dr. Bono is a great professor who believes in lateral thinking and he has provided some examples of how we can solve many problems with lateral thinking.  When I heard the Minister saying that to extend the eligibility for medical care by £1 would cost £1 million, I said to myself that the Minister was blinkered and was looking only one way.  That is what he is doing and he has come up against a stone wall.  What he did not think of doing was walking round the wall.</P>
    <P>He could extend the medical card by divorcing the medical card service from the drug service.  I had great difficulty in persuading patients that they did not need a new pair of elastic stockings which are costing a lot of money, and I had to say to them constantly that a poor lady down the road was in great need and if those people were demanding those from me they were depriving her of badly needed tablets for her illness. Sometimes people want to hear only about their own illnesses and they do not want to hear about anyone else's.  When these articles are not urgent and not life-saving they should be put into the luxury category.  In that way a lot could be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Minister's colleague cannot give him unlimited amounts for the health service and what he has got up to the present has been very good.  I ask him to set up a special section within his Department for studying ways of economising within the health service without depriving people of certain essentials. Perhaps the whole structure is a <Col N="508" /> little unwieldy on account of this bureaucracy which we are encouraging by setting it up all over the place, and whether it is benefiting the health service is questionable.  There is enormous cost. Ministers&mdash;I am not referring to the present Minister&mdash;have a habit of boasting that they got so much extra for the health service in a year.  We should not be boasting about that; we should be saying that it is deplorable that they had to provide so much more because of the way the service is going.  The Health Contributions Bill has gone some way, although it poses problems.  It is going to extend the waiting lists for hospitals and it is going to encourage, in a way, a longer stay in hospital, and that is going to be another burden on the cost of hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more day hospitals. Day hospitals have to come and they should be extended in major hospitals where a number of operations can be done and the person can be allowed home on the same evening.  A full service can be provided there.  The big expense is the maintenance cost in the hospital.  It is incumbent on the Minister to set up this special section within his Department to look at the question of cost.  They must ask each hospital what they are doing about setting up day hospitals to relieve this tremendous pressure on beds.  That should be among the Minister's priorities in the hospitalisation service.  The day hospital service is operating in St. Vincent's and in Sir Patrick Dun's.  I would like to see it extended to every major hospital and facilities for it should be provided because the savings are obvious. This could save a lot of money as it would eliminate overnight maintenance costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister should investigate to see how the out-patient service could be improved. The present out-patient services are far from satisfactory.  If we operate an appointments system everyone should not be asked to come at 10 o'clock, as is happening at the moment. A little questionnaire should issue to hospitals from the Department as to how out-patients services are working, how they could be improved and how the appointments system is operating. <Col N="509" /> These are ways of relieving the strain on the hospitals.  A questionnaire from the Minister's Department could elicit a lot of information which would be of great benefit.  The Minister may argue that this is a question for the health boards, but the Department of Health are the body who exercise full control over all and who direct the health boards in doing this.  The Mater Hospital made a statement to the effect that the operation of the casualty service is creating an enormous burden on the hospital beds.</P>
    <P>Another area which requires investigation is the special tests that have to be provided for patients.  We want to see how we can operate them more efficiently and effectively and much more satisfactorily from the patient's point of view.  This can and should be done.  The proportion of the £419 million which goes into the hospital services is really enormous.  We could cut back tremendously and divert the money into essential areas which are screaming out, starved of resources at present.  We can do this without spending an extra penny by streamlining our out-patient services and making them into proper diagnostic centres so that a patient does not have to go into hospital for tests.  Figures for the number of patients admitted and who need not be in bed, who merely need tests that could be properly and adequately carried out at out-patient centres would indicate that probably between 30 and 40 per cent of admissions to hospitals are admissions for that purpose. That is a very high figure and it is a very costly operation.  Another area, that of minor operations, would represent a high proportion of hospital admissions.</P>
    <P>Two or three years ago it cost £212 but now I think it costs £250 a week for a bed in a Dublin teaching hospital.  This is the cost to the State.  Would it not be better to accommodate patients who are ambulatory in hostels close to the hospital?  This would reduce the cost of hospitalisation and the bed occupancy rate.  There is considerable pressure on beds because there are not sufficient available for those in need. Many people in need of hospitalisation <Col N="510" /> are being deprived of beds that are taken unnecessarily.  We must streamline the health services and make them more satisfactory for patients.  The Department of Health should examine areas like this on a continuous basis.  For many years I have been asking for this examination but nothing has happened. We make suggestions here on how to reduce the cost of the health services without reducing the quality or causing inconvenience and it is annoying when nothing is done.  There is an obligation on the Department to consider this matter.</P>
    <P>There is enormous waste in the health services.  There are areas in medicine that need money.  I have already mentioned services with regard to mental care.  There are 50,000 people&mdash;this is a conservative figure&mdash;who are urgently in need of hip replacement operations and they can only be told that there is a delay of from one to three years for admission to the Dublin hospitals.  Where a person's way of life can be improved considerably by a hip replacement and where he can be returned to society to play a useful role, we have an obligation to provide the necessary money.  I wonder about sophisticated operations that may be equivocal in their beneficial effects but this is one area where a lot can be done.  We have an obligation to see how we can divert some money into this area of medicine in order to make people useful members of society.  A person in need of a hip replacement does not suffer mere inconvenience; he can suffer excruciating pain and the disability and immobility may be severe.  I am not asking for more funds but for a diversion of funds into this area.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that everyone who is crippled needs a hip replacement.  I have seen some disastrous effects and some situations where people could not be expected to be restored as useful citizens. It must be done on a selective basis and we must give priority to people who can be restored as useful members of society and capable of playing an active part.  I saw one case of a man of 80 years being chosen for the operation.  I would not consider this of benefit to him because the risks are enormous.  As it happened <Col N="511" /> he was 14 months bedfast as a result of the operation and his condition was worse.  A proper and careful selection of patients is necessary but there are 50,000 on the waiting list for this kind of operation.  We should plough back more money into this area of medicine.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the free drugs scheme.  There are various medical conditions that are being ignored so far as this scheme is concerned. This matter should be looked into.  The Minister promised me he would do so after Christmas.  We are now in the month of February and I am asking him to make free drugs available for certain conditions.  First, I would ask him to consider the provision of free drugs for sufferers of asthma.  This can be a chronic condition, it can be exacerbated acutely and can be life-threatening on many occasions.  The drugs needed are very expensive.  The other illness I have in mind is arthritis.  There are several other illnesses and I sent a list to the Minister a year-and-a-half ago.  I would ask him to consider the possibility of extending the free drugs scheme for these crippling conditions.  They cause untold misery and there is an obligation on us to provide the drugs.  If we are going to introduce the drugs subsidy scheme we should see if we can curtail the type of drugs that can be given and by savings we should be able, without any extra cost, to help those who are suffering from such disabling conditions as asthma, arthritis and some other illnesses. These illnesses are not self-induced. It is a tragedy for the people concerned. They are chronic and disabling and I would make those the two conditions for giving the drugs.  It is unjust to deprive people suffering from those illnesses of the vital and life-saving drugs that they need.  The Minister will be getting some money.  He pointed out that this will be a self-financing scheme.  He has succeeded in extracting a considerable additional amount.  I am merely asking him to see that his Department consider what economies could be effected within the health services without lowering the quality.  We must ensure that the best medical attention is provided for those in <Col N="512" /> need.  If he does that he will be doing an effective job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to follow such an educational speech as that given by my good friend and colleague, Deputy O'Connell.  I do not speak from the point of view of the professional but from the point of view of the employer and the employee.  This Bill is certainly a step in the right direction and I give it a guarded welcome.  Three different categories of people come under this Bill, medical card holders, people who come under the Health Contributions Act and people who are over the £5,000 limit. From reading the Bill and listening to the Minister I take it that, as far as people earning over £5,000 are concerned, hospital beds in public wards are free and they have to pay only for the consultant or for maternity treatment.  This is certainly an improvement which has to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Our shadow spokesman, Deputy Boland, referred to the drugs scheme and I certainly disagree with him.  One of the great things in the drugs scheme is that if people, particularly children, suffer from some ailment which requires treatment with expensive drugs, regardless of the parents' incomes the drugs can be obtained under the drugs scheme.  There are cases where well-off parents have one or two children who require expensive drugs treatment and the family would find it impossible to pay for the drugs.  There was a case in my constituency where a wealthy man's wife became ill and required expensive drugs which he could not afford to pay for.  It is a good thing that if a family experiences hardships like this the State be able to protect the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other cases which are deserving of State support concern families where a member has an incurable disease.  In my constituency recently a farmer with a £60 valuation fell ill with cancer. Because he had a £60 valuation he was not insured as far as the £24 a year is concerned, and he did not bother about the bills because he thought he would get better.  Just before he died his wife came to me with bills totalling £2,500.  The farm had deteriorated due to the farmer <Col N="513" /> being in and out of hospital for the previous three years.  They had practically nothing except the land and they were faced with these bills.  In such cases of hardship it is a good thing that the health boards can be asked to look into them to see what can be done.  I would ask the Minister to see his way to asking the CEOs in all health boards always to look sympathetically at hardship cases. No matter how well-off some families are, when sickness hits it can impose an unbearable hardship.</P>
    <P>One thing which worries me, which is a general occurrence in western seaboard areas, is the withdrawal of medical cards.  There seems to have been a directive from the Department of Health through the CEOs in the health boards to assistance officers to look into borderline cases.  It is disgraceful that in the last two months medical cards have been withdrawn from people with an £8 valuation who have only eight cows on their entire holding.  Some of the other cases had £3, £4 or £6 valuations, but the highest valuation was one of £8 and the medical cards were withdrawn from those people.  By the time I had contacted the CEO and by the time the assistance officer visited the people, two months had elapsed.  The richest of these people and they were married people had only eight cows and were on the dole, yet their medical cards were withdrawn.  There is something wrong somewhere.  I can see the Minister shaking his head to say that no directive is coming from him.  If not some of the CEO's must be taking it on themselves, and they must be real cranks to take it out on these unfortunate people.  I would ask the Minister to see to it that such things do not happen in future.  I understand that the eligibility limit for a married person at present is roughly £41 a week gross.  It is a very meagre sum but I accept it.  However, it is an absolute disgrace when people living on less than that lose their medical cards.</P>
    <P>As I see it, a self-employed person must show his income tax returns to the Revenue Commissioners to prove that his gross earnings are under £5,000 a year.  That being the case I take it that the person is eligible under this scheme <Col N="514" /> once he pays £45 to the Revenue Commissioners. The procedure the Revenue Commissioners use in relation to this is wrong.  The Revenue Commissioners should issue straightforward forms which people could fill in and send to the Revenue Commissioners enclosing a cheque for £45 so that they could be automatically registered.  What is happening at the moment is that when a man writes to the Revenue Commissioners he encloses his income tax returns and sometimes two, three or four months can elapse before the person is covered under the health contributions scheme.  A person could become ill during that time and he would not be covered.</P>
    <P>In relation to farmers, the Minister mentioned that some form of notional valuation could be attached to the farm and stated that farmers are covered if they have less than a £60 valuation.  A £60 valuation was probably the handiest figure to arrive at with maybe a £1 per £1 valuation.  If somebody, for example, has a £25 land valuation that person has to send away only something in the region of £25 to be automatically covered.  I take it this is what the Minister means by a notional valuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the situation in relation to those with small holdings and a small grocery shop in the north west? It is unfair if, on taking the combination of both, the income of such people is in excess of £5,000 that that person does not qualify for the full services available. There are people with a land valuation of £6 who will not qualify because they have a small business concern which will bring their income in excess of the Minister's limit.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to another case which will create a problem.  A man living on his own earning £4,000 per year qualifies for all benefits but if after he <Col N="515" /> gets married his wife earns £2,000 per year both are ineligible.  I appreciate that as this is a new scheme it is difficult to cater for all cases but I hope that gradually people will be asked to pay according to their income with no such thing as a limit.  The Minister told us that £40 per week is the limit as far as the medical card is concerned and I have no doubt that within a few years £5,000 per annum will not mean anything.  I hope it is the intention of the Minister to grant free hospitalisation to everybody, regardless of income.</P>
      <P>I should now like to deal with the health contribution stamp and the social welfare stamp in so far as employers are concerned.  I understand that the Minister intends bringing in a Bill which will combine the payment in relation to redundancy benefit with the two payments I have mentioned.  The social welfare stamp at present amounts to 11.2 per cent with 1 per cent for health contribution.  I appeal to the Minister to leave the amount at an even figure that will make it easier for small businessmen to cope with.  Matters would be greatly simplified if the Minister made the total contribution a round figure.  At present the 1 per cent for health contribution goes on to the employee's contribution of 3.4 per cent but if the employee is a medical card holder it is up to the employer to add the 1 per cent to his contribution.  That is codology.  I do not know how employers can cater for that situation.  The Minister should forget about imposing that 1 per cent for medical card holders on employers.  It should be left simple.  What is wrong here is that we have a complicated system.  As was once remarked, a complicated system is only as complicated as the mind.  We have too many complicated minds and not enough black and white speakers.  The figures should be left easy for calculation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank goodness that the stamp has been done away with because many employers abhorred the work involved <Col N="516" /> in stamping cards.  Last week we were told of a case where the State was not paid thousands of pounds for insurance stamps by an employer.  If the position was assessed throughout the country I believe we would discover that the State lost millions of pounds because some employers did not stamp cards.  In most cases the reason cards were not stamped was that employers found the system very complicated.  If it was a straightforward system employers would have co-operated much more.  The Department should have insisted that stamps were put on cards weekly.  A lot of employers did not stamp the cards until the end of the year with the result that the State was without the money for 12 months.  I welcome the Bill and I hope that within a couple of years the Minister will extend the scheme to cover everybody, regardless of income.</P>

We have heard the professional point of view of Deputy O'Connell who knows his subject and Deputy White dealt with the matter in a general way outlining the difficulties which certain systems present to business people who must try to work out percentages.  I live in a poor constituency and I deal with urban and rural dwellers, people who are finding it very hard to make ends meet and I will concern myself with their plight.  Under the present system there are three categories, medical card holders, the middle income group and those with a valuation of more than £60 and an income in excess of £3,000.  The medical card holders get medical, surgical and hospital services free while the middle income group pay either 50p per week or £24 per year, if they are farmers, and they receive hospital services free.  Those over £60 valuation or with an income in excess of £3,000 do not enjoy any free medical or hospital services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for holding the House and to the Minister for a further half hour.  My query is prompted by the fact that Dublin City Council, for a variety of reasons, have now decided not to operate the rather inadequate system and arrangement of traffic wardens.  One of the country's better cartoonists was prompted to make the observation that he hoped to have for Christmas one of those cars with winking eyes that enabled one to park anywhere.  Anybody travelling around this city will see that Santa Claus has been unbelievably generous and has given these cars to everyone.  We now have the spectacle of triple parked cars, all with winking lights, in Merrion Square, St. Stephen's Green and other parts of the city.</P>
      <P>I do not think I am labouring the point when I say that the present position of traffic management in this city is so bad that people are despairing and in their despair Mike Murphy on RTE offers them consoling jokes as they sit locked in traffic jams, blocked by traffic, double parking and all the other inadequacies of the traffic management system.  Ideally the person who should be in the Minister's bench tonight is the Minister responsible for transport. Earlier today the Minister for Justice had some harsh words to say about my observations which were made in the context of other legislation but the more he makes such remarks the more I believe I am beginning to score.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to the present Administration, this problem of administration is the product of a totally inadequate structure of transport policy, an inadequate structure that pre-dates the present Fianna Fáil Government and the previous Coalition Government.  The fact that one <Col N="518" /> can spread the blame so liberally does not in any way reduce the degree of urgency that confronts the city.  In the last couple of weeks Dublin Corporation have decided to abandon the remaining part of their traffic warden system.  The net effect of that has been to remove 20 odd traffic wardens who maintained some degree of order in ensuring the observance of traffic regulations on parking in the centre city area.  We could go into the causes why that has come about but I would like to make some observations on the effects of that administrative breakdown.  I am indebted to the Minister for his reply to a written question today in which he clearly set out the background to the present difficulty.</P>
    <P>It would appear that there is a dispute with regard to the interpretation of the administration of the 1975 Traffic Wardens Act.  The Garda Commissioner and corporation officials are not at one in their interpretation as to how best this system could be used.  I am not being truculent but I would like the Minister to explain why this system has broken down.  The Traffic Wardens Act, 1975, contains powers which were vested in the Garda Commissioner over the appointment of traffic wardens and those powers were sought by the Fianna Fáil Opposition&mdash;I checked this point with the then Minister for Local Government. I am open to correction on this, but I understand the Garda Commissioner has effectively sat on the application for the appointment of a further 20 odd wardens which was placed with him some time before the end of last year.</P>
    <P>The reasons for that unsatisfactory situation relate to such matters as the Garda saying that if a traffic warden puts a ticket on a parked car the gardai have to bring the prosecutions and this means that some of their resources have to be tied up in court and they simply do not have those resources.  What really throws this into clear focus is the role of the Garda Síochána in relation to traffic management.  The responsibility for the management of moving and stationary traffic in our cities and towns is divided between local authorities and the gardaí, and consequently the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> Traffic management is not the primary role of the Garda and no Deputy would argue such.  I sympathise with the heavy administrative and legal role which the Minister and the Garda have with regard to more primary matters directly related to the role of the police force in our society.  Given the difficulties that have arisen with regard to requests for overtime, extra foot patrols and all the additional police services aimed directly at providing an additional police presence, it is only natural that simultaneous requests from a local authority, in this instance the City Council, for gardaí to improve the system of traffic management must take second place in the order of priorities of the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The city has been the victim of this.  I do not think it is necessarily the fault of the Garda Commissioner or the Minister for Justice but I believe it throws into sharp and bitter relief the total chaos that now surrounds the transport policy of our cities generally and Dublin city in particular.</P>
    <P>In his reply today the Minister stated that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the Traffic Sub-Committee of Dublin Corporation have in fact decided to recommend to the City Council not to establish a traffic warden service in the city under the 1975 Act and that responsibility for the existing service should revert to the Garda Síochána. These recommendations are due to be considered by An Coiste Cuspóirí Coitean and the City Council.  In the meantime, the situation is also being examined by the Garda authorities, the Department of the Environment and my Department.</P>
    <P>During yet another review by the Government of 84 seats, what is going to happen to the traffic in Dublin city? During the interdepartmental discussions, no doubt ably augmented by representations from the 84 Fianna Fáil Deputies, what is going to be done about the movement of traffic in this city? Arising directly out of the Minister's written reply today, how long will this review take?  When will it be completed? <Col N="520" /> Will it make specific recommendations? Will these recommendations clearly define who is responsible for traffic management in this city, and therefore by implication within the country at large?  Does the Minister have any observations or proposals with regard to the status of the 1975 Traffic Wardens Act?  When will this Minister and this Government do anything about traffic and transport in this city?</P>
    <P>I regret that I had to have the Minister for Justice here tonight.  There are many more important matters that are properly the concern of the Department of Justice.  I know&mdash;and this is most of the problem&mdash;that on top of everything else, to be bothered with the problems of Dublin's traffic difficulties is too much for the Department of Justice.  The Garda Commissioner, for administrative reasons relating to the implementation of the scheme under the 1975 Act between the local authority and himself, sat on the request for additional traffic wardens.  The traffic sub-committee, of which I was once a member, reckon that the city needs at least 100 traffic wardens to implement the existing traffic regulations in the centre city area.  In order to implement the traffic regulations within the Dublin city administrative boundaries approximately 200 traffic wardens are required.  If even two traffic wardens were allocated that would be a 100 per cent improvement. What proposals has the Minister got to give that 100 per cent improvement? The people who have to use urban transport every day are becoming more frustrated as time passes.</P>
    <P>The traffic problem in Dublin city will not go away.  Traffic management relates to the control of moving vehicles on our road system throughout the country.  There has been a staggering increase in the number of vehicles registered in the last 18 months especially in the Dublin area.  Deputy Smith might say that this is a great monument to the slogan of getting the country moving again.  If he was stuck in a traffic jam in south County Dublin, as distinct from North Tipperary, he would see that there is absolutely no movement.  Traffic in urban areas is moving at the rate of six <Col N="521" /> miles per hour.  That is a measure of Fianna Fáil progress.  The problem will get worse rather than better because it is essentially a problem of traffic management.</P>
    <P>The collapse of the traffic warden system is a symptom of a much greater problem.  When we come back into office, which will be sonner than many people expect, traffic wardens will be taken away from the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  I am sure that will be a relief to a great many officials in Stephen's Green.  What proposals has the Minister got to improve the traffic problem now that the traffic warden system has collapsed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quinn for allowing me five minutes to explain the position regarding the management of the traffic problem in this city by Dublin Corporation.  I am chairman of the traffic sub-committee which deals with this problem.  Traffic conditions in Dublin at the moment are chaotic.  During the bad weather I had to walk from Clontarf to the GPO which took me 40 minutes.  I have done the same journey by car on numerous occasions since and it has taken me 45 minutes.  This illustrates the traffic conditions in Dublin at present.</P>
      <P>At the moment we have 15 traffic wardens and seven supervisors.  The Minister has refused to appoint additional wardens because of a disagreement in relation to their duties.  They were asked to deal with tax discs but they refused to do this.  One might as well try to keep out the tide with a bucket on Dollymount Strand as to try to deal with the traffic problem in the Dublin city area with 22 wardens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The traffic sub-committee recently sent a deputation to the Minister for Justice, which he was unable to meet. They met some officials from the Minister's Department and Mr. Doherty the Assistant Garda Commissioner.  He said the divided responsibility whereby the traffic wardens are employed by Dublin Corporation but receive their instructions from the Garda authorities was unsatisfactory.  While traffic wardens may fix tickets to cars which are parked in prohibited areas, parked <Col N="522" /> on double yellow lines, parked on a clearway or parked too long in a parking area, they have no other powers.  If somebody is causing an obstruction and holding up the traffic those wardens have absolutely no power to ask that person to move on.  Those wardens are doing their duties as well as they can but 22 wardens in the city area are unable to help with the continual movement of traffic in that area.  At a recent meeting with the traffic superintendent he expressed the view that it would be necessary, as Deputy Quinn has said, to have approximately 100 wardens within the city area to allow traffic to move in a normal manner, so we were faced with the responsibility that either we accepted full responsibility for the movement of traffic or we would hand back to the Gardai.  In the circumstances the Minister will agree that we have no alternative but to hand back to the Gardaí.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier today I gave a full reply to a written question that was on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Quinn. There is not much I can usefully add to what I said in that reply.</P>
      <P>The arrangement with Dublin Corporation, introduced in 1970, is one in which there is divided responsibility between the Corporation and the Gardaí and it has proved unsatisfatory in practice. It was intended to be a temporary arrangement which would end when the Traffic Wardens Act became law as it did in 1975.  In the event, however, Dublin Corporation did not establish and operate their own traffic warden service as envisaged in that Act.  Apart from that, the traffic wardens were demanding extra payment before agreeing to put &ldquo;fine on the spot&rdquo; notices on cars for failure to display a tax disc or, as it now is, a registration disc.  For these and for other reasons the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána is dissatisfied with the position and he was not prepared, as long as circumstances remained as they were, to authorise the appointment of new wardens or to replace those who have left the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporation were asked by my Department last October to decide whether they intended to set up and <Col N="523" /> operate a service under the 1975 Act and, as Deputy Belton said, they requested a meeting with me and officials in the Department and with the Garda Síochána on 16 October last if my memory is correct.  He was not able to be present, nor was I, but the meeting was at a proper level and I understand that only very recently, on 31 January, the corporation traffic sub-committee reached a decision on the matter as far as they were concerned.  I gather that that decision, as was said earlier on to-day, goes to the general purposes committee. An Coiste Cuspóirí Coitean, of the corporation on 19 February and from there it goes to the City Council meeting on 5 March 1979 for final decision by the corporation.  I am assured that as soon as the corporation make that decision the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána will be glad to provide the service that the corporation were not able to provide since 1975.</P>
    <P>There were a number of questions asked by Deputy Quinn during the course of his 15-minute contribution.  I think they have been answered because it will be obvious to him at this stage that he has not got all the facts.  Dublin Council have not decided yet not to operate the traffic warden system. Deputy Quinn asked why the system has broken down.  It cannot have been necessary for him to ask that question because the system never got off the ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation has certainly got worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The system did not even get off the ground to get worse.  I will ignore the Deputy's political teasings about parties with 84 seats and so on. That does not help to make a case and the Deputy should know that by now. The Deputy need not have any great sympathy with me because I am the Minister responsible for this area, the innuendo being that I am too busy <Col N="524" /> to deal with such a matter.  This is not so.  Indeed the Deputy is probably aware that only ten days or so ago, on 25 January, I had a meeting with the Dublin Chamber of Commerce at a function which they organised.  I raised this matter with them and I told them that I hoped that progress was being made rather quickly in this area because I too am convinced, as any sane person must be who has to use the roads in and out of Dublin every morning and evening, that there is a very serious situation with the frustrations and everything else that people have to undergo morning and evening now.  I do not know how Deputy Quinn got the idea that the whole thing collapsed in the last few weeks.  Perhaps the bus strike must have something to do with that but it is no better and no worse this week than it was last week.</P>
      <P>As Dublin Corporation take a final decision on 5 March when this meeting is held then I would like to assure both Deputies Quinn and Belton that within a very short time after the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána will be very glad to provide the service that the corporation was not able to provide for the last number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that involve extra gardaí being made available for traffic management?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the service is to be provided by the Garda Síochána naturally it will mean that there will be a drain on manpower from some other source.  That is one of the very great pities about the fact that the corporation could not do this job as we would have liked them to do it.  I would further say, since I am on my feet again, that a number of local authorities have already adopted the provision of the 1975 Act and are working it quite well.</P>

A medical examination has been arranged in order to assess the degree of disablement resulting from the accident.  The appropriate rate of disablement will then be determined and payment of any disablement benefit to which he may be entitled will be made as soon as possible afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no traffic wardens employed by my Department.  The position is that the Road Traffic Act, 1968 empowered the Commissioner, Garda Síochána, to appoint traffic wardens&mdash;&ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo;&mdash;to operate the fixed penalty system for parking offences and, in accordance with the provisions of that Act, traffic wardens were initially appointed by him.  In 1970, as a transitional arrangement pending the enactment of legislation to enable local authorities themselves to operate a traffic warden service in their functional areas, Dublin Corporation agreed to employ wardens on an agency basis subject to their appointment being authorised by the Commissioner and the cost being recouped out of the Garda Vote.  The legislation&mdash;the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act&mdash;was enacted in 1975, and some local authorities now operate a traffic warden service under the provisions of that Act.</P>
      <P>At present, apart from the service operated by some local authorities under the 1975 Act, a total of 34 traffic wardens are employed by five local authorities, on an agency basis, under the Road Traffic Act, 1968.  I assume that the Deputy is interested primarily in the Dublin situation and the present position there is that 22 traffic wardens are employed by Dublin Corporation. The numbers employed have been dropping in recent years due partly to transfers from the service and partly to the fact that authorisation of new appointments has been withheld by the Commissioner pending settlement of difficulties which arose in regard to the extension of the duties of wardens and clarification of the position in regard to the taking over of the service by Dublin Corporation under the 1975 Act. Pending resolution of these matters, no decision was made as to the precise number of additional wardens that might be required to provide an adequate service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been discussions between the Garda authorities, Dublin Corporation <Col N="415" /> and my Department about these matters.  Within the past week my Department have been notified that the Traffic Sub-Committee of Dublin Corporation have in fact decided to recommend to the city council not to establish a traffic warden service in the city under the 1975 Act and that responsibility for the existing service should revert to the Garda Síochána.  These recommendations are due to be considered by an Coiste Cuspóirí Coitean and the city council.  In the meantime, the situation is also being examined by the Garda authorities, the Department of the Environment and my Department.</P>
    <P>The enforcement of parking regulations is not, of course, confined to traffic wardens and members of the Garda Síochána on beat duty continue to perform this function and to issue fixed penalty notices in Dublin and elsewhere.</P>

    <P>From 1 January 1968 when the redundancy payments scheme came into operation to 31 March 1974 the redundancy lump sum was calculated by reference to a qualified redundant worker's normal weekly remuneration as <Col N="419" /> provided for in the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967.  In that period, non-manual workers with income above the limit for compulsory insurance under the Social Welfare Acts were excluded from the scheme.  On 1 April 1974 these workers became compulsorily insurable and the scheme was amended at the same time to provide that a person's earnings in excess of £2,500 per annum&mdash;£48.08 per week&mdash;should not be taken into account in calculating redundancy payments.  Subject to this ceiling, redundancy lump sums are calculated by reference to the redundant worker's normal weekly remuneration not exceeding £2,500 per annum.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of weekly redundancy payments in payment-week ended <Col N="420" /> Wednesday, 3 January 1979, the latest week for which the information is available, was 2315.  The three highest rates of payments in that week on the available information were £24.04, £24.03 and £24.00.  The three lowest rates were £0.04, £0.06, £0.10.  The average weekly redundancy payment in 1978 was £15.24.</P>
    <P>As regards differentiation between &ldquo;first time&rdquo; and &ldquo;resumed&rdquo; payments and the average duration of payments, the compilation of such information would require a survey involving all employment exchanges and offices which would take a considerable time to complete and would be unduly costly.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that Deputy Kenny is referring to the report&mdash;A Study of Youth Employment in North Central Dublin&mdash;which was jointly commissioned by my Department and by AnCO.  The report was released by my Department on 9 December 1978, and copies have since been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he has received a request from the Board of Management of Saint Oliver Plunkett Boys and Girls National School, Dunedin, Monkstown, County Dublin, for an increase in the capitation grant, and for a grant to carry out necessary repairs and maintenance; and the action, if any, it is proposed to take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received such a request from the Board of Management of Saint Oliver Plunkett Girls' National School, Dunedin, Monkstown.</P>
      <P>This scheme of grants is, however, of general application&mdash;with certain special provisions for schools for the handicapped&mdash;and I am, accordingly, unable to entertain applications from individual schools for higher grants than those provided for in the scheme.  Moneys made available under the scheme of capitation grants, introduced in 1974, are intended to be spent on heating, cleaning, repairs and maintenance, the provision of teaching materials, and the periodic painting of the schools.  The grant was raised from £6.00 to £8.00 per pupil for the school year 1977-78 and the question of a further increase is now under consideration.</P>
