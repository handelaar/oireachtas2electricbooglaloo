      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) the latest figure available for registered unemployment and (b) the means adopted by the Government to inform themselves on the unemployment situation on a weekly basis during the continuance of the postal strike.</P>

      <P>The most recent complete live register total relates to 9 February 1979.  This was 102,285. Since the commencement of the postal dispute it has not been possible to obtain regular returns on a weekly basis from every local employment office.  However, it has been possible, by means of telephone contact, to obtain weekly information, with some delay, from about two-thirds of these offices.  The most recent date for which an aggregate live register figure for this group of offices is available is 23 March; this total was 73,366 which compares with 76,518 for the same group of offices on 9 February.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

      <P>On the previous occasion to which the Deputy refers I was replying to a question from Deputy Ryan.  I had then a figure up to 23 February.  This was procured by telephone.  The Deputy asked me if I had national figures up to that date and I told him I could assume that the national figures were available but it transpired that this was not so and that the figure I had referred to two-thirds of the offices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it would be a simple matter to ascertain how much money is being paid out each week under the various heads.  The Department of Social Welfare must have that information. They must know from their register how many people they are supporting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Minister what is the Government's information about unemployment.  This is the conventional way of eliciting such information. I appreciate the difficulties caused by the postal strike but allowing for those difficulties I have asked for the current figures.  The figures given by the Minister relate to about three-quarters of the offices but he has not given us any information regarding the remainder of the offices.  I am suggesting that it would be possible to let us have the entire figure by ascertaining from the Department of Social Welfare how much money is being paid out each week to the various categories and by dividing that amount by the appropriate weekly payment.  Is the telephone being answered in the Custom House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not be difficult to ascertain the number of payments involved in each category.  Is it the position that the Minister is trying to avoid giving what would be a very non-political answer, that is, that the unemployment figure is in excess of 100,000?</P>

It is not fair for the Minister to state that next year they will have telephones.  Of course they should get priority and should be given telephones immediately.  I do not accept the excuse he has offered for not installing them.</P>

The applications from the people whom the Deputy speaks of here were submitted in mid-October 1978. We have to take a broad view from an industrial standpoint of the applicants in Limerick who require telephones and to look at the number of people employed. There are firms in Limerick with more people employed than some of the companies mentioned by the Deputy.  That does not take away from the fact that we take a serious view of the concept of providing telephones as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to cow reactors.  It is almost impossible for a cow reactor to qualify for the hardship fund grant having regard to the restrictive measures imposed in the scheme.  The question was specifically one dealing with cow reactors and it has not been answered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have repeated that separate statistics are not kept.  The Deputy may be confusing the ordinary compensation paid, which in the case of cows is considerably greater than that paid for other cattle.  I made changes there more than a year ago almost doubling these payments made for cows. That situation is compensation for cow reactors excluded.  As for the hardship scheme, that is administered under recommendations made by the Animal Health Commission who represent all interested parties in the livestock trade.  It is their recommendation that the Department of Agriculture are acting upon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case it is a question of the determination of the intensity of the breakdown in the herd.  Again, it is a question of the whole herd, more or less irrespective of what the herd consists of.  If there is a particular degree of infection in that herd the question of the payment of a grant from the hardship fund will be considered.  I agree it would be better if the hardship fund was of greater size but there is a strain on the resources.  With the backlog of disease eradication work we inherited when we came into office it is necessary for us to deploy all our resources in the best way possible in conformity with the recommendations of the animal health committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the initiative taken by me during the price-fixing negotiations last year, the EEC Commission has prepared a comprehensive package of aids, aimed at promoting the development of agriculture in the West of Ireland and at tackling the structural problems at present inhibiting growth there.  The measures provide for the improvement of agricultural infrastructures in the area of piped water supplies, rural electrification and farm roads as well as aids for land improvement and division of commonages.  They also cover investment aids for on-farm improvements, education and advisory services, grants for the agricultural processing and marketing sector and incentives for promoting afforestation on lands not suitable for agricultural production.  Fuller details of the measures were given in the statement issued by me on 15 March.</P>
      <P>The Commission's proposals have recently been presented to the EEC Council of Ministers and it is my objective to have them considered quickly so that they can be introduced at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the Commission's proposals, or will he be suggesting improvements in the course of the Council of Ministers' consideration of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The package is a highly satisfactory one especially when one considers that it must be taken in conjunction with the drainage package of last year.  Taken together they should mark a really significant improvement in agriculture in the west.  In my opinion they will do a great deal for the uplifting of living standards generally in the west.  For those reasons it would be ungracious to embark on a programme on nit-picking on the scheme.  It is an excellent scheme.  Certainly, we will have recommendations to make to the Commission and to the Council.</P>

      <P>Members of the House will have learned with deep regret of the death, during the recess, of Seán Brosnan&mdash;ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam. His untimely death has left us with a profound sense of loss and we are the poorer for his passing.</P>
      <P>Seán was a kind and compassionate man.  He was greatly respected by all his colleagues and constituents on whose behalf he laboured so tirelessly.  As a member of the Council of Europe and, later, as a member of the European Parliament, he gave unselfishly of his time and energy in the service of the nation. He was an active participant in the affairs of those bodies and we were proud to have him as our representative. His keen interest in European affairs and his dedication to the European ideal made him an excellent choice for the European Parliament.  His experience will be sorely missed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who knew Seán were impressed by his courteous and generous disposition.  These same qualities endeared him to all those whom he dealt <Col N="1452" /> with in his professional life as school teacher, university lecturer and barrister and in public life.  His elegance and sportsmanship as a Gaelic footballer were fully reflected in all aspects of his later life.  We are saddened by his death and I would ask the Ceann Comhairle to convey to his widow and family our deepest sympathy.</P>

    <Title>Health (Family Planning) Bill, 1978: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>The first duty of this House to my mind is to legislate for all the people in the entire country regardless of their religion, whether Catholic, Protestant, Jew or Dissenter.  I submit that this Bill does not cover all the people in the country.  It is the right of the churches in turn to make their <Col N="1465" /> own rules and advise their parishioners as to what they should do as far as family planning is concerned.  In turn, it is the right of each person to make up his own mind, taking into consideration the advice of his or her particular Church on what a married person should do in regard to family planning.  It is about time that we separated the Church from the State.  As a State we must legislate for all the people.  The choice in this Bill, and in other Bills that I have no doubt we shall be discussing in future years, is one that must be left to the individual.  It is not the case that anybody is insisting that a married person or a single or divorced person must use contraception; if their Church tells them they should not use any form of contraception, pill or otherwise, that choice should be left to the individual and that should be made quite clear.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we are interfering basically with human rights.  The first human right is to have a choice to make up one's own mind as to what one should or should not do.  I am very doubtful as to whether this Bill if taken to the Supreme Court would not be thrown out in the same way as in the McGee case.  It is a humiliating thought in modern society to think that a married person must go before a doctor for the doctor to prescribe any form of family planning. Most doctors will probably be able to advise and probably some doctors will not encourage people to use any form of family planning.  We must be realistic about this and I think the problem is most serious&mdash;many people are talking but they are not talking in the context of the present time&mdash;as far as a divorcee is concerned or a separated person.  I hope the Minister will state how he suggests these people should secure any form of family planning.  Probably he will not answer that but it is one of the questions that must be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about a family planning Bill in a modern age&mdash;what happens to single people and even university students who at present are using different forms of contraception?  My reading of the Bill indicates that there will be no more clinics as far as the universities are <Col N="1466" /> concerned.  What happens to these people?  I think that if a single person or a divorced person brings this legislation to the Supreme Court such a person will have a human right and we are legislation as a State.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland contraception is freely available and has been all through my life and probably in my father's time, possibly since the beginning of the State in the twenties.  Contraceptives are freely available there; they are sold in chemist's shop which sell whatever articles they are without requiring a doctor's prescription.  I do not think anybody in southern Ireland can honestly say that morals in Northern Ireland are any worse than they are here.  I would be first to admit that moral standards have been declining.  This is part of modern society. I do not consider it a good thing but, life being what it is, we must accept that many single people, whether this Bill becomes an Act or not, are using and will be using contraceptives.</P>
    <P>I understand that only a married person can be given this prescription by a doctor and that in turn a woman may go to a chemist's shop with the prescription&mdash;even though it is not a prescription&mdash;and the form of contraceptive required is handed out, whether it is the pill or any other form of contraceptive. What happens if the chemist sells contraceptives to an unmarried person?  Is it intended that such a chemist will be prosecuted?  If he sells contraceptives to a divorcee or separated person&mdash;I return to the fact that we have marriages breaking up at the present time&mdash;what happens as regards that chemist?  What happens if the doctor prescribes contraceptives for a single person if that single person goes to the doctor after having intercourse and the doctor honestly feels this person would be better on contraceptives?</P>
    <P>This is a Bill that has gone half way; it has certainly not gone far enough.  I realise the Minister is in a dilemma in trying to satisfy everybody particularly when probably the vast majority of Deputies are the older type of Deputy and totally against legislating for any form of contraception.  No doubt the time will come, and it will not be that <Col N="1467" /> long in coming with the number of young people we have in the country, when people will demand full human rights not only in the case of family planning but in regard to all forms of contraception. We are only hiding our heads in the sand if we think this storm will blow over.  These people will demand the basic right to make up their own minds and this is only right.</P>
    <P>There was recently reference in the media to a doctor who should know quoting the figure of over 7,000 women from southern Ireland having abortions in Britain at present.  This is a dreadful fact about which we must be all very concerned, but I suggest that the connotation of this Bill, with its strict insistence that first, a person must go to a doctor and secondly must go to a pharmacist to get a simple thing handed out over a counter&mdash;which should have nothing at all to do with the doctor&mdash;is that people who want to have sexual intercourse will not bother to comply.  The likely effect of this Bill is that people who wish to engage in sexual relations will not bother to use contraceptives.  That would be a most regrettable situation in that it would be likely to lead to a greater number of Irish women having abortions in Britain.  The present figure of 7,000 in this regard is alarming.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying he might confirm whether contraceptives may be prescribed by the health boards for medical card holders.  If this is to be the situation, it should be made clear so that the people concerned would be aware that contraceptives may be prescribed by the health boards and obtained free of charge.</P>
    <P>There is a need for more family planning clinics at which young people could be educated in family planning matters. If this Bill will mean the closure of the clinics that exist in some of the universities, it is a backward step.  I doubt whether anybody now a days would consider it proper that there should be families of as many as 14 or even up to 20 living in bad conditions.  The fathers may be drawing the dole.  In such circumstances children would not be getting the opportunities that other families <Col N="1468" /> would be likely to have.  We must endeavour to educate the young people in matters of family planning.  That is why there is a need for proper family planning clinics in all the large centres of population.</P>
    <P>There are varying opinions on all sides of the House in regard to this legislation.  I am disappointed that the other Member here of the minority, Deputy Briscoe, has not let us hear his views.  Perhaps he will rectify this situation and let us know how he considers the Bill will work, particularly as far as the minority are concerned.  We in Fine Gael are being allowed a free vote on this occasion.  We are a very independent party, especially in matters relating to human rights.  However, it is not my intention to vote one way or the other. This is because I do not consider the legislation to be going far enough.  If the Minister had introduced a measure that would provide for contraceptives for such people as divorcees and mature people generally, regardless of their marital status, I would have been tempted to vote with the Government.  I am not voting against the Bill on the basis that the Minister has gone at least half way on this occasion.  We must appreciate that this is a difficult area.  There may be Members of Fianna Fáil for whom voting on the Bill will be a problem.  However, I trust that they will vote on this occasion and that the fact that so many of them are missing today is not an indication that they will not be here later for the vote.  On the previous occasion 27 of them did not vote.  They should be here to ensure support for the Minister.  It should not be necessary for the press to go so far as to indicate the manner in which people voted on this issue though I expect some of them will give this information.  However, the sooner the Bill is voted on the better because it is at least a step in the right direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been debating this Bill for some weeks.  It is a sad commentary on the order of priority of business that, while the country is experiencing so many strikes, while there is unparalleled discontent with the tax system and while there are oil shortages, <Col N="1469" /> we should be spending time discussing a measure which all of us know will be unworkable and which in essence is ridiculous.  We know that the Bill is an expedient designed to placate the rural element in the Government party.  I am convinced that if the Minister had his way we would have a Bill which would at least call for more support from all sides of the House.  Fianna Fáil in their election manifesto undertook to ensure a positive policy of family planning that would have the widest possible acceptance. I was a member of that administration which attempted some years ago to deal with this matter.  The proposals were opposed under Whip by the then Opposition.  If this Bill is a product of years of preparation it is a sad indictment of the confidence of this Government.  If, as we expect, the Bill will be found not to be workable, we may assume that before long it will be contested in the courts.  At least some of its provisions will be contested one way or the other.</P>
      <P>The import of the Bill in relation to the family planning clinics has been referred to by Deputy Lemass in an interesting and courageous speech.  It is regrettable that during debate on a measure of this kind, which though of great importance to everybody is of the greatest immediate importance to women, there should only be a handful of women Members here to contribute. Whatever may be the outcome of any court case concerning this Bill, in its present form it will mean the end of the family planning clinics.  There is one of these clinics in my constituency.  They are in other parts of the city also, but wherever they are they are providing a very valuable service.  Therefore, it is only fair to ask what is to be the situation for those thousands of families who avail of these services whether by calling personally at the clinics or by having supplies posted.  The postal service in particular afforded privacy to families in this area, which should be private, but a big question mark hangs over the whole future of this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision to make training in family planning available for the doctors who have such an important role to <Col N="1470" /> play if this Bill is taken seriously.  The training of doctors does not equip them to give advice on contraception.  There is only one recognised authority on family planning, that is, the Joint Committee on Contraception of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of General Practitioners. Ideally, doctors who are to give advice on contraception should have a certificate from that body.  The only recognised training centre in the country offering that certificate is the Irish Family Planning Association.  The Department of Health recognise this state of affairs to the extent that they subsidise doctors taking part in these courses.  If the activities of the Irish Family Planning Association are curtailed as a result of this measure, what will happen in relation to the training which they are presently giving doctors in relation to family planning?  The Bill does not provide for minimum training standards in family planning.  There are no restrictions in the Bill on who may give instruction in natural methods of family planning.  I believe women are entitled to the best medical advice available on this matter.</P>
    <P>The point must also be made that the service given by the clinics is relatively cheap.  The Bill proposes the additional cost of a consultation fee and prescription fee.  Many people will be denied contraceptive advice because their doctors and chemists may opt out of the scheme. The Bill makes no provision whereby doctors can state publicly whether they are in or out of the scheme.  Therefore, information on contraception will be difficult to obtain if the measures in this Bill are actually operated.</P>
    <P>Hanging over the entire Bill is the threat of reference to the Supreme Court which will probably put aside many of the major premises in it following the McGee case.  There is the question of what happens the entire lecturing, information and education service which is presently operated by the clinics.</P>
    <P>I know that many of these points have been referred to in what has been a long debate and I do not intend to detain the House unduly by going over ground which has been adequately covered. <Col N="1471" /> However, my work as a constituency representative for more than 14 years persuades me that people must have access to contraceptives, which is a basic human right.  The Bill is a compromise between the rural and urban wings of the Government.  If the Minister had had his way we would have a Bill which would have met the problem more honestly and accurately.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives doctors an impossible role in that they will be forced to make moral judgments about their patients. Before prescribing contraceptives they must be satisfied that their patients are seeking contraceptives for <i>bona fide</i> purposes. The Minister has already assured the House that legal consequences will not follow the advice given by doctors on contraception.  However, the Minister's assurances are one thing and the legal consequences are another.  Sufficient assurance has not been given to the House on the matter.  The Bill leaves one with a great sense of unease.  It must be asked whether this section of the Bill can be reconciled with the requirements of the judgment in the McGee case. What happens in the case of victims of broken marriages and in the case of annulments granted by the Church?</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised that the clinics will not be able to operate after the Bill becomes law.  I hope that the Minister will consider this aspect of the Bill.  The point has already been raised by a woman member of his own party with a constituency similar to mine.  Deputy Lemass speaks from the same experience of representing a large constituency and she has referred to the valuable work of the clinics.  If the clinics close as a result of the passage of this Bill, who will deal with the large number of people who visit the clinics regularly? We are not in a position to say that we have a sufficient number of adequately trained doctors to deal with the large number of people who will have nowhere to go in future.  Whether doctors' surgeries can cope with the number of people looking for contraception advice is very much in doubt.</P>
    <P>What will happen in the case of medical card holders?  There is no provision <Col N="1472" /> for them in the Bill.  At present they can only get the pill.  The Bill will make it impossible for doctors to prescribe for medical card holders any other form of contraception than the pill.  As we know, there is a body of opinion which suggests that the pill may not be the best form of contraception in all cases.</P>
    <P>A melancholy comment on the way progress occurs here is that before 1935 this debate would not have been possible because we had no legislation that needed amending in this respect.  There is no evidence that society was more degenerate before 1935 than it is now. Forty-four years later we are trying to deal with a situation that was brought into being in 1935.  The simplest action we could take in relation to the matter would be to repeal section 17 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935. In other words, a return to the pre-1935 situation would probably be the simplest remedy.  After such a repeal this House could deal with any abuses that might arise in its wake.</P>
    <P>The main point in relation to the Bill is that it will mean the closing of clinics which have performed a valuable service for families in Dublin and elsewhere. Another point is that doctors will be arbitrators in public morals which is not a role they would willingly take.  The Minister inevitably runs the risk of his measure being described as unworkable and ridiculous.  He has done his utmost in his Department and is sincerely anxious to improve health services.  He suffers the disadvantage, of course, of being a member of a Cabinet whose priorities in this matter have not exactly been demonstrated, but within the constraints of his membership of the present Government the Minister has attempted to do a reasonable job.  He is dedicated to improving the health services, but his most glorious hour was not in bringing this Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>The House must remember that the courts have already spoken on this matter in the McGee case.  They will probably speak again when this Bill has been passed.  We assume it will be largely unamended because there have been very few voices raised in criticism on the Government side, apart from those of <Col N="1473" /> Deputy Lemass and Deputy Andrews.  It is significant that they represent large city constituencies in which the clinics, which are threatened by the passage of this Bill, are seen to be of assistance. These Deputies know this and my chief concern is the adverse effect of the passage of the Bill on the operation of the clinics.  As a public representative, I know these clinics have been of immense service in local communities.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons why I will oppose this Bill.  I would ask the Minister once more to consider the entire matter and, perhaps, proceed no further.  He should appreciate that there are features of this Bill which in the years ahead will not be cited to his credit as a hardworking Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain points I feel I must make in relation to this Bill.  This is a piece of legislation where heads will be counted.  When I became a Member of this House in 1954 one could always see which way Deputies voted because it was the practice of the daily newspapers to report this.  The practice has now been stopped and probably rightly so because much of the time this information was not very relevant.</P>
      <P>The McGee case was quoted by the Minister in his opening speech and this Bill perpetuates the situation which the McGee case produced.  It is legal under this Bill to take into the country contraceptives for one's own use and, as I understand it, that was the conclusion of the reserve judgment in the McGee case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the danger of not drawing an absolutely clear line between contraception and abortion.  I have no doubt that abortion is murder.  As a layman, I have seen photographs of the foetus and no person has the right to do away with a living being.  When conception takes place another living being is extant.  Being in the position of having a free vote on this Bill, I have to ask whether there can be a grey area between contraception and abortion.  I fear there can.  There are some things which might be described by some medical people as abortifacients and by others as contraceptives. There is a device used which <Col N="1474" /> may allow conception to take place but which makes it impossible for development to take place in the womb.  This is an example of the grey area which is so important.  I will deal later with the reasons for the Bill which, perhaps, are valid.</P>
    <P>One finds in the interpretation section of the Bill a definition of &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo;, and definitions of dispensing chemists and druggists, family planning services, pharmaceutical chemists, registered medical practitioners and the word &ldquo;sell&rdquo;, but there is no definition of the family.  Section 4 (1) (b) (ii) states:</P>
    <P>the person to whom the contraceptives are sold is named in a prescription or authorisation in writing for the contraceptives of a registered medical practitioner and is a person who, in the opinion of the practitioner formed at the time of the giving of the prescription or authorisation, sought the contraceptives for the purpose, <i>bona fide,</i> of family planning or for adequate medical reasons and in appropriate circumstances and the prescription or authorisation bears an indication that it is given for the purposes of this Act, or</P>
    <P>A girl aged about 20 may go to a doctor and say she is not married but is cohabiting with her boyfriend and wants contraceptives.  She may say that they constitute a family unit but that they do not want any children yet and, therefore, she seeks a prescription for contraceptives from the doctor.  How does the definition apply in such a case?  If she were my daughter how would I feel? What is the position in relation to doctors of different creeds and faiths.  In the town I come from, which has a population of 20,000, would a doctor who had been honourably raised with a certain creed and faith take a different view from a doctor who had been honourably raised with another creed and faith? Such a situation would occur.  In a town where everybody knows everybody else, would not those who want contraceptives go to the doctor whom they knew would give a prescription?  In the circumstances I speak about, Newry is only three-quarters of an hour away and anybody could hitchhike there to <Col N="1475" /> purchase whatever he required.  That does not apply to the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is an aching void in that there is no definition of family.  The Minister intends to put the onus on the unfortunate general practitioner.  I do not think many people would see a consultant on this matter.  The general practitioners must decide whether a request for contraceptives is based on valid family planning reasons.  To me that is extremely odd.  It shows a great weakness in this Bill which turns me away from voting for it, even though I have a free vote if I so wish.</P>
    <P>What is the <i>prima facie</i> case for this Bill?  It did not arrive in the House as the brainchild of the Minister.  There were many requests for it and many lobbies. This matter should be argued from the point of view of how we all consider it and how we have assessed the situation. The <i>prima facie</i> case for the Bill is the non-availability of contraceptives to people in the poorer brackets in certain cases where they are direly needed.</P>
    <P>I was in Kerry a few years ago when the previous Bill was being considered.  I was speaking to a middle-aged lady who was the proprietoress of the establishment in which we were staying.  She instanced a case to me and my wife of an unfortunate farm labourer's wife who had 12 children.  She was living out in the back of the bog, so to speak, and her husband did not take any account of her failing health and was quite prepared for her to have another 12 children.  The proprietoress of the establishment in which we were staying said she sent all the food and clothing she could to this woman and tried to do everything she could for her.  She asked should she not have access to some form of contraception. My answer is: &ldquo;Yes, I think she should.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If young people in Dundalk and Drogheda want to get these things, they hitchhike to Newry and buy them.  There is no question of their not being available in that town.  It would be far cheaper for them to drive across the Border and buy them than it will be to go to a doctor and get a prescription under this Bill.  The <i>prima facie</i> case for the Bill is not that of <Col N="1476" /> the person earning a decent wage but the lady I described in Kerry who received sincere pity and help from another person of her own sex.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy White that this is a half-baked Bill and that it only goes half way.  The Minister should define &ldquo;family&rdquo; in the Bill if he wants it to be a Family Planning Bill.  Otherwise he should say each citizen shall or shall not have availability.  What were Fianna Fáil doing in introducing this half-baked Bill? They were trying to provide an aura of liberalisation and fair play and to get away from the insistent lobbies who were making life intolerable for them. Family Planning clinics are flourishing in Dublin since the McGee case and there is another lobby to get them closed. Fianna Fáil thought this would be a way to get out from under all this political clout.  In the immortal words of the late General Seán MacEoin, they wanted to avoid a belt of a crosier.</P>
    <P>I see the <i>prima facie</i> case I have mentioned. I also see the danger of abortion. As I said, abortion is murder.  It does not matter whether it takes place one instant after conception or weeks or months after conception: it is murder.</P>

      <P>No person has the right to take the life of another.  The living foetus is a human person.  I see the Minister's dilemma in attempting to prepare this Bill.  Apart from the fact that I have bounced off him politically now and again, and he off me, he knows I have a considerable regard for him and for his abilities.  I know this matter might never have been faced up to by other Ministers, but he did not face up to it fully. He did not produce something which might make his party unpopular but which would be fairer and better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On balance I have decided what I will do.  I will vote against the Bill, bearing in mind the sad case to which I referred where there is a need, also bearing in mind the non-definition of &ldquo;family&rdquo; and what can happen in every town in Ireland to young people who in my view would only have to tell certain doctors they were cohabiting and were therefore <Col N="1477" /> a family, and also bearing in mind the grey area of abortion.</P>

      <P>I once read of an artist who painted a picture. He wished to find out what the public thought about his talent and his painting and he placed it in the market square.  Beside it he put a brush and a tin of black paint and a notice asking any member of the public who did not like any element of the picture to put a black stroke through it.  Lo and behold, a day later his entire picture had been blacked out.  With the teacht anair most artists have, he painted the picture again and put it in the same market place and put the same brush and tin of black paint beside it.  The notice this time asked members of the general public who particularly liked some element or aspect of the painting to put a black stroke through it.  Of course, the following morning again the entire painting was blacked out.</P>
      <P>I am afraid this Bill is very much in the position of that painting.  There is hardly anybody in this House, or indeed in the country, who does not dislike the legislation or some element of it for entirely different reasons.  I listened with great care and attention to the whole debate and I find that the views of the different Members of the House are so varied and so different that it is utterly and totally impossible to conceive of any Bill I could bring into the House which would receive universal approval.</P>
      <P>The House is simply reflecting the views of the community it represents. This is an issue on which an infinite variety of views are sincerely and positively held by different people.  I indicated that although that was the position when I introduced the Bill&mdash;and having listened to the debate I am convinced that that is so&mdash;there are in this House Deputies who can find reason for voting against this Bill no matter what their views on contraception and family planning may be.  I am not interested at this stage in scoring political debating points about the legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but as I listened to the debate I was sorely tempted from time to time to defend myself, my motives and the party in bringing in the legislation.  As I listened to the debate unfolding I came to the conclusion that Deputies making contributions were motivated by a variety of different objectives. Some of them presented their views sincerely; others expressed the views that they felt they should express and that people would like to hear from them.  I am afraid there were others who were quite cynical in their approach.  I would like to deal briefly in substance with points which were made in the course of the debate.</P>
      <P>The first aspect of the debate that I would like to deal with is the approach of the Fine Gael Party and the suggestion put forward by the spokesman on Health in the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Boland.  He suggested that we should take the Bill away and set up now an all-party committee who would reach a consensus and on the basis of that consensus we could then bring in legislation which would be agreed unanimously. That would be an attractive proposition for me to adopt if it were even remotely feasible, but I think Deputy Boland on reflection would accept that it is not.  In fact, the establishing of such a committee would mean simply that we would be postponing the whole matter until some future unspecified date and that there would be no more possibility even then of securing unanimous agreement on what we would propose.  First of all, any such committee would have to be representative of the Fine Gael Party, apart from being representative of the House as a whole.  I want to have a brief look at the different points of view of the Members of the Fine Gael Party which were put forward to show that any such all-party committee arriving at a consensus is not a practical proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, let me mention Deputy O. J. Flanagan, who put forward, with great conviction and at some length, his views. I do not want to summarise them unfairly, but his view in general is that contraception is bad, an evil thing, and therefore we should not at all legislate in any way for the legalising of contraceptives. He was followed by Deputy <Col N="1479" /> Clinton, a man for whom I have great respect and admiration as a very sincere man.  He gave expression very concisely to his viewpoint, which was different from that of Deputy Flanagan.  His viewpoint was that married persons had the right and should be entitled to have access to contraceptives if they so wish, but in order to do that&mdash;to make contraceptives available to married persons&mdash;he would have to make them universally available.  He could not see any way in which they could be made available to married persons and not to the population as a whole, and therefore he was against making them available to anybody.  I think that is a fair summary of his point of view.  Then we had Deputy Kelly, who had a completely diametrically opposite approach.</P>
    <P>His point of view, which was fairly simple and straightforward, was that all we needed to do on this occasion was to repeal section 17 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935.  That proposition is very simply stated, but when you look at what it means it does not disclose such a simple proposition at all.  The simple repeal of that section 17 would mean that artificial contraceptives would be universally available without limitation or control to every person in our community.</P>
    <P>I will take those three Deputies as having spoken very clearly and honestly in giving us their views on this matter. You can see within the compass of those three speeches three completely different approaches to this problem.  Then Deputy White, who has just spoken, approached the matter differently again.  I do not want to delay too long on this aspect of the debate, but I say that the speeches from the Fine Gael benches in particular indicate quite clearly that there is no possibility of making any progress with the sort of all-party committee which Deputy Boland has put forward.</P>
    <P>I come back to Deputy Kelly's proposition, because examination of it is fairly basic to this whole debate.  His is the simple approach of repealing the offending section in the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, and throwing <Col N="1480" /> the floodgates wide open.  I know that consistency is stated by somebody to be the hobgoblin of small minds but, even allowing for that, Deputy Kelly's approach to this legislation is completely incomprehensible.  The divergence between his stance on this occasion and his total commitment at the time to the provisions of the Coalition Bill cannot be looked on as any sort of reasonable evolution or modification of a point of view, no matter how vast the range and scope of the mind and no matter how total its rejection of consistency being the hobgoblin may be.  Deputy Kelly now advocates the simple repeal of section 17.  Of course, as I have already pointed out, that means that contraception of all sorts without any supervision will be universally available to young and old without limitation of any sort.</P>
    <P>That is in stark contrast with Deputy Kelly's activities on the last occasion that this matter was before the House. On that occasion not alone did he vote for the Coalition proposals, which are quite stringent, restrictive and limited, but he actually worked hard and assiduously to have them passed.  I and many others in the House remember his dedicated efforts to whip up support for the Bill among the Coalition parties.  I remember seeing him physically practically compel the unfortunate Deputy Joan Burke into voting for the Coalition Bill.  The unfortunate Deputy voted against it thinking she was doing the right thing by her party.  But she did it because she was practically compelled, certainly persuaded to do so, by Deputy John Kelly.  I cannot for the life of me see how he can reconcile his activities as Chief Whip for the Coalition with his condemnation of this Bill and his now apparent advocacy of total, unlimited, universal availability of contraceptives.</P>

      <P>Another aspect, raised by Deputy Browne in particular, was the accusation that this is a sectarian measure.  I want to reject that.  I think Deputy Browne does not understand the views of the majority of the churches in this country when he says that&mdash;the implication is in what he says, and indeed the implication was in some other contributions&mdash;the restrictive provisions in this Bill were inserted to meet the wishes of the majority.</P>
      <P>I have to be careful in what I say because I do not want to disclose to any extent views given to me in great confidence, in a very responsible manner, but I can assure the House that what is in this Bill is far more in keeping with the views of the majority of the churches in this country than the approach of Deputy Browne.  I know from my own certain, personal knowledge that the majority of churches in this country turn away from making contraceptives generally available without any restriction whatsoever.  I think I would be right in saying that the majority of the churches, as churches, and that the vast, overwhelming majority of church-going people would favour the making available of contraceptives to married persons under very strict limitation and control.  I say that, not again I hope in any political sense but just disclosing to this House the situation as I have found it.  I want to make this plan&mdash;and I do not want to make it in any spirit of arrogance or self opinion&mdash;that by now I think I am better informed on this issue than any other individual Member in this House.  I think I now have a better understanding, a better knowledge of what the vast majority of people in this country think about contraception and indeed what is the greatest majority of responsible opinion on this issue because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Most Deputies who have spoken have not listened to what other Deputies have had to say.  But by now I have a fairly comprehensive picture of what the view is.</P>
      <P>Again I want to reassure the House that in my view the proposals in this Bill &mdash;vote them how you will&mdash;represent something which is acceptable to the overwhelming majority of responsible people in the community.  I want to give it as my view that the overwhelming majority of people in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;think that contraceptives should be made available under control and with certain restrictions. I think there would be no majority at all for a view which said that contraceptives should not be made available under any circumstances.  I think quite a large majority of people believe that contraceptives should be made available for genuine family planning purposes.  Also I am certain&mdash;and I know this&mdash;there is no majority whatsoever for a viewpoint which would suggest that contraceptives should be made universally available to all sections of the community without any control or limitation.  They are the two things of which I am certain, having listened carefully for a long time to a great variety of views.  Once one accepts that contraceptives should be made available, must be made available for whatever reason, once one accepts that there should be control, limitation and restriction, then inevitably one is driven to the proposals in this Bill or something like them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think also that Deputies who are interested should give the Government credit for placing this matter firmly in the context of family planning because I think that is what the majority of ordinary men and women think about this; they think that it is legitimate, right and lawful to make contraceptives available for genuine family planning purposes.  If <Col N="1483" /> there is to be control, restriction or limitation, as I believe the people want, then one has got to vest that control, restriction and limitation somewhere and ask oneself: where is one going to vest it?  In whom is one going to vest it&mdash;in the Garda, or to what other body of persons would one entrust the administration of the limitations and restrictions which the vast majority of people want?  Surely if there has to be some control and some limitation the sensible approach is to ask the medical profession to take on the role and responsibility of family planning and, in that context, to be the people who will control and limit the availability of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>The arguments are overwhelming for that approach.  Once one comes to look at this situation, in any sort of depth and with any sense of responsibility, inevitably one is led, step by step, to what is in this Bill.  First of all, whether it is the Supreme Court case or whether it is a social need makes one decide, there is a necessity to make contraceptives available.  The second stage in one's line of thought must be that they cannot be made universally available.  Nobody wants a slot machine, huckster shop situation in so far as contraceptives are concerned.  We have to have some limitation and restriction.  Therefore the next step in one's line of thinking is&mdash;if they have to be made available and if there has to be some limitation&mdash;is not the right thing to do to make them available only in a family planning context and are not the right people to handle family planning and deal with family planning the family doctors?</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne can be smart aleck if he likes, but I do not think he need try to be a smart aleck about this; I do not think it is necessary. Deputy Barry Desmond made an amusing speech about Customs officers being embarrased, going through people's luggage and so on.  I do not think that gets us anywhere.  I am trying to explain to <Col N="1484" /> the House my reasoning for this legislation and the inevitable logical steps which led me to propose what is before the House.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies rightly spoke about the need for training and education.  I accept that fully.  It is perhaps the most important aspect of this matter.  The availability of contraceptives is a relatively minor matter in so far as family planning is concerned.  What we need, more than anything else, is a corps of skilled trained people to help couples plan their families and to approach the planning of their families in a sensible and responsible way.  I am accepting that responsibility.  I accept that once this legislation is passed it will be my responsibility to set up a suitable and adequate family planning service.  Deputies also pointed out, correctly, that we must begin with the family doctor, many of whom already provide a first class family planning service.</P>
      <P>One of the best pieces of encouragement I got in this whole laborious and unrewarding process of introducing this legislation was from a woman family doctor who has a large general practice in rural Ireland.  She welcomed the Bill and indicated to me that it was exactly what she, as a professional person, had been waiting for.  She did not anticipate any problems in administering it.  That was a great endorsement for me of the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that the ordinary GP is hard-pressed and that it takes him all his time to keep up with the pressures of his practice and look after his patients to the best of his ability.  We must have facilities for such doctors to enable them to provide a family planning service for their patients.  A start is being made, as Deputy O'Leary mentioned, by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of General Practitioners by establishing a joint committee to formulate a training programme for Irish doctors.  That is a beginning but there is a need for a great programme in this area.  I accept that the Minister for Health, and the Department, will have earnestly and actively to engage in the provision of a family plan <Col N="1485" /> ning service for the community as a natural follow-up to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne asked me to speak about natural and unnatural family planning services.  However, the Bill does not mention anything about unnatural family planning and I would not recognise such a term.</P>

      <P>We must recognise that a large number of married people in our community wish to have family planning available to them but abhor artificial contraceptives.  For those people natural family planning methods&mdash;family planning which does not involve the use of artificial contraceptives&mdash;offer a solution to this dilemma.  It is no good dismissing them as obscurantist or uneducated or by any perjorative word of that type.  A large number of married people in our community wish to limit the size of their families, space the births, but do not wish to have recourse to artificial contraceptives.  The Bill is right when it directs attention to the need for a natural family planning service and places an obligation on the Minister to meet the wishes and needs of that section of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with them in a moment.  Before I leave the question of natural family planning I should like to state that there has been some controversy recently about the effectiveness or otherwise of different natural family planning methods.  I have planned to hold in Dublin later this year an international seminar, of a highly scientific quality and in co-operation with the World Health Organisation, on natural family planning so that we can hear the latest position from the greatest international authorities available on natural family planning and natural family planning methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> Deputy Browne asked me about family planning which involves artificial contraceptives. I propose to make instruction and education available in that area also.  A number of people have criticised the fact that the Bill provides that money be made available for research for natural family planning and asked why funds cannot be provided for research into family planning which involves artificial contraceptives.  The reason is that I do not need to.  I am assured that the different research bodies have complete authority, jurisdiction and facilities to carry out any research needed into methods other than natural family planning methods.  It was because there might be some doubt as to whether natural family planning could be described as medical research&mdash;some people might say it is not&mdash;that I deemed it prudent to put in this special provision governing the making available of funds for natural family planning research.  There is nothing more sinister in it than that.</P>
    <P>I reject the suggestion put forward that the Bill is being introduced to meet the political needs of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I should like to assure the House that that is not so.  As part of our election programme we undertook to legislate for this area.  In our election manifesto we undertook to seek the broadest spectrum of views to try to get the widest possible consensus and, on the basis of that consensus, to legislate. The argument that we have to legislate is unanswerable.  Whether or not we approach it from the point of view of the Supreme Court decision which has created a very unsatisfactory situation or whether we approach the issue from the point of view of the social needs of the community the case for some legislation by the Oireachtas is unanswerable.  I have no time for the people who put their heads in the sand and say that they do not want legislation under any circumstances. That is not a mature or responsible position to adopt.  The one argument I have no time at all for, one which is hideously self-denigatory, is the idea that by legislating for this we are making a laughing stock of ourselves in the eyes of the outside world.  The outside world has plenty of problems of its <Col N="1487" /> own and I do not believe for one moment that the people in France, Germany, Britain, America or anywhere else are watching Ireland day by day to see if by attempting to deal with our problems in our own way we are doing something which they regard as hilariously funny. Any sophisticated people in any country can look at particular things in other countries, their life styles, habits and attitudes and find them funny.  We should not pay the slightest attention to this argument that people outside this country are watching us and finding what we do amusing and, therefore, we should not attempt to deal with things as we see them in case we might attract some outside amusement.  Other countries have plenty of problems of their own and it takes them all their time to deal with them.  Our obligation is to look at our community, our beliefs, our traditions, our sense of values and try to deal with out problems in the light of our concepts.</P>

      <P>I do not exclude the Six Counties.  I probably know as much if not a great deal more, about the feeling of ordinary men and women in the Six Counties as Deputy Browne or any other Deputy in the House.  My roots are in the Six Counties.  At one time I had 52 first cousins living in the Six Counties.  I have a fair idea of what the ordinary men and women in the Six Counties believe in.  If it were left to them as ordinary residents of the Six Counties I believe that what is proposed in this Bill would be fairly acceptable to them.  Of course, they are not left to decide for themselves and have to accept what others ordain they should accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tried to deal with this problem as honestly as I can.  I knew I would attract a great deal of personal animosity and attack.  That is inevitible in the case of anybody who seeks to legislate in this sensitive, emotional area, this area in which so many different views are so passionately and sincerely held by so many people.  I have endeavoured to <Col N="1488" /> ascertain what is acceptable as reasonable to the overwhelming majority of the people in the country.  I believe I have succeeded in doing that.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with one argument which I omitted to deal with earlier on, that is the people who say: &ldquo;Forget about the McGee case, do not legislate; have a constitutional referendum.&rdquo;  That is an impossible proposition.  The people who put forward that proposition do not realise that the judgment in the McGee case flows straight from the family Articles in the Constitution.  The McGee court decision is based on the provisions which our Constitution makes for the family.  It is because of those family provisions that the Supreme Court decided that artificial contraceptives should be made reasonably available for the purpose of the family.  It is in line with that decision that the proposals I am putting before the House are framed in the way they are.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is any proposal that we could put to the people by a constitutional referendum which, if it were to meet the wishes of those who say we should not legislate, would not detract from the value of the family provisions in the Constitution.  I am leaving aside the question of whether or not any constitutional referendum along the lines those people suggest would be passed. I doubt that it would from my assessment of public opinion in this matter.  If we set out to frame a proposal for a constitutional referendum to put to the people to modify the family provisions of the Constitution I do not believe we could possibly do so without seriously detracting from the protection which those Articles of the Constitution afford to the family.  I do not believe that the people who have that outlook would really want to do that if they went into the matter carefully enough.  I believe that the suggestion that we could deal with this problem by way of some constitutional referendum is not a possibility.</P>
    <P>I believe, no matter how one examines this issue and goes into it from any point of view one likes and no matter where one starts, that, if one wants to deal with it in a responsible and mature way which <Col N="1489" /> meets the needs of the situation and at the same time does not offend the views of the overwhelming majority of the people in the country, then one comes up with some sort of proposals of the type we have here.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy Browne takes a very personal interest in those matters and that he would be totally dissatisfied with those proposals because he would wish to have a much more liberal approach and have artificial contraceptives universally available.  I ask him to accept that that is not acceptable, no matter how desirable he might think it might be. No matter how committed to that viewpoint he or any other Deputy in the House might be, that is not acceptable to the overwhelming majority of the people in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal to give the National Council for Educational Awards power not just to validate examinations but to actually set them is one of the most regressive aspects of the Bill.  From the Opposition benches I and other speakers have criticised the Bill for many reasons not least because it adopts a pathetically subservient attitude towards universities.  It appears, in relation to this function, as if this subservience to the whole idea of universities and the way they can and should organise their business is to be carried into concrete expression by giving the NCEA the right, whenever it sees fit, to set examinations for the awards it proposes to validate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment we are discussing is designed to strip the NCEA of this <Col N="1494" /> power as being unnecessary and irrelevant to the proper performance of its functions as conceived by the original Fianna Fáil administration, by the last administration and as is now conceived by me and no doubt by Deputy Edward Collins.  Instead of the NCEA validating properly organised courses in various institutions we are apparently to have a mini-university all of its own, something that once given power to set examinations would be sorely tempted to do so. Will we have the director of the NCEA going around in cap and bells to every third level institution where he is validating a course, like a minichancellor of a mini-university, handing out mini-degrees on behalf of the council because it not only validates the awards but sets the examinations on which they are based?  The decision to give the council these powers strikes at the heart of innovatory tendencies in higher education.  It is a slur on the competence, on the professionalism of teachers in many disciplines, in many institutions throughout the country and for that reason we feel bound to oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate my opposition to this power which the Minister is giving to the council, the power of setting examinations.  In amendment 15, in the rephrasing of subsection (2) the Minister retains for the council the right to set examinations.  I think this should be removed and I oppose the amendment on that ground.  I do not know if the council has been consulted on this matter.  I am not aware whether they are in favour themselves of setting examinations but it is quite clear from the history of the NCEA that they have not had the power to date, they have not used it to date and why they should suddenly be given the power now is very interesting.  I should like some reasoned argument from the Minister as to why he is suddenly giving the council power to set examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years the staff in these colleges and institutions have enjoyed developing the various courses, adopting an attitude of flexibility to the introduction of new courses, weighing up the success of existing courses, reducing <Col N="1495" /> certain courses which were seen not to be popular.  They have enjoyed this freedom and also the freedom of examining standards nationally and internationally. They have enjoyed the responsibility of asking external examiners to set examinations and establish standards acceptable to each college. That freedom has led to a healthy atmosphere within the colleges and institutions and a sense of involvement and <i>esprit de corps</i> among the staff.  I think they wish to guard their right to oversee as they think fit the direction in which the college is going.  This is freedom to set standards in a general way&mdash;not in any way contrary to the policy of the NCEA&mdash;in consultation, obviously, with the NCEA which has validated courses and examinations to date, but also in consultation with experts in the field from inside and outside Ireland.  If this is to be taken away from them we are doing irreparable damage to the standing of the staff in each college and to the concept of a flexible third level, non-university sector.  We would be doing a great disservice to the non-university sector if the Minister insists on pushing through this section and amendment.</P>
    <P>Courses, after all, will justify themselves in time on close examination of people involved in the industry.  If the standards set are too low the course will die and the college will suffer.  The courses that have high standards and their colleges will continue to prosper. That is as it should be because it means that the staffs, the lecturers, heads of Departments and principals particularly have the responsibility of the future of courses and their colleges in their own hands.  To take that away from them as is proposed by the Minister is doing a great disservice to the third level, non-university sector.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not in any political way but purely in the context of what is educationally sound and desirable to leave the principle of validation with the NCEA but to leave the setting of examinations to the various colleges as has been the practice to date.  I think the Minister should look at the matter in this way.  I <Col N="1496" /> am sure that if he consults the people in his Department they will have the opinion, based on their experience with the colleges and their success in their flexibility and in their devotion and in the pride they take in the development of their colleges, that the staffs would prefer to have the question of setting examinations left to them.  If the Minister is not prepared to change his attitude in this matter I shall bring this amendment to a division.</P>

      <P>Were the true position as interpreted by Deputies Horgan and Collins I, too, would be in total agreement with them but there is no suggestion of any change in the procedure that has been followed regarding examinations by the <i>ad hoc</i> National Council for Educational Awards.  It may be interesting for the House to hear what the present system is as operated by the <i>ad hoc</i> NCEA.  The council appoints and pays an external examiner for each approved subject of a course.  These external examiners visit the college during the course of the year to satisfy themselves on the progress of the course.  In particular, they must visit the college not later than six weeks after the commencement of the Hilary term, the second term of the academic year, to agree on the examination paper with the internal examiner, that is, the staff of the college.  That has been the system and will continue to be the system.  The paper, in the first instance, is drawn up by the college staff, as Deputy Collins said.  It is fairly usual for each teacher to make an input and provide one or two questions on this particular part of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is well known, there is no hard and fast rule about this: the people in charge of the course are the best judges and the freedom exists now and will continue to exist.  Some teachers may not make any contribution and the entire paper may be prepared, by agreement, by the head of the department or by a senior teacher of a particular course.  In any case the coordinator of the first draft is the head of the department and he will be responsible for agreement of the paper with the external examiner.  That has been the situation since the <i>ad hoc</i> council were <Col N="1497" /> set up and it will continue to be the procedure under the new arrangement. The external examiner goes through the paper then.  That, too, will continue to be the position.  He makes any change he considers necessary and may add a question or two himself, but it is he who finally settles the format.</P>
    <P>It is well to mention that on a few occasions it has happened that the council's external examiners had to set the entire paper and correct in full the examination papers.  This happened when staff in some area were not available to prepare the paper.  The council would regard having to write the examination papers only as a fall-back position.  The system that operates now is the one that will continue because it has been found to be satisfactory.  There is not any change envisaged.  All the benefits mentioned by Deputy Collins in regard to freedom of choice and to flexibility and so on are valid reasons and I assure him that healthy interest, that feeling of freedom and of innovative power remain even with the new amendment.  Damage, irreparable or otherwise, will not be caused by the acceptance of the section as suggested by me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is not any change envisaged what is the reason for inserting the words &ldquo;set by the council&rdquo;? Up to now the council have not been setting the papers.  An external examiner has been engaged for this purpose and he, in consultation with the colleges, sets the papers.  Therefore, we should not include the words &ldquo;or set by the council&rdquo;. They are offensive to many people working within the system.  Wording such as &ldquo;in consultation with the institution to which this Act applies&rdquo; is looser phraseology and this is what is called for.  A looser phraseology would be more acceptable to the lecturing staff in the colleges.  I am prepared to withdraw amendment No. 17 but reserve the right to resubmit it on Report Stage in order to ensure that it will be stated clearly that the council will not have the power to set examinations, because to provide for such power for them would enable the NCEA to take up that power fully. Despite the practice to date, despite the goodwill on the part of the Minister for <Col N="1498" /> on the part of the present director, or indeed despite the goodwill that the council may have, a future council might interpret the legislation in a totally different way.  It is stated clearly in subsection (2) of section 3 as it stands that the council have the power to set examinations; and we know from past experience in relation to other legislation that Acts are interpreted in terms of what they contain and not in terms of anything that might be said here.  It is not right to use the phraseology proposed by the Minister because the council should not have both the validating and the examination-setting functions.  It is defeating the objective of establishing a validating body to give that body also the power to set examinations.  Such a situation is unacceptable in principle.  To include this provision would be to give to the new council powers far in excess of what the Minister indicated is the position to date.  Therefore, I ask him to reconsider the amendment with a view to rephrasing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were two other points which I made before we adjourned on the last occasion but which may have escaped the Minister's memory.  But before reminding the Minister of those matters I wish to point to the fact that what we are discussing here is not merely a difference of interpretation but of fact.  I can appreciate the Minister's intention in trying to persuade the House that there is not involved any change in procedure as between the present <i>ad hoc</i> NCEA and the NCEA as they will operate if this amendment becomes the section.  It is ludicrous to hold that, because in certain circumstances in the past an external examiner had to set an entire paper and perhaps even correct all the examination papers, that is the same as the setting of an examination by the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the practice in higher education generally whereby all institutions employ external examiners.  I should not be surprised if there were occasions in the past when, for example, a similar situation occurred in the NUI and where for one reason or another an external examiner had to set an entire paper.  Let us take for example a situation <Col N="1499" /> in which an external examiner from the University of St. Andrews had to set, for some reason outside the control of the NUI, an entire paper in microbiology in UCD.  There is no pretence that the student going into the great hall in UCD as it was then would be sitting for an examination set by the University of St. Andrews.  The examination paper would go out under the rubric of the National University of Ireland, of the fundamental institution in which the student is studying. Therefore, we can delete the words &ldquo;set by the Council or&rdquo; without in any way interfering with the freedom of external examiners to do the work they have been doing extraordinarily in the past and which they may be called upon from time to time to do in the future.  It is not necessary to give the council the power to set examinations in order to give external examiners the right to do what the Minister has described them as doing.</P>
    <P>There are two other points in relation to the Minister's amendment which I mentioned beforehand.  The Minister did not mention them in his reply today and I would be grateful if he would give us the benefit of his thinking on them.  In section 15 (II) (B), there is a reference to &ldquo;other exercises which both so relate and for the time being stand so approved of,&rdquo;.  In relation to these other exercises, where are they to come from?  Are they to be specified by the council or are they to be specified by the institution?  At the very least there is a grevious lack of clarity in this subsection.</P>
    <P>The third point which I mentioned before we adjourned related to the research section of the Minister's amendment.  On my reading of the research section it seems that the council will have to corporately approve of every single research programme carried out by any individual in any third-level institution outside the universities.  This is centralism beyond the beyonds.  It is quite extraordinary and unnecessary that the council should be involved in individual programmes of study at the third-level research area.  I would argue that it points to the general unwisdom of having a Bill which is based on institutions <Col N="1500" /> as such rather than on courses as such.</P>
    <P>Where are these eponymous other exercises coming from?  Is the Minister really satisfied that the best way of organising higher education research outside the universities is to have each individual post-graduate student come to Dublin with his cap in his hand and his little satchel on his back to get the approval of the director and of the entire council of the NCEA?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reiterate what I said with regard to the method of examining.  When I outlined the present procedure in detail and the role of the external examiner acting as the council's agent, I thought that the Deputies would accept that the words set are easily intelligible within the context of that activity by the external examiner and that there was no cause for alarm.  If it were interpreted otherwise there would be legitimate cause for alarm.  The system obtaining will continue to obtain.  A change in the system is not envisaged. This simply indicates the extent of the council's interest to the external examiner.</P>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Horgan about section 15 (II) (B) referred to other exercises which are undertaken with a view to gaining an award from the council. The words are clear.  It seems that the candidate who is looking for the award will be more than willing to have exercises, whether in research or study, assessed by the council.  With regard to research, the same situation obtains.  If a candidate is doing research and wants an award he seeks approval from the council.  Deputy Horgan made a dramatic statement about the student coming cap in hand to Dublin with his little satchel and seeking in some humble way approval from the council.  It is quite normal in any context to submit whatever work has been done to the person who is assessing the results of research.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply to my last point, it is unclear from this section as it appears in the Minister's amendment who will actually be assessing the research done by <Col N="1501" /> the students themselves.  In relation to non-post-graduate work, to graduate and diploma work, it appears that, if we are to accept what the Minister has said, the assessment procedure will be carried out under the aegis of the individual insitution. It will be approved by the council.  There will be external examiners appointed and paid by the council.  Will the individual institution have any such function in relation to the research student or will the sum total of his work be totally assessable by the NCEA without intervening reference to the institution of which he is a student?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is better to put the thing in the context of, say, an institution. Take the NIHE in Limerick.  There is a student there who wants to do post-graduate research work.  He is operating in the institute; he has a tutor or adviser. The course which he is following for the award will be submitted in the normal way to the council.  I expect, as happens generally, that the council will choose somebody with expertise in that field. The work will be done in the institution and the council will assess it through their agents.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (2), to delete lines 33 to 47 and insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  recognise a degree, diploma, certificate or other educational award conferred, granted or given to persons who successfully complete such courses, if it is satisfied that the standard in general of both&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  a particular course of study or instruction conducted by, or provided under the supervision of, an institution to which this Act applies and relating to professional, scientific or vocational education (which course may be partly concerned with liberal arts), and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the examinations or other tests of knowledge or ability conducted in relation to such course. </P>
      <P>corresponds or is analogous to any relevant standards for the time being acceptable to the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> (c)  approve of such course of study or instruction, if it is satisfied that the standard in general of both&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  a particular course of study or instruction conducted by, or provided under the supervision of, an institution to which this Act applies and relating to professional scientific or vocational education (which course may be partly concerned with liberal arts), and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the examinations or other tests of knowledge or ability conducted in relation to such course. </P>
    <P>corresponds or is analogous to any relevant standards for the time being acceptable to the Council,&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 19 and 129 relate to the matter of standards.  There is a reference in section 3 (2) (b) to &ldquo;any relevant standards for the time being in force in universities&rdquo;.  That is unfortunate phraseology.  Many of the courses being established in colleges and institutions in the non-university sector have no parallel in universities in Ireland, though they may be found in some universities or institutes of higher education in, perhaps, England or America.  Most of the courses relate to technological professions and the comparability with standards in universities is out of place in this Bill.  I have tried to change the wording to read &ldquo;any relevant standards for the time being acceptable to the Council&rdquo;.  That would meet the position of the council, who have prime responsibility for setting standards and validating courses.  Their standards will prevail in the non-university sector.  In establishing such standards they may make reference to standards acceptable in industry or related professions and may, on occasion, make reference to comparability with standards in some universities where such courses are available.</P>
    <P>The words used in the Bill are too narrow for proper interpretation and I ask the Minister to be realistic about this. The words &ldquo;in force in universities&rdquo; are out of place in this Bill and in the context of the courses being established.  When <Col N="1504" /> one examines the many courses for which certificates or diplomas are awarded, one sees that there are no comparable standards in universities.  In many cases the standards are acceptable to an industry or a professional institute. We have no wish to bring everyone in the regional technical colleges up to a degree standard.  Certificates or diplomas are awarded at the end of 80 per cent of courses in these colleges and there are no comparable university courses in this country.  In the making of awards at the certificate and diploma level the comparison required in section 3 (2)  is ridiculous.  I will ask the Minister to explain how this comparability will be operated at certificate and diploma level.</P>
    <P>My amendment separates subsection (b) of section 3 (2) in order to make it clearer.  This was somewhat compressed in the Bill.  The first part of my amendment deals with the recognition of degrees, diplomas, certificates or other educational awards and the second part of the amendment allows the council to approve such courses of study.  This makes for clarity.  The words &ldquo;being acceptable to the Council&rdquo; are preferable and put the responsibility on the council to set their own standards.  It is important for all to see that the NCEA have their future in their own hands and that they cannot blame any other institution for the establishment of standards.  The validation of courses and the setting up of standards of academic excellence are the responsibility of the council.</P>
    <P>I referred on Second Stage to the danger that, because of the manner in which the Bill was being put forward, degrees awarded by the NCEA may be seen to be second-class awards.  This would be dreadful and it is not something which any of us would like to happen.  I am very conscious of the need to establish high standards and to ensure that they are acceptable not only for the Irish scene but also for people who may have to go abroad to obtain work.  It is very important that the awards made by the council are acceptable abroad.  International comparability is essential if the council are to prosper.</P>
    <P>In that context the research carried out by the institutions to which this Bill <Col N="1505" /> will refer must be given substantial funds to ensure that there will be ongoing research in all the colleges and institutions so that there will be no question of their academic standards falling.  I did not mean to refer to this aspect at this stage.  I do not wish to draw the wrath of the Ceann Comhairle because I can discuss it on another section.  I am just referring to the fact that there is a need for international standing for the awards, and there is a need to put the responsibility and the onus directly on the council for establishing and continuing the standards of the awards the council will make.</P>
    <P>For that reason it is wrong to import university standards.  There must be no way out.  The council may set their own standards having consulted standards perhaps in universities and among professional and semi-professional bodies.  Having consulted those other institutes the council must then carry their own can.  They must then establish their standards.  Only then will the responsibility be quite clearly seen by the public to be taken by the council.  The words I have used are quite clear, &ldquo;to any relevant standards for the time being acceptable to the council&rdquo;.  I do not mind the council consulting with universities, or whatever, but in the end the buck stops on the council's desk.  That should be clearly stated in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects of this situation which arise under the amendment.  The first is the problem itself and, secondly, the remedial action which ought to be taken to solve it.  The problem is that the gratuitous insertion of a specific reference to the universities flies in the face of everything the Minister is trying to do in this Bill.  It is almost a sleeveen attitude to the universities at a time when one should be insisting that, if technological education is to come in out of the cold, it comes in out of the cold on its own terms and by virtue of internationally accepted standards which are already widely recognised and accepted in technological education elsewhere, and in many places where they do not have to have specific reference to the university even though there may well be some degree of interpenetration <Col N="1506" /> of personnel at various levels.</P>
      <P>It is sad to have to relate that the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; itself is not in as common currency as might be supposed.  It does not mean the same thing all over the world.  It means something here and in Britain and in most of the Western European countries, but there are many countries in which the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; is not as hallowed and protected as it is here.  In part of the United States, for example, the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; is regarded with considerable suspicion as referring to the growth of degree mills and similar institutions.</P>
      <P>In countries where the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; does not mean what it means here, many people when they are looking for safeguards for standards look not to universities, as such, but to the many very high-powered institutions which are established and guaranteed and in which standards are organised and controlled by the State or by a body analagous to the NCEA.  There is absolutely no reason why we should (a) insert a specific reference to the universities in the Bill, and (b) why we should not look eleswhere for a model and look for another form of words which will give the council all the standing they need.</P>
      <P>The wording suggested by Deputy Collins is &ldquo;corresponds or is analagous to any relevant standards for the time being acceptable to the council&rdquo;.  My amendment No. 21 suggests standards &ldquo;nationally and internationally for the course of a similar nature&rdquo;.  As reference to amendment No. 130 will make clear, that is a typographical mistake.  It should read &ldquo;for a course of a similar nature&rdquo;. There is a third possibility which has not been suggested by way of amendment but which I would urge on the Minister as a positive option, that is, instead of talking about the universities, instead of talking about standards in the universities, instead of talking about standards for the time being acceptable to the council, instead perhaps of talking about standards nationally and internationally for a course of a similar nature, we should be talking about standards which correspond with or are analagous to any relevant standards for the time being in force in the discipline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1507" /> It seems to me, with the best will in the world towards Deputy Collins, that the formulation he has chosen, &ldquo;standards for the time being acceptable to the council&rdquo; may be open to the slight objection that it does not impose on the council reference to any outside standards at all.  I do not believe the council will be afraid in any degree of reference to outside standards, provided they are suitable outside standards.  These standards should either be as suggested in my amendment, those which are nationally and internationally recognised for courses of a similar nature, or those which are for the time being in force in the discipline concerned.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to guarantee strict equality of standards because examiners differ, students differ, institutions differ, functions of courses differ, and the economic and social circumstances of the countries in which they are operating differ as well.  Maybe the discipline should be the over-arching international umbrella to which the relevant standards should be referred.  I see the Minister's desire to use the universities in this way as a very short-sighted one, one which if it is passed, will be looked back on in a very short time indeed as a very quaint survival from the days in which we thought the universities&mdash;and they have done a lot for our country&mdash;were the be all and the end all of higher education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to spell out the thinking behind this terminology and it is better to begin by saying, in the manner of the mediaeval philosophers, what it is not.  What it is not is what the Deputies have come to the conclusion it is.  For example, it does not mean importing the university ethos into the technological sector.  It does not mean that the university thinking should influence the technological sector.  It does not mean that the material studied to get an award under the NCEA should be the type of material studied in a university, but it is important to state by way of analogy that the kind of standard required is the standard which in its own sphere of technology is the standard achieved in a different sphere and a different <Col N="1508" /> ethos by the university.  As Deputy Horgan has indicated, the university has been in the field in western Europe from the Middle Ages, in Boulogne, Paris and so on and, while having their ups and downs over the years, they are associated with certain standards of excellence.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of mentioning them in this context is precisely to indicate that what the council are claiming and what this House wants is something that is not a second-class standard, a second award, but is there on an equal basis with the standard of the university award.  It is very important to repeat that it does not mean importing a university ethos.  There are large technological sections even in our own universities.  It does not mean importing that ethos into the technological sector.  By anology it means a standard which is nationally and internationally recognised as one of excellence.</P>
      <P>Many universities outside this country&mdash;for example, the British technological universities&mdash;provide both degree courses and technological courses that are not provided in the universities here.  We are talking about a new council making awards in the educational sphere, a council whose awards will be nationally and internationally recognised in their own sphere, and taking account of their own ethos in the same way as are awards in the universities which have had hundreds of years of history behind them and which have already achieved something recognisable by way of standard in our cultural context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Horgan that some universities are not worthy of the name.  There are degree mills, as he called them, in some countries; but there is a general accepted meaning for university standards.  By analogy, and only by analogy, and without interference with the ethos, that is what we are aiming at for the awards of the NCEA.  Many of the colleges of advanced technology in Britain advanced into a degree-awarding position themselves and are called universities at present, but they are technological universities with their own ethos and awards standing equal to <Col N="1509" /> those of the old traditional universities.</P>
    <P>I am in general agreement with Deputy Collins and Deputy Horgan that if, for example, the use of the word could be interpreted in any way as indicating either a sleeven&mdash;that is a lovely word &mdash;or subservient attitude to universities, that would be a bad thing.  I do not think it is so interpreted.  It is there to indicate that we are in the awarding business on an equal footing with the universities. The charter for the corresponding council in Britain, the CNAA, provides that academic awards conferred by the CNAA are comparable to awards granted and conferred by universities in a country where some of the medieval foundations have lasted down to the present time and have established standards in the university sphere.  This did not damage in any way the new technological institutes.  It did not damage the awards made by the CNAA and it did not damage their standing in educational awarding.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;analogous&rdquo; has been mentioned and it is the Ceann Comhairle's contention that there are two separate spellings of the word in the Bill.  It may mean a drafting amendment.  It is rather peculiar and I wonder which one is right.  On page 3, line 46, it is spelt &ldquo;analogous&rdquo; while on page 9, line 34, it is spelt &ldquo;analogous&rdquo;.  Whether that is better I will leave the Minister to decide.</P>

      <P>We will call it a clerical error.  I am still not convinced by what the Minister has said in reference to the universities.  It is an unfortunate and unnecessary importation.  There will be certificate courses, especially technician courses, for which the NCEA will be making awards, and of course there will be no possible comparability with the courses in the universities.  There are no courses of comparison available in the universities.  Therefore, I do not know how we are going to have the comparison made.  It is an impossible comparison <Col N="1510" /> which has no relevance and therefore it is put back to its own devices, certainly on certificates and to some extent on diplomas.  In that context the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; is unnecessary, unfortunate and irrelevant.</P>
      <P>English law has no relevance to what we are doing here today.  I have no wish to follow the English model.  This is an Irish Bill to meet Irish circumstances. We ape British Bills too much in this House, and that is unfortunate.  I do not wish to say more, but I have on a number of occasions seen very technical Bills drafted here following on Bills drafted in England which have been from four to ten years old and when they were examined in the House they were found to be faulty.  Therefore, I have no wish to follow the English model.</P>
      <P>A more important point to bear in mind relates to the legal position.  The council are awarding degrees.  It is the council's function to award a degree, diploma or certificate to a person who has reached a certain standard of academic excellence.  Therefore it is the council which is setting and accepting the standard; it is the council's pride and legal responsibility to establish a standard. Some crackpot who has failed a final examination could very easily go into court and maintain that the standards set by the council were not in keeping with those in universities to which the council referred.  There could follow a silly legal battle, the only people making money being Junior and Senior Counsel and judges wasting court time on the ridiculous.  I am sure that is how it could end up.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is&mdash;and it is a legal point&mdash;that it is the council which make the awards on their own standards. That is the reason I used the words I did in my amendment.  If awards are made on that basis they cannot be contested in court.  The awards cannot be brought into disrepute and, if the standards are in disrepute, it is the council who will bear responsibility for bringing the courses into disrepute, when we will all see clearly where the liability and responsibility lies in relation to courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I think, agrees with me <Col N="1511" /> that it is very important that we ensure high standards.  I do not think the reference to the universities achieves that.  The council must be seen to be standing on their own feet.  It is for that reason I used the words I did and placed the primary responsibility for its own future on the council by actually naming them in relation to the making of awards.</P>
    <P>The other words &ldquo;nationally and internationally for the course of a similar nature&rdquo; used by Deputy Horgan are an alternative.  Deputy Horgan referred to my amendment and said he could see how it could be questioned.  I disagree with him there.  We should make it quite clear that the council who are making the awards should have the clear responsibility, that the awards they are making are acceptable to the council.  Therefore, it is on the council's head the responsibility lies in respect of the making of awards.  There can be no buck-passing, no statement in a possible press release to the effect: &ldquo;Oh, well, they were not really our standards; they were standards in force in the university at the time and it is the university's fault.&rdquo;  In relation to the setting of standards it can be nobody's fault except the council's.</P>
    <P>I mention in passing that there has been a question of the leaving certificate being called into question as a standard for university entrance in England.  That question has been raised, but I shall leave it at that.  I should not like to see awards made by the council meet a similar fate at home or abroad.  That would be an absolute disaster.  Unfortunately also&mdash;I have read on one or two occasions&mdash;of some degrees of our universities being questioned abroad.  If they are being questioned abroad and we allow the council freedom to use those standards, automatically we are allowing the council to accept standards which may not be acceptable abroad.  Surely that is not intended in this Bill?  Surely that is the last thing the Minister would like to see in relation to awards made by the council?  Let us put the responsibility where it properly lies&mdash;on the council&mdash;and let it be clearly seen to be on the council's head.</P>

      <P>I was intrigued to hear the Minister lean, not for any reasons of false chauvinism, on the British experience in support of the phraseology he has chosen for the section and which Deputy Collins wants to amend. Perhaps, unlike Deputy Collins and more like the Minister, I have no rooted objection to British legal formulations.  If they happen to have stood the test of time in that culture and are deemed suitable to ours, there is no particular reason we should not borrow when borrowing is legitimate.  In fact, one could argue that one of the strengths of Anglo-Irish culture and many aspects of Anglo-Irish life has been precisely that it has been the meeting of very strong historical, cultural and political forces which has created a fusion and a bond which is a very strong one.</P>
      <P>I was intrigued to hear the Minister call on the experience of the Council for National Academic Awards in support of his general thesis because I have here in my hand, as the late and unlamented Senator Joe McCarthy once said in a different context, the charter and statutes of the Council for National Academic Awards.  I have perused the charter and statutes in the last ten minutes with extreme care.  Nowhere in the charter and statutes of the CNAA do I find any formulation even distantly resembling the formulation in the section of this Bill Deputy Collins seeks to amend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three references to the universities on the first page of this document; none at all that I can see on the second and third pages.  The first reference is simply a reference to educational establishments other than universities.  The second reference is one to educational establishments other than universities.  The third reference is to an educational or research establishment other than a university.  There is absolutely no reference to university standards anywhere in the document at all. Deputy Collins may be disheartened to find that the English model which he has spurned in the last ten minutes is almost precisely the one which is in his amendment, because the operative section of the charter and statutes of the Council <Col N="1513" /> for National Academic Awards of the United Kingdom reads:</P>
    <P>3.  The Council shall have the following powers:</P>
    <P>(a)  To grant and confer Degrees, Diplomas, Certificates and other academic awards and distinctions to and on persons who shall have pursued courses of study approved by the Council at educational establishments other than Universities and shall have passed such examinations or other tests as may from time to time be required by the Council;</P>
    <P>Let us look at Deputy Collins's amendment:</P>
    <P>(i)  a particular course of study or instruction conducted by, or provided under the supervision of, an institution to which this Act applies and...</P>
    <P>and which are courses which for the time being stand approved of by the council. The wording is almost identical. Therefore Deputy Collins has some eating of words to do if he opposes the formulation of the Council for National Academic Awards.</P>

The reference to universities in this context, which we are now seeking to delete, is parochialism of the worst kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot but be horrified when I hear Deputy Horgan say that referring to universities in Western Europe was parochialism.  Salerno established for medicine, man's first need; Bologna for law; Paris for philosophy, and the Deputy thinks we are being parochial by referring to such universities. Go bhfóire Dia orainn.  Deputy Collins raised a point about the responsibility for standards.  I agree that the responsibility is on the council to see that the standards are high and are accepted nationally and internationally. The existing <i>ad hoc</i> council, and any future council, relying on this legislation will be fully conscious of its obligation in the maintenance of standards.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell Deputy Horgan that I made a passing reference to the CNAA.  The reference to the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; in the Bill stands on its own used in the analogous sense I have outlined to the House.  The reference I should like to give to the House&mdash;Deputy Horgan said he had perused the Charter and Statutes and could not find it&mdash;is in the Second Schedule 8 (5) (a) which states:</P>
      <P>Ensuring that the Degrees, Diplomas, Certificates and other academic awards and distinctions granted and conferred by the Council in the subjects signed to the Committee are comparable in standards to awards granted and conferred by Universities;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to make much of those words but I wanted to state that there was a reference in the Charter and Statutes setting up the sister council in Britain.  In general terms we have used the word purely because in a different ethos and in a different educational sector the word stands for something national and international.  It has stood thus for century after century.  There is no intention on the part of the Bill to import that particular geist or ethos into the technological sector; it is simply stating, for the benefit of the people involved in the sector, that their standards will be recognised nationally and internationally <Col N="1515" /> for their own virtues, their own strengths in the same way as over the years awards were recognised in the university sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been strengthened by the fact that the words used in the NCEA Bill were similar to those in my amendment.  That is fortuitous. I purposely did not read the NCEA Bill because I did not want it to be drawn into the British model.  If an RTC has a technical course available how can the NCEA refer to standards in the universities in relation to such courses when it is patently obvious that there is no comparable course in the university?  Leaving aside the relevance of the standard of degrees and the relevance of the standard in relation to certain diplomas for which there may be comparability within universities in Ireland or abroad and concerning ourselves with the bulk of the courses run by RTC's, the basic courses for which the NCEA was established in the first instance, there is no comparable course available in the universities.  How can one use the university model even in a general sense, when there is no comparable course in university?  That is a plain question and I would like a plain answer.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Collins understood my use of the word &ldquo;analogy&rdquo;.  It is as true to say philosophically that God is bad as that God is good and we only say that God is good by analogy.  To take his reference to the certificate courses and sub-degree courses, the standard of excellence required there is to be a nationally and internationally recognised one in the same way as the First Arts hurdle in the university is internationally recognised as a step along the road to the award of a degree in the university.  That is all it means; it does not mean that one influences the other in any way to their detriment.</P>

In that context, no matter what philosophical comparability the Minister would like to see in relation to the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; being applied to standards in relation to awards, the fact remains that it could be open to misinterpretation by some people if they feel aggrieved.  It was for a reason of clarity that I said I disliked the word &ldquo;university&rdquo;.  It is a most unfortunate and unwelcome use of the word.  Many people who are involved in the third level non-university sector have objection to the use of the word &ldquo;university&rdquo;.  It is unfortunate that it has been imported into the Bill.  It will lead to misunderstanding and may lead to legal cases in the future.  The Minister should change it and adopt Deputy Horgan's amendment or mine.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(ii)  assist the colleges and institutions to which this Act applies to enable them to co-ordinate&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to subsection (2) (d) and is an important amendment. Section 3 (2) (d) (ii) allows the council to &ldquo;co-ordinate or assist in co-ordinating in such manner as it considers appropriate, any two or more such courses of study or instruction conducted by, or provided under the supervision of, one or more institutions, to which this Act applies.&rdquo; My amendment defines that a little more by simply using the word &ldquo;assist&rdquo;.  The reason for this is that, since the establishment of the NCEA and the RTCs especially, they have been allowed to co-ordinate the development of courses <Col N="1518" /> within the colleges and institutions.  They have done their own business in relation to the courses they wish to see established in their colleges.  They sometimes like to see outside bodies bringing courses into their colleges.</P>
    <P>Waterford RTC run a course in accountancy which is recognised by the chartered institute.  This amendment would allow the colleges and institutions the right to continue to assess their needs in relation to courses.  I believe the council should not have full power in relation to the promotion of degrees, diplomas and certificates of educational awards conferred by colleges or institutions. This is an important shift of emphasis. At the moment the colleges make their own decisions, develop their own courses and know what direction their colleges are moving in.</P>
    <P>The objective of my amendment is to ensure the continuity of that academic freedom.  The Bill proposes&mdash;I find objection to this&mdash;to give the power to the council to co-ordinate those courses at their own behest.  That is a very obnoxious move by the Minister and will certainly not be welcome in the regional technical colleges in particular and perhaps also in the other colleges and institutions to which the Bill refers.</P>
    <P>It is the same thing as the examinations wording.  The Minister is giving to the council powers in a more absolute way than has been the practice to date.  I ask him to allow the academic and administrative freedom which the colleges have at the moment in relation to the development of their courses and departments. The colleges and institutions should be given power rather than giving to the council the overriding power to co-ordinate courses in any one or more of the colleges.  The wording of subsection (d) (ii) will be seen as a sinister move by the Minister to give the council excessive power in relation to the development of courses in the colleges.  That is the reason I put down this amendment.  I assure the Minister that if the present wording in the Bill stands it will create illwill especially in the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Second Stage <Col N="1519" /> of the Bill we rang the changes on the difference between words like &ldquo;plan&rdquo; and &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo;.  I, like Deputy Collins, am apprehensive about the use of the word &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo; in this particular context.  It seems to me that when used in this unadorned way it has a sense much stronger than the word normally has.  It implies that the NCEA will be able to co-ordinate regardless of the wishes of institutions instead of simply allowing itself to be the handmaiden of co-ordination within the sector generally. Perhaps when the Minister is replying to the amendment he can sketch out in some concrete way precisely how this co-ordination function will be achieved.</P>
      <P>It is almost analogous&mdash;to use the wording of the Bill&mdash;to a planning function, which I thought the Minister believed should not be exercised by the council as constituted under the Bill, if they are to be given the power to co-ordinate regardless of the wishes or the felt needs of particular institutions.  This is effectively a planning function which should be exercised somewhere else and, if it is not, it should be enough to leave in the power to assist in the co-ordination of courses.  In any event, we would be glad to hear from the Minister how this co-ordination function will be exercised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The function of co-ordination is an important one for the council to have.  Deputy E. Collins was concentrating on one institution&mdash;the one in which he has a direct and specific interest and which he helps to be the success they are.  As far as any other regional technical college is concerned, save Waterford, they have no other power.  They have power to organise their own courses and there is no intention that anybody should be given the power of interference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council of awards are there to assess courses submitted to them.  For example, let us take the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick or the National Institute for Higher Education in Dublin.  If the council did not have a co-ordinating function, they would not be in a position to validate a course in a regional technical college which would <Col N="1520" /> link into, fit and would not have a co-ordinate in a national institute for higher education.  The whole idea of the RTCs and the national institutes was that there would be mobility.  The council, in assessing courses for awards, should be in a position to facilitate mobility as between RTCs and the national institutes for higher education.  There is also the problem of the art courses.  I would envisage the council having a co-ordinating function and a role for the National College of Art.  &ldquo;Co-ordination&rdquo; means facilitating mobility of students as between one RTC and another or between an RTC and a national institute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make clear what I am saying.  The council must be seen to be working hand in hand with the colleges and institutions where they have an overseeing function.  It would be very wrong and a retrograde step to give the council overriding powers in relation to the development of courses in colleges. It will mean that the council will become the omnipotent masters of the development, or otherwise, of regional colleges or NIHEs or colleges of technology and that is wrong.  It is unwise, unnecessary and objectionable.</P>
      <P>There must be seen to be co-operation between the council and colleges.  There must be seen to be an open avenue of discussion available to colleges and institutions. There must be seen to be a certain amount of independence in relation to the development of courses or departments in colleges.  Section 3 (2) (d) (ii) does away with the happy medium.  I am looking for, that is, one in which there is a reasonable amount of academic and administrative freedom and autonomy within these colleges in relation to the development of courses, departments and staff and other ongoing resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill as it now stands, a college in the country may get a phone call from Dublin, that great place where people come to shop, telling them that their desire to develop a course in fishery science or in agricultural science has been looked at but that it might be put in another college somewhere else in the <Col N="1521" /> country.  That power lies only with the council, according to the first word of this subparagraph, which is &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo;. It does not say only assist in co-ordinating; it gives the council the power to co-ordinate in their own right, without reference to the governing body or the boards of management in the colleges concerned, to promote degrees and so on.  It is that to which I object.</P>
    <P>This is a major objection to this Bill because I have seen the genuine goodwill that exists in colleges in relation to the future of those colleges.  I am here to preserve, foster and harness that goodwill.  This is one of the aspects of this legislation which will damage that spirit in the colleges and to that extent it is an extremely retrogressive step.</P>
    <P>The wording I need is clear.  It says that the council, for the purpose of promoting degrees, diplomas, certificates and other educational awards conferred, granted or given by it, &ldquo;assist the colleges and institutions to which this Act applies to enable them to co-ordinate&rdquo;.  I am clearly putting the emphasis on the colleges, giving them the power to co-ordinate their own courses.  The principals, heads of departments and staff meet and they know what they want.  It is they who should have the prime responsibility of co-ordinating and developing courses and promoting degrees, diplomas and certificates within their colleges.  If that responsibility is given in a primary sense to the council substantial damage will be done to the college and to the standing of the staffs in the colleges, particularly the heads of departments, lecturers and principals. Damage will also be done to the functions of the boards of managements of the regional technical colleges or governors of other institutions.  That is most undesirable if we are thinking in terms of local involvement and interest in the development of courses and awards systems within colleges.  This is a serious matter and it is an amendment on which it is important enough to force a division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reiterate that a college cannot co-ordinate outside itself.  There is no function for the council <Col N="1522" /> in the whole field referred to by Deputy Collins.  Section 3 (2) (d) states:</P>
      <P>for the purpose of promoting degrees, diplomas, certificates or other educational awards conferred, granted or given by it&mdash;</P>
      <P>it can co-ordinate but only for that purpose. That is what is important.  It cannot interfere at all in the organisation of the RTC or the institute.  I submit that it is important that the council, which has the overview in the situation from assessing all over the country, should have the co-ordination power given to it by section 3 (2) (d) (ii).</P>
      <P>If a student gets an award in a regional technical college, say Waterford, and wants to go on for a third or fourth year to the NIHE Limerick, with the involvement of the NCEA, that student cannot be told: &ldquo;No, your course is not suitable for acceptance in NIHE Limerick&rdquo;, which also comes under the aegis of the NCEA as far as awards are concerned.  The council, having the overview, the assessment power, having seen the situation and having kept in mind that it is important that if the student wants to go up the ladder to degree level he is equipped to do so, should also have the co-ordination function.  This makes it much easier for the student and for the institution.  There is no interference with the academic freedom of the student.  A rational view is obtained by the council purely in the context of assessing for awards.</P>

      <P>The Minister is being naïve in the matter.  Obviously any decision by the council in relation to degrees, diplomas or awards will directly and immediately affect the decision of a management board of a college to develop or not to develop a course.  I do not want a red herring to be put up on this.  It is an important change of emphasis in relation to the present position regarding the promotion of degrees, diplomas and certificates.</P>

    <P>The principals and the heads of departments chat among themselves and with other college principals and heads of departments.  They see a way forward in a particular direction and are happy <Col N="1523" /> that it would be good for the college to go in that direction.  The system works and the colleges are being developed successfully. It should be left at that.  The council should only be allowed to assist the colleges and institutions to which this Bill applies to enable them to co-ordinate in a statutory manner rather than giving the council the overriding purpose of co-ordinating.</P>
    <P>The wording in the Bill indicates that the council may assist in co-ordinating as well.  The very fact that wording was used in conjunction with the word &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo; implies that there was a case to be put forward and that the council should assist in co-ordinating in certain circumstances.  What I am saying is that the council should assist in co-ordinating as a primary function.  To import the concept that the council should co-ordinate of itself without consultation and without necessarily discussing the matter with the college authorities or with the staff is anathema to me in the context of the section dealing with the regional technical colleges.  It would also apply to the colleges of technology although in Dublin they are under the umbrella of the City of Dublin VEC.</P>
    <P>The changing of emphasis and the giving to the council of the primary function of co-ordinating is wrong.  It is a backward step and will do damage.  I am convinced that the council should only assist the colleges in co-ordinating and the primary responsibility for co-ordinating degrees, diplomas and certificates lies with the colleges of technology and the RTCs.</P>

      <P>To repeat, section 3 (2) (d) (ii) simply relates to the functions of the council in promoting degrees, diplomas, certificates or other educational awards.  That is the context in which it must be taken.  I do not think that Deputy Collins has faced up to the difficulty of a regional technical college, say Waterford, wanting to co-ordinate a course with Limerick.  How can it do it? It simply gives the council a rational power.  Some cases have come to my attention where the lack of co-ordination has caused hardship to students.  If a student <Col N="1524" /> has completed a certificate under the aegis of the council, the council has the overview and has smoothed the path for that student into a national institute or into another regional technical college which may be taking the particular course to a higher level.  There is no interference with the academic or administrative freedom of the RTCs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (3), lines 14 and 15, to delete &ldquo;with the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service and&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;having consulted an tÚdarás&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, the object of this and related amendments is to remove the Minister for the Public Service from the scene altogether, putting it very simply and as something which I think the Minister would welcome, something which the Cabinet may have imposed on him rather than that he inserted it himself in the Bill.  We are establishing an academic council whose functions will be of an academic nature, whose independence will be important and whose freedom of action in relation to staff and to current and possibly capital expenditure must be protected.  It is very important that these functions are seen to be untramelled by civil servants and by a Minister.  I object strenuously to the importation of the requirement to have the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service into this Bill especially in reference to academic matters aside from any question of financial expenditure or matters of staffing and things like that.  Here we have the Minister for Education whose primary concern is with matters educational and who, according to this <Col N="1525" /> Bill, may not now assign to the council such functions relating to technical, industrial, scientific, technological or commercial education... as the Minister thinks fit.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous that if the Minister for Education wishes to assign a function, certainly an academic function to the council, he has to go through the procedure of getting the concurrence&mdash; not only consultation&mdash;of the Minister for the Public Service before he can give additional functions to the NCEA.  I understand that the Minister should consult with such other Ministers, if any, as the Minister considers to be concerned in regard to the granting of functions but I fail to understand why he must have the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service.  I am deeply suspicious and I advise the Minister to get rid of that gentleman from this Bill at least because I feel that in regard to the freedom the Minister for Education would like to have, not only relating to academic matters but also in relation to financial and staffing matters, the heavy hand of the Minister for the Public Service would become very evident when proposals were put to him.  Educationally, that would be very unsound, as the Minister well knows.  Apart from the inability of the Minister for the Public Service to prognosticate on inflation rates and growth rates, I imagine his capabilites in regard to the NCEA might be found wanting especially where the public purse is concerned.  The ghost of the Minister for the Public Service will be seen quite clearly and very often in the Bill.  He should not be there at all because he is a very bad ghost who will hinder the Minister for Education and hinder very substantially the development of the NCEA.  I suggest that he should be removed to some old ivory tower which might better suit him.</P>
    <P>The other matter related to my amendment is the introduction of an tÚdarás, a very interesting importation into the Bill.  It is referred to in paragraph (e) of subsection (2) of section 3.  The whole question of an tÚdarás is very important.  Why has the Minister brought it into this Bill&mdash;or indeed why has not an tÚdarás been given its proper role in this Bill under the 1971 Act?  It is <Col N="1526" /> of high importance that this matter be clarified here before we move further on this Bill.  In the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, an tÚdarás in addition to the specific functions given to it by that Act was assigned &ldquo;the general functions of (a) furthering the development of higher education...&rdquo;  That is a very important phrase and perhaps the Minister would discuss it a little more in the House, not necessarily on this amendment but perhaps on section 3 in its generality.  It is clear to me that the HEA has the primary function of developing higher education.  Yet, we have a Bill here dealing with higher education albeit not in the university sector but the non-university sector and the functions of an tÚdarás are not being recognised in the NCEA Bill except in a minor way in relation to grants.  I do not know if it is grants in relation to NCEA's administrative expenses or grants relating to the overall expenditure of the non-university sector&mdash;we shall come to it later.  We must clarify this matter because the Minister is all at sea. The HEA Bill is quite clear in its powers and the powers granted to the HEA have been ignored in this Bill.  The primary function of the HEA to further the development of higher education has been ignored in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In my amendment I provide that the Minister, having consulted an tÚdarás&mdash; which I think he would be obliged to do in regard to any matter affecting higher education; he may also consult other Ministers&mdash;may by order assign to the council other functions.  To me that would be a normal procedure in relation to the development of the NCEA.  But if that is the case also in regard to the primary function of the NCEA under section 3 in its totality, the absence of any part to play by the HEA is an extremely interesting omission and certainly needs explanation in this House.  I wonder if the HEA were consulted at all about the drafting of this Bill.  The quality of the drafting is so extraordinarily poor that I doubt that Mr. Seán O'Connor played any part in it at the drafting stage.  I think he would have produced a better drafted piece of legislation.  However, regarding the amendment, <Col N="1527" /> I ask the Minister to remove the bad ghost and explain a little more about the lack of functions of the HEA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>To take first the Deputy's point about the Minister for the Public Service, I do not think that the inclusion of that Minister will have any deleterious effect on the operation of the Bill or on the workings of the council. From my knowledge of him in relation to education I do not consider him to be a ghost who will shake his gory locks at me.</P>

      <P>Ghosts grow their own locks.  The Minister has been good to education.  The Deputy seems to be puzzled that an tÚdarás are mentioned in paragraph (e), subsection (2) of section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same section.  As the Deputy very pertintently remarked, an tÚdarás have a statutorily defined function in relation to third level education, a function which arises from the 1971 Act which set up an tÚdarás Um Ard-Oideachas.  That Act provides that an tÚdarás be consulted on any matter relating to their functions.  There is no need to gild the lily, to repeat and give powers in this Bill that an tÚdarás have already by reason of their special functions in relation to third level education. The 1971 Act makes clear the role and function of an tÚdarás.  This role is mentioned specifically in paragraph (e), subsection (2) of section 3 of this Bill. Therefore, there is no need for the importation of an tÚdarás to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot believe the Minister.  Here in section 3 we are establishing a wide spectrum of functions for the HEA without any consultation with the HEA being evident or considered desirable on the Minister's part. Yet, in relation to the continuation of courses being financed by the council <Col N="1528" /> through an tÚdarás all the council can do is to advise the Minister through an tÚdarás.  There is no reference in paragraph (e) to advising an tÚdarás or to the council advising the Minister directly.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the HEA have been left out of the Bill.  I do not see the functions of the HEA being incorporated in any way in this legislation except perhaps in a minor sense in paragraph (e) which conforms with paragraph (b) of section 3 of the HEA Act.  The question of a proper involvement for an tÚdarás has been ignored totally in this Bill.  That is unfortunate.  As I said on Second Stage we should be moving towards a unitary system of third level education.  The Minister agrees on that point.  Surely, then, he should be taking every opportunity to further the concept of unitary education in the long run at third level by allowing the HEA to play a greater role in the development of the non-university sector.</P>
      <P>I admit freely that the HEA are held in suspicion by many people in the non-university sector and that if that authority were to be given a full and proper part to play in the development of the non-university sector there might be a need to amend the Act in order to change the position of the authority. However, we could do that at a later stage without upsetting unduly the schedule of the Oireachtas but, accepting that the composition of the HEA Authority can be amended to bring into recognition the part being played by them in the non-university sector, there cannot be any objection to their playing a wider role than that envisaged for them in this Bill.  They are playing their part successfully in the university sector within the confines of the available moneys.  The knowledge that the authority have at their disposal and the wisdom they have accumulated should not be ignored but should be harnessed and used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit to the House that the Minister and the Department are fully conscious of the functions, the role and the power and indeed of the contributions of an tÚdarás.  As Deputy Collins mentioned, an tÚdarás are referred <Col N="1529" /> to in paragraph (e), subsection (2) of section 3.  They had the opportunity of reading this Bill before it was presented to the House.  The institute named in the Bill are funded through an tÚdarás and consequently they have some function in regard to the allocation of moneys for courses in those institutes.</P>
      <P>The regional technical colleges are not funded from an tÚdarás but I wonder if it is the view of Deputy Collins that an tÚdarás should fund these colleges.  Is this one of the areas where he thinks an tÚdarás should be operating?  This Bill is about a council for educational awards. In so far as an tÚdarás have a role with regard to the council, they are consulted as they are consulted about all problems that arise in the university sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage, at column 1211 of the Official Report of 14 February 1979 I said:</P>
      <P>The present system is fragmented, and the Minister has lost an opportunity to unify, even to some degree, the present position in relation to the Dublin colleges, the regional technical colleges, and the National Institute for Higher Education at Thomond College. The opportunity has been lost to create a unified system in relation to financing, staffing, and the utilisation of resources.  Why should the Department of Education finance regional technical colleges, Dublin VEC colleges and Thomond College while the HEA fund the NIHE in Limerick and the National College of Art and Design?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister challenges me to say whether I agree that the RTCs should be funded by an tÚdarás rather than by the Department.  Why is the Minister encouraging the present fragmented system of financing?  Why is he allowing the Department to subvent some colleges and institutions in the third-level sector and why are the HEA funding other colleges in the non-university third-level sector?  Does the Minister not feel that there is something askew in that sector in relation to finance?  Does he not agree that a more rational approach to the matter would be for all the colleges <Col N="1530" /> referred to in the Bill to be funded by either the HEA or the Department?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the Minister.  In certain circumstances it would be better for the RTCs to be funded by the HEA.  One of the circumstances would be a change in the composition of an tÚdarás, that it would be more representative of the non-university sector than at present.  If that were done there would be more confidence in an tÚdarás in relation to such matters as funding.  Is the Minister aware&mdash;and if he is not aware he should ask the civil servant sitting beside him&mdash;that the delay in appointing staff to RTCs is a disgrace to him and his Department?  Is he aware that there is great dissatisfaction about funding?</P>

      <P>If An tÚdarás had powers in relation to the colleges which he referred to a short while ago, would the Minister accept that there would be the same delay in making appointments and the same delay in making the initial funding allocation to the RTCs?  Is the Minister aware that the boards of management of many RTCs do not know where they stand in relation to the development of certain courses because they are not given their allocations in time to plan the academic year?  They cannot allocate staff and resources to <Col N="1531" /> areas in need of development because they do not know when they will get the money and because of delays in sanctioning the appointment of staff.  Is the Minister happy with that situation or would he prefer to have a more professional approach adopted?  I suggest that many people in the RTC sector would welcome a change in the method of financing assuming that certain conditions were met, such as changing the composition of the HEA, guaranteeing allocations in time for the academic year and a reduction in the delay in sanctioning staff.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1532" />&ldquo;(5) (a) Any degree, diploma, certificate or other educational award conferred, granted or given to or on a person by the body of persons which, immediately before the commencement of the Act, called itself the National Council for Educational Awards, shall, from such commencement be regarded as having been conferred, granted, or given by the Council.</P>
    <P>(b) Any course of study or instruction conducted by, or provided under the supervision of an institution to which this Act applies and which, immediately before the commencement of this Act, stood approved of by the body of persons referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall for the purposes of the Act be regarded as having been approved of by the Council immediately after the commencement of this Act.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the awards conferred by the <i>ad hoc</i> council be recognised by the council after the commencement of the Act.  This is the usual thing because it has been operating in an <i>ad hoc</i> capacity.  It is also the purpose of the amendment to ensure that any course of study or instruction which stood approved by the <i>ad hoc</i> council immediately before the commencement of the Act shall be regarded as having been approved by the council immediately after the commencement of the Act.  This amendment meets amendment No. 132 in the name of Deputy E. Collins.  Amendment No. 132 proposes that all awards made and acts done before the commencement of this Act, by the body of persons then calling itself the National Council for Educational Awards shall, on such commencement, be recognised by the council. My amendment provides for the recognition of awards given by the <i>ad hoc</i> body and section 13 protects the rights of staff.

      <P>The Minister subsequently put down an amendment which is broader but basically says the same thing.  I can accept amendment No. 28 because I feel it is necessary.  It would be quite ridiculous if acts carried out and awards conferred by the <i>ad hoc</i> council were not confirmed by the statutory council.  This omission from the Bill was a drafting error of major proportions.  As it stands, the Bill before us does not give protection to acts done and awards made by the <i>ad hoc</i> council.  This major drafting error reflects either the lack of thought put into the Bill or the dreadful work done by the parliamentary draftsman concerned.  There is a responsibility on the Government of the day and the Minister directly involved to see that whatever legislation comes before the House is sound and well thought out.  It is obvious from amendment No. 28 that this was not so.  The Bill was hastily or sloppily drafted.  If I withdraw amendment No. 132 at this time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we should discuss the generality of section 3 in detail, not only because of the number of amendments which have been put down but because the wording of section 3 has been found to be so objectionable, imprecise and faulty.  I cannot accept the section as it now stands and I will oppose it, not because I oppose the giving of functions, either specifically or generally, to the NCEA but because the granting of these functions is so badly worded in this section.  The intention of the section is diverted on a number of occasions because of the wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other parts of the section to which I have political objections, for example, the council being given certain <Col N="1535" /> powers in relation to the co-ordination of courses.  I object to the use of the word &ldquo;universities&rdquo;.  The importation of the concept of standards in universities, despite whatever philosophical importance they may have for the Minister, reduces the acceptability of the Bill to many people directly involved in the non-university sector.</P>
    <P>The position which the HEA should play and are not playing in this section leaves me to feel that the fragmentation of the third-level education system is to be positively encouraged.  That is an unfortunate move.  The Minister should have taken the opportunity in this Bill to move, as slowly as he likes, towards a unitary system at third level.  He has not seen fit to do so and has continued a policy of fragmentation.</P>
    <P>The wording of the Bill also omits reference to a number of areas of academic interest to which the council should address themselves more positively.  This is unfortunate.  In particular I refer to the omission of reference to apprenticeship courses.  We discussed that in detail and we are all satisfied that the academic content of apprenticeship courses is not to our satisfaction as educationalists.  The philosophy of AnCO in relation to apprenticeships is not sound educationally. It may be sound economically and from the point of view of industry but we have a higher priority and must ensure that young people pursuing apprenticeship courses are protected educationally and given the facility of continuing their education, which they will appreciate to a far greater extent later on in life if not in their teens.  It is for that reason that the inclusion of apprenticeship courses was important.  I very much regret its omission.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blaney received permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of alternative <Col N="1536" /> methods of distributing outstanding headage grant payments during the present postal dispute.  Deputy Blaney has not more than 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take very much less than 20 minutes.  The promise made that all outstanding payments would be completed before the end of March might have been fulfilled were it not for the unfortunate postal dispute.  Unfortunately that dispute is still with us and has been for a long time.  The number of payments still outstanding may seem small having regard to the total volume of the figures, but to each person who is still awaiting his few hundred pounds, or more as the case may be, this long delay is very important. This is particularly the case in regard to payments under the maximum of £400 to the smaller members of the farming community.  Although not very much spring work has been done because of the weather, nevertheless seeds, fertilisers, and so on, have to be purchased and those few pounds would be of exceptional use to the people who are awaiting these outstanding payments.</P>
      <P>We must presume that were it not for the postal dispute all these payments would have been made by the end of March.  I can only assume that the cheques or pay orders must be ready and waiting to be sent out as soon as there is clearance for posting.  Unfortunately we still do not know how long the delay may be.  Would it not be possible to send to each BTE office the appropriate headage payment grants outstanding in the area and put an advertisement in the papers for a day or two saying that those who have not yet received their payments should come and get them at the BTE office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is necessary and it should be done.  I do not think there is any reason why we should not do it.  I hope the Minister will consider that suggestion or any alternative suggestion.  The Minister and the Department may be able to devise a more useful or likely arrangement, or a more convenient arrangement for all concerned.  So long as it has the effect of distributing these grants to those who have not yet been paid, and <Col N="1537" /> so long as it is done quickly, I do not mind how it is done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Blaney and I greatly regret that farmers, in the west in particular, have to suffer as a result of the postal dispute in so far as they cannot get the headage grants to which they are entitled.  This is beyond the control of the Department and is deeply regretted.  It has not been feasible to post approved grant payments in the ordinary manner to participants in the cattle headage scheme, or to arrange delivery of payments to them since the postal difficulties began.  Such grants will, of course, be posted out when the postal difficulties have ended.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that it has been represented to the Department that non-payment of grants may be causing hardship in some cases, the Department have arranged that, where a participant in the scheme gives advance notice of not less than 24 hours to the headage scheme division of the Department at Setanta Centre&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that it has been represented to the Department that non-payment of grants may be causing hardship in some cases, the Department has arranged that, where a participant in the scheme gives advance notice of not less than 24 hours to the headage scheme division of the Department at Setanta Centre, that the participant will call in person to the office to collect the payment, or will provide a written authorisation to the Department to make the payment on his behalf to a named person who will call to the office, payment can be made.</P>
      <P>The Department must, of course, be fully satisfied as to the identity of the participant who calls to collect the payment or, in the case of a person who calls with an authorisation that the authorisation was, in fact, given by the participant.  These precautions are fundamental in the making of payments out of State funds.</P>

    <P>In reply to a previous similar question from Deputy Quinn, I pointed out that the question of the 5th EDF arises in the context of negotiations with the ACP countries towards a successor agreement to the Lomé Convention.  I said at the time that as the financial aspects of the negotiations were being left to a later stage, the Community had yet to formally consider the matter.  This is still the position and it would be premature and inappropriate for the Government to make public at this stage any position <Col N="1420" /> which Ireland will take in the European Community consideration of the question. Ireland will, of course, contribute actively to determining the appropriate volume of funds which the Community could contribute to co-operation with the ACP States under the new convention.  I do not consider it necessary that there should be consultation on this issue with voluntary and professional organisations involved in development co-operation such as those listed by the Deputies.  I will of course be very pleased to receive submissions from these or any other interested parties on this question.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office are at present carrying out an analysis of the redistributive effects of taxation and State benefits on household income.  The analysis is based on the results of the 1973 Household Budget Survey and it involves the use, at the individual household level, of the figures for direct taxation and direct benefits, such as social welfare receipts and scholarships, together with the estimation of the indirect tax content in household expenditure and the value of indirect benefits, such as health treatment and education, provided by the State.  The individual household results are being aggregated and classified in different ways&mdash;by income group, social group, household tenure and so on.  The resulting tables will show the effect of taxation and benefits on the direct income of households.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the results of the study will be published in the early autumn.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has received representations from dealers in secondhand television sets pointing out the disadvantage to them of the replacement of a VAT rate by an excise duty which makes their goods uncompetitive and if it is intended, in view of these representations, to go ahead with the proposal.</P>

      <P>The former non-deductible VAT charge of 30 per cent on television sets was replaced, with effect from 1 March 1979, by an excise duty designed to yield the same level of revenue.  The new duty is chargeable at specific rates which apply equally to new sets and imported used sets.  Consequently, whilst the price advantage enjoyed by cheap imported secondhand sets will not be upset, it can no longer be enhanced by a high <i>ad valorem</i> fiscal charge as happened under the former VAT system.</P>

      <P>Drainage works on the Kinnegad River would interfere with the public water supply for Kinnegad and are being deferred pending the outcome of negotiations between the Commissioners of Public Works and the Westmeath County Council in regard to alternative arrangements for the water supply.  It is hoped that the negotiations will be concluded and that the alternative water supply will be available in the near future, thus permitting resumption of drainage works on the river.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no global annual allocation of funds to firms in the Statesponsored sector under the Bilateral Aid Programme.  Rather is it the position that organisations in this sector are engaged, as appropriate, by my Department to execute specific projects within the programme.  The basis on which the organisations concerned agree to negotiate their involvement in the execution of a project is a matter for their boards and/or for their responsible Ministers.</P>
      <P>It is difficult also to be precise about the questions of costs raised in (iii) and (iv).  The costs shown below can be considered, however, to be almost the full cost of each project in 1978.  This does not, however, include the local back-up cost factor, which is normally met by our partner countries.  I would add also that some projects are integrated into larger national or international programmes, not funded by Ireland, details of the financing of which would not be readily available to me.</P>
      <P>On (vi), I give below the number of personnel employed on the ground in developing countries on each project by State-sponsored organisations in 1978. In addition, of course, officials of these organisations were assigned, as required, on a short-term basis to assist in the implementation of projects.  It would be extremely difficult and time-consuming, however, to quantify these short-term assignments.  In addition, given that the grades of staff involved, together with the duration of their involvement, varied considerably from project to project, this might not be a particularly meaningful exercise.</P>
      <P>With these qualifications, therefore, the answers to (a), (b), (i), (ii), (iii) and (vi) are given below.</P>
