That Counsel has himself been so personally embarrassed about what has happened that he has made a public statement to the FLAC people that their only alternative is to close down as the Government have not implemented the assurance he gave on the Government's behalf.

    <Title>Agriculture (An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta) Bill, 1978: Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&mdash;Section 12 of the Act of 1977 is hereby amended by the addition of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(3)  Courses or lectures to be provided in agriculture under subsection (1) of this section shall include, where appropriate, preventive veterinary medicine.&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta, which is the new body being set up under this Bill, will be concerned with education and advice for the farming community.  Under the operation of the county committees of agriculture, so far as educational advice was concerned, that was confined to agricultural subjects other than preventive veterinary medicine.  No veterinary surgeons are employed anywhere in the advisory services notwithstanding the fact that veterinary matters are of central importance to agriculture nowadays.  Yet the advisory services for farmers have not got a single veterinary surgeon on their staff in any county.  There is no statutory body charged with responsibility or having as one of its main responsibilities the giving of advice on veterinary matters. The situation is, obviously, that private veterinary surgeons may give advice. But that is not their primary function, which is to treat disease.  Indeed there is so much disease extent in the country that their time is taken up with curing existing illnesses, leaving them little or no time to devote to the educational function of giving farmers information on how to prevent disease.</P>
    <P>The only other people apart from the private veterinary surgeons who might be interested in this area are the district veterinary officers of the Department of Agriculture.  They have no educational role worth talking about because they are completely absorbed in the administrative details of the eradication schemes, in the enforcement of these schemes and, very often, in imposing penalties on farmers for breaches of the schemes.  People who are charged primarily with responsibility for administering a scheme and, in some cases, with penalising people who fail to comply with its provisions, are certainly not the people best suited to adopt an educational role in veterinary matters. They do not and will not have the trust of the people to whom they are giving advice if, having given their advice one day, the next day they have to come back and penalise those people in regard to some breach of the veterinary regulations. In fact, the district veterinary officers do not pretend to exercise any effective <Col N="1545" /> educational role.  In a case of a specific problem they may address a meeting of farmers but that would be a rare occasion.  They do not have an ongoing educational role.  There is no statutory body charged primarily with responsibility for imparting knowledge medicine.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture launch campaigns occasionally and advertise in the press in this regard but this is not adequate.  Many millions of pounds could be saved if farmers were given advice on how to prevent disease. One of the reasons for the prevalence of bovine TB and brucellosis is that farmers are not taking the proper precautions in relation to disinfection and the isolation of animals or in relation to animals bought into herds.  This situation stems from the lack of education in veterinary matters.  In each country the advisory service should have at least one veterinary surgeon whose responsibility would be to advise farmers on how to prevent disease.  Also, the general courses in agriculture&mdash;the 100-hour courses&mdash;should contain a substantial veterinary element as of right and be given by people who are part of the staff of the service.  There must be a missionary approach on the part of the Department to this whole area of the prevention of animal disease.  The approach of waiting for problems to arise and of then trying to employ a fire brigade operation is not the correct approach.  I have studied the situation in Northern Ireland.  There is an outward looking approach on the part of the veterinary service there where veterinary surgeons address meetings of farmers and call on farmers in an effort to put across positively the message of preventive medicine.  They do not adopt a wait-and-see approach and then endeavour, for instance, to impose penalties when something goes wrong.</P>
    <P>If this amendment is accepted and AnCOT are given responsibility for preventive as distinct from curative veterinary medicine, we would be going a long way towards remedying the situation of a real lack in our agricultural services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said during Committee Stage this amendment is unnecessary.  The desirability of the dissemination of instruction and advice in preventive medicine is beyound dispute.  I take issue with the Deputy's observations about alleged inactivity or inertia on the part of the Department in this regard especially so far as the past couple of years are concerned.  The efforts of the Department in a renewed and invigorated campaign are discernible to all and approved by all through this campaign means considerable expense for herd owners.</P>
      <P>There cannot be a sensible approach to general disease eradication without that approach having a large content of a prevention element.  Can the Deputy recall, for instance, the great deal of adverse publicity in the press that followed the announcement of the requirement in October last of a movement certificate? There were outcries then about the undoubted cost that would accrue to herd owners.  Though herd owners may grumble outwardly about this cost, they are co-operating because they know that it is necessary for the country generally in the long run and particularly for themselves.  They may expect from me a relentless pursuit of as near perfection as we can achieve in the matter of disease prevention and eradication.  I say this in order that there be removed any possible reflection on the Department or myself in the area of animal disease.  I shall refrain from engaging in slogans on the subject because it is too important for a political battlecry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree readily with much of what Deputy Bruton says.  There is a high incidence of disease that is unnecessary. Much of this disease could be either prevented or arrested by the dissemination of information and advice about animal hygiene but first let us bear in mind that the new comhairle will be absolutely free to make this advice available.  In pre-NAA and comhairle days individual committees saw fit to be instructed even in the days when the time of veterinary surgeons was less occupied than is the case now.  There is a certain degree of paradox in what the <Col N="1547" /> Deputy says in that on the one hand every veterinary surgeon is under pressure to meet his professional obligations while on the other hand there is an urgent need for professional advisers who are veterinary surgeons.  There is no question about their desirability and the question of their procurement will be one for the comhairle.  I approve of the idea but to amend the Bill as suggested would introduce an unnecessary direction to the incoming comhairle.  It will be for them to make available to herd owners and others the most desirable form of advice and instruction in matters of animal husbandry and agriculture generally.  It is logical and reasonable that there should be veterinary instruction in animal hygiene but it is not necessary to include a provision specifically to this effect in the Bill because such provision could be regarded as an intrusion on the duties that will devolve properly on the comhairle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider the amendment to be absolutely necessary and this is borne out by the fact that a veterinary surgeon is not employed by any of the county committees of agriculture.  When the new comhairle come into existence&mdash;hopefully in June or July of this year&mdash;and take over the existing staffs of the county committees of agriculture and the staff of the educational arm of the Department, there will not even then be a veterinary surgeon employed by the comhairle.  How could they be expected to dispense veterinary advice if they do not have even one vet on their staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not denied that.  The procurement of vets is not a problem because there are vets graduating from our veterinary colleges who are looking for jobs and who would be delighted to take jobs with the comhairle.  When the Minister was in Opposition he had a lot to say about jobs for graduates.  This is an opportunity to provide jobs for veterinary graduates in the comhairle, doing work where I believe the return for their salary would be far greater than almost anywhere else in the public service. The amount of money they would save to the Exchequer in compensation <Col N="1548" /> for reactors and in the general cost of disease eradication by dispensing preventive veterinary advice would be immense.</P>
    <P>The present system will not provide the advice because there are one-third as many vets per farmer in the private practice in the west as there are in the rest of the country.  Those vets have to deal with three times as many farmers as vets in private practice elsewhere.  There is too great a work load on private vets in the west to be able to dispense advice as well as dealing with disease.  The Minister seemed to question whether it was right for the House to give a direction to the comhairle with regard to what they should give priority to.  I consider it perfectly right for the House to do that because the comhairle are a statutory body being set up by this House.  The money for them will be voted in this House.  If we are not entitled to give them a direction nobody is entitled to do so.  There will be no shortage of advice to the comhairle from various sources outside the House.  I believe the best people to give them advice are Members of this House.  I believe this amendment should be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 15 of the Act of 1977 is hereby amended by the addition of the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(2) in the exercise of these functions the Authority shall devote special attention to farmers with smaller acreages and to farmers who are failing to a relatively large extent to realise the full economic potential of their land.&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to direct the comhairle to give special attention to farmers with smaller acreage and farmers who are failing to a large extent to realise the full economic potential of their land.  A large number of farmers at the moment are not achieving from their land what could be achieved.  There are <Col N="1549" /> great divergences among different types of farmers in different parts of the country in relation to the degree of achievement of the physical potential of their land.  Special attention should be given to the areas where potential is not being realised to the fullest extent. Special attention should also be given to small farmers.</P>
    <P>Members of the advisory service are likely to be tempted to concentrate their resources on larger and better placed farmers.  This temptation arises from two factors.  First of all, the farm modernisation scheme, as at present constituted, means that only farmers who are relativly well off and large can achieve what is described as development status. It is only if they achieve development status that the advisory service get involved in the detailed drawing up of development grants for their farms and it is also only where they get the higher rates of grant in the east of Ireland certainly. Small farmers who are not development farmers do not get those higher grants.</P>
    <P>The pressure of the EEC farm modernisation scheme is on the advisory service to concentrate their time on relatively larger farmers.  That factor could be remedied if the farm modernisation scheme was changed.  The Government included in their election manifesto a pledge that this would be done.  I know that this is an EEC scheme and that any changes must get EEC approval.  The Government are almost two years in office and so far we have not seen much progress in relation to changing the farm modernisation scheme.  I am optimistic that something will be done.  The fact that nothing has been done in relation to the farm modernisation scheme tends to push the advisory service to pay more attention to the relatively larger farmers as against the smaller ones.</P>
    <P>The second factor, which will not be so easily remedied, is that the larger farmers have the resources to invest and are more likely to be able to adopt new technologies, better able to take risks and have more resources with which to take them.  They are more likely to be in the forefront of technical innovation in agriculture.  Farmers who do that, <Col N="1550" /> whether they are large or small, are doing the nation a favour and should be given every encouragement.  The temptation will be for advisers to concentrate on farmers who are adopting the new technical methods because they are likely to learn more from them.  If they have the time to pass this knowledge on to the smaller farmers that is very good.  The danger is that those advisers will be so absorbed with administrative work on the farm modernisation scheme that they will not have the time to pass on what they have learned from the attention they are giving to the larger farms.  We cannot remedy the situation which arises from those two factors by any hard and fast rule telling advisers they must spend so many hours per week with a certain category of farmers.</P>
    <P>The amendment does not tie down the authority in relation to how they should exercise their functions.  It merely exhorts them generally to devote special attention to the smaller farmers.  I believe that a provision like this is necessary to counteract the in-built tendencies I have already described which are pushing advisers in the other direction.  The adoption of this amendment would not tie down the authority to any great extent. The amendment is so drawn that it merely exhorts them to move in a particular direction.  If the Minister looks at the terms of the amendment he will see that it does not tie them in a tight fashion but merely directs them in a particular way.  I hope he will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The exhortation in this amendment has been dinned into the heads of farmers who for decades have not been as ready seekers of advice as others from committees of agriculture.  I have known advisers who introduced themselves to farmers at creameries and inquired if they would be interested in having a chat about their farming operations. The quest after the less developed farmers is a continuous effort.  The amendment makes me think that Deputy Bruton would have the comhairle in the position of a back seat driver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of this Bill is to set up the comhairle and ask them, on behalf of <Col N="1551" /> the Minister for Agriculture, to direct and guide the course of Irish agricultural advice and training in the future. As I said at an earlier stage, that course of advisory and training work is in the process of continuous change.  There is continuous need for adaptation to the rapidly changing conditions that exist now.  There is a growing recognition of the needs for specialist advice.  Because individual groups are coming together to meet these specialist needs, it would be one of the main functions of this Bill to draw this area under the general tutelage of the comhairle.</P>
    <P>To start defining this by law is an unnecessary measure.  I acknowledge that, almost by definition, the people whose farms are not so well developed are obviously those who require most advice. There may be a great many human and social factors involved too and it will be for the comhairle to determine the approach to be adopted in this regard and, on the ground, for the individual committees to adopt a human and constructive role in their man-to-man relationship with individual farmers.</P>
    <P>The penetration achieved has been remarkable.  I believe that the alleged work load imposed on our advisory staff by the operation of the farm modernisation scheme is more mythical than real. How many Deputies have made an application for grant assistance under that scheme?  It is as simple as making an application to the old Department of Agriculture, possibly even simpler.  I have done a great number of jobs under that scheme and have never felt the need of an agriculture adviser to guide me nor can I imagine where the difficulty lies in cluttering up advisers with application forms and the consequent correspondence between the Department of Agriculture and the farmer.  This alleged immersion in paper of our agriculture advisers in my opinion does not happen. To define by law the statutory obligation on the comhairle and its officers and servants to pay particular attention to a specific class, has many undesirable aspects.  The worst one is that in my opinion it will intrude on the legitimate <Col N="1552" /> freedom of the comhairle when it is set up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with the Minister's reply.  Before the onset of the farm modernisation scheme it may have been possible for advisers to go out and look for business among the farmers who were not availing of the service&mdash;usually farmers who were not achieving the full potential of their land, particularly small farmers.  That may have been the case up to 1974 when the scheme was introduced, but it is not possible now because the advisers are heavily immersed in paperwork under that scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister said this alleged work load is more mythical than real.  I do not think he would get a single agricultural adviser to agree with him.  He made that statement before and I have had discussions with advisers since.  They are very strongly of the opinion that he is out of touch with the work they do.  When he made that statement originally, in an interview in <i>The Farmer's Journal</i>, he was new to office.  One might not have expected him to have been familiar with the work of the advisers under that scheme because it had not been in operation when he was Minister before.  It is inexcusable ignorance on his part to make that statement after two years in office.  This shows a culpable lack of knowledge of the working of the advisory service.  In making this statement the Minister has made a very incautious move which is in contradiction of the sentiments expressed in his party's manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seemed to imply that because he was able to fill up his forms for grants under the farm modernisation scheme relatively easily, the adviser's job was also relatively easy.  What he seems to forget is that it is simply not a question of the adviser checking the form&mdash;which would have been the case under the Department's old grant scheme where it was simply a question of a physical job being done and then the grant would be paid.  Under the farm modernisation scheme it is not necessary solely to check that the work is done and that it coincides with what is on the application form; now it is necessary that <Col N="1553" /> farmers be classified as to their income, that plans be drawn up and approved and that the Department of Agriculture, and ultimately the EEC, be satisfied that any farmer who is admitted to development status and receives a grant is capable of achieving a comparable income over a certain period.  This involves analysis of the farms, the stocking rate now and the stocking rate and income from the farm at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Neither the Minister nor the farmer had to concern himself directly with these matters when filling up a form previously.  Now when that is done the adviser's job is only starting.  He has to examine that information and see whether the Minister or any other farmer can be admitted to development status on the basis of the information about his income and the plan for the development of the farm.  This is a totally different operation from the one which the Minister or any other farmer has to undertake in merely filling up the form.  It is a completely new type of job.</P>
    <P>What the Minister said is in contradiction to something that was contained in his party's manifesto.  In that manifesto they undertook to simplify the farm modernisation scheme forms.  The Minister said he had filled up these forms and that they were simple.  If they were that simple why did his party's manifesto undertake to simplify them? Has that promise been fulfilled?  I do not believe it has.  It is easy to see now why it has not been fulfilled&mdash;the Minister does not think that the forms need to be simplified.  This must have slipped into the manifesto without his knowledge. The farmers were told that the Minister's party, on assuming office, would do something about what the Minister says in now a mythical problem.  There is an unusual contradiction between what the Minister is saying now and what his party said about the complication of the farm modernisation scheme when in Opposition.  I hope for the country's sake that they sort out whether or not the farm modernisation scheme needs to be simplified.  It does not do for the Minister to say that it does not need to be simplified having stated in the manifesto that it does.</P>

    <P>This amendment is a matter of concern not just in the case of this Bill but in any Bill establishing an independent or autonomous agency receiving public funds.  The amendment requires that the annual report and accounts of the agency in question must be lodged with this House within six months after the end of the year to which they apply.  If a private company receiving no public money fail to submit their accounts within 60 days after their annual general meeting they are liable to prosecution and fines up to £100 for the first offence under the Companies Act.  However, when it comes to companies in receipt of public money and established under statute there are no requirements as to when they may submit their accounts and many agencies have been extremely lax in their submission.  The Agricultural Institute in one year recently did not submit their accounts to the Dáil until 16 months after the end of the year.  If they were a private company they would have been prosecuted if the accounts were not submitted within 60 days.  They <Col N="1555" /> are receiving public money whereas the private company are not but merely enjoy the privilege of limited liability, a much lesser privilege than the receipt of substantial sums of public money.</P>
    <P>There are other bodies whose accounts have not been submitted to this House since 1972.  There is a group of bodies in receipt of £400 million from public assistance, namely the health boards, whose accounts have not been submitted to the House since 1972 or 1973.  The Minister for Agriculture is in no way responsible for this and perhaps the health boards are not responsible either.  The present or past Minister for Health may be responsible for the health boards' accounts not being submitted. They would be prosecuted if they were private companies.  I am not blaming the health boards but the fact is that the accounts have not been submitted.</P>
    <P>The only way in which any public bodies are directly accountable to this House is by means of the requirement that they must submit their accounts. They are not accountable directly by means of parliamentary question.  If we put down a parliamentary question about one of these agencies the Minister can say that he is sorry, he cannot answer the question because it is a matter for the internal operation of the agency.  If the reports and accounts are not submitted until a year, 16 months or, in the case of the body I mentioned, three or four years after the year to which they apply the agencies are not fulfilling the spirit of the requirement which exists in relation to the submission of accounts.</P>
    <P>The amendment I am proposing is reasonable and merely requires that the accounts must be submitted within six months, which is a reasonable length of time.  If people cannot get their accounts together within six months I do not know what kind of situation we are in.  A private company have to have them ready within 60 days and why should a public authority not be able to have them ready within six months?  My original amendment was for three months but in deference to the arguments put forward by the Minister about <Col N="1556" /> possible overcrowding in the office of Comptroller and Auditor General, and so on, I changed it.  I believe that most of the delays occur in the bodies themselves and not in the Comptroller and Auditor General's office but, even assuming that there are such delays, six months is a reasonable length of time.  If they cannot get their accounts to this House within that time we should ask questions about how they are conducting their business.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In making the arrangements for the annual report and accounts this Bill follows the pattern for all other similar semi-State organisations. When one contemplates the nature of the future organisation, consisting of 27 different county sub-units and the correlation of figures and data from all these sources, independently and separately, it is too restrictive to confine them and might well exceed the bounds of possibility to try to do so.</P>
      <P>It does not follow that there is an unfavourable comparison between private companies and bodies such as the comhairle. My understanding is that private companies present their accounts before audit.  Deputy Bruton's contribution seemed to imply that this was not the case.  He said there was some substantial ground for comparison between a private commercial company and a semi-State organisation such as this consisting of statutorily elected members in 27 counties with a controlling council at one controlling place which has yet to be determined.  It would be putting an undue strain on the comhairle which might not always be physically feasible.</P>
      <P>It is a bit unreasonable to go on to say and reason that because they are not doing this in the presentation of their annual accounts, because they are not confined to six months their whole practice and the execution of their duties in their expenditure of public money is open to question.  That is an unfair deduction: I do not think it possible to make that deduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am looking for no more and no less than the same set of rules that governs other similar semi-State bodies and I <Col N="1557" /> have not heard of any serious difficulties in any of them.  I am glad to say that most of them or all of them perform their duty to the country in a uniformly satisfactory way.  I am confident that the comhairle will do the same.  I would fear that the restriction Deputy Bruton contemplates would make for rushed work, work under pressure.  My attention has been drawn to the fact that a three months preparation and three months audit of accounts period allowed for in the Universities Act, 1908 was found in practice to be unworkable and was abandoned.  I would not propose in the taking of this amendment to expose the comhairle to the same hazard because it is quite unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister adduced two arguments against the amendment, first that the comhairle would have 27 subsidiaries and it would be very difficult for them to get all the information together in six months.  The second argument was that in the case of private companies their accounts have to be submitted before audit whereas in the case of a company such as this the accounts would not be submitted to this House until they were already audited. To deal with these two arguments, in the case of the first, I point out that the comhairle are not the only body with a number of subsidiaries.  I happen to know of one of our largest private companies, Cement-Roadstone Holdings, who have subsidiaries not just in every county&mdash;which they have&mdash;but all over the world they have interests in companies&mdash;in the Netherlands, in America and so on&mdash;and they are able to have their accounts with their shareholders and presumably lodged in the Companies Office within two months of the end of the year to which they apply.  I cannot see if Cement-Roadstone Holdings are able to do it&mdash;and they do not receive a significant amount of public funds&mdash;why a body who are to be exclusively funded by public money should not be able to do it within six months, three times as long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second argument adduced by the Minister related to the audit.  If the Minister is claiming that there is a big difference between State companies and <Col N="1558" /> non-State companies and that the fact that State companies, as I have already demonstrated, have submitted accounts, in the case of the Agricultural Institute as much as 16 months late, and in the case of other agencies of which I am aware as much as four or five years late, is because these have to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General&mdash;that would seem to be the implication, that that accounts for the delay&mdash;I think the Minister would be making an unfair reflection on the Comptroller and Auditor General.  To my knowledge, in the case of any questions I have put down about delays in the submission of accounts the length of time these accounts spent in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General was very small by comparison with the delay between the end of the year and their submission to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In many cases the Comptroller only has them for a month or two whereas they may have languished with the body concerned or with the Minister&mdash;who is to know?&mdash; for as much as ten or 12 months.  So, in my view then the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office is not the road block in regard to the failure of bodies of this sort to submit their accounts in time to this House.  The block exists in the bodies themselves because subsidiary bodies do not realise as fully as they should that their authority and ability to spend money derives from this House and from nowhere else, from the democratic decisions of this House which was elected by the people. Anybody spending public money must have it borne in on him that authority to spend that money derives from the Members of this House and if reports are required by this House in time they should be provided in time because these bodies would not exist but for the fact that this House by statute created them. In my view it is not acceptable that companies in receipt of substantial amounts of public money should be as late as I have said some of these bodies have been in the presentation of their accounts.</P>
    <P>The comhairle are not to blame because they have not existed up to now and perhaps they will be able to have <Col N="1559" /> their reports in within a month or two of the end of the year.  I hope this debate will draw attention and will also draw the attention of all other State bodies&mdash;there are about 60 of them at the last count to my knowledge&mdash;to the need to take account of the fact that their ultimate responsibility is to this House and if they are asked to submit accounts these should be submitted in time.  Submitting accounts 16 or 20 months old is useless; they might as well not be submitted.  These bodies must get the accounts in at most within six months.</P>
    <P>This amendment requires that they be submitted within six months and is an eminently reasonable amendment.  The Minister, as a Member of the House whose authority derives from the people, should be as much on my side on this issue as anybody because it is his authority as a Member of the House as much as the authority of any other Member that is being ignored by bodies which submit their accounts late.  It would assist the Minister in the supervision of these bodies in as far as he is responsible for them as Minister if a requirement such as this exists.  He would then have to get the accounts within four months if they were to be submitted here within six.  That would help him as well as the House in the exercise of supervision over bodies of this sort.  I hope that on reflection the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>This is very similar to amendment No.3 which relates to a six months period in which accounts must be submitted. Amendment No.4 relates to a fourmonth period in which reports must be submitted.  The difference is justified on the ground that, as the Minister said, accounts must be audited and so we are allowing two extra months for that to be done in amendment No.3 where the proposed period is six months.  We are asking that the report be submitted within four months to this House.  My arguments apply in this case as in the previous one.  Members of the House are entitled to get this information in time: the Minister is entitled to get the information in time.  If these requirements exist the Minister will have to get the reports quickly so that they can be submitted here.  The amendment should be accepted, just as the previous one should have been.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments put forward by Deputy Bruton in support of this amendment are similar to those in favour of the previous amendment.  I should like to remind the House that the assembly of a satisfactory annual report by a body such as this with a deadline of four months is undersirable.  It would necessarily introduce an ingredient of haste into its preparation and, if it did, it would introduce the necessary sloppiness that frequently goes with haste.  I would prefer that the annual report would come out in good time after full preparation.  I would not be happy if it came out a month or two earlier in a somewhat half-baked way.  I look forward with great expectation to annual reports from the comhairle because they may be of the greatest interest to the farming community and those involved in advising them.  I cannot perceived any reasons why the amendment should be adopted.  I am advised that Deputy Bruton's use in the amendment of the phrase &ldquo;the authority&rdquo; is incorrect.  That is irrelevant now because it is not my intention to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I accept that the amend <Col N="1561" /> ments are similar as far as our arguments are concerned, but the Minister has not made any case as to why the reports could not be made available earlier.  He has told us that it is undesirable that they be brought out in haste but he has not told us when we can expect such reports.  We are all aware that public bodies, particularly county councils, produce their audited accounts up to three years behind time.  That is a hopeless situation.  Deputy Bruton's request is reasonable.  The Minister should tell us when we can expect that the reports will be made available.  He has not specified any time.</P>

I regret the Minister has not accepted my argument but I have no doubt that in time he will.  Other Members will also see in time that, unless requirements such as this are inserted and unless we insist on this authority, we will rapidly become more irrelevant in a whole area of activity here.  We are failing to assert democratic control over a lot of matters where such control should exist.  This is but a small example where such failure may lead to laxity on the part of a body.  Most bodies are good and prompt in their submission of their reports but some are not and our failure to insist that standards should be the best from all is one we will regret.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 47, after &ldquo;active&rdquo; to insert:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;and with significant membership&rdquo;. The amendment concerns the nomination by the Minister of voluntary bodies concerned with farming who will have a number of seats on the new county committees of agriculture.  I welcome the fact that voluntary farming bodies will be entitled in law to seats on county committees of agriculture.  My amendment is not concerned with the principle of the issue, which is common cause among <Col N="1562" /> both sides of the House.  That matter was first given statutory form in the Act put through the House by the Minister's predecessor.  However, one problem occurs to me in relation to this.  The Minister will be asked to decide what organisations are strong in the different counties.  If four seats are to be allocated it will be the Minister's task to decide whether three of those seats should go to the IFA and one to the ICMSA or some other farming organisation or whether it should be two to the IFA and two to another farming organisation.  He will have to decide what body is important in the different counties.  That is giving the Minister considerable power to show favouritism to one organisation over another.  That is not an appropriate power for a Minister to have.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see this matter being dealt with objectively by an outside body who would assess which organisation is important in a county and allocate the seats and not by a political person such as the Minister.  I accept that a similar position existed in the other Bill but it was regrettable there also.  The section states that every person other than a person chosen by the council to be a member of a county committee of agriculture shall be appointed on the nomination of such voluntary rural organisations active in the county as the Minister may by order designate.  All that is necessary for the Minister to designate an organisation to have seats on a county committee is that they be active in a county.  Such an organisation, if they have organisers active in a county and a small membership, may be given a seat.  We propose that rural organisations active in a county and with a significant membership be given seats. That gets over the possible anomaly that the Minister might give seats to bodies which although they are active do not have a significant membership and requires the Minister to take account of membership.  It will require him not to give seats to organisations on the basis of who makes the most noise but on membership.  Putting such a requirement into the Bill would be a good move which would require that the Minister and his successors would act in an objective fashion.</P>

Deputy Bruton made an important point in relation to the allocation of seats on the board.  We all know that those who make the most noise are listened to.  A large number of rural organisations claim to represent the interests of the farming community and the recent statements on taxation and agriculture will lead to an increase in their number.</P>
      <P>So far we have only heard the Minister of State's views on this matter. We have not yet heard the Minister's views and I am certainly interested in hearing them.  I should like to know how the Minister will allocate the seats and to whom he intends to allocate them.  The Minister may say that this is not an important matter, that an order can be made after the elections, but I should like to have this information now.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to discuss the main defects in the section as it stands.  It is an unsatisfactory section in that the specific functions being given to the NCEA under subsection (1) have not been spelled out.  There may be difficulty in interpreting the section when the Bill becomes law.  That would be most unfortunate and a number of amendments have been put down by Deputy Horgan and myself clarifying the position.  My amendment No.9, which was not accepted and which I subsequently withdrew, would have clarified the situation substantially.  The absence of a reference to art and design was noted here and the Minister corrected that omission, but only after pressure had been put on him by Deputy Horgan and myself and people involved in the National College of Art and Design.  The Minister moved amendment No.11 to deal with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second major defect in the Bill relates to the area of apprenticeship training and teaching.  During his speech on 3 April the Minister mentioned that there was a responsibility on the Department of Education.  I am sorry that the responsibility which should belong to the NCEA in respect of the education of apprentices has not been enshrined in this Bill.  The Minister accepts that he has responsibility in relation to the educational content of apprenticeship courses and grave dissatisfaction has been expressed outside this House in relation to that educational content.  The Minister has the opportunity to rectify that defect and ensure that apprenticeship courses have the correct amount of educational input.  He could have <Col N="1566" /> done so by giving responsibility to the NCEA, where it properly lies.  They are the award-giving body in relation to certificates and diplomas and in the future I think it will be part of their function to give awards in relation to apprenticeships. AnCO should not duplicate the work of the NCEA and nobody has yet defined the position concerning awards to apprentices.  They are entitled to recognition for courses attended and work done.  There is no reason why masons or carpenters should not have an award system, just as people who are involved in the technical sector.</P>
    <P>Another omission relates to recurrent education in the absence of a statutory body to deal with adult education.  The Minister is probably aware that Fine Gael intend moving a Private Members' Bill in my name to set up a national council for adult education.  This is especially desirable in view of the complete disinterest of the Department in the field of adult education, which is deserving of development and commitment and should not merely be given the lipservice support we so often find in this House.  Until such time as a statutory body is established, reference in the NCEA Bill might be worthwhile and might complement the work of the statutory body on adult education which, hopefully, will come into being during the life of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>The next major defect in this section relates to the absence of reference to primary, higher and honorary degrees. The Minister has said this is covered in the wording of the section, but I feel the present wording may lead to court action in the future concerning the right of the council to award higher and honorary degrees.  No Member would like to see this happen.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the question of allowing the NCEA to set examinations. Tremendous exception has been taken to these powers being given to the council by people who are actively involved in the non-university sector. The NCEA should be seen to be a validating awards body and should not be given the power to interfere in a direct manner with the setting of examinations. The present system of employing externs <Col N="1567" /> and co-operating with colleges and institutions has worked satisfactorily and the colleges enjoy their own freedom in developing their own types of examinations and assessment systems.  That should be left as it is and the wording of the Bill is unfortunate in that it clearly states that the council can set examinations. This will do substantial damage to the staff in colleges.  They would prefer greater freedom in relation to this aspect of their work.</P>
    <P>The next major defect in the section relates to the co-ordination function in regard to degrees, diplomas and certificates. The council can themselves coordinate this function.  My opinion is that they should assist the colleges in coordinating their own development of courses and awards.  Serious damage is being done to the successful working of the colleges by putting in the heavy hand in this section and giving inordinate powers to the council in relation to the setting of examinations and in relation to the co-ordination of the courses within the colleges.  That is most unfortunate and most unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Again, on the question of examination standards and standards to be used as a guideline, the wording here has been unfortunate. The submissions I have received were unanimous in condemning the importation into the Bill of the wording &ldquo;standards for the time being in force in universities&rdquo;.  As I stated last night in relation to certificates and diplomas, there may be no comparability available. There may be no comparable courses offered in universities.  Whatever philosophic input the Minister would like to see in the Bill, the bare bones of the matter are, of course, that there may not be comparable courses available.  That phrase should be withdrawn, or should be amended, and either Deputy Horgan's amendment which uses the words &ldquo;nationally and internationally&rdquo;, or my own amendment which refers to &ldquo;relevant standards for the time being acceptable to the Council&rdquo;, would meet the situation adequately.  It is most unfortunate that the Minister has imported this phrase into the Bill, and perhaps he <Col N="1568" /> would consider withdrawing it on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Subsection 2(e) relates to the functions of An tÚdarás, the Higher Education Authority.  I am not satisfied that, in drafting this Bill, proper and full account has been taken of the role which the HEA were statutorily instructed to play in higher education.  The Minister said last night that the HEA were allowed to see the draft heads of the Bill.  I do not know if that means they were invited to have an input into the Bill, or whether they were merely shown it and not given the opportunity of amending it or of having an input into it.  Certainly I am not satisfied the Minister is going in the right direction here.  He will be seen to be continuing to favour a fragmented system of third-level education.  This is the most unfortunate and retrograde step taken in this Bill.  The move by the Minister to encourage fragmentation at third level is to be condemned and certainly I condemn it.</P>
    <P>This section is badly phrased and lacks clarity.  The omissions are glaring and the powers and the functions being given to the council are inordinate and overpowering <i>vis-à-vis</i> what one would consider to be a proper balance of power which the colleges should enjoy.  There should be a balance of power; there should be an openness between the colleges and the council.  This has not been achieved in this section.  It is an unfortunate backward move in the context of the non-university sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the core sections of the Bill we are discussing.  It is interesting to note that, not only has it been subjected to considerable critique and attempted amendment from this side of the House, but the Minister himself has brought in a number of not insignificant amendments to the section in the course of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all fairness to the Minister, it must be agreed that he was probably a loser either way.  If he had waited any longer to have the Bill more suitable to his own way of thinking before he brought it into the House, he would have been subject to further abuse from this side of the House for having delayed it longer, <Col N="1569" /> whereas by having to import his own amendments at this stage, he shows that the first thoughts presented to us were not necessarily the best thoughts.</P>
    <P>I want to make two points of detail and two points of fundamental principle in relation to this section.  The first is on subsection (2) (e).  This subsection which we are now discussing for the first time, as it were&mdash;it was not the subject of any amendment earlier on in the proceedings&mdash;gives the council the function, through An tÚdarás, of advising the Minister in relation to certain matters. The matters on which An tÚdarás are to be able to advise the Minister include &ldquo;the cost of providing, or continuing to provide, or the financing of any course of study or instruction approved of by the Council&rdquo;.  I feel very strongly that that phrase should not be there. While it is arguable that the council should have the function of advising the Minister in relation to &ldquo;the cost of modifying any course of study or instruction to the extent necessary to secure its approval by the Council&rdquo;, which is also in the subsection, the base line costing and financing of courses are not matters which are appropriate to an academic awards body.</P>
    <P>This is, fundamentally, an academic awards body, not a planning body.  The costing function which is envisaged in this subsection is, effectively, a planning function.  I do not feel it is either necessary or desirable that it should be added to the council's already substantial responsibilities in the field of higher education.  If the council are to do their job properly in relation to the academic side of their work, they will have their work cut out for them.  It is quite unnecessary that they should be asked to advise in these wider areas as well.</P>
    <P>The second point of detail refers to our old friends, the universities.  While it is true, as the Minister said, that there is a reference in the CNAA Charter of Statutes to standards obtaining in universities, it is also true that in the CNAA statutes to which he referred, this particular obligation is laid not on the council as such, but on committees of the council, and committees of the CNAA fulfil much the same purpose, I <Col N="1570" /> should imagine, as the boards of studies are intended to do under this legislation. I still hold, to some extent, to my original criticism that, if only for reasons of tidiness, the council, as a structure, is something into which the universities, as such, need not have been imported in this context.</P>
    <P>The first of the two more fundamental issues I want to raise in relation to this section is that it repeats and intensifies what I believe to be a basic error in the approach by the Government to this question, that is, it focuses on the question of institutions rather than on the question of courses.  Ultimately, what it will be doing is validating courses, but we have not had any really clear explanation of why one has to interpose the institutions as recognised or designated institutions, entities, between the courses and the council.  The institutions will exist in any case.  The courses will be presented to the council in any case.  Ultimately it is the courses, rather than the institutions, which the NCEA will be validating.  They do not validate an institution or a college.  They validate a course and the standards of that course.  The institution concerned is responsible for the standards of that course but there seems to be no reason why the institution as such should be imported into the Bill.  Not only does it seem not necessary to import institutions into the Bill, but the very fact of importing them gives rise to considerable anomalous complications, some of which we have tried to remedy in this section, particularly in relation to the liberal arts position.  I will come back to that.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give the House some idea of his thinking as to the responsibility of the NCEA as they would exist under this section in relation to courses which may be presented to them for approval or disapproval.  The reason I ask is that there was a case in the not too distant past&mdash;I hope the Minister will correct me if I am under a misapprehension&mdash;in which an institution, a regional technical college, presented to the NCEA a course, in applied chemistry I think, for validation. They were told by the NCEA that the <Col N="1571" /> NCEA did not have the resources to validate such a course and they were advised by the NCEA to apply for validation to the City and Guilds.  What is the point of having the National Council for Educational Awards, if they not only do not have resources to validate courses presented to them but go further and advise the institution in question to present their course for validation to a non-Irish validating body?  This piece of foolishness&mdash;I would not dignify it by any other name&mdash;was eventually cleared up.  The institution concerned rejected the NCEA's advice and the NCEA subsequently had second thoughts, but that it should have happened in the first place is bad.</P>
    <P>We must have an assurance that the NCEA will have all the resources necessary to carry out the task and that they will not, simply by virtue of shortage of resources, ask any institution to submit courses to non-Irish validating institutions. I would be interested to know whether there will be any need, after the passage of this Bill, for any Irish institution to acquire validation from any non-Irish institution rather than from the NCEA.  I appreciate that there will be situations in which an Irish institution could seek validation from both the NCEA and a non-Irish institution, and it would be within the rights of any institution so to seek.  If the NCEA are to be what they are or are to operate under this section, they should be capable, at least technically, of validating every non-university award regardless of whether the institution themselves choose to add to the number of scalps on their belt by going to another validating institution outside or inside the country.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the problem caused by the interposition of the institutions between the course and the council. During the earlier discussion on this section the question of liberal education was brought up.  We will have to amend this section to disjoin liberal education from technological education precisely because the Bill was drafted in a way that is based fundamentally on institutions. If we had not made that amendment it would be impossible for the <Col N="1572" /> NCEA to validate any award in a college or institution which could not have a technological component or because of the lack of a technological component. The case which was brought up was the question of the Irish School of Ecumenics at Milltown which was already validated in respect of at least one course by the NCEA.  When we were making that amendment in order to make it possible for the council to validate awards in non-technological institutions, which was a positive thing, we were also creating some kind of potential problem at least.  The potential problem which we were creating is in regard to the relationship that should exist between liberal and technological education within institutions which are largely devoted to technology.  In this context the original phrasing of the section was preferable because it implied that there was not only a possible but a very proper relationship between liberal and technological education within the same institution.  Over the past ten or 15 years in this country and for a longer period in other countries, there has been a substantial growth in technological education. While that growth in technological education has contributed to economic growth and perhaps even to employment in certain areas, it has very often been unaccompanied by any degree of reflection or analysis such as liberal education can provide for the purposes and uses of technology.  At certain levels one could argue that by expanding technological education as all modern States have done, there has been very substantial ongoing and continuing subsidy by the State to the private sector of employment and therefore indirectly to the profits which are generated in that sector. It is because that sector is permanently under criticism that any State investment or State subsidy to that sector&mdash;as, for example, in the area of higher education&mdash;should be accompanied by fundamental and, if necessary, radical critiques of the way the whole system is run.  Technical education divorced from values and from judgments about the kind of technology that we have, about the use to which it is put and about the further role of technology in our society is an emasculated education <Col N="1573" /> which ultimately will create only further social and economic problems in the guise of providing short-term solutions to problems of trade.</P>
    <P>In conclusion on this section, I urge the Minister to bear this in mind and to reflect between now and Report Stage on the possible negative side effects that we have engendered by divorcing, at least in verbal terms, liberal and technological education as we have done during discussion on this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the main points that were made in the general treatment of section 3.  They were really by way of summary of points already made by Deputy Collins, and Deputy Horgan has added a couple of other points on parts of section 3 which did not come up for discussion by way of amendment.  The freedom enjoyed by the colleges now dealing with the National Council for Educational Awards, the <i>ad hoc</i> body which this statutory body will replace, will be in no way impaired by the provisions of this Bill.  The freedom and input into the examinations system which they have now will continue.  The role of the external examiner was outlined by me yesterday, and it is in that context that we are to understand what we have in the section with regard to standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have been complaining about the importation of the word &ldquo;university&rdquo;.  I spoke at length on this yesterday, and indeed in discussions outside the House with interested parties, and explained that the word was used by way of analogy, and that it did not indicate that there would be any importation of ethos, but simply that we would see to it that within their own sphere the National Council for Educational Awards would be giving awards which would claim in the nation and outside the kind of recognition in a different sphere which the university awards have.  In relation to co-ordination, a governing body of any college cannot co-ordinate outside their own walls.  It may be a way of having agreement and discussion with another institution and reaching a co-ordination of courses, but the council has the over view.  The council <Col N="1574" /> can ensure that through co-ordination a student will have greater freedom for developing his or her discipline by being assured that, having finished in one RTC, there is a place into which he or she fits in a higher institution or in an institution to which he or she can make a sideways transfer.  An tÚdarás have their own statutorily defined role in third-level education.  I and my Department are aware of this and we are also aware of the expertise and experience of An tÚdarás, apart altogether from the statutory obligation of consulting them in this field.  There has been and will be no neglect of An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan referred to section 3 (2)(e).  I will just give an example of where the council through An tÚdarás, both having a role in the matter, might require the provisions of section 3 (2) (e). If the council decided through their relevant committee and or external examiner that an extra term was needed in a certain course there would be a role there both for the council and An tÚdarás because there would be implications for costings&mdash;&ldquo;In relation to the cost of providing or continuing to provide...&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that not be &ldquo;modifying&rdquo;, which I agree could be left in?  The latter part of the subsection &ldquo;cost of modifying&rdquo; is all right, but &ldquo;the cost of providing or continuing to provide&rdquo; is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In modifying one is actually providing and continuing to provide.  They are not mutually exclusive in this instance.</P>
      <P>On the more general point made by Deputy Collins, the Deputy went into hyperbole.  He talked about this being a &ldquo;most unfortunate and retrograde step&rdquo; and talked about fragmentation and so on because of the system he alleged I am responsible for.  I know that Deputy Collines does not fully believe what he said because he is on record as saying in the House&mdash;Official Report, volume 310, of 30 November 1978&mdash;that:</P>
      <P>There are aspects of that system which are good and aspects which are favourable, there are some with which I would not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> The Deputy goes on to say that;</P>
    <P>There are also aspects of a comprehensive approach to third-level education which have good facets and bad facets.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the Deputy let his words run away with him in relation to the &ldquo;most unfortunate and retrograde step&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan referred to the controversy about the merits of binary and comprehensive third-level education.  It is foolish to take hardened positions on this.  For example, I would see Limerick&mdash;Thomond College, the NIHE Limerick and the training colleges&mdash;developing into a technological university by the end of the century.  I would favour allowing new institutions to develop their own muscle and gain their place, settle down and specialise.  Hardened positions should not be taken in the educational world.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan also referred to the amendments I brought in.  In a democracy surely this is the whole purpose. One listens to the people with the expertise, one is sensitive to the suggestions and, in consultation with the experts in a Department, one produces the best possible Bill.  One listens to the Opposition speakers, to the organisations involved and then comes up with the best possible Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan went on to refer to the fact of the Bill focussing on institutions as being a basic error.  The Bill is a Bill for educational awards; that is self-evident from the name of the Bill which is concerned with the making of awards. Only in so far as institutions apply to the council for validation assessment and the making of awards, are institutions concerned in it.  The point the Deputy made about the applied chemistry is totally new to me.  I did not know anything about it.  The Deputy started off very dramatically with it and then went on to tell us that the whole problem had been solved anyway.</P>

      <P>I find the suggestion <Col N="1576" /> coming from the NCEA that the school or college should go the City and Guilds a very odd one indeed.  I am not aware of the case the Deputy referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the RTC in the Deputy's native town was able to solve their problems without pestering me with it.</P>
      <P>The final point made by Deputy Horgan was with regard to liberal education.  I am glad he is pleased with my amendment to the section.  I agree fully with his point about the importance of the liberal arts input.  Of course there is a danger, of which I am sure the Deputy is aware.  We did not want colleges that were designed as technological colleges to take off as liberal arts colleges. I want to emphasise that there is that danger.  The thinking behind the NCEA, the establishment of the RTCs and the institutes was to emphasise technological education and to make provision for it, and we must keep that firmly in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relationship between the liberal arts content and the technological content in institutions which will apply to the NCEA for awards is very important, and I think Deputy Horgan touched on something very fundamental.  It was the intention of the Government when establishing the technological colleges that there should be a liberal arts content in the curriculum and I agree with the Deputy that there is a lack of balance where this is not the case.  For example the MIT always prides itself that it is one of the great technological institutes in the world but that its liberal arts section is very strong.  As Deputy Horgan said, the kind of reflection and analysis that are predicated of the liberal arts education are important in that context.  A business studies publication under the auspices of the NCEA pointed out the dangers of over-specialisation in business education, strangely enough as exemplified in Western Germany where concentration was on business education only to the neglect of the liberal arts element. The result was that when methods <Col N="1577" /> and technology changed, the people who were involved and who had got the narrow education were found wanting and they found it very difficult to re-educate themselves.  For that reason I agree with Deputy Horgan that it is very important to have a liberal input.  The divorce of liberal arts from technology is something over which I should not like to preside.  It is not the intention of the Department or of the Government and it is not my intention that there should be such a divorce because even from the point of view of having effective technology it would be a mistake.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Deputies for their contributions on the section.  I think the section is a flag under which the NCEA can sail very effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister accused me of indulging in hyperbole.  I regret the implication.  Of course he quoted me out of context in the debate as contained in Volume 310 of the Official Report of 30 November 1978 in that in that debate I said there were advantages and disadvantages in the binary system and in the comprehensive system.  Of course I said that.  I would be rather stupid if I did not say that either system had advantages and disadvantages.  I was putting forward a reasoned argument and I cannot understand why the Minister accused me of indulging in hyperbole today when I said that the promotion of a fragmented system in which the Minister is now involved is retrogressive.</P>
      <P>To clarify the position for the Minister I should like to quote from the Official Report of 14 November 1979.  Soon we will need an index of the various days on which we discussed this Bill.  I made it quite clear it was my opinion that the binary system is unfortunate.  At column 1210 I said:</P>
      <P>Basically, this Bill is promoting a binary system at third level and promoting a fragmented system.  This is unfortunate.  I believe in the comprehensive system and the Minister himself is, in the long run, in favour of a comprehensive system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the conclusion I came to after giving a reasoned argument to the House.  That is what any Deputy should <Col N="1578" /> do.  It is far better than running with the hare and hunting with the hound, which is too often the case in this House.  At column 1211 I said:</P>
    <P>The present system is fragmented, and the Minister has lost an opportunity to unify, even to some degree, the present position in relation to the Dublin colleges, the regional technical colleges and the National Institute for Higher Education at Thomond College. The opportunity has been lost to create a unified system in relation to financing, staffing, and the utilisation of resources.  Why should the Department of Education finance regional technical colleges, Dublin VEC colleges and Thomond College while the HEA fund the NIHE in Limerick and the National College of Art and Design?</P>
    <P>I went on to say:</P>
    <P>This is a regretful aspect of this Bill. It does nothing to bring together the various strands involved in the administration of third-level education. The Minister is to be faulted on this major error.  If the HEA was amended as to its composition and if people from the non-university sector were brought on to the authority the HEA would be the proper vehicle through which State funds would be passed to all third-level institutes and colleges.</P>
    <P>I went on to discuss this matter at some length.  I think it was a reasonable contribution and I take exception to the Minister saying I was indulging in hyperbole.  That is not the case.  I am well aware of what is in the Bill.  I do not wish to criticise the Minister and for that reason I will not go into it further.  As far as I am concerned, a comprehensive system or a move towards a comprehensive system would have been a much more constructive approach and that fact that the Minister has not taken that approach is unfortunate.  The minor refernces, the near off-hand references to An tÚdarás in the Bill is symptomatic of the attitude of the Minister.  This section is unsatisfactory and I will oppose it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.30:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 37, to delete &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason for the amendment is to substitute &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; for &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;.  In these days when women's rights are being brought very much to the fore, the male chauvinism displayed by the Minister in this matter is unnecessary.  It can be corrected easily and such correction would meet with the approval of the majority of people, not only women.  I see no reason why we should be keeping strictly to the terms of section 11 (b) of the 1937 Interpretation Act which states that where the masculine gender is used, where appropriate the feminine gender should be construed.  We do not have to interpret that section strictly.  The Minister must not use the masculine gender simply because of that section, simply because of the technique used by the parliamentary draftsman.  I suggest that the Minister of the flowing mane should have taken the opportunity to make an impression on the female section of the community who are in the majority in regard to voting power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very important. Why should we always use the <Col N="1580" /> masculine gender when discussing males and females?  In modern times the more popular term is &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Chairman&rdquo; offends many women who have an equal part to play in developing the State institutions.  I would ask the Minister to adopt modern usage in this instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>In broad terms I support the amendment but I should like to make some comments on the subject.  I am against sexism in education and elsewhere.  I am also against tokenism in any form.  It can be surprisingly easy for persons of whichever gender to respond to the legitimate pressure of the women's movement here and in other countries to adopt token solutions without searching underneath the surface for the root causes of the problems which the women's movement is facing without analysing these causes or being prepared to do anything fundamental about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The irony is that we do not change the situation fundamentally by changing a word in a Bill, and yet there are some words which are important.  If I recall it correctly, the Creation story in the bible laid importance on the naming process. It is by naming a word that we comprehend it.  That naming process has a political dimension because if we change a name we sometimes change the way we look at the object and we take part in the political activity of changing things. Frequently, when suggestions like this for change are made, every reason is advanced other than the one which is truly felt by the person opposed to the change. Very often the reason it is really felt is that the new way of describing something is offensive to the person concerned because in some sense it is threatening.  To take away the word &ldquo;man&rdquo; is almost to unman.  One can see a psychological factor operating here. What to put in its place is another matter. There are elements in the women's movement who would prefer the formulation adopted by Deputy Collins.  On the other hand there are other elements who believe, and with some justice, that there is nothing wrong with the word &ldquo;woman&rdquo; and that it would be quite possible to amend it by inserting the words &ldquo;or chairwoman&rdquo; as the case may be.  If there is nothing wrong with the word <Col N="1581" />&ldquo;woman&rdquo; there is nothing wrong with inserting it in that context.</P>
    <P>Before commenting on what the Minister has to say I do not, as Deputy Collins may have done, under-estimate the difficulty in which the Minister finds himself because what we are asking him to do really is to take the initiative and there are all sorts of arguments against taking initiatives and one does not have to be on the Government benches to experience those arguments.  But the invitation here is to the Minister to take an initiative, largely of symbolic value but of a symbolic value that could be of real significance to the way we think about things, to the way we think about relationships between men and women in our society, to the way we think about the right of all people in our society to participate in all its institutions.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a few general remarks on this amendment because the remarks by Deputy Collins in proposing it and by Deputy Horgan were in general terms.  I would have no objection to accepting the amendment if I thought that it was necessary or if I thought that in any way the present form of the Bill could be attributed to male chauvinism on the part of anybody, either myself or my Department or parliamentary draftsmen.  Deputy Collins rightly adverted to the 1937 Interpretation Act and it adequately covers this point.  I agree with Deputy Horgan that there can be an element of tokenism in such usages.  There can be on the other hand, as he said, a resentment and a refusal to use certain terms because of either a conscious or subconscious fear that there is a threat in them. In my own organisation there are some women who chair meetings and they object to being called &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; because they say that that is making a distinction on the basis of sex.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point that the Deputy made.  The parliamentary draftsmen confirm that there is nothing in the anti-discrimination Acts which could be <Col N="1582" /> argued as superseding the Act of 1937.  I am talking now in the purely legalistic world.  It is not necessary to specify here that the Interpretation Act covers this but, of great interest to the Deputies and to the House is the fact that in the two Acts, the Anti-Discrimination Pay Act of 1974 and, more interestingly, the 1977 Employment Equality Act which specifically deals with some of the old wounds of our way of looking at things and of treating people, both the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; are used. This is of particular relevance because the Employment Equality Act has a specific purpose&mdash;to remove a fundamental injustice.  So I refuse to wear any kind of male chauvinist hat.  I reject the suggestion that Chauvin plays any part in my life or thinking in regard to my fellow human beings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the Interpretation Act covers the point. It does in a legal sense but what I am looking for in my amendment is a move towards a more modern use of words.  I do not believe in tokenism either and I would reject it.  What I am looking for is a meaningful up-dating of parliamentary usage of words.  I believe that the time has come when we should move away from the concept of the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; covering &ldquo;chairwoman&rdquo;.  I do not agree that the word &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; should be interpreted as covering a chairwoman.  I think &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;, with the dropping of the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;, would cover a male or a female.  It is desirable to use the word &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; so that, rather than using three words we should use one word.  &ldquo;Chairman&rdquo; or &ldquo;chairwoman&rdquo; is long and the word &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; covers both and it would be preferable.  I was hoping that the Minister would take this parliamentary initiative in updating the usage of English in our Bills going through this House and consequently in our Acts of Parliament.  I firmly believe the Interpretation Act is out of date in its usage of words and needs to be updated. That was the reason for my amendment.</P>

      <P>In relation to the discussion that is taking place it is fairly obvious that the change which Deputy <Col N="1583" /> Collins is recommending here is not legally necessary.  The question is, is it socially desirable?  There is no harm or bother at all about putting things into Bills that are socially desirable even though they may not be legally necessary. I would appeal to the Minister, certainly between now and Report Stage, to think again about the social desirability of a change of this order&mdash;not necessarily this precise change.  I could not agree with the Minister more when he points to the justifiable indignation on the part of women who see a response to the situation in which we find women as chairpersons and men go on calling themselves chairmen.</P>

      <P>I know the Deputy does not want that but in a sense it is almost an index of how hard it is to shift people's attitudes and how slow they are to shift, that the introduction of the word &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; as a tactic should have been met by this counter tactic from the male side that when women call themselves chairpersons, men go on calling themselves chairmen.  I fully accept the Minister's <i>bona fides</i> that he is not a male chauvinist in this matter but I beg leave to doubt that the Interpretation Act of 1937 did not have some subliminal male chauvinism written into its context.  The women's movement in 1937 was nothing like as strong as it is today.</P>

      <P>Parliamentary draftsperson, as the Deputy wishes&mdash;it is all the same to me.  But the social situation, and the question of relationships between men and women in regard to institutions, which is in some senses a political one, was quite different in 1937. Look at the Constitution of 1937; look at the section of the Constitution which deals with the woman's role in the home&mdash;still very true for very many <Col N="1584" /> women in our society but less and less true for many women who spend the greater part of their adult life in the work force.  We are dealing with a different situation 40 years afterwards.  I do not think it is too much to ask the Minister to reflect on the consequences of those 40 years, between now and Report Stage, to see whether he could take some gentle, meaningful initiative in this regard.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 37, to delete &ldquo;, the Director&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter of principle.  I firmly believe that the director should not be a member of the council.  The director should be seen as a chief executive with direct responsibility for implementing policy, which policy has been laid down by the council in their deliberations at <Col N="1585" /> meetings.  It is important that the director should not have a direct input except as is allowed for in section 10 (3) (b) which states:</P>
    <P>The Director may from time to time make such proposals regarding the functions of the Council as he shall consider appropriate.</P>
    <P>That is the mechanism allowing the director access to the board.  Of course he should have the right to be present at meetings of the council in his capacity as director but I feel he should not partake in the deliberations of the council when it comes to laying down the overall policy of the council.  It is a personal preference, but an important one.  I would prefer to see the director removed from the policy-making responsibility of the council.  He has a very important function in regard to the overall administration, indeed in the overall development of the workings of the council but he should be relieved of responsibility of actually setting down policy.  He should implement policy as laid down by the council.  The council will be composed of many experts in their own fields.  That is as it should be. But the director should not be given the extra responsibility of deliberating on the laying down of policy which he will be implementing at a later stage.  That is an incorrect approach to the workings of the council.  It is an unnecessary imposition on the director.  The director should be seen quite clearly to be a chief executive of the council carrying out policy as laid down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not start off with a closed mind.  In a sense Deputy Collins is talking about old thinking.  In the business world we have had quite a revolution in thinking in regard to who would be represented on boards.  The old thinking would exclude employees from the board altogether.  In our semi-State companies we have new worker directors. For example, we have teachers on the management boards in educational institutions when the non-workers, the non-professionals, learn a lot from having people from the work force sitting alongside them.  In particular the director of the NCEA is the person who is not merely present at all council meetings but he is also the person who has the expertise derived from membership of boards and committees so that his input is very considerable at council level.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly that because he is in direct contact with all the institutions, by reason of his office as director, to which the Bill applies, by reason of his direct contact with committees and other sub-committees of the council his presence is essential.  He is permanent. The ordinary members of the council may serve for a period of ten years and no longer.  The director is the permanent official who knits the whole operation together.  He would be more effective as a member than just as an attender.  I have very strong feelings about this, that he should be a full member of the council.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan asked what was the <i>ad hoc</i> position.  The <i>ad hoc</i> position is that the director is a member of the council and this, over the last few years, has proved very satisfactory.  There is no particular reason which can convince me that it should be otherwise.</P>

      <P>This is the first time I have been accused of such thinking.  The Minister's argument is specious.  He says he has introduced a concept of industrial democracy but there is no industrial democracy in the Bill because there is no representation for the ordinary workers on the council.  The director has responsibility for directing the staff under him and in that context he cannot be seen as an ordinary worker employed by the council.  In fact, he is the most senior officer, the managing director of the company.  I do not believe that such an officer, because he is a member of the council, would be seen to be encouraging or promoting any concept of industrial democracy.  If the Minister is interested in promoting industrial democracy he should make provision in section 5 to ensure that the academic and nonacademic staff have a role to play on the council by representation.  There is no representation for the ordinary working staff on the council.  If the Minister examines the Bill in relation to the ordinary employees of the council he will see where he is lacking in his interest in industrial democracy.  The director cannot be described as an ordinary worker of the council.</P>

There has been tremendous interest in the composition of the council and amendments have been tabled to section 5 relating to this matter.  I appreciate the Minister's dilemma in relation to this matter but I do not like to see large numbers on councils or committees because it invariably ends up with everybody wanting to have a say.  It <Col N="1588" /> often happens that the amount of work done is minimal.

    <P>(i)  six shall be so appointed on the recommendation of the Minister.&rdquo;.  e</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the composition of the board.  There should be a wider spread of representation on the council.  We have three models to consider, that presented in the Bill, that contained in my amendment and the one proposed by the Minister in his amendment. I am not saying that my amendment is the answer or that the Minister is correct.  Indeed, irrespective of the amendment adopted there will be criticism.  One of the major changes in the amendments is the change of heart to allow representation from the board of the National College of Art and Design on the council.  Such representation was omitted.  That was unfortunate although I believe the Minister may have been playing a game of chess when the Bill was being drafted.  His move that time caused a violent reaction from within the NCAD.  They clarified their own desires in the matter then.  The Minister engaged in a checkmate move which succeeded to a certain extent.  It is proper that there should be representation from the NCAD.  We hope that the NCEA and the NCAD will work together in relation to giving awards and the development of the national policies in relation to art and design.  I know the Minister is aware of the need to evolve a radical art and design policy throughout the country under the aegis of the NCAD.  I am pleased that he has seen fit to give representation to the NCAD.</P>
    <P>I have tried in my amendment to give representation also to the Union of Students in Ireland.  It is right that they should be satisfied in regard to representation. They are not specified in the Bill or in the Minister's amendment.  They have a part to play.  I meet presidents of student's councils and they are very interested <Col N="1591" /> in the work going on in their colleges and in having continuous contact with the boards of management and the academic councils in the colleges and institutions. They are anxious to see their colleges developing and prospering. Young people have a part to play in the development of their colleges.  They have their own points of view and are the life and soul of the colleges.  They have their rag weeks but they also have their serious side.  As well as attending to their studies they promote the social and cultural life of their colleges and of the community in which they live.  They should be specified as having a right to be on the NCEA, the governing body for all non-university colleges.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Minister has not seen fit to specify the students in this section.  He probably will say that he intends to appoint one under paragraph (g) in his amendment No. 36 but there may be pressures on him which might not allow him to appoint a student.  That is the reason why I have made a direct move to include them on the council.  I have had to reduce the number from the NIHE.  I believe they are not entitled to four each.  The Minister is now satisfied that four is too many and he is reducing the number to two.  I have also reduced the representation of Thomond from two to one and I have given one each to the university colleges.</P>
    <P>I have specified one representative from the NCAD.  I have introduced a concept in paragraphs (j) and (k) of allowing the boards of management of the regional technical colleges to appoint four members.  This means that the boards of management will have to get together to nominate four people to the council.  I believe that is a fair way of giving the RTCs specific powers in relation to appointing specific people to the council.  I hope they will see fit to appoint staff from the regional technical colleges, which is the reason for phrasing my amendment in the manner I did.  I do not mean that the appointment of members by the boards of management of the RTCs are necessarily to be members of the boards of management of the RTCs.  I hope they will recommend <Col N="1592" /> for appointment one or two members of the staff and perhaps two members of the boards of management in order to keep the balance.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (k) I have made provision for four appointments from boards of management or governing bodies or boards of institutions specified under section 20 of the Bill.  I have used that mechanism to allow the Dublin Institute of Technology, whose student population is around 5,000, the opportunity of participating in the membership of the council.  The position in Dublin has not been clarified.  They are awaiting the Minister's initiative in regard to the clarification of the future of those colleges. I am giving the opportunity to the colleges and institutions, which will be specified by order under section 20, to nominate a balance between members of the staff and members of the committees of the boards.</P>
    <P>This leaves six to be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister.  This will allow him a fair number to represent him on the board.  I am sure he will act in good faith in the appointment of members to the board to ensure that the many interests involved in the non-university sector will have an opportunity of being represented on the council. I have no reason to believe that he will not use his discretion wisely.</P>
    <P>I believe that my amendment is as fair an approach to this problem as anybody can come up with.  It provides a very broad spectrum of representation on the council and should commend itself to the House.  The Minister's amendment is also changing the representation.  In subparagraph (f) he has given four to the staffs of any university in the State, or any college or institution which is a constituent college of a university and in subparagraph (g) he has given three from amongst &ldquo;those who are members of the governing or managing body or of the staff of, or are students at, any institution to which this Act applies&rdquo;.  He reduces his option to three which is unfortunate. I am allowing nine, if one takes into account the student representative, on the boards from the staff and student bodies of the colleges while the Minister is only allowing three.  My approach <Col N="1593" /> is more liberal and would be welcomed more by the people involved.  I take it we are not discussing amendment No. 37 now?</P>

      <P>I want to refer briefly to representation on the council by members of trade unions.  Deputy Horgan's amendment No. 37 mentioned that the Teachers Union of Ireland should have representation on the council. That is the major union involved and they have made representations to Members of this House to have this representation, but there is a flaw in that amendment which I intended mentioning, if it had been moved.  Some staff members belong to the ASTMS and some of the staff of the NCAD are members of the Workers Union of Ireland.  Therefore, I had reservations about the TUI having exclusive representation on the council.  As I said, they should be represented on the council and I hope such a move will be made to give them representation but it must be remembered that there are other unions involved.</P>

      <P>When we attack this question, no solution that anybody comes up with will satisfy everybody.  I prefer the Minister's second thoughts to his first, but there are problems even about them.  Before referring to amendments Nos. 34 and 36 I would like to make a general point which is of some substance here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have inevitably a proliferation of institutions in the complex society in which we live.  With the proliferation of institutions, we have a proliferation of governing bodies, councils, advisory <Col N="1594" /> bodies of this and of that.  More and more the practice seems to be that in order to be a member of this, one has first to be a member of that.  This is partly for organisational reasons and partly because of the way in which careers are structured, in higher education no less than anywhere else.  As we have committees, so we have committee persons; as we have councils, so we have council persons.  As each committee person rises in the ranks he achieves and acquires more and more responsibility.  If I might make it more concrete by analogy: it is like a rocket which takes off and lifts into the stratosphere.  If we regard a committee person as a rocket, each successive layer of the stratosphere he penetrates endows him with a further patina of administrative responsibility. By the time he has broken free of the earth's gravitational pull to arrive in all his glory on the council of the National Council for Educational Awards, he has acquired so much administrative responsibility en route that his original job has been largely lost sight of.</P>
    <P>I suspect there are many decent hardworking people in this country today who devote no more than about 5 per cent of their time to the jobs they were originally appointed to do because their appointment to that particular position has involved them in a particular administrative responsibility which, in turn has involved them in a further responsibility at a different tier or level of administration and so on.  They will end up doing none of the jobs properly and discharging none of their administrative responsibilities properly.  We should be careful, to say the least of it, in creating systems which encourage further proliferation of responsibilities of this kind.</P>
    <P>In relation to the amendments we are discussing, this is very relevant.  Up to now, although the Minister in some parts of his amendment, I am glad to see, has broken away from it in part, we have been talking in terms of representing people who are almost by definition guaranteed to be already representing some other interest on another body. This is particularly true, for example, of the NIHEs.  With the exception of ministerial nominees, one gets to be a <Col N="1595" /> member of an NIHE because of some other responsibility one already holds.  If the council of the NIHE is going to appoint one, two or four members to the NCEA that will be an additional responsibility for those people.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any short answer to this problem but I feel it should be mentioned. Otherwise we run the very grave risk of creating in this council, and perhaps in other areas of Irish life as well, a mandarin class of people who spend their time doing nothing less than going to each other's committees and whose contact with reality becomes attenuated to the point of insignificance.</P>
    <P>There is a particular danger obvious in education, and it is a danger which is compounded by the idea that education is so important that it must be left to the experts.  With all due regard to expertise, I believe education is too important to be left to the experts.  One of the most important aspects of this Bill, which is dealt with in a very real way in these amendments, is the relationship between the numbers of experts and others.  &ldquo;Others&rdquo; in this context means those appointed in the public interest by the Minister for Education.  We should not be shy in facing up to the need to ensure that the public interest on such bodies and organisations is always substantial enough to offset the well-meaning, but sometimes rather blinkered, view of the experts.  In addition, when we come to decide on the appropriate balance between experts and others&mdash;I do not like using the word &ldquo;non-expert&rdquo; because it implies a diminution of responsibility&mdash;we have to come to terms with the fact that education is a very specialised area and the experts have a head start.  They are at their job full time.  If there is a genuine conflict of interest between the institution or professional interest on the one hand and the public interest on the other it takes a very determined person all his or her time and energy to catch up with the defenders and the promoters of the professional or institutional interest.  If we are to make a mistake we should err on the side of generosity towards the public interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> I would not be averse to a relative increase in the number of persons that can be appointed by the Minister for Education without having his hands tied under amendment No. 36.  I would like to see such persons not merely as representative of areas of business, industry and commerce which have a strong relationship with technological education but as representative of the liberal, academic value-oriented world which the Minister has already spoken of.</P>
    <P>In relation to the small print of the amendment, I welcome the decision of the Minister to appoint somebody on the recommendation of Bord an Choláiste Náisiúnta Ealaíne is Deartha but I am confused as to the relationship in numercial terms between that appointee and the appointees from the other institutions on their recommendations.  For example, the National College of Art and Design is to have one nominee appointed. Two are to be appointed on the recommendation of Thomond College of Education and two each from NIHE, Dublin and NIHE, Limerick.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us what rationale he has devised to justify the discrepancy.  Is it on the size of the student body?  That would be an odd way to decide a recommendation because it is a rationale which is not evident in any other part of the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many students there are in Thomond College but I doubt if there are very many more than there are in the National College of Art and Design.  The NIHE, Dublin has no students at all at present.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply will tell us why he chose one for the NCAD and two for the others.  I would not be averse to leaving all institutional appointments at the level of one and Minister taking to himself any surplus that might thereby be created.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 36 (f) I am in agreement with the Minister freeing his hands.  It is likely that he will appoint on an institutional basis but he leaves himself free not to do so.  The last line of (f) refers to an institution standing for the time being designated for the purposes of this section by the Minister.  In relation to sections 1 and 2 of the Bill <Col N="1597" /> which are already discussed, I raise the question now: are we to have two forms of designation?  Is there to be one form of designation for an institution for the purpose of the Act whose courses will be validated by the NCEA?  Under this amendment will there be a different form of designation for colleges, universities and other institutions whose courses will not be validated by the NCEA but which will have to be designated in some sense by the Minister in order that their staff or management can form part of the council?  It gets rather cumbersome and one wonders whether it is strictly necessary.</P>
    <P>The first line of amendment No. 36 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 4, subsection (1), lines 44 to 54,...</P>
    <P>That should be lines 43 to 54 not 44 to 54.  Perhaps the Minister will look at that in due course.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that Deputy Collins and Deputy Horgan stated that in the composition of the council there was a difficult problem and that no matter what proposal one came up with it would not be solved to the satisfaction of everybody who had an interest in it.  I thank the Deputies for their remarks and I thank all those who wrote to me with their suggestions.  As has been indicated by the two Opposition speakers, the interest in this section of the Bill has been very great.</P>
      <P>My proposal in amendment No. 36 seems to be a representative and flexible one which should command the support of the House and the people concerned in this area of education and educationalists generally.  Apart from the chairman, the director and four individual members from the university&mdash;I prefer the word &ldquo;members&rdquo; to &ldquo;representatives&rdquo;&mdash;I take Deputy Horgan's point about this, the two NIHEs are to have two each and Thomond is to have two also.  I will refer later to Deputy Horgan's comment on this.  There will be a National College of Art and Design representative and as is stated at (g):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>three shall be so appointed on the <Col N="1598" /> recommendation of the Minister from amongst those who are members of the governing or managing body or of the staff of, or are students at, any institution to which this Act applies.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Deputy Collins about the importance of student representation.  They have a very serious contribution to make.  The students nowadays show an interest not merely in educational matters but in social matters and so on.  I agree with the Deputy's remarks and feel that amendment No. 36 (g) covers the position adequately without mentioning a specific union or group.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Horgan's general point that in a complex society such as ours we have a proliferation of institutions and consequently heavy burdens on individuals who move on their point of departure upwards and consequently tend to lose touch with their original institutions which they are supposed to represent, it is not an easy problem to solve&mdash;if there is any solution. In regard to Muintir na Tíre, Canon Hayes said that if you wanted to get something done you should always go to a busy man&mdash;the very fact that he is busy indicates a man who tends to get things done.  It tends to happen that people are appointed to a great number of organisations because they are held to be people who can get things done.  I suppose there is a danger of reaching a kind of mandarin situation.  In fact in the US very often they have professional administrators who are switchable from one institution to another.  They qualify as administrators and do nothing else.  In our context generally the person involved as an expert educationist is also heavily involved as an administrator.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what Deputy Horgan said about the dangers of experts being blinkered, taking a narrow view of problems coming before them and perhaps education is too important to be left to the experts.  It is more than likely that when the Minister turns to look for people who will have a useful input on such a body as the National Council for Educational Awards in the public interest he will have to go to people who are known performers in their particular <Col N="1599" /> fields.  Whether it is in industry or anything else they will be people who will be very busy anyway in their own line and will have extra burdens imposed on them by membership of the council. There are&mdash;and we should know it and say a word of appreciation&mdash;very many people who with considerable stress to themselves and no particular advantage give themselves to such councils and committees.  Were it not for this I think our complex system of democracy would not work at all.</P>
    <P>I take Deputy Horgan's point about the importance of having someone with the stamp of the reflector, the analyst on the council and I hope to use my own powers of appointment in that sphere. Regarding the point made by Deputy Horgan in respect of Coláiste Náisiúnta Ealaíne is Deartha, I should say that when he mentioned Thomond in particular, Thomond is to be not merely the national college for physical education but will also train teachers in rural science, metalwork and woodwork.  That part of Thomond is practically completed and will be in action and it will be a sizeable institution.  The fact that it will have a multiplicity of disciplines is important in this context of representation. An Coláiste Náisiúnta Ealaíne is specifically involved in art and design and I am sure it will be well represented by the person appointed.  It is not in any way a judgment on the importance of an institution&mdash;in this case because there is only one&mdash;or that it is in any way inferior or less entitled to consideration than those getting two.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan made a point about designation which I did not quite grasp&mdash;did he refer to section 1 (1)?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">

      <P>It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four shall be so appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from amongst those who are members of the staff of any university in the State, or any college or institution which is a <Col N="1600" /> constituent college of, or is recognised by, such a university, being a university, college, or institution standing for the time being designated for the purpose of this section by the Minister.</P>
    <P>That is a designation under section 20.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would cavil with the Minister's amendment No. 36 specifically in relation to paragraph (g) which says:</P>
      <P>Three shall be so appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from amongst those who are members of the governing or managing body or of the staff of, or are students at, any institution to which this Act applies.</P>
      <P>I do not think that provision goes far enough to meet the requirements of the staff side or the side of members of the boards of management or of the student section.  The spirit of the amendment is that you have one student, one staff representative and one member of the boards of management of the RTC or indeed of the DIT.  The RTC and the DIT together must account for a minimum of 80 per cent of work done under this Bill.  Yet the Minister is reducing representation from that sector to three which is completely inadequate and is unfair.  The Minister is reducing the status of the RTC and the DIT, the composite colleges within that institute to miniscule proportions.  It is very unfair to do that in paragraph (g).  My amendment is far more generous in that respect.  I have one student, four from RTC and four from other colleges or institutions designated under section 20.  I was allowing nine to come from the RTC and the section 20 designated colleges network.  That is a far better and fairer reflection of the representation justly deserved by that section.  Reduction of representation for that sector to three as intended by the Minister in paragraph (g) is extremely wrong and does great injustice to people in the RTC and the DIT sector.  I ask the Minister to reflect on this and to be more generous to the governing sector and to the staff and student sectors.  I am seeking a better deal for the RTC and DIT people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to appear <Col N="1601" /> to be nit-picking but the Minister referred me to section 20 in relation to paragraph (f) of his amendment. That section gives the Minister power to designate any college, school or other educational institute apart from a university whereas paragraph (f) of the amendment relates almost entirely to universities. There is no ministerial amendment later that would delete the words &ldquo;other than a university&rdquo;.  I do not see how there could be any such amendment because section 20 is fundamental to the whole operation of the Bill.  What I in quired originally was whether the Minister was envisaging one designation procedure for institutes recognised under the Bill and referred to in paragraph (g) of the Minister's amendment and another form of designation for the university constituent colleges.  Perhaps that is something we could deal with fairly quickly.</P>
      <P>The Minister's defence of his delegation of one member on the recommendation of the board of the NCAD was somewhat muted.  I should be glad to hear whether his formula has the approval of the president and board of that institution.</P>
      <P>I recall amendment No. 5 which has been passed as providing in the definition section that staff means either academic or administrative staff.  I should be rather unhappy if I considered that paragraph (f) of amendment No. 36 in relation to the universities would be interpreted by the Minister in practical terms as giving him the right to appoint the administrative staff of the universities. I am confident that the Minister's intention here is to appoint academic staff to the universities.  The same objection might be raised in respect of paragraph (g) of the amendment in relation to the designated institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to Deputy Collins that there are nine in that sector in accordance with my amendment.  These are made up of two, two and two for the NIHE's and Thomond and three as provided for in paragraph (g).  Therefore, it is a matter of the same numbers relating to the purely technical field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" /> Regarding the point made my Deputy Horgan, paragraph (g) refers to section 20 but the universities as referred to in paragraph (f) stand on their own.</P>
    <P>To answer the other point made by Deputy Horgan, we did not ask for clearance from the boards of any of the institutions who have been allocated representations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the House might be misled inadvertently by the Minister, the point I made in relation to paragraph (g) was that the provision of this paragraph governs the regional technical college sector and, in effect, the Dublin Institute of Technology group of colleges. The effect of paragraph (g) is to restrict to that sector as well as to the possible representation of students the question of student representation because in relation to paragraph (g) &ldquo;student&rdquo; is specified.  I would assume that under paragraph (a) of section 5 a student would not be so nominated because it is intended now to nominated a student in accordance with paragraph (g) specifically.  If that is the case and if one student is appointed there is being reduced the possible representation of members of the governing and managing bodies or of the staff or students of any institute to which the Bill applies. Therefore, I assume that what is intended in respect of paragraph (a) is that there will be appointed people from outside the system as presently constituted and that in accordance with paragraph (g) there will be appointed three from the system as is represented at present by the RTC and the DIT sectors.  If that is the intention, and I have not heard to the contrary, representation of the RTC and DIT sectors is being reduced from three to two.  These sectors represent the major portion of the non-university sector both from the point of view of students and staff.  The representation they are being given, even within the terms of the Minister's amendment, is miniscule in proportion to their importance in the non-university sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I ask the Minister <Col N="1603" /> either to reconsider paragraph (g) or to give us assurances that the representation from the RTC and DIT sectors in relation to a representation of one student, two staff members and a board of management representation of three would be more than what is specified in paragraph (g) and that it is his intention to use the provision of paragraph (a) to give greater representation to staff, students and members of boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pointed out that my amendment proposes nine representatives in the purely technological area.  I would merely comment on Deputy Collins's remarks in the light of something that was said pertinently by Deputy Horgan, that was, that one of the dangers in this whole business is that of a blinkered approach.  Perhaps the use of the word &ldquo;representation&rdquo; is unfortunate in this context.  I would envisage the people acting on the council as representing not purely the interest of the students but of technology in general.  The same applies to a person from any institution. Naturally, being human he would think of his own institute but on a national council such as this he would be expected to represent more than merely the interest of his institution.</P>
      <P>In all, then, there is a representation of ten.  These are one each in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) and a representation of two, two, two further back in the amendment.  That is a good spread of representation and I will use my powers to nominate to balance the team each time.  That is the purpose of the Minister retaining power under section 5 (1) (a).  It was in this context that Deputy Horgan felt we would not have a blinkered approach, that even he would be satisfied if the Minister had power to nominate more members to the council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to one or two points, one of which the Minister may have neglected to advert to, that is, whether he intends in relation to appointment from the university area to appoint from the educational rather than from the administrative area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that under the section <Col N="1604" /> the universities stand on their own. They stand on their own but they stand out.  In higher education legislation we have two forms of designation.  We have designation under the Higher Education Authority Act and we have designation under the National Council for Educational Awards Bill.  The designation of universities under the National Council for Educational Awards Bill appears under section 5 (1) (f) without as much as by your leave if the Minister's amendment No. 36 is accepted.  There is no procedure in this Bill for Ministerial designations under section 5 (1) (f). There is no specific power given to the Minister as there is in section 20 in relation to the non-university institutions.  At the very least it seems that we will have to have two lists of designated institutions, one list of institutions designated under section 1 and another list of institutions designated under section 5 (1) (f).  Is that the Minister's intention?  It is not formally in the Act.  It comes in in the subsection in amendment No. 36. Perhaps the Minister would consider this matter between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(b) Where a member ceases to be a member of the body or institution which he represents, that person shall also cease to be a member of the Council.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This merely ensures that bodies and institutions who are represented on the council will have the assurance that they will at all times have a person representing them there.

      <P>There is much substance in what Deputy Collins has said but there are difficulties as well.  A person may cease to be a member of an institution for perfectly understandable reasons.  He may not be fired or sacked or in any way blot his copybook and the Minister may be quite happy to have him continue on the council for the remaining period.  In circumstances where a person has left an institution in bad odour, as it were, it is obviously essential that he should not continue to be a member of the council.  Between now and Report Stage we might think of a formula which would obviate the possibility of this happening and I am sure the Minister will be as anxious to ensure this as we are.</P>

It is in the area of technological education that there is most interchange and interplay between the actual institution and business. <Col N="1610" /> manufacturing industry, engineering, electronics and so on.  I would be reluctant to write something into the Bill which would force people off the council who have expertise as soon as they ceased to be members of institutions which have nominated them for membership of the council.</P>

      <P>Under the Community's scheme of FEOGA grants for <Col N="1614" /> marketing and processing of agricultural products, the EEC Commission may give grants for the provision of grain drying and storage facilities.  An essential condition of eligibility for a grant under that scheme, however, is that a minimum part of the cost must be financed from national funds.  Some years ago the Industrial Development Authority ceased giving grants for grain drying and storage facilities except where these form part of a general scheme of modernisation of a provender milling business and then only to the extent of the storage deemed for working stocks.  I recently raised with the authority the question of reintroducing grants for grain storage and drying generally and that body are currently examining the matter.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the reply I gave on 8 November last, in which I indicated that it would not be prudent to decide on national arrangements until we knew the final form of the common organisation of the Community, potato market, which has been under consideration for some time.</P>
      <P>Appreciable progress on the European Commission's proposals for the potato market has been made since then. The matter was, in fact, considered by the Council of Ministers at their last meeting and will be further considered at their next meeting on 8 May.  It is hoped that firm guidelines on the few remaining issues will soon emerge.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the proposals is to help to stabilise the Community potato market.  I would, however, point out that even the existence of elaborate potato marketing organisations in other countries has not prevented gluts and scarcities there.</P>

Would it not be prudent if not absolutely essential that we should have a body who would be representative of all those various interests with a view to trying to regulate and control the growing, supply and disposal on a spread-out basis rather than this thing of seed at £45 a ton last November and taking £650 an acre to grow and we would be lucky to get seven tons to the acre&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the total tonnage of beef and <Col N="1620" /> cheese imported by the EEC in the most recent 12 months for which figures are available; the tonnage of each of these commodities which will be imported during the present year; and if he will make a statement on the effect such imports have on Irish producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that Community imports of beef and cheese in 1978 were about 340,000 tonnes and 80,000 tonnes respectively.  These levels are not expected to alter significantly in 1979.</P>
      <P>The imports of cheese were mainly of varieties not produced in Ireland and, therefore, would have only a limited effect on Irish producers.  Furthermore, the imports were far more than offset by Community exports of cheese, which amounted to over 200,000 tonnes in 1978.  In the case of beef the overall level of imports must be seen in the context of a Community deficit of about 400,000 tonnes, consumption of about 6.5 million tonnes and exports of about 150,000 tonnes per annum.  The bulk of the imports of beef take place under contractual arrangements and are subject in most cases to annual fixed limits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Minister's detailed reply and his figures for imports and exports, I do not understand how either in the case of cheese or beef it could have an insignificant effect on our market.  Does the Minister regard the net difference in imports as against exports of beef of 200,000 tonnes a year as being other than very significant?  Do the 200,000 tonnes we export not represent in many cases a very substantial loss to the EEC?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the existence of a very real problem in the question of the oversupply of dairy products.  It is not in the long term interests of the farmer or the dairy producer that there should be unlimited increase in production.  There are certain factors in the securing of that increased production which I have consistently resisted.  They are the importation of third country supplies of butter, especially from New Zealand, into the Community, which aggravates considerably the butter surplus within the Community. Of equal seriousness is the importation of soya and other feedstuffs of that kind from the third countries into the hard currency countries of the EEC such as Holland and Germany where it is used for intensive milk production. This type of production within the Community might well be restrained.  I agree that there are many serious difficulties in the beef situation, but from the Irish farmer's point of view one only has to look at his performance since 1973.  The milk market is buoyant and there is no reason to believe that it will not continue to be buoyant.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 12 to 15 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Treaty of Rome the determination of whether a particular state aid is compatible with the common market is a function of the Commission, but where a member state fails to comply with a decision of the Commission in this connection, the matter may be referred <Col N="1624" /> to the Court of Justice.  Clearly, in the consideration of an Irish State aid by the Community institutions the provisions of Protocol 30 to the Act of Accession have to be taken into account.  I can assure the Deputy that in the implementation of EEC policy on state aids for agriculture, my Department, wherever appropriate, has invoked and will continue to invoke the special considerations provided for Ireland in that Protocol.</P>
    <P>The current review of these aids referred to by the Deputy has not yet reached the point where it would be possible to say precisely how particular aids in this country would be affected by the criteria being proposed by the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has Protocol 30 in this context any enforceable legal effect? Does the Minister believe that the fact that German farmers are receiving about five times as much State aid from their Governments as our farmers are receiving from this Government indicates that Protocol 30 is being honoured in the spirit by the European Community in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The capacity of comparatively wealthy countries such as Germany and the hard currency countries generally to pay bigger State aids in a great many of the European Community schemes which are contributory, like the payments under the disadvantaged areas scheme creates a chronic situation.  The advantages that fall to comparatively wealthy countries are great and it is within their national capacity to pay better incentives to their producers, but they must do it in such a way so as not to produce distortion within the Community market generally. If they did, it would be possible for the complaining state to bring its case to the Court of Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Protocol 30 is an annex to the Treaty and therefore is of considerable legal effect, has the Minister considered taking an action in this matter in the European Court to restrain other countries from giving aids which Ireland cannot afford to give?</P>

    <Col N="1625" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal restraints that will be affected do not apply in disadvantaged areas such as the west of Ireland.  Ireland has, by virtue of Protocol 30 secured an especially exempt position in this regard because of its comparatively early stage of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a misunderstanding here.  There is no Community input into the purchase, for instance, by the Netherlands of supplies of soya. They can buy comparatively cheaply with their hard currency.  That is not within the context of the Treaty or within the Community scheme.

      <P>I need no reminding of the position of the small farmer with a genuine land need, whether he lives in County Tipperary or elsewhere.  In today's circumstances, however, the effectiveness of the traditional acquisition and division programme of the Land Commission is being called more and more into question.  Obviously, a new approach is now required and I hope later this year to be coming to the House with proposals for a comprehensive package of measures more appropriate to present-day needs.</P>

In all of these cases a large number of smallholders who were urgently in need of land were deprived of these lands by his Department by agreeing to the sales privately.  Secondly, does not the Minister agree that because of this lack of concern many of these unfortunate <Col N="1627" /> smallholders will be forced off the land because they have not viable holdings?  Finally, does the Minister agree that the cheque book should not be the priority over the needs of these people who are the backbone of the community in rural Ireland?  In my area many of them have waited 14 years for their needs to be recognised and met by the Department but they have not been successful.

      <P>I am well aware of the unsatisfactory situation in which small farmers find themselves.  With regard to Deputy Ryan's reference to the cheque book farmer, new legislation is needed to bring effective control over that serious problem.  As I said in my reply, I hope to have new legislation aimed at controlling that situation before the House this year. Before we leave this subject I want to give the Deputy a few statistics about County Tipperary.  In the year 1976 the amount of land acquired was 262 hectares; in 1977 it was 296 hectares and last year it was 367 hectares.  The number of hectares allotted in 1976 was 400; in 1977 it was 582 and it was 677 last year.  I am not boasting about this but the situation has been improving steadily since 1976.</P>

      <P>Under the 1978 cattle headage payments scheme there was a total of 72,600 applicants: 68,417 of these have been cleared for payment and 43,417 payments have been issued.  There have been no delays in dealing with west Cavan cases under the 1978 cattle headage payments scheme.  Some 97 per cent of cases there have been cleared as compared with 93 per cent for the western area as a whole. Most of the outstanding cases are being further investigated or additional documentation is being awaited.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Bruton's question, I would make the point that a more relevant figure should be the total expenditure on conservation <Col N="1638" /> during the years in question and I can relate them to the Deputy.  In 1976 the total expenditure on conservation was £98,000; in 1977 the amount was £160,000; in 1978 the amount was £115,000 and in 1979 it is estimated there will be an expenditure of £422,000.

The whole question of conservation has to be taken into account right across the board.  Particular problems arose this winter as a result of difficult climatic conditions.  Consequently there were extra demands on supplies.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 36 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>I have, for some time, been examining the desirability of establishing a State oil corporation and considering towards what areas of the oil industry such a corporation might, from the point of view of the national interest, be orientated.</P>
      <P>My approach to this matter is based on the belief that, given the general outlook for oil supplies worldwide, it is essential that the State should at least take the initial steps in improving its capacity to react to developments.  I do not envisage that major initiatives would be taken by a State company in the very early stages&mdash;the legislation which I am considering contemplates a graduated approach.  I consider that it is necessary to have established an instrument of public policy, with the necessary competence and expertise, to undertake, in the first instance, the study and preliminary work on which future initiatives could be based.  In the circumstances, it would be premature to attempt to answer the other specific questions raised by Deputies Kelly and Desmond.</P>
      <P>I would hope to introduce the legislation before the end of the year.</P>

He or she does not necessarily lose that expertise when constrained to leave the council.  Deputy Horgan supported my view.  He mentioned that, in the case of a person who left the institution because of some misdemeanour, misconduct, or something like that, there would be a case for the removal of that <Col N="1658" /> person but I think that point is covered in section 8 (5). There are sufficient controls built into section 8 to ensure that a person may be removed from membership if it is considered that he or she should be so removed.</P>

      <P>I take the point the Minister has made.  I put down the amendment merely to allow discussion on the problems raised by the representation of various colleges and bodies on the council.  There may be a grievance felt within a college, a body, or group of persons who are represented by a person on the council.  If for one reason or another that person leaves the nominating body, if a member of the council ceased to be a member of the representative body or group of persons, I felt for that reason he or she should also cease to be a member of the council. However, I shall not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned the section is still not satisfactory. I am not happy even with the Minister's amendment and in particular with amendment No. 36 (g) because it deprives the most important sector governed by this Bill, the RTCs and Dublin colleges, of proper representation on the Council of the NCEA.  That is very wrong because the bulk of the work done under this Bill will be carried out by the RTCs and the Dublin Institute of Technology group of colleges.  For that reason perhaps the Minister would reconsider the structure of representation before he finalises this on Report Stage.  The manner in which the Minister has approached the question of representation resolves some problems but raises others.  I accept that whatever system is evolved it will be unsatisfactory in certain respects but certainly I am not satisfied with the Minister's approach.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), between lines 27 and 28, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) the chairperson shall be appointed initially for a five year period and this appointment may be renewed only for a further period not exceeding five years.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to the tenure of office of the chairperson, or chairman, whichever is the word used, which I contend should be limited.  The initial chairperson should be appointed for a five-year period and should be entitled to not more than a second period of five years.  There is need to specify this in the Bill.  It is not done in section 6 to my satisfaction.  Ten years is long enough for any chairperson to hold office.  Any further term is unnecesary and undesirable. The term of office of such a person should be limited.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 76 states that members of the first council shall be appointed for a period of five years and that the Government shall not attach restrictive terms or conditions to the appointment of any member of the council. The latter part of my amendment denotes the serious disagreement I have with the Minister's wording in relation to section 8.  I accept that the amendments are related in regard to the terms of office but not in regard to the terms of appointment.

      <P>The provisions in the Bill permit the chairman's appointment to be a term which will not exceed five years which can be reviewed for a further term not exceeding five years.  There is no restriction on eligibility for further re-appointment. The idea in not putting any restriction on the re-appointment of the chairman and leaving the option to the Minister to re-appoint that officer is to give the Minister the maximum freedom to appoint the chairman, even after a ten-year period, if he thinks at that time that the holder of the office is the best person to perform the job.  It would be loss-making and restricting the freedom of the Minister to pick the best person if one brought in a provision which disallowed the re-appointment of a chairman after two periods of five years.  I suggest that the wording in the section should remain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 58:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 41 to 43, to delete subsection (5) and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The chairperson shall be removed from office by a special resolution of the Council having the support of at least two-thirds of the numbers present and voting at a meeting at which the chairperson shall be present or represented.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 58 deals with the chairperson while amendment No. 87 deals with any member of the council. They are not quite related but I accept the ruling of the chair.  In amendment No. 58 I am seeking the deletion of subsection (5) because I do not believe the Minister should have the powers he is being given in that subsection.  That subsection states that the chairman of the council may, on the recommendation of the Minister, be removed from the office <Col N="1661" /> of chairman by the Government.  That gives the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> to remove the chairman who may not, for example, have the same political affiliations as the Minister.  The Minister may also take exception to the handling of the development of the NCEA by such an officer, No Minister should have such over-riding power in relation to a chairman of such an important academic council.  Under this subsection the Minister is given inordinate powers.</P>
    <P>In my amendment I seek to give the power initially to the council to remove such an officer from office by a special resolution having the support of at least two-thirds of the numbers present and voting at a meeting at which the chairperson shall be present or represented.  A chairperson should have certain security of office.  The heavy hand which the Minister can use under subsection (5) is unnecessary and undesirable. A chairperson should be allowed to pursue his or her policies in accordance with ordinary procedures.  I would not like to see a chairperson receiving a note to the effect that the Minister had recommended to the Government that he be removed from office without a full explanation.  In the light of the Garvey decision by the Supreme Court I wonder if that subsection is constitutional.  A person being removed from office by a Government is entitled to a full explanation and, perhaps, compensation.  Under this subsection it is not necessary for the Government or the Minister to give a full explanation.  That is not just and it may be contrary to the Act which deals with unfair dismissals.  I do not think this Minister would act in a political fashion but I cannot say that other Ministers would not act in a political fashion and dismiss a chairperson without an explanation. The Garvey case may indicate the necessity for a change in the wording of that subsection.</P>
    <P>I want to see subsection (5) changed. In my amendment I have tried to put on the council the responsibility for removing the chairman from office because they are the people who are involved in the working of the council and they see the good work or bad work a chairman is doing.  If two-thirds of the members of <Col N="1662" /> the council feel that the chairman is not good enough or for some reason or other that he should not be in office, they have the right to remove him from office. That is a fair treatment of the chairperson of the council.  I am very dubious about subsection (5) of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a couple of points to make which are more appropriate to the section and I will make them when we come to discuss it.  With regard to Deputy Collins's amendment, I feel it does not achieve the effect he would like to achieve.  It means that, effectively, the chairman could avoid being sacked by simply boycotting the meeting which is held to sack him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to comment on the statement Deputy Collins made that, if the chairman had not the same political affiliations this might be a reason why he could be removed by the Minister.  I do not accept that this is a hazard.  The office is a part-time one and is unpaid.  One might be inclined to give it to one's enemy rather than one's friend because the duties are so onerous and it takes great dedication on the part of the person appointed to devote his time and considerable energies to this position. The chairman, basically, is appointed by the Government and it follows logically that the power to remove him from office should rest with the Government rather than with the council.  It is accepted practice in the public service that the authority who have the power to remove from office should be of a rank at least as high as the authority that appoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the chairman or chairwoman, the difficulty he or she would have presiding at the council would be all the greater if there was the <Col N="1663" /> possibility of a gang-up and two-thirds of the members voting him or her out of office.  I believe for those reasons that the powers given to the Government to remove the chairman or chairwoman from office should remain with the Government.  I do not believe it would be abused by anybody holding the office of Minister for Education.  Therefore I will maintain the position as outlined in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 44 to 46.</P>
      <P>This relates to subsection (6) of this section. I wish to achieve a mechanism which allows the chairman who for one reason or another ceases to be chairman of the council to become an ordinary member of the council.  I do not see any reason why such a person could not become an ordinary member of the council and I do not see why the experience and wisdom he has gained while chairman of the council should not be put to good use.  It seems to me rather harsh to remove him from the scene altogether and not allow him the facilities of being an ordinary member of the council.  Surely if the chairman, who might be an excellent man and a relatively young man, has served his time as chairman on the council, his wisdom and experience should be harnessed rather than dispensed with.  It is very unfortunate if we are dispensing with good men.  My amendment allows a procedure which would permit a chairman who has retired from that position to become an ordinary member of the council.  That is very desirable.</P>

      <P>Twenty-five is the fixed number for the council.  If acceptance of Deputy Collins's amendment meant a <Col N="1664" /> council of 26 it would contravene the position of the 25 on the council.  I see no reason why a chairman who ceases to be chairman at the end of one of the quinquennial periods should not come under another provision of the Bill and that after two years he could become a member of the council again.  He would not have lost his expertise and possibly would have sharpened his perceptions by the two years rest and could have a look at the council from without rather than from within.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the difficulty in relation to the number, but it seems to me that it may be faulty.  Suppose in mid-term a chairman reached the end of his tenure of office and at that time there was a casual vacancy to be filled, a possible interpretation of subsection (6) might mean that he could not be appointed as a representative either by the Minister or by one of the nominating bodies to fill this casual vacancy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that he is penalised for two years.  While I accept that ten years seems to be a long period, if the chairman is a good person there may be a very valid reason, especially in mid-term, to allow him to continue as an ordinary member if there is a casual vacancy to be filled.  This subsection and another subsection seem to exclude that possibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know why the Government and the Minister saw fit to include in subsection (1) the restriction to a part-time capacity of the person who is to be chairman of the council.  I am not saying I oppose this in principle but it seems odd to write this in in such a restrictive way.  The Minister does not <Col N="1665" /> give himself the freedom to appoint a full-time person if he decides a full-time person is necessary for the proper functioning of the council.</P>
      <P>The second point on which I want the Minister's advice relates to subsection (5) and removal from office.  Since the Garvey case, removals from office by the Government are subject to different considerations than they were beforehand, to make the mildest commentary on it.  One would like to know if a person appointed as chairman under this section by the Government is an employee and, if so, of whom is he an employee?  If he is an employee, what conditions of service might be reasonably expected to attach to his employment?  If he is not an employee, what is he?  Will he get remuneration for his services?  Can he receive remuneration without being an employee?  There are all sorts of questions like this about the role of a chairman and other members of the board, and in particular in relation to any provisions about dismissal or removal from office.  I would be glad to have the Minister's observations on those points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill restricts to a part-time capacity the position of chairman.  If there is a growth in this section, we hope there may be a need for a full-time chairman and that possibility should not be excluded.  I disagree emphatically with subsection (5) which gives a Government a free hand to remove a chairman from office on the recommendation of the Minister.  The subsection does not allow for the Government, the agent of the Government, or the Minister to discuss with the chairman the reasons why he was removed from office.  That is antidemocratic. It is bad Government, socially unjust and may be illegal, as a result of the Garvey case, or in the context of the Unfair Dismissals Act.  The least one would demand of the Government is that they remove a person from office after giving the reason for taking that action.  That is the minimum legal and social requirement.  It would be most unfortunate if we were to continue to give a completely free hand in the <Col N="1666" /> removal of chairman from office to the whim of the Government of the day.</P>
      <P>We have an opportunity now of ensuring that this Bill is airtight, both constitutionally and legally.  We should take the opportunity of being generous in matters of dismissals from office.  Before Question Time the Minister accused me of 1937 thinking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have come a long way since that time and I do not wish to dwell on it or to talk about it.  Subsection (5) may be illegal and even unconstitutional. Leaving those considerations aside, the minimum requirement in social justice is that the Government be required by law to give reasons for the removal from the position of chairman of any person.  If that is not in this subsection, it is socially wrong and legally dubious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Horgan and Deputy Collins asked why we are restricting the office to part-time only.  I notice that Deputy Horgan put down and amendment in relation to this.  The reason is obvious.  We want to have as chairman of the council a first class person.  In order to qualify for consideration as chairman of this very important council the person will be one who has made his mark elsewhere and will be mid a successful career and would not be available to us as chairman if we made it a full-time job.  It is important also in the context of the remarks we made before Question Time and since, that we want in the technological sector people who have made their mark in research, commerce and industry.  If we cut out part-time people we would be narrowing the field very much.  The kind of experience and prestige a person acquires from achieving a significant position in commerce, industry or research is very badly needed in the chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies raised the point about the Government's power to remove from office. Deputy Horgan asked if the chairman was an employee.  He is appointed by the Government and is removable by the Government.  As of now there is no remuneration for the <Col N="1667" /> chairman.  Subsection 8 (3) is a permissive subsection which deals with the matter.  Deputies do not have any real cause for worry on the score that any injustice could conceivably be done to the chairman of the NCEA.  All the relevant precautions would be taken by the Minister and the Government in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the assurances of the Minister.  I fully accept his goodwill and his personal position in the matter.  He would be above doing any person an injustice but I have serious legal reservations and reservations in social equity about the wording of subsection (5). I urge the Minister to refer the matter to the Attorney General, to the Chief State Solicitor's office or to the parliamentary draftsman's office in the light of the Garvey case.  If I am not mistaken, the heads of the Bill or the Bill itself may have been published prior to the Garvey judgment.  That should be taken into account.  We all recall when a whole authority were dismissed at the whim of the last Fianna Fáil administration and there was public outrage at the offhand dismissal.  This approach is being retained in this subsection and it is unacceptable politically, legally and in social justice.  I will move an amendment on it on Report Stage but the Minister should take advice on it before then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all in the dark here.  The only reason I can imagine for it is that the Minister, in relation to whether or not chairman are employees, does not want or perhaps is not in a position to make a statement which might be regarded as an interpretation of the law rather than a statement on the legislation.  However, if that is the way it will be, that is the way it will be.  The Minister will have to live with the consequences of it for the next two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the question of whole time or part-time, the Minister seems to have got me slightly wrong.  I was not arguing that one should not appoint on a part-time basis but that one should have liberty to appoint on a part-time or full-time basis.  For example, if the Minister <Col N="1668" /> were to appoint a retired public servant as chairman of the NCEA&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 66:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 6, to delete paragraph (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to the requirement for eligibility for membership of the council. Section 7 (a) states that if he is for the time being not ordinarily resident in the State he is not eligible for membership of the council.  That is an extraordinary <Col N="1669" /> provision from a Minister of Deputy John Wilson's standing.  Is this the Minister's attitude to the evolution of an all-Ireland education policy or his contribution to the reunification of the country?  Does this represent Fianna Fáil's attitude to cross-Border co-operation or the Government's attitude to co-operation between this State and European countries?  If it is, it is the most disastrously negative attitude I could envisage in an Education Bill.  I was appalled when I read it.  I put down an amendment simply to delete it and Deputy Horgan subsequently put down a similar amendment.  Our two names now appear on the one amendment.  We are at one on this.</P>
    <P>I am appalled that the Minister for Education could come into the House and positively promote a situation in Irish education which excludes Irishmen from Northern Ireland partaking in the evolution of policy affecting third level education in the Republic.  It is distasteful, disgusting and politically most undesirable.  I do not know if the Minister is talking to his civil servants in an effort to try to amend this policy or whether he is doing so so that he does not have to listen to me.  It is at the Minister's discretion but he is not achieving much by it.</P>
    <P>There is at present a professor in Queen's University, Belfast&mdash;I think his name is Cathcart&mdash;who is on the staff of NUU and who prior to that was teaching in a comprehensive or community school in the Republic.</P>

If the Minister can defend that I would be shocked.  It is a slur on the House that this provision should be allowed to appear in a Bill.  It is an extraordinary political decision to put <Col N="1670" /> paragraph (a) into the Bill.  Surely the Minister has more commitment to cross-Border co-operation at least in education although from a reply I received from his Minister of State, Deputy Tunney, on the extent of his visit to the North to meet his corresponding No. 1&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have come to mind.  The depth of the discussion between those two gentlemen seems to have been in rambling around on walks and so on.  If that is the extent of the commitment of the Education Ministers to the development of an all-Ireland education policy it is small and superficial to say the least.  I wonder how many visits the Minister has made to his counterpart in Northern Ireland to discuss the evolution of an all-Ireland education policy even at third level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept paragraph (a) of section 7 and I doubt very much if Deputy Horgan on behalf of the Labour Party can accept it.  It is certainly an indictment of the Minister and of his party in regard to their concern for North-South relations and it is a slur on this House if that provision is enshrined in a statute emanating from this House.  I cannot imagine anything more disgraceful than purposely to exclude a person who is ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland from the NCEA.  I did not believe my eyes when I read it and when the amendments came from the Minister's office I was certain that he would have seen the light and moved to delete this.  It must be deleted because, leaving aside the question of our relationship with the North, there must surely be an interest in involving one or two people from England or a European country when we might like to develop a certain discipline in the non-university sector.  There may be an excellent professor with Irish connections living in England and who might even have taught here but he is excluded from membership of the NCEA under this Bill.  Equally, he could live in Brussels, <Col N="1671" /> Strasbourg or Luxembourg and might have contributed enormously to the development of education policy within the EEC but he is now excluded from NCEA membership.  That is a disastrous and disgraceful attitude. Politically it can only be described as a Fianna Fáil attitude.  If it reflects Fianna Fáil thinking especially in relation to our Northern fellow countrymen I shall not stand for it and it will be voted against either on this Stage or on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I am shocked and appalled that the Minister for Education from County Cavan should come here and purposely rule out the possibility of an Irishman in Northern Ireland because of his residential situation being a member of the NCEA.</P>

      <P>I suspect the Minister is not likely to accept the amendment and more is the pity.  I have no shyness in this matter; I was just anxious to proceed with the business of the House. It is one of the peculiarities of Fianna Fáil genius and especially of their founder that they should have chosen two aims which they identify as national aims&mdash;the unification of the national territory and the revival of the Irish language&mdash;which have been of inestimable advantage and act as a powerful unifying force with large groups of people whose interests in virtually all other respects may be totally opposed to each other.  They are aims which seem with the passage of time and with Fianna Fáil Government after Fianna Fáil Government to be if anything further from attainment rather than closer.  One would have thought that by now, whatever the constitutional or legal complexities of making any reference in any legislative instrument to the entity that begins just above the Minister's constituency and ends where you meet the <Col N="1672" /> North Atlantic, we would not at any rate be excluding that area deliberately from our activities and our legislation.  Effectively this excludes the possibility that anybody from Northern Ireland can become a member of the NCEA and the possibility that anybody who is a council member and who subsequently goes to live in Northern Ireland can remain a council member despite his willingness to serve and to travel to attend meetings. Incidentally, I presume he would have to put up with the fact that his travelling and other expenses would be paid in Irish pounds but no doubt his keenness and dedication would overcome that minor handicap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a national reason for deleting these provisions and there is an educational reason which should appeal to the Minister.  In a sense, education is a seamless web; it does not stop at national frontiers.  Educational expertise and disciplines traditionally relate across national frontiers; the exchange of knowledge is a fundamental part of the transmission of knowledge.  It seems strange that the Minister is excluding the possibility that even one out of a council of 23 should form the visible embodiment of that educational and philisophical principle.  I strongly urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire the performance of Deputy Collins who worked himself into a lather over this provision expressing doubt as to my commitment to education on the basis of section 7 (a).  I should like to point out that there is no intention of excluding the services of people who live in the Six Counties, in my native province, nor is there any intention of excluding any other expertise. The Deputy mentioned Dr. Cathcart and there are many others whom I know personally&mdash;I attended a university college in the Six Counties.  What the Deputies failed to realise is that where the real value lies and the real need is is on the board of studies.  There is no such exclusion of anybody from the Six Counties, from Britain or any EEC <Col N="1673" /> country or even from the US from the board of studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That will not do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a matter of convenience as regards attendance at meetings; there is a question which Deputy Horgan raised and about which he was both convincing and eloquent, about the development of a mandarin class, people on committees of committees until, as he colourfully put it, they take off into outer space.  He did not mention that they shed pieces of themselves as they ascend, but they do.</P>
      <P>One of the arguments used in the context of the NUI for the setting up of independent universities at Cork and Galway is the waste of time of members of a faculty travelling to meetings of the NUI.  The point about the inconvenience of such a situation has been made repeatedly.  The point I made about the boards of studies is very important.  The boards of studies will have a maximum impact on the work of the council.  This has been the experience up to now.  The quality of the people on a board of studies is of great importance.  I should hope that those who have particular strength in the Six Counties will continue to be utilised by the NCEA.  There has been very strong contact with the technological sector in the Six Counties and there has been very close contact with the director of the CNAA in Great Britain with whom I have had meetings. There is no question of our becoming exclusive or insular.  Such a situation in this case would be damaging to education. Therefore, I refute the suggestion that anything in this Bill puts outside our availability the best we can get in this country or in any other country.  The section of this Bill which deals with membership of the council is similar to section 9 of the Higher Education Authority Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As requested I shall have another look at the point with which I have been dealing, but I must emphasise that all the expertise in the country will be availed of in the context of the NCEA.  There is no exclusion clause so far as the utilisation of the services of experts on the boards of studies is concerned. If and when there is need for expertise from Britain or from any of the other EEC member states we shall avail of such expertise.  The history of the studies on education here will prove that such expertise is always available.  There is a great freemasonry in education.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan rightly made the point that frontiers in education in the political sense do not mean very much. This is my belief also and I am maintaining that within the terms of the Bill such expertise as we have or as is available in any of the other countries referred to will be available to the NCEA.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, I said that one of the arguments advanced for the breaking up of the NUI and the granting of independent status to <Col N="1675" /> the universities at Cork, Galway and Dublin is that a great deal of the time of faculty members was spent travelling to and from meetings in Dublin.  I went on to say that boards of studies where experts are making inputs will have members from wherever the expertise can be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the Minister's contribution the implication is that these people from outside the State will be wasting their time coming to Dublin to attend meetings and that they are much more valuable on the subordinate boards of studies.  The Minister cannot get out of the situation as easily as that.  The policy-making body under this Bill are the council.  Membership of the council should be prestigious and should be open rather than shut to experts from Northern Ireland especially.  I say Northern Ireland because I regard the Six Counties as part of this country in spirit.  We should do everything possible to encourage participation by people from the Six Counties in every sphere of interest which is a cross-Border interest and which can be used profitably and constructively to encourage co-operation in both parts of the country.</P>
      <P>The arguments put forward by the Minister are spurious.  His attitude is to put the experts on the boards of studies, that that is where the real work will be done, but the boards of studies are subordinate to the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the board of studies being subordinate to the council.  In the matter of policy making it will be the concern and the function of the council to lay down policy.  That will not be a function of the board of studies. Their function will be to advise the council in relation to a specialised discipline. The Minister's decision, which apparently has been reinforced by his speech here, is that people ordinarily resident in <Col N="1676" /> Northern Ireland should not be allowed to be members of the council.  I object to that political decision because it is one which even de Valera would not have stood over.  Although I disagreed fundamentally with the man, God rest his soul, if he were still alive I doubt very much that he would deny membership to people living in Northern Ireland.  This is a politically insane move which may give some consolation to bigoted people in the North, who will be able to say that we do not want to consult with them or to give them the opportunity of minor participation in the evolution of an all-Ireland education policy.</P>
      <P>As an Irishman and as spokesman for my party I object to this measure.  It must be removed.  The fact that it was included in the HEA Act does not make it any better.  I reject the Minister's snobbish statement that the only good educational moves are made by Fianna Fáil, which is as inaccurate as it is ungenerous.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made an eloquent argument in favour not only of the possibility but the likelihood of having people from Northern Ireland or from any quarter of the globe on the board of studies of the NCEA.  I agree with that argument despite the fact that the board of studies, if anything, will meet more frequently than the full council.  There will be heavier demands on members of the board of studies, and for those members <Col N="1678" /> who live abroad there will be more likelihood of difficulties in the way of their attendance.</P>
    <P>I fail to see the logic of a ministerial position which advocates the possibility and predicts the likelihood of the membership of people from abroad on the board of studies and at the same time positively excludes even the possibility of the likelihood of membership of exactly the same kind of people on the council.</P>
    <P>Among other things, we are talking about the international standing and viability of the council.  I believe that one of the beneficial political or psychological side effects of such membership might be to enhance the international acceptability of the awards of the council.  As things stand at present, it is impossible for the Minister to appoint any person, regardless of his standing or his expertise, to the council. I fail to see the logic of the Minister's position if he is not only allowing it but encouraging it in one area of the activities and specifically excluding it in another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as putting the courses together is concerned, the most important place for international input is on the board of studies.  If the board of studies get it right and the council make the award, the very best possible work is being done with a view to having awards that will gain international recognition. The logic of that argument seems to be clear.  I am fully convinced that people with expertise in the various fields covered by the board of studies who live in the six counties of my province, who live in Britain, who live on the Continent or in any other country, and whose services are required, will be available on the board of studies.  The Council will be acting on the packet that the board of studies put together.  The board of studies will be having a look at programmes in institutions and it is here that the importance of knowledge of what is happening elsewhere in the field is very important. There is no exclusion of any part of this country or of any other country.  As Deputy Horgan said, education is something that crosses national frontiers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 74:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1681" /> In page 6, line 14, after &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for a term in excess of six months&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment refers to section 7 (e) which states:</P>
    <P>within the immediately preceding period of five years he has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment by a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Under that wording, if I squatted on Wood Quay and were taken to court under the Forcible Entry Act and sentenced by a court of competent jurisdiction to one week's imprisonment, I would then be debarred for five years from being a member of the council.  I wonder if that is the intention of the Minister.  That is certainly the effect of this paragraph as it now stands. Sometimes we are inclined to give support to a good cause which may be slightly outside the law and we could not support causes such as Hume Street and Wood Quay without coming into contact with the law.  I am trying to make this paragraph more reasonable by ensuring that one must be sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of six months before becoming ineligible for appointment to the council.  That would be a more reasonable attitude.  The paragraph is too punitive.  Some misfortunate person may be sentenced to imprisonment for a misdemeanour and he should not be debarred from membership of the council.  I am seeking a more liberal attitude in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to speak at any length on this amendment because the nature of our society and system of justice is such that persons who tend to be sentenced to terms of imprisonment are very unlikely to be the sort of persons to be considered for membership of the council by any Minister for Education.  Whether that is a good thing or not is another day's work.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  I understand the humanity that prompted it.  Generally speaking, prison sentences are not imposed except <Col N="1682" /> for serious offences, though there are exceptions of course.  This provision is a harsh one, but there is no precedent for allowing a jail sentence up to a certain limit so that a person serving such a sentence could be a member of the council. Deputy Horgan, Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Begley were interested in the Údarás na Gaeltachta Bill.  A similar provision was put in there and it did not attract any comment at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell received permission to raise on the Adjournment with the Minister for Tourism and Transport the question of the disastrous effects of the postal strike on the tourist industry and ancillary activities including mail order services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of any opportunity for a full-scale debate on the adverse effects of the prolonged postal dispute, I am availing myself of this opportunity, with your kind permission sir, to focus attention on the disastrous consequences of the postal dispute on a very important sector of the national economy, the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tourist industry has made very dramatic strides over the past decades.  It is now a very important element in national development and national <Col N="1683" /> progress.  In 1978 that industry earned £181 million and the projections for 1979 were £201 million.  The tourist industry in 1979 was poised to achieve a record-breaking year, reaching the magic £200 million figure.  Over the past few days my attention has been drawn to the manner in which, unfortunately, the postal dispute has been affecting all sections of the tourist industry.  I refer to hotels, guesthouses, the car hire industry, travel agencies, tour operators and the variety of activities which go to make up this very important national industry.</P>
    <P>I have received reports from various parts of the country.  I have taken the trouble to investigate the position over the past 24 hours.  I have been shocked and horrified at the manner in which this very important national industry has been thrown into complete disarray.  I have also been shocked at the possibility that, in the event of the postal dispute lasting even for another short while, the financial consequences for tourism in 1979 will be very serious indeed.</P>
    <P>I know it is difficult to quantify this financially, but I have taken the trouble to try to investigate some of the effects on the tourist industry.  It was estimated that it would yield £201 million in the current year.  From all the information available to me I forecast that, in the event of the postal strike lasting for another week or ten days, the loss in tourism revenue for the current year will be of the order of £30 million to £40 million. That is the direct loss and, with the multiplier effect which applies to tourism, that loss can be multiplied by three or by four giving a national loss in the order of over £100 million.</P>
    <P>One of the worst features of the postal dispute and the disruption in the telephone service is that many of our major tourism centres are located in areas which have had no post for the past ten weeks and no telephone service. Deputies will have read reports in newspapers yesterday from one region in west Kerry.  I am aware of what is happening along the whole west coast up to Donegal.  We are now at the end of what normally would have been the peak <Col N="1684" /> booking period.  Promotion takes place from November to January and bookings come in from the end of January. This postal strike has coincided with the peak booking period.  We are now at the start of a new tourist season and hoteliers and guesthouse owners do not know&mdash;and they have no way to ascertain&mdash;what their volume of business will be in the current year.</P>
    <P>I have seen a report from the Irish Hoteliers' Federation&mdash;and inquiries I have made among hoteliers and others confirm this&mdash;that hotel bookings at this moment, facing 1 May, the summer season, are only one-third of what they were this time last year.  If that is not final proof of the disastrous consequences of this dispute, I do not know what is.  Not merely have booking been held up, but hoteliers do not know the volume of bookings they will have.  Some people posted bookings a few days before the strike commenced.  These bookings are held up in the post and people intending to come here on holidays do not know whether they have been accepted, and hoteliers do not know who have sent bookings.</P>
    <P>The hotel industry and guesthouse owners and others provide substantial seasonal employment in areas where there is little alternative employment.  As well as being confused over the number of their bookings, they do not know the number of staff to recruit.  The hotels, during the course of the postal dispute, have not engaged in any promotional work abroad and this is bound to be reflected in tourism earnings.  They have no method of cash collection, getting in deposits, and so on.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has been drawn to my attention and which is ancillary to tourism and comes under the aegis of the Minister's Department is the mail order business.  This business is an adjunct of tourism.  It arises, directly or indirectly, largely as a result of tourists visiting this country.  The Shannon Mail Order Store which has been built up over the years into a highly successful business will have lost, by the end of this week, over £1 million as a result of the postal strike. Approximate average earnings off season are £81,000 per week, going up to about £120,000 per week over the peak <Col N="1685" /> period of the tourist season.  Over a ten week period that means £1 million has gone down the drain.</P>
    <P>From the feedback I am receiving from hoteliers and guesthouse owners, and from travel agents and people who go abroad promoting Irish tourism, one of the vital elements in tourism development is good promotion work at home and overseas.  Bord Fáilte have field staff in the UK, on the Continent of Europe and in North America who have done a tremendous job over the years.  Now all their work down the years is being adversely affected, or certainly counteracted by the notices which are to be seen in every post office in the UK and Europe, and probably throughout the western world: &ldquo;No letters or parcels being accepted for the Republic of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to yield some of my time to my colleague, Deputy M. O'Leary. The last aspect that I want to refer to is an area which could be described as indirect tourism.  It grieves me very much to learn in the last 24 hours, as I am sure it grieves the Minister who spent a period in the same capacity as I did there, that the postal dispute has been utterly disastrous and a total calamity for the Gaeltacht summer schools which attract 18,000 young people per year and provide a very valuable source of revenue for Gaeltacht householders.  We have now a Minister who has been specially designated as Minister for Tourism and Transport, and tourism has been identified in the Cabinet through a Minister as being a very important sector. Here we have the ironical situation of a Minister for Tourism and Transport who has special responsibility in relation to tourism faced with the prospect of seeing the work of years going for naught in loss of employment and loss of revenue directly to many hoteliers and guesthouse owners who have invested substantial sums of money in developing their business and who provide substantial seasonal employment, and in some cases all-the-year-round employment.</P>
    <P>This effect on the tourist industry and ancillary activities such as mail orders, the Gaeltacht summer colleges, tour operators and car-hire firms is one of the many aspects of the disastrous consequences <Col N="1686" /> of what can be described as the worst and most calamitous industrial relations episode in the history of this State.  In the normal way I would be appealing to the Minister for Tourism and Transport to bring the matter to the attention of his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  In view of the fact that the same person occupies the two posts I say to him that this is an appalling tragedy which could have been averted if the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would depart from his rigid stance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Tourism and Transport, the <i>alter ego</i> of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, has allowed himself to become the prisoner of procedures when his clear <Col N="1687" /> administrative duty as head of the Post Office is to seek an end to the dispute. The effect on the tourist industry can be described as disastrous.  This is the order season.  I ask the Minister for Tourism and Transport to speak to his other half during his sleeping hours and confide to him some method by which some settlement could be arrived at in this dispute now in its 10th week.  Tourism, a difficult industry in itself, faces the breaking down of the whole telex system on which industry depends.  The stratagems to which the hotel industry has resorted mean that tours have been interrupted. Tourist markets have been built up carefully over the years.  Orders have been displaced and ruin is facing many people in the hotel industry.  When the communications system of a State is cut off, as ours is, it is obvious that certain adverse consequences follow.  In what other EEC state would a communications strike of this length be tolerated without every effort being made to bring it to an end?</P>
      <P>One way which has been suggested from the very start is the direct meeting. Obviously, that is the requirement.</P>

      <P>It strains credulity that this Parliament should not be discussing ways of ending the dispute in the course of such a debate as this.  We are discussing its impact on the tourist industry. That impact would be lessened and the problems would be removed if we could get a solution to the dispute. However, Sir, I accept your ruling that we cannot go into the steps that would lead to an end to it.  Some kind of inertia has apparently overtaken the Department which has impeded their efforts to get a settlement.  There are complex factors at the heart of this dispute.  At least it can be said that the Minister for Tourism and Transport has not overconcerned himself to the extent of seeking a settlement in his capacity as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when he considers the effects this strike must be having on tourism.  We shall know only at the end of this season what the effect on tourism will have been.  Only at the end of the season will the hoteliers be able to sum up what their losses have been.  Last year was a record one for tourism, we are told.  The position of sterling itself assisted.  This year we must surely be joining the Guinness joke league of countries in the EEC when we consider the length of this dispute and the fact that it has been tolerated with so little effort to get a settlement over its ten weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a strike lasts so long a settlement becomes ever more difficult.  A compromise has been referred to by one of the parties in this dispute.  Surely it is not too much that the Minister for Tourism and Transport would speak to his colleague, the Minister for Posts and <Col N="1689" /> Telegraphs, and ask him not to allow himself to become the total prisoner of procedures in this matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised the question and he stayed on it for 15 minutes.  He gave Deputy O'Leary five minutes to follow on the same question.  Deputy O'Leary insists on staying on the dispute and not on the question before the House.</P>

      <P>This dispute is affecting the tourist industry; Deputy O'Donnell will agree with me on that. The Minister will agree that the Opposition throughout this dispute have attempted to be as constructive as possible under the circumstances.  I am urging on the present Minister that he speak to his near companion, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and try to persuade that member of the Cabinet that there is ample material at this moment in this dispute for settlement.  We do not have to wait another two months or another day.  The settlement material is there. The compromises have been referred to by the POWU and a figure would settle it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not need Deputy O'Donnell or Deputy O'Leary to tell me what the effects of the strike are.  From the outset I have made it quite clear both in this House and in the media that the strike would cause serious inconvenience and hardship to the community as a whole.  The strike is putting jobs at risk and is hampering the Government's job creation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally recognised that I have played a very worthwhile part in the development of tourism since I became Minister for Tourism.  It is also recognised by the tourist industry.  Quite obviously, I am concerned at anything that may cause problems for that industry. The strike is causing difficulties in many sectors and the tourist industry is not exception.  Every effort is being made by the industry through the various Bord Fáilte offices through the services of the regional tourism organisations to minimise the difficulties and to try to alleviate the problems.  We <Col N="1690" /> recognise that these problems are there and every effort is being made to overcome them.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into the background of the dispute as I did that on a number of occasions.  As the House is aware, I undertook in advance to accept the results of independent arbitration on the Post Office Workers' Union's current claims.  Wherever these claims are shown to be justified by the arbitrator I will ask the public to bear the cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept the office of mediator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have agreed to independent assessors appointed by the Employer-Labour Conference.  The Congress of Trade Unions have agreed to place all the expert advice they have in relation to assessing the value of productivity at the disposal of the union. I stated that so far as the conciliation council is concerned I would agree to have an independent mediator chair the conciliation council and that I would ask my representative on that council to withdraw.  The House will be aware that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have been making every effort to find a basis for a resumption of work satisfactory to both parties.  I welcome the ICTU initiative and I appreciate the efforts of the ICTU representatives.  After discussions, the congress issued a set of recommendations which provide for normal work to resume and for negotiations on the union's claims to be restarted straight away.  The negotiations are to be concluded within a period of two months and are to be conducted, if the union so wishes, under the chairmanship of an independent mediator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that neither Deputy O'Donnell nor Deputy O'Leary would wish to contend that the congress would be a party to proposals which would be injurious to any union's interest or to imply that they know better than congress how this dispute should be settled.  They asked me on a number of occasions to intervene personally and I wish them to know that I always involve myself closely with industrial relations in the Department <Col N="1691" /> and I have been closely involved in this case in all the congress efforts to secure a resumption of work.  We are dealing with a very difficult problem which is having and will continue to have serious effects on the economy.  If this were a simple matter it could have been solved long ago.  I can understand and appreciate the desire of many people to have the strike settled at all costs&mdash;people who are under severe pressure because of the strike, who are not in a position to apprecaite the consequences and who believe that the future will look after itself.  I am afraid the future will not look after itself.  It will be determined to quite an extent by our actions. To think otherwise is to delude ourselves.</P>
    <P>When the agreed procedures are broken down there are no structures within which we can negotiate, no structures on which we can reach a settlement. Deputy O'Leary suggested that I was a prisoner of procedures.  The fact is that this conciliation and arbitration scheme is being used effectively by all the unions in the public service and none of the unions, including the union in question, wishes to damage these procedures.  Perhaps they would like them improved or modified.  There is no problem there if we can get agreement. Deputy O'Leary is well aware of that.  I can understand and sympathise with people who are under severe pressure, who think that there is a relatively simple way of dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> On the other hand, I very much regret that there are others who are very well aware of the catastrophic consequences that could flow from the abandonment of the conciliation and arbitration scheme in this case for all the people working in the public service and for the public generally who would have to meet the cost.  These people persist in trying to make a political football out of a very grave situation.  I regret that we find a situation where, for example, we have statements by former Ministers in the Coalition Government in relation to these agreements when in fact the Coalition Government insisted on the observance of these agreements.  We should all realise that the embargo placed by the Coalition Government on special increases was a large contributory factor to the discontent which gave rise to the problem we have today.</P>
    <P>My objective is to treat the staff of the Department in an equitable and fair manner.  I recognise that I have a special responsibility to them and I am doing everything in my power to encourage them to return to the negotiating table.  I can assure them that, if they do so, their claims and problems will be given urgent and sympathetic consideration.  I appeal earnestly to them to adopt this course in their interests and in the national interest.</P>
