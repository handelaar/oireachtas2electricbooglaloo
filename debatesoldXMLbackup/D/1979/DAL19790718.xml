      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and to deal with some of the matters which have been quested for comment. For instance, in yesterday morning's papers Deputy P. Barry was reported as saying that the Government should establish whether they are able to contradict the gloomy forecast made by the ESRI, otherwise &ldquo;industrialists planning investment here will inevitably cancel or postpone their plans until the economic prospects become clearer.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The time of this House has been wasted consistently as it is being wasted now and the people of Ireland have been misled consistently. I want to spend some time dealing with the numbers as carefully as I can in order to show how unimportant they are and how they have been used to obscure the real issues.  I will come back to concentrate on what I believe to be the important issues and the manner in which they should be tackled now.  I do this because some people, including some media commentators, have referred, for instance, to estimates of the economic situation by institutes such as the ESRI being consistently more pessimistic than the utterances of Ministers and so on. That is true.  I want to draw the distinction <Col N="2833" /> as carefully as I can between the forecasts or estimates produced by outside bodies and the targets set for Government policies.</P>
      <P>First, I want to show that some of these estimates by the ESRI are on balance more pessimistic than were justified by the outcome of events.  We have before us the mid-summer forecast of the ESRI published the other day which is considerably more pessimistic than the target of the Government.  The easiest way to draw a quick comparison is to go back 12 months and ask what the ESRI were saying about 1978 in the summer of last year.  What were the then Government targets?  What appears to have happened in 1978?  I stress the words &ldquo;appears to have happened&rdquo;. That is another point that I want to deal with as carefully and as clearly as I can.</P>
      <P>The main economic targets referred to by the ESRI in June 1978 were: expected growth rate 5.75 per cent in our GNP based on growth in exports 10 per cent, growth in investment 7.5 per cent and growth in consumer expenditure of 6.75 per cent, and 5 per cent for current Government expenditure.  These are all volume terms, in other words we put aside inflation.  The Government targets were GNP 7 per cent, exports 9-10 per cent, investment 12 per cent, consumer expenditure 7 per cent and Government current expenditure 3.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>Essentially the difference is that we were expecting faster growth in investment and in consumer spending.  The information such as we have for the last year suggests that GNP did rise by 7 per cent, that exports rose by 14 per cent&mdash; more rapidly than either we in our targets or the ESRI in their forecasts were expecting&mdash;investment rose by 15 per cent, again much more rapidly than either the Government targets or the ESRI forecasts.  In consumer expenditure the volume increased 8.5 per cent, again more rapidly than anticipated, and the growth in current Government expenditure was 3.5 per cent, in other words in line with the Government's target and below the figure suggested by the ESRI.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with it.  I ask Deputies not to interrupt and to allow me to make my case. In so far as we have any comparisons they suggest, in order to show that this is not a partisan matter, that the ESRI forecasts to tend to be a bit pessimistic on balance.  Let me go back and look at the record in previous years.  The easiest one to take is 1975, the year when the ESRI were forecasting, in June, 1975, that there would be a fall of 1.5 per cent in GNP.  By the autumn of that year they had revised that downwards to a fall of 3.5 per cent in GNP.  The latest estimates we have&mdash;and I would emphasise that they are that&mdash;for the <Col N="2835" /> apparent out-turn for that year shows that, on balance, there was a very modest increase of perhaps between a quarter and a half per cent.  I could go through the figures for other years.  But I hope any fair-minded person who looks at them will establish that as the pattern. I will come back to the reason for the difference between these forecasts, which I want to stress again&mdash;that is what they are, forecasts of what the ESRI think will happen&mdash;and targets for policy set by the Government.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that it is important not to spend too much time on these sorts of numbers.  I have consistently said that in this House before, whether we are talking about figures for GNP, for employment or anything else.  Why do I say that?  Let us take the latest publication which Dr. FitzGerald is waving in front of him.  If he cares to turn to page XI, Table 2, he will be told there the apparent increases that have taken place in GNP over the last seven years, the years of this decade.  What does one discover?  If one asks what was the growth rate in 1977 one discovers that people will always say the CSO estimates it at 4.9 per cent.  Most people will not know that that is the average of two estimates, an estimate derived from expenditure information and a separate estimate derived from output information. There are quite significant differences between those two estimates. For a relatively normal, easy year, like 1977, the differences are that the output data shows 4.6 per cent and the expenditure data a growth of 5.2 per cent&mdash;a difference between the two of 15 per cent&mdash;not too terrible one might think.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Point 6, not too terrible; 15 per cent.  Yet I want to show just how great these differences can be and what happens over time.  If one looks along the table to ascertain if that is a typical sort of discrepancy, one would be inclined to say: No, not really; look at the previous year, 1976, and remember we are now two and a half years on from 1976 when the output <Col N="2836" /> data suggested 1.4 per cent and the expenditure 0.9 per cent, a difference of more than 50 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us go back further to a year I used a few moments ago when we were talking about the ESRI.  Let us talk about 1975, a year of rapid change.  The average figure suggests that a growth of .3 per cent occurred in that year.  If one looks at the two separate estimates, the expenditure data suggested an increase of 1.6 per cent, the output data a fall of .9 of 1 per cent, a total gap of 2½ percentage points or, in percentage terms so beloved by Dr. FitzGerald, a discrepancy of 275 per cent.  Therefore three-and-a-half years later we still do not know, to a margin of error of 275 per cent, what happened in 1975.  Surely this illustrates the absurdity of wasting the time of this House in spurious and irrelevant arguments about arithmetic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What else is the Minister doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is not all.  This is what Dr. FitzGerald and other Members of his party do.  If one goes back and looks at what happened each year as this book is published&mdash;and what many people do not realise is that, of course, these numbers are revised every year&mdash;for instance, what does anybody think happened in 1971 or 1972?  We now have seven different estimates for 1971; six different estimates for 1972; five different estimates for 1973; four for 1974 and so on.  The crucial point here is that not only do these revisions alter the numbers by modest amounts, they even alter our whole perception of what happened. Let us cast our minds back to 1972-1973.  I can recall very clearly the budget of that year introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley.  I remember it because it was the first year that a modest budget deficit had been introduced designed deliberately to give a stimulus to the economy.  I can recall it clearly being described as hoping to boost the growth <Col N="2837" /> rate by about 1 per cent from the 1971 figure, estimated at that time at a 3 per cent growth, hoping to increase that to about 4 per cent.  I can recall that, when the first results became available for 1972, they appeared to confirm that, because the first estimate we got for 1972 suggested a growth of 3.8 per cent, close enough to the 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>Then going back to 1973 I can recall that everybody thought there was going to be even faster growth.  There was the period of our entry to the EEC and so on, the upswing still continuing, and everybody talking about a growth rate of about 6 per cent.  Right enough, if one asked for the first official estimate for the CSO, it gave one a figure of 6 per cent.  Therefore, one would look back and say: yes, at that time the first official estimates were 3.8 per cent for 1972, 6 per cent for 1973.  What has happened every year since then?  Every year the figure for 1972 has been consistently revised upwards and that for 1973 consistently revised downwards.  So if one looks at the latest estimates published in July 1979, we are now told, if we can believe it, that the growth rate&mdash;the average of the two estimates of expenditure and output data&mdash;in 1972 was 5.6 per cent whereas the growth rate in 1973 has now fallen to 4.4 per cent.</P>
      <P>Here we are, seven years later; we have consistently revised our ideas of what happened at the time.  What this means is that, when we get to 1985&mdash;unless the statistics improve enormously in the meantime&mdash;we still will not know where we have been this year.  I hope to goodness we still will not be wasting the time of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to turn now to Deputy Cluskey and to take one other illustration of this point, when we were talking about unemployment and employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cluskey, when we were talking about unemployment, consistently tried to argue that there was not the growth in employment taking place that was being estimated by us.  He claimed that what was happening was a great upsurge in emigration.  Both inside and outside this House on a number of occasions I pointed out to him that the only preliminary estimate we had for a long time was the year February 1977 to February 1978 and that suggested an emigration of about 7,000.  The Deputy spoke consistently in terms of emigration increasing rapidly and used numbers in the region of 14,000 to 15,000 consistently as being the order of emigration that took place last year. When we now get the first preliminary, official estimates from the CSO&mdash;which we got a week or two ago&mdash;what do they suggest?  They suggest, far from there being any emigration, that there was immigration of the order of 10,000 or 11,000.  They were estimated on the same basis as he had chosen to use in his earlier remarks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a few moments.  If the Deputy had the courage now of his previous convictions he would logically want to argue that employment last year must have risen, not by the 17,000 which we are claiming, but by something of the order of 30,000 to 35,000; otherwise he would have to lead us to believe that these people who entered the country have mysteriously vanished in some manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make all these points, not to score any statistical points, but to argue, as I have said repeatedly, why I have consistently avoided going into detailed numbers in this House.  I have said it was unhelpful and irrelevant.  It is that side of the House that has tried consistently to introduce these numbers debates designed to confuse and mislead.  The reason I am doing it today&mdash;and I want to say it as clearly and emphatically as I can&mdash;is that they and I know there are all of these limitations, uncertainties and <Col N="2839" /> inaccuracies that surround statistics and he who has the greater knowledge has the greater sin, and he should not be wasting the time of this House, confusing and misleading people with these irrelevant discussions.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to undertake a programme of action.  That is what we have been doing.  I think the Deputy has a confounded nerve to come into the House, as he did last week, and say that the Government did not appear to be aware of the importance of the problem facing this country in the area of finding employment for our young people.  He was drawing attention to our demographic trends; he was talking about how there would be a growing number of young people looking for work up to the turn of the century.  He was commenting on the 60 per cent increase in the number of young people under the age of 20.  Where were the policies during his period in Government to deal with that?  Nowhere.  What happened? There was a fall in employment. Before and since we came into office we identified that problem.  I am not talking about numbers now.  I have consistently said it did not matter what the real level of unemployment was; we knew that it was high, we knew that it had increased during the four years of wasted Coalition Government; we knew that it was crucial for the sake of the country that an immediate, urgent start be made on tackling that problem.</P>

      <P>We have constantly argued that the vital task and the reason why we ought to be in this House is to identify the real problems and to identify programmes of action for solving them.  We have put forward a programme.  If people do not like that programme, if people have a superior alternative to it, it is their duty as the elected representatives of the people to say so loudly and clearly.  The only comments I have been able to identify from either of the main speakers from the Opposition benches is the remark of Deputy FitzGerald that a lot of the jobs being provided by the Government are bad or unsound because they are in <Col N="2842" /> some sense unproductive.  He is really saying that although we are supposed to be concerned about the unemployment problem of our young people he is putting them on notice that he would do far less to solve it, that he would condemn far more of them to spend their time on the dole queues or else to look around for the emigrant ship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I said at the outset that there was an important difference between the kind of forecasts or estimates which are prepared by independent bodies such as the ESRI and the setting of targets for dealing with policies.  I hope I have said enough to make it clear by now that although I have had to deal with the forecasts of the ESRI in what might be regarded as a critical manner it is not my intention to criticise them.  Let me make it clear that I welcome the work of any independent body provided the nature of that work and the nature of its relevance to discussion is clearly understood.  That is what I am trying to put right on the record this morning.  I also want to put on the record, therefore, a quotation from the ESRI report at the bottom of page 13 and the top of page 14:</P>
      <P>There is a tendency to concentrate over much on the actual numerical results of any forecasting exercise.  To do so is to lose out on the flavour of developments in the economy&mdash;in particular, the assumptions made on policy tend to obscure the very real difficulties surrounding policy choices made by economic agents in this society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are saying that we should not allow ourselves to be distracted or confused by the numbers, we should concentrate on the real policy issues.  It is in this context that we have consistently set targets.  In the two years that my Department have been in existence I have refused to publish any forecasts for that reason because there are enough independent bodies doing that already. <Col N="2843" /> One more forecast or estimate will not necessarily add anything to our understanding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Minister's employment forecast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>What is important in identifying the problems and the policies is to try to lay out some comprehensive, though clear-cut, programme of action.  An important part of that exercise is to set out targets, that is, some form of signposts or milestones against which we can measure our progress in solving the issues and problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The analogy that could be drawn very easily here is that if we wanted, for instance, to travel from Dublin to Galway we would identify the distance that would have to be travelled, the nature of the transport mode that would be used, whether one was travelling by car, train or whether one was marching, and would then set out the milestones along the route so that we could estimate the time by which we would arrive at various points along the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where one can establish if some detour is necessary because a road has been flooded or an obstacle arises along the way, whereas the approach of Deputy FitzGerald and that of Deputy Cluskey is that we should not say where we want to go.  We are not supposed to talk about full employment.  It is too dangerous an objective to set before the people.  It will intoxicate them, it will arouse their expectations unduly.  Not only should we not tell them where we want to go, we certainly should not say anything about the pace at which we are going to get there.  In their view it is very dangerous and very wrong to say how much progress one hopes to make this year or <Col N="2844" /> next year because in some mysterious sense that will lead us all astray.  That is the poverty of thought, the poverty of policy-making and the poverty of action which has been demonstrated so clearly from the Opposition benches.  That is the clear choice which faces the people in our approach to those issues.  I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that the correct approach is the path we have chosen.  Why should we not say that we can set ambitious targets and reach them provided the right action is taken?  Part of that action lies within the domain of the Government and to the extent that it does, it has been, is being and will continue to be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Other important parts of that action depend on the support and the action of others.  Here again the Government have set out quite clearly the manner in which they propose to achieve that programme and to win that support.  Though our target in respect of full employment seems to be regarded by the Opposition as an impossible dream, I would make it clear that in the early months of this year often we had had prolonged discussions with members of the trade unions and employer bodies, the trade union movement's first decision at a special delegate conference in March this year, when they were giving a mandate to their officials to enter into discussions with the Government on the talks that led to the draft national understanding, was to endorse the importance of the full employment target and to express their support for it.  They welcomed the action that had been taken by the Government in their effort to begin improving employment for our young people in particular. There, then, is the clear evidence of where an important independent group&mdash;and they are important in that they represent a large section of people&mdash;outside this House endorsed the Government's approach.</P>

The right test of whether we are pursuing the right policies this year is not related to numbers as such but to the direction of policy and in this context I am happy to know that the ESRI in their latest forecast recognise that the volume of investment this year is increasing much more rapidly.  They are talking of <Col N="2847" /> a volume increase in investment of 12½ per cent.

      <P>Before the Tánaiste and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development leave the House I should like to tell them that in my 18 years here I have just witnessed the greatest exhibition of statistical diarrhoea that the House has ever witnessed.  We have had a glaring example of Alice-in-Wonderland policies, of a Minister living in cloud-cuckoo land who chooses to entertain us with a litany of figures while our people are suffering the effects of the bad administration of this Government during the past two years and none more so than the effects of the break with sterling.  Another example of the Minister's blindness to the Irish position is his having dealt exclusively with the economic situation.  No Dublin Government have the right to decide unilaterally on the economic position of the country without having reference to the Northern position, because politics are influenced by trade and the way in which we have conducted our affairs in terms of trade with Northern Ireland and Great Britain is nothing more than an indictment of this pseudo-republican group known as Fianna Fáil, a group that were brought together in 1927 for the purpose of uniting the country and who came into <Col N="2849" /> government in 1932 on the basis of a promise to unify the country but who have driven the people further apart in a way that no other group have done in our history.</P>
      <P>Yesterday we had the example of Ian Paisley protesting in the European Parliament that the flag of his country was upside down.  Those of us in this part of Ireland ask: his country?  That is not the flag of his country, but to him it is, because we have made it impossible for him to identify with the flag of our country.  Nobody has contributed more to that than the Fianna Fáil Party, the pseudo&mdash;republicians from the Blaney blarney to the Colley folly to the O'Donoghue I do not know what.  This is the hypocrisy of a party who will go to the country with promises that will get them votes for no other reason than to get back into power, a party who have codded and fooled their own supporters with high emotions based on sham Republicanism.  Their contribution to Irish unity has been nil in the period of their existence.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that some people on the backbenches of the Fianna Fáil Party believe in the philosophy of Eamon de Valera and all their leaders. They should look closely at the position. The only person who led the Fianna Fáil Party who believed in a possible solution between North and South was the late Seán Lemass.  He saw clearly that free trade with Britain and with our Northern countrymen was colouring the politics of tomorrow.  Now we have gone into reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our break with sterling has caused confusion in the minds of the Irish people particularly in Border areas, and very particularly in the northern part of the country where, for the first time, Irish currency is foreign currency in six Irish counties, all because of the blindness of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development who, before Christmas like a child with a toy, came in here during the EMS debate, held up this abstract called the EMS and made backbench Members of the Fianna Fáil Party believe that his economic arguments were right.  He instilled confidence in the figures he quoted.  He bluffed, persuaded, <Col N="2850" /> gulled and misled decent ordinary Fianna Fáil back benchers who, if they were asked now to decide what they would do about the EMS, would give their decision and I know what it would be.</P>
    <P>I have many friends on the backbenches of the Fianna Fáil Party. Their thinking on what Ireland should be is not very far removed from my position. The only difference is that, for some reason or another, I am inclined to give more time to thinking about it than Members of my own party even who are far removed from the Border and who fall into the same bracket as Fianna Fáil Deputies who are far removed from the Border.  I am not slighting Fianna Fáil Members because of the lack of interest they demonstrate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Economic Planning and Development spent a full half hour talking about economics which are folly to the minds of the ordinary people.  Let him talk to people living in Belfast, Derry, Antrim, Down or Fermanagh who get an Irish pension and who go into a post office in Northern Ireland and get 92p or perhaps 91p for every £1 of the pension they are paid by their native Government, by the party who said to them: &ldquo;Give us a chance and we will bring you under the tricolour.&rdquo;  I wonder what old age pensioners living in Ballymena, or Coleraine, or Newry, or Strabane, think about the nationalism and the republicanism and the sincerity of the Fianna Fáil Party when they go to collect their pension and are told it is cut by 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>People living in the Republic and in receipt of British pensions go into the post office and are paid at parity.  It makes no difference to people living in Cork, Dublin, Galway or southern parts of the Republic.  People living along the Border go into their local post office in Donegal, Monaghan, Cavan, Louth or Leitrim get their pensions at face value. They get IR £10 for £10 sterling.  They do not see the folly until they go to the North to spend the IR £10 and they are cut by 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>I ask myself: where the hell are this Government going?  No Government have created more problems between the <Col N="2851" /> Irish people than this Government.  Their 1977 mandate is no longer valid.  It is time the Taoiseach understood clearly that the mandate he received in 1977 is no longer valid.  The promises he and his party incorporated in the 1977 manifesto are a sham and a shame and an affront to members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and to their supporters at county council level.  It is not possible to quote a line from the manifesto without being interrupted at county council meetings because they are ashamed of the document.  I do not fault them for being ashamed of it.  It was meant to cod people.  It was the most corrupt document ever put before the Irish people.  I deliberately use the word &ldquo;corrupt&rdquo; because they tried to fool people and get them to support them with votes.  The manifesto corrupted the minds of the people because it made false promises which Fianna Fáil knew they could never fulfil.</P>
    <P>Traditionally the banking centre of east Donegal was the town of Strabane. All the farming families, whether they were Catholics or Protestants or had no religion, had their bank accounts in Strabane.  There was nothing disloyal or unpatriotic about that.  It was a family tradition.  My relatives in the town of Lifford continued that tradition right up to the break with the EMS.  I would have continued it but for the fact that I moved six miles away from the Border.  I moved my account to a bank in County Donegal because it was more convenient for me, just as it was convenient for people living immediately in Border areas to have their accounts in banks in the North.</P>
    <P>A constituent of mine had an overdraft of £5,000 and the bank manager in Strabane said to him: &ldquo;Your Government have said your account must now be in the Republic of Ireland. You will have to go to our bank in County Donegal and negotiate a loan with the bank manager to discharge your account here.&rdquo;  He went to the bank manager in County Donegal and explained the position and the bank manager said: &ldquo;The currency is sterling in Strabane.  You will have to pay them <Col N="2852" /> in IR£s and you will need £5,800, not £5,000 to discharge your overdraft.  We cannot give you that because the Central Bank have told the Government that all overdraft accounts are to be frozen.&rdquo; These are the daily problems being caused by the break with sterling.  It was the damned nonsense of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, a shortsighted little man, that walked us into this.  He and he alone is responsible for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance may say I had the right to vote against entry to the EMS.  I said I was in favour of EMS membership when Ireland was going into the EMS, not when the Republic of Ireland was going into it.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development used terms like &ldquo;Ireland's entry&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Irish economy will benefit&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Irish people will support us in our entry&rdquo;, &ldquo;this will be good for everybody living in Ireland&rdquo;, but they were talking about the Republic of Ireland.  They were not talking about the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to give an example of the interest the Government have in unity, reconciliation and friendship.  Yesterday I asked the Minister for the Environment if he would recognise driving licences issued in Northern Ireland.  His reply was given to me in writing this morning.  It reads:</P>
    <P>There have been no recent developments on securing a bilateral agreement on matters between this country and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>My question had nothing to do with this country and the United Kingdom.  My question dealt with the unity of people, to see that the people of this country&mdash;the 32 counties of Ireland &mdash;would not have to do driving tests on moving from one political unit to the other.  The blindness of this is that the Government subconsciously give the impression of being more partitionist than any other political group. Everything they do is partitionist.  They say, &ldquo;We do not believe in Ireland being divided&rdquo; but everything they do builds a partition between North and South.  If <Col N="2853" /> this is Ireland, then the flag which Paisley said is the flag of his country is his flag.  Paisley is right and we are wrong.  There is no point in laughing at Paisley when he calls the Union Jack the flag of his country.  I mean no disrespect to our flag.  The people who designed the Tricolour meant well and it should be respected.  However, it has come to be the flag of the Republic and the flag of the republican groups who use it as a rag to infuriate Irish people of another Irish tradition.</P>
    <P>Year after year the members of this Government visit Wolfe Tone's grave to preach to the dead but they scorn anyone who goes to the North to speak to Protestant Irish people as being some kind of a political queer.  When one walks the streets of east Belfast one is in some way disloyal, in some way less Irish.  Members of the Fianna Fáil Party have pointed across the House at me and said, &ldquo;He is a queer guy.  He talks to Unionists&rdquo;.  My contribution to Irish politics and Irish public life has been more fulfilled than the contributions of the hypocrites who go to Wolfe Tone's grave each year and preach to the tomb stones.  It was Tone who said that it is necessary to &ldquo;forget all former feuds, to consolidate the strength of the entire nation and to form for the future but one people&rdquo;.  What is the nation?  Have Fianna Fáil now defined the Nation as being those people living in the 26 counties, living in the Republic?  Speaker after speaker, including the Taoiseach, continue to refer with monotonous regularity to &ldquo;this country&rdquo;, &ldquo;this nation&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Irish people&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;.  If we have defined the 26 counties as being Ireland we should be consistent about it.  If partition is here to stay, Ian Paisley is no longer part of this nation.  The trap is that they are also saying to Gerry Fitt, Austin Curry and John Hume, &ldquo;You are also no longer part of this nation&rdquo;.  That is the folly of argument.</P>

      <P>The Minister is confused. He has linked being Gaelic with being Irish.  I have nothing but praise for the people who promote Gaelic culture but they should not lead us into a Gaelic nation. One can be Irish without being Gaelic and Ian Paisley could prove that he is Celtic.  He does not have to be Gaelic to be Irish.  I am not arguing about what Ian Paisley thinks he is.  I am arguing about what we think he should be.  If we define Ireland as the Thirty-two counties and if we define the Irish as the people who live here, he is as Irish as the Minister but he does not have to conform to the Minister's thinking to prove that he is Irish.  Neither do I have to conform to the Minister's thinking and thank God for that.  If I were living in the North I would have grave doubts about the leadership that is being foisted on the Irish people by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we joined the EMS we argued that it was wrong to join in advance of Britain.  I know that information was passed by the British Government to the Government that Britain was not against joining the EMS but that she was against its structures at that time and that after the general election Britain would join the EMS under either a Conservative Government or a Labour Government. Members of my party suggested that the conditions of entry be renegotiated and that we should ask for better terms.  We <Col N="2855" /> asked for a 6 per cent band but the Minister for Economic Planning and Development said that it was not necessary, that the 2¼ per cent band would protect our position with sterling.  We joined the EMS on 13 March.  Seventeen days later, one hour and five minutes after the exchange banks opened, we had broken the link with sterling.  Since that time our economy has rocked.  Not alone has our economy rocked, the Fianna Fáil Party have rocked.  It is not too long since the Taoiseach had confidence in the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  It is not too long since many Fianna Fáil backbenchers had confidence in him.</P>

      <P>I did not say that.  I said that he is probably a better Irishman than the Minister because he does not have to prove that he is Irish by waving tricolours, by singing rebel songs, by attending Gaelic football matches and by running to visit tombstones.  He has a Celtic culture that makes up the foundation <Col N="2856" /> of the State.  I am taking the most extreme political case in Northern Ireland to illustrate that there are people living in this island who are not Gaelic and who will never be Gaelic but they are as Irish as Deputy Hussey is.  I know them.  If the Minister wants to build an Irish nation he had better realise that that is the direction he is going in. Otherwise he should be honest about it and say that he does not want an Irish nation, that he wants a Celtic or a Gaelic nation.  In that case he should admit that Partition is right and that he will support Partition.  He should go in front of his convention in Galway at the next general election and say that he is no longer interested in the unity of Ireland or the Irish people, that he believes now in Partition, that he believes in the two nations theory which Fianna Fáil castigated Conor Cruise-O'Brien for before the last general election because, believe it or not, Deputies Moore, Hussey and Conaghan are proving that Conor Cruise-O'Brien was right with this glib talk they have of the Irish nation and the Irish people as an exclusive right of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>There is nothing funny about it.  This type of thinking has cost the lives of 2,000 people in Northern Ireland.  Everyday Irish people who happen to wear RUC uniforms are being shot by other Irishmen.  That is the reality.  If the Minister thinks that is unpatriotic he should go and ask the families of the fathers and husbands who have been killed what nationality they belong to.  It is nothing to laugh at because nobody realises more than I do that the Scottish live in Scotland, the English live in England, the Welsh live in Wales and the Irish live in Ireland and it does not matter a damn into what political grouping they were born or grew up in or what influence they got from their parents or what church they go to on a Sunday morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are serious about building an Irish nation there are a lot of naked things that we have got to realise and one of them hits very hard at the core of <Col N="2857" /> Fianna Fáil because they never tried to build a nation of Ireland; they tried to build an exclusive nation of Gaelic people that even excluded Catholics who happened to be looking for conciliation or unity among the Irish people and their traditions.  It excluded people like me because I did not conform to their type of thinking; I did not wave a flag.  The Government will have to think a wee bit more seriously than the Blaney blarney that has influenced them or the Colley folly that also influences them.</P>
    <P>I knew the only person leading Fianna Fáil who could clearly see that the unity of Ireland could only be brought about by trading with our Northern countrymen and by having a free trade agreement with Britain.  That was Seán Lemass.  I often wondered why he was in that party.  The only answer I can think of is that he was young enough to be influenced by the emotion of Fianna Fáil in his younger days and he found himself trapped.  But let not those people of Fianna Fáil forget that what Lemass could see as the solution&mdash;and what I acknowledge as Lemass's theory&mdash;was a common market between Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  If we had harmonised our economies, if we had kept step with Britain, if we had continued to have a harmonisation in costs and prices it would not have been difficult for Protestant businessmen and Protestant industries to sell their goods south of the Border. Because of that intercourse we would have had a better relationship between North and South.</P>
    <P>While there is free trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain those businesses that sell goods to Britain from Northern Ireland will continue to be influenced by that type of economy.  Is it wrong therefore for me to say that Fianna Fáil are so blatantly wrong in their economic policies because they ignore completely the political dimension of our dealings with Northern Ireland?  No Government, whether it is a Fianna Fáil government, a Fine Gael government, an inter-party government or a Labour government can have it both ways.  It is totally inconsistent to argue about the political unity of Ireland <Col N="2858" /> and, on the other hand, ignore the politics of Ireland and deal unilaterally with the economic position.  The country that gives the greatest trading example is Yugoslavia.  Yugoslavia argues continually that if it does not get enough trading with the west then it becomes part of the Eastern bloc and that it is unhealthy for them to sell too much to Eastern Europe and to the Russians because the people will eventually think along those political lines.  If we cannot see our own position, far off then let us look somewhere else to show us the example.</P>
    <P>I am now saying that the economic policies of Fianna Fáil since their foundation have been wrong.  Until such time as the Government grow up and realise that if we aspire to the unity of Ireland, which will resolve our security problems, cause an Irish people to have peace and harmony and do away with all the hatred and death and destruction and bind together the Irish people in one nation, there is no escape from the direction that I am advocating.  It is shortsightedness on the part of the Government to take short-term economic advantage or financial gain by trying to fiddle with the EMS.  It can be argued that we are holding parity with the other European currencies but we ignore the fact that, if we had stayed with sterling, when Deputy Moore goes abroad he could buy with the Irish punt many more Deutschemarks, many more francs and many more lira than he can now. We cannot buy with the present currency value of the punt the amount of Deutschemarks, francs and lira that we could have bought if we had stayed with sterling.  Therefore, it will cost more to buy oil and other imports and in our trading with Britain in this financial year the loss will be so colossal that it will affect even the very poorest in our community. Everybody will suffer.  The quicker the Government realise that their messing around with the EMS has been a calamity for this State the quicker will they realise that their mandate no longer holds and they will go to the country and seek a new mandate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Before going on to make my contribution, I must refer to the happenings  <Col N="2859" /> here this morning while the Minister for Economic Planning and Development was speaking.  We saw an exhibition from the Opposition parties of bad manners and downright rudeness and irresponsibility.  They reminded me of school many years ago when we were breaking up for the summer holidays and the boys would act in a very irresponsible manner.  They were schoolboys.  But today we saw a spectacle here with members of Fine Gael and Labour carrying on in a most disgraceful manner.  It is no object lesson for the people in having respect for this national assembly if this is allowed to happen.  Anyone who speaks in the House is an elected Member and has the right to speak.  I am very disappointed that the leaders of the two parties did not try to assert themselves and bring some discipline to their members.</P>
      <P>This is the Adjournment Debate. When we look at the national scene let us not forget that the problems of the country are the concern of everyone of us who has been returned to this House by the people.  We have had a very chequered history if we go back to famine days and on through the time of Parnell, and 1916 and after that.  We always had problems but up to the 1920s they were caused by outside forces and a foreign Government.  We have had control of our own affairs since 1921 and we must now see how we are handling them. Never before has our society been so affluent. By that I do not mean that everybody has enough or that we are satisfied with our progress because far too many people have not yet got an acceptable standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, we must try to build the economy so that everybody will have an opportunity of providing for his needs. We must find employment for young people and make our old people comfortable. All our resources should be so distributed that we will have social justice. We have become selfish, all of us, and we no longer care for our neighbours sufficiently.  Over 2,000 years ago we were given commandments which we are now disregarding.  Much of the suffering in our country is self-inflicted.  There is chaos on the industrial scene.  I do not <Col N="2860" /> attempt to apportion blame for it.  Some of the industrial disruptions may be blamed on both employers and unions or their members.  In other cases, it is the fault of the unions; in others, the fault of management.  We must try to reestablish the urge to achieve the common good.  We need an injection of common sense.  If we saw an old person being attacked we would feel outraged and would probably go to his assistance but I have seen old people suffer frightfully because of no light, no heating or because something else was missing.  Yet the industrial unrest goes on and even seems to be getting worse.  If we believe that we are our brother's keeper and if we want to build up the nation for the good of all, we must ask where are we going wrong.</P>
    <P>We read about the boat people of Vietnam.  We pity them and we are taking in a small number of refugees.  But for many years we had our own boat people, people forced to go abroad for employment, once in coffin ships and later in better craft, but they had to go to get work abroad.  Unless we put the industrial situation right we shall have more boat people leaving our shores. There may be social injustices that cause men to strike and these must be removed.  There are ways of remedying these grievances.  I praise the efforts of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who have worked hard to try to get harmony in industry.  Probably 90 per cent of the people involved in industrial disputes want peace and progress: that is the tragedy.</P>
    <P>Where have we gone wrong?  I have asked trade union leaders and business people this question.  One gets various reasons but, in fact, we are not improving the position.  According to the Taoiseach's statement, in the first six months of this year we lost over 1 million man-days by disputes.  Each strike or dispute is eventually settled but it seems we want to inflict suffering on ourselves and we do not settle disputes in a reasonable time.  A letter in last evening's papers suggested that we want another Jim Larkin.  He was one of the greatest trade union leaders ever to appear on the national scene, especially on <Col N="2861" /> the labour scene, but if he were here to-day he would have a very difficult task in trying to blend the work force into an organisation which would always bear in mind that the common good was the aim to be achieved.  Larkin would grieve to-day at the sufferings of many people. The trade union leaders and the employers are also very concerned. What is it then that is causing the great suffering of the people today?  My voice will not carry much weight with either side but I appeal, not so much as a Deputy but as an ordinary man in the street who sees much suffering especially among old people, to all concerned to examine the social ills of our system, determine to eradicate them and not go on inflicting suffering.</P>
    <P>I often find it hard to understand the Opposition attitude to the Government plans for the development of our resources and the creation of full employment.  I do not suggest the plans are perfect or that the Opposition have no right or duty to criticise but the aim of full employment is something we all dreamed about.  Before we got our freedom people said that when we got rid of the conqueror we could plan our own economy and achieve full employment. Surely this is a worthy idea?  The Minister for Economic Planning has been derided because he is striving for and believes we can achieve full employment. People are very glad that the Government have this idealism.  There are many people who say we cannot achieve it.  That is not the point.  If we feel despondent, no matter what our aim in life, and say we cannot achieve it, we will never achieve anything.  The people appreciate that this idealism is worth following.</P>
    <P>When people say it cannot be done and the Government say it can, we should remember the remark of Bernard Shaw that &ldquo;some people saw things that were and asked why, but we saw things that never were and asked why not&rdquo;.  He spoke abuot the Irish people.  I feel the same way now.  Some people see unemployment and ask &ldquo;why&rdquo;.  We never saw full employment but we said &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;  We can achieve it but we cannot do it on our own.  Together with <Col N="2862" /> the Government, trade unions, employers and so on we can dedicate ourselves to the cause of full employment.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why the Coalition lost the last election was the parents were worried because their children were not employed.  People said they would change the Government in the hope that they would have better results under a new Government.  Parents and young people are concerned about employment and I get very angry when I hear people say that people do not want to work. The vast majority of the unemployed want to work.  All our efforts should be concentrated towards that.  The Opposition can put forward ideas and criticise but they should not deride the fact that full employment is obtainable.  If we believe it we can do it.  We have a duty to do this.</P>
    <P>Democracy in many countries today is under great pressure.  We are a democratic State and believe all men are equal in the sight of God.  We have a duty to give whatever talents we have towards achieving full employment.  If the people see that we are striving towards this they will back us.</P>
    <P>The Government must bend their mind towards the creation of a just system of taxation.  We know taxation can bear unfairly on many people.  It bears mostly on parents with young children.  These are the people who must be looked after adequately in our taxation. I back any means the Government take to tax luxury living.  The family, being the basic unit of our society, must be given all possible help and a distribution of the national wealth in great proportions. The family is taking a great bashing from influences inside and outside the country.</P>
    <P>When I speak of this country I mean North and South.  Unfortunately we do not have much influence over the North. If we can convince them that we have the basis of a just society, that we believe in providing employment and good housing, this will find an echo in the Six Counties.  Deputy Harte spoke about east Belfast and the North in general this morning.  We should have made common cause long ago with people from the working districts in the North.  We <Col N="2863" /> have suffered in ways they have suffered from unemployment and bad housing. We can find common ground here for unity.</P>
    <P>Without going into academics, the man from the Shankill Road does not realise that economics and not so much religion has played a great part in the frightful upheaval that has taken place in Ulster in the last 10 years.  Deputy Harte spoke about the GAA.  The GAA is a great organisation but I was never a member of it.  I played soccer.  I went to the North, to Ravenhill and Windsor Park.  I did not feel I was any less an Irishman for doing that.  I felt affinity with the people there long before the trouble started.  I would be very much at home in discussing the merits or demerits of a team playing at Windsor Park or Ravenhill.  There is goodwill in the North towards us.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy Harte lives near the Border and is, perhaps, more aware of the situation than I am, but in the Fianna Fáil philosophy we look for a united nation and this will come.  People in the North need basic things like full employment and good housing.  A lot of our people need them, too.  We can say to the people in the North that we are striving towards a better society and that they are welcome to be part of that.  Let us go forth together striving for these targets.</P>
    <P>When the Opposition decry the efforts of the Government towards full employment, I cannot follow their line of argument. If the Government are not going the right way about it the Opposition should say so.  If they are not and the Opposition put forward good arguments as to the way they should, we can take those suggestions and be glad of them. The day is past when the only duty of the Opposition was to oppose.  It probably never was their duty.  We live in dangerous times and we should have a more responsible attitude from the Opposition than was displayed this morning. There are many problems facing us particularly in relation to our city.</P>
    <P>About one-third of our population live in the Dublin area and that figure is increasing all the time.  Since the industrial <Col N="2864" /> revolution big cities have tended to expand to a great extent because they have attracted people to them.  While decentralisation might help to stem that flow, I do not think any democratic country has been able to curtail such growth.  Various Ministers have tried to preserve even one green belt around our cities, but few cities were successful.  We tried to preserve a green belt in Dublin but, because we have to face enormous pressures in relation to housing, we were not successful.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that within a few years the population of Dublin will exceed one million.  For that reason we must give more thought to the city problems which are becoming more apparent and serious.  Housing is the basic thing we need.  I know of many young couples who cannot get proper accommodation except at exorbitant rents.  We need a tremendous investment of capital and thinking in housing.  We must avoid the mistakes made in other cities in the past and use the resources we have to the utmost to create a proper society in the city.  Many of the problems and temptations of young married couples would be removed if they had proper housing.  Our people tend to marry at an earlier age and, therefore, the demand for housing is great.  We are all aware that building techniques have changed to such an extent that houses can be built a lot faster than ten years ago.  Great efforts have been made by the local authorities in Dublin to deal with this problem and they have managed to reduce the number of applicants on the waiting list but that number is still at an unacceptably high level.  We must do everything to cut that number drastically.  Such problems will not go away.  All sectors of society must be called into play to help solve this problem. We have a great opportunity of creating a society here which could be a model to other countries.  We have a minimum of resources and little influence over external happenings that affect our standard of living but in spite of that I believe we can succeed by using our best talents in the Oireachtas and in industry and commerce to guarantee our people a good standard of living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2865" /> The basis of a lot of our trouble in the city is the fact that the educational system available to many of our people is not good enough.  We need more schools and a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio.  We still need the help of religious orders who have served us well in the educational sphere down the years.  While it may not be very popular to praise such orders today I believe we must show them appreciation for the work they have done.  Now more than ever their influence is needed on the educational scene in the city.  People would not criticise the raising of extra taxation which is earmarked for a better educational system.  The Minister for Education is doing a good job.  His thinking on educational matters is refreshing.  We should show our confidence in him by backing him in his efforts to create an educational system which will guarantee to all our citizens who desire further education that this will be forthcoming.  A lot of tasks face us but the Government are on the right track.  Hopefully, by next year we will have made further progress in the fields of endeavour I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>Two years ago, after the general election, Fianna Fáil were returned with a tremendous majority. My comment then was that as the people had chosen we must accept their decision.  I felt that if all the things that were promised in the manifesto, which is now known to rival Hans Anderson's fairy tales, were carried out, we would be doing well.  I believed I could gain from some of the promises.  I decided to give the Government a chance to put their plans into operation, if they had any plans.  For that reason in the last two years, as the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy pointed out recently, I have occupied a back seat watching Fianna Fáil moves.  I watched that Minister in particular because, of all the Ministers appointed two years ago, he was the one with the promises which culminated in him taking off his coat to fight the oil giants before heading for China to announce a massive increase in the price of petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last two years I discovered <Col N="2866" /> that Fianna Fáil announced the promises in the manifesto only in order to gain re-election.  They did not have any plan.  Obviously, they depended on the ideas of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  They either accepted those ideas as being the way which the country could make a tremendous surge forward or they knew he was talking through his hat but felt that because he would succeed in getting them returned to office they were worth a try.  Whatever the reason, they got back into government and their return to office was followed by a series of mistakes, things which one could not picture happening to seasoned politicians.  One would imagine somebody, particularly somebody who has been in government before, should not make the mistakes which have been made time after time, not alone by new Ministers, but by the Taoiseach and the senior members of his Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The evening immediately before the last general election the Taoiseach announced, in a statement on television, that he was going to wipe out the dole queues immediately.  He was asked specifically when it was going to happen and he said immediately they got back into office.  Several times since he has spoken about this problem and as recently as a few months ago he repeated that in a few years' time&mdash;it was three first, then he felt that was a bit close and would be within the life of this Government, so he put it back to five; in four or five years&mdash;there would be no dole queues.  This is probably what Deputy Moore was talking about. Probably he heard the same statement.</P>
    <P>I was a trade union official for 30 years.  Therefore I know as much about employment, and putting people into employment, as does anybody else in this House.  The so-called programmes which have been put before the House and the country in no way are likely to create full employment, about which the Taoiseach spoke also.  As a matter of fact I am one of those people who believes that going into the age of the silicon chip will make it extremely difficult to reduce unemployment substantially, but we must aim at that goal.  Yet <Col N="2867" /> Fianna Fáil, knowing that they cannot do so, knowing that what they are saying is pure claptrap, have repeated it again and again.  The fact that they are blatantly saying things that are untrue was evidenced by this morning's antics in this House.  I regret as much as anybody else the fact that there was a continuous barrage of interruptions during the time Deputy O'Donoghue was speaking.  I can sympathise with him very much because on numerous occasions, as a Minister speaking from the front benches in this House, I was subjected to the same type of barrage by the people now protesting from Fianna Fáil. However, that does not justify it.  I do not think it is a good idea.  Everybody is entitled to make the statements they want in this House.  But I can see the point of people who know that statements being made just could not be true, and indeed the person making the statement knows that what he is saying is pure and simple bluff.  Therefore, there is a certain amount of sympathy for those who suddenly find themselves so incensed that they interrupt.  But that does not excuse what happened and I regret it as much as anybody else.</P>
    <P>To go through the Minister's remarks as quickly as I can&mdash;and half-an-hour does not allow very much time for this sort of exercise&mdash;my successor is in a Department whose title has been changed from that of Local Government to the Environment, which has consisted simply in having new notepaper printed, nothing else.  There has been no effort made to alter the face of the Department, rather simply the need to give the impression that something was being done.  The first point I would make in this respect is that the amount of money being made available for local authority housing has dropped consistently. Furthermore the number of houses being built by local authorities this year, in my opinion, will be an almost new low record.  Yet we have Deputy Moore coming in here telling us of the necessity to build houses in Dublin, particularly in the city centre.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind Deputy Moore that he was one of the people who was a <Col N="2868" /> consistent critic of mine when I was allowing over 40 per cent of the amount of money allocated to local authority housing to be spent in Dublin city, when I sanctioned CPOs for areas in this city, including the one he represents, which had been refused by Fianna Fáil predecessors of mine.  I would remind the House further that houses being built since the change of Government are simply the result of efforts made by the Government of which I was a Minister, and carried out faithfully by Dublin Corporation. My sympathies now are with Dublin Corporation because I believe they will not be given the money to continue that programme.  I believe that the housing situation in Dublin, and indeed throughout the country, will deteriorate badly.  I hate to say this but the small man in this country, the working man who would not have sufficient money earned or saved to build a house, indeed, even newly-weds looking forward to building their own homes, have no hope whatever of being able to go into a new house because, first, the State will not provide the money to build local authority houses and, secondly, the price of private houses has gone out through the roof.  It costs now twice as much for a site, even in a backward, rural area, as a few years ago would have built a house on that site.  This is what my successor has done as Minister for the Environment, and I have great sympathy for the people who will suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>Coming now to roads, can anybody in this House say that our roads were ever as bad?  They are a disgrace, as one can see travelling from one end of the country to the other.  No effort is being made to improve them because the money just is not there.  There was a small percentage increase in the allocations this year but then the Government notified the local authorities that for the first time VAT must be paid on road materials and machinery.  The end result is that the net amount given for road building and repairs has been reduced, with an appalling situation obtaining throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not know what has happened in regard to water and sewerage grants.  We <Col N="2869" /> seem to have gone back to the bad old Fianna Fáil system of to-ing and fro-ing <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Department, making it impossible to get schemes implemented or off the ground, if that is an appropriate expression to use in relation to water and sewerage.  This is the treatment we are receiving from the Department of the Environment, which has been given a new name and nothing else.</P>
    <P>I always remember, when our Government were in office, the Minister for Labour, then Deputy G. Fitzgerald, coming in here like a little terrier every time there was even a rumour of a strike, when he was up on his hind legs shouting at the then Minister, Deputy M. O'Leary, telling him what he should do to stop the strike; what he should have done to prevent it, that every strike begun should not have been allowed; that it was his job to sit up all night to deal with them.  What did he do when he assumed office?  He seemed to have disappeared; he just went; he intervened in no strikes, and they got worse and worse.  Perhaps it was just as well he kept out of them.  Then last weekend I noted that a terrible thing happened him: he had gone down to Cork and had to come back all the way to Dublin to talk sternly to the oil men on strike.  I could not understand why he had not remained in Dublin in the first place because all of us knew that the row would burst over the weekend, and it would have been a very good idea to have made an effort to have settled the dispute here.  But to go home and come back again was too much for him; he should not have been asked to do it.</P>
    <P>I want to make myself very clear on one thing.  I believe that trade unions were and are very necessary.  I believe they are representative of a large body of working-class opinion and that it is their job to negotiate wages and working conditions. Having said that, I believe also that possibly they could have more discipline within their ranks.  I believe it is wrong that any small group, no matter how incensed they may be about the conditions in which they work or the wages they earn, should, on their own, decide that they will hold, not an area or <Col N="2870" /> a section of people, but the whole country to ransom.  If they are dissatisfied with the service they are getting from their unions, there is a vehicle by which that dissatisfaction can be brought to the notice of Congress, when Congress can investigate it.  And, if they are not doing their job, there are always other trade unions to which they can resort.</P>
    <P>I believe also that it is the responsibility of the trade unions to ensure that they give service to those people.  There must be a better way than simply going on unofficial strike.  I will not agree that the employers are innocent of blame in this charge.  Many of them simply allow things to get so bad, refusing to negotiate that eventually their employees become sore, with a resultant unofficial stoppage of work.  One of the things wrong is the quickness with which employers who have got into trouble, or when an unofficial dispute occurs, are prepared to negotiate directly with the people who have gone on strike rather than with the trade unions concerned.</P>
    <P>I am a great admirer of the trade union movement, having been part of it for so long.  They must put their foot down, no matter what Government are in power.  They must ensure that they are the people who do the negotiations and that the mavericks who want to go off at a tangent to get something for themselves on the side are not allowed to do so.  Speaking as a trade union official of 30 years standing, I believe that the responsibility must be carried by the trade unions themselves.  If a trade union official is not doing his job there is always another trade union official who will be able to do it.  The ICTU and other groups of unions feel very strongly about this, and if they would come together we might get somewhere.</P>
    <P>At present there are numerous strikes and rumours of strikes.  There are stoppages for this, that and the other, some of them reasonable, some unreasonable. It is very annoying when I go to get my lunch and there is no electricity, and that evening there is no light because for one reason or another there is no electric power.  Because the electricity has been cut off water is not being pumped and whole areas are without water.  This is in <Col N="2871" /> Ireland in 1979.  Some of this is caused by industrial disputes and some by sheer inefficiency on the part of the people running the organisation.  Some of it is caused because the Government do not appear to know what they want to do.  It is a little bit too much, when we look back at the postal strike, to realise that the terms offered and accepted in the end would almost certainly, had they been offered, have been accepted before the dispute started.</P>
    <P>Let us not talk about what the workers who were out lost.  They lost a lot and, as one who has been involved in disputes, I know what it costs to a worker and his family.  You do not take such a decision lightly and when it is taken things are very hard when you stand up to it.  The postal workers were on strike for a long time, and the ramifications of that strike will be with us for years to come.  There were the lost orders, the tourists who could not come in, arrangements of various kinds which could not be made, the old folks who could not hear from, talk to or write to their friends and relatives for many months.  The people responsible for that were the Government of this country who fought the issue deliberately under the impression that they could starve those strikers back to work.  But for the fact that the Presidency of the EEC was coming along today, that strike would still be on.  It would be an awful embarrassment if correspondence could not be passed backwards and forwards and the members of the EEC would look askance at the strike-bound country with its Prime Minister, the Taoiseach, as President of the EEC.</P>
    <P>The strike was ridiculous and outrageous and it will never be forgotten that Fianna Fáil allowed it to drag on for so long.  They could have settled it easily but they made no effort to do so.  I would give no bouquets whatever to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs because, decent man that he is, either he took orders from the Government or, because of his nature, kept his head down.  The ostrich act may be all right but it is no way for a Government Minister to behave with a storm raging as this storm was for 18 weeks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2872" /> I listened this morning here to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and I have heard him on a number of occasions previously, but this is the first time that I have seen a brazen, hard-necked person come into this House and say that there was net immigration at present.  All the evidence proves that there is emigration of somewhere between 11,000 and 20,000 people per annum and yet the Minister for Economic Planning and Development has discovered suddenly that there is net immigration.  He got the IDA to print his little advertisement suggesting that key jobs were available for a lot of people, Irish, British or otherwise, who would come over here to work.  If there are any key jobs here they should be filled by the almost 100,000 people who are still unemployed despite the promise in the Fianna Fáil manifesto to do away with unemployment completely.</P>
    <P>A bouquet was thrown at the Minister for Education.  I will not be too critical of him, and perhaps he is doing his best. The manifesto said that there would be a reduction in the class sizes immediately and that new school buildings were to appear all over the country, but these do not seem to have happened.  At present, despite our free education, little children of six, seven or eight years old come home with notes from their teachers looking for £10 and £12 for school books.  Multiply that by five or six as the children grow older and that means that very little is left out of £100 for some unfortunate working man.  Also, because his child is living 50 yards outside the limit, that child cannot even travel to school on the bus while more wealthy people living further down the road have no hesitation in taking the vacant seats. If the Minister for Education really wants to live up to the reputation which he had before he became Minister as the result of his statements in this House, he will want to do a lot more than he is doing at the present.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance introduced a budget here.  The trouble with Ministers for Finance is that they have come to accept that the budget is not the annual housekeeping account.  It is now something to put before the Dáil more or <Col N="2873" /> less to please the Government's supporters and to give the impression that something is being done.  On two occasions at least the Minister has given a solemn guarantee that there will be no supplementary budget this year.  I will wait to see what will happen before the end of the year.  One thing he did this year was to remove completely the subsidy on some foods and he also reduced substantially the subsidies on others. The income tax remission which he talked about in the budget has turned out to be the dampest of damp squibs. The tax bands were changed and the people who were paying under the A band are now paying under the B band, and they find that, although they seem to have a higher personal allowance, they are paying more tax out of the same amount of money.  The people mainly affected by this are those at the bottom of the ladder.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Economic Planning and Development was responsible for what happened with regard to the EMS.  We had statements and counter-statements. The Taoiseach made statements and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development here and on radio and television contradicted flatly what the Taoiseach said.  In some peculiar way the Taoiseach was under the impression that a grant of £650 million was being given and in the same television programme he was corrected from Brussels by one of the television commentators, who shall be nameless, who explained that there was a slight error and that what he was talking about was a loan.  A person who does not know the difference between a grant and a loan of that amount knows very little about anything.  Then there was the question of the £45 million.  We were getting a £45 million grant.  We were getting a £45 million subsidy.  So far we have got nothing. Yesterday evening it was reported in the papers that the £45 million was to be given and the guess was hazarded that that money was now going to be spent in tax remission.  I understand that the £45 million is the interest which will be paid on whatever loan we get and either we <Col N="2874" /> will not get that or, if we do get it, it is for the purpose of passing it back again to those who lend the money.  Then it will be said that it is not available for the purpose of paying tax.</P>
    <P>Lined up beside that was the question of the £60 million which the Minister for the Environment said he was going to give to those who would be converting from oil to solid fuel.  I do not believe a word of it.  He said that there would be no inspection.  There might be the odd spot check, but anybody at all who applied, whether having a house or not, would get that £600 grant, or at least so it appeared in the papers.  I am not holding the Government or the Minister responsible for what appears in the papers, but a kite must be flying somewhere which they have used.  It is not possible to do what is suggested.  The Minister himself in this House last week was very confused over what he had said he was going to give.  He said he would make a statement, but that statement does not appear to have been made yet.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of oil and petrol.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy was reported recently as having said that there would be heating oil supplies available in August.  If he said that it was simply for the purpose of taking the heat off the Minister for the Environment.  A lot of people were converting, in the hope of getting the grant, to solid fuel and this would be one way of preventing them doing that.  I met a lot of people who said they were thinking of converting to solid fuel but if the heating oil was made freely available it would be all right.</P>
    <P>Shortly before Easter I had a question down to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy about petrol and heating oil.  He was not present and neither was his Minister of State, Deputy R. Burke.  His Minister of State, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, answered the question. For up to ten minutes she berated me about scare stories and said that there was no question of a shortage of any kind, there was plenty of oil and plenty of petrol and it was people like me who were causing the trouble.  Shortly afterwards a further question was asked <Col N="2875" /> by somebody else and the same reply was given.</P>
    <P>I commented on a radio programme that I thought it was appalling that we should be put in the situation where the petrol and oil supplies were apparently almost non-existent and yet the story was being given out that there was plenty available.  The Minister then came on the scene.  He was supposed to have taken on the oil giants and he was going to tell them off.  Again, the newspapers suggested that we would even be able to get supplies of oil from Russia if the oil giants did not toe the line.  He was not going to allow them to raise prices. Whatever he did after he left the country and went on his trip to China, we then got a notification that prices were going up.  They have gone up twice since and we understand they are going up again.</P>
    <P>We also have queues.  We have the cowboys, the people who will look for petrol although they have got a full tank, bring it home and fill it into something else, who should not be facilitated in any way.  We have queues at petrol stations and people are very badly incommoded. The Minister, so far, has done very little about it.  He played around with the £5 minimum amount but that is no answer. While I dislike petrol rationing I firmly believe that if the petrol shortage is as great as it is supposed to be we have got to do something very serious about it. Perhaps the Government may have to think about petrol rationing.  The Minister assured me that the coupons were ready if that was necessary.</P>
    <P>The question of diesel oil is far more serious because farmers have complained to me that they cannot get enough oil to carry on their normal farming work.  The amount of oil they are getting is not sufficient.  Somebody who normally got 500 gallons now gets 100 gallons and then he has to waste time going back looking for more which he sometimes gets and sometimes does not.  As far as heating oil is concerned I believe we are in for a very cold winter.  I am glad the Minister is here because I would like him to make a categoric statement about the matter.  I believe he knows there will be a severe shortage of heating oil.  He said he would ration it if <Col N="2876" /> necessary.  He did not say how he would do it but when the time came he would have his mind made up.  The people who use central heating oil are entitled to know what will happen.</P>
    <P>I am proud of the fact that on 24 May 1974 I made an order that no new house could be built without at least one fireplace which would use solid fuel.  If I did not do that we would still be in cloud cuckoo land going around with our little can of oil expecting that the central heating oil would last forever.  We should finish this codology about whether or not oil supplies are there and arrange to let the country know exactly what the position is.  We are grown up and we should know.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the EMS.  I do not know if people realise that we have reached the stage where we are importing an enormous amount of English goods.  We are importing household goods which practically everyone buys in the shops.  Nine out of every ten articles sold are British made.  We are paying an 8 per cent subsidy on those goods.  The Minister for Finance had the hard neck to go on radio and television last week and say that people should thank them because it will give us a better competitive edge by our pound being worth 8 per cent less than the British pound.  He said that this was all right and he then referred to Germany, a strong country, and said that we needed a strong currency to be a strong country.  I do not know how he added those two together and got them to agree.</P>
    <P>The cost of living has gone up much more than the cost of living index shows because things which are not included in that index are being bought every day by our people and we are paying 8 per cent more because the stuff is British.  If we want to know what we should do about industry why do we not attempt to manufacture in the country a lot of the stuff we are importing?  The Buy Irish campaign, which was started some years ago and on which a lot of money was spent, is a complete joke because people do not buy Irish.  I insist every time I can on getting Irish goods but many people do not bother their heads buying Irish at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2877" /> The Minister for Foreign Affairs was very annoyed when the leader of the Labour Party attacked him about the way the troops in the Lebanon are being treated.  He was not prepared to do very much about it.  We have only to look back and remember that he is the man who was advising the IFO and other kindred organisations about the necessity to have the 50-mile limit.  It is written into the Fianna Fáil manifesto that Fianna Fáil thought that a 50-mile limit to protect our fisheries was necessary. Now nobody in Fianna Fáil wants to hear anything about that.  If that is the kind of Government we have come to, then what Deputy Harte said when concluding is right.  What President Carter has succeeded in doing in America might be copied here.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would go away for a couple of weeks, bring his ministers together, have a long talk with them and they might then hand in all their resignations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately in the time available to me I have to be brief and I can only cover parts of two topics relating to my Department and even those by no means as fully as I would wish.  I make that point at the outset lest I be accused of not dealing with umteen matters that I could deal with, if I had the opportunity to do it, in the course of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, on the question of industrial development, I would like to say that the pace and rate of overall expansion by Irish manufacturing industry during 1978 was not equalled in any member state of the EEC and, indeed, to the best of my knowledge, was not equalled by any country in the world during that year.  Our manufactured exports rose to £1,623,000,000 representing a volume growth of over 10 per cent and manufacturing output increased by nearly 9 per cent.  A most encouraging development was the gain in labour productivity at 6 per cent, which demonstrates the underlying strength of our manufacture base and its potential for further sustained growth.  Employment in the manufacturing sector in the December <Col N="2878" /> 1978 quarter was 6,700 higher than the year previously.  This was the best performance since the boom year of 1973. An even better outturn would have been achieved were it not for the continuing incidence and disappointing level of job losses.</P>
    <P>Economic dynamism, the need to adapt to the growing impetus of marketing and technological changes and the new international division of labour make some redundancies inevitable. However, there is no doubt that in certain instances jobs are lost and factories closed because of the failure to invoke in good time the support and assistance that are available from the State agencies.  This country is fortunate in that we have the best and most professional industrial promotional agency anywhere in the world.  The track record of the Industrial Development Authority is the envy of all our competitors.  Its success owes nothing to luck but owes everything to unstinted dedication and unrivalled expertise.</P>
    <P>The IDA's approach to industrial planning is both comprehensive and systematic.  Recently the authority published a new industrial plan for the period 1978 to 1982.  I propose to mention to the House some of the principle objectives and strategies of the plan, the primary aim of which is the creation of a total of 75,000 grant-aided jobs in manufacturing industry in the five-year period, 1978 to 1982.  This level of job creation has never been achieved previously, not even in the world-wide trade and investment buoyancy of the early seventies.  The challenge is even more daunting because of the recent international developments regarding energy and the damaging labour disputes here in vital public services.  The scale of job creation necessary in the years immediately ahead means that the IDA's programme for the attraction of industry from abroad must remain an essential feature of our development strategy.  New overseas projects are expected to contribute about 45 per cent of the total job approval target of 150,000 contained in the plan.  This will not be easy because of the intensifying and sometimes bitter competition which exists  <Col N="2879" /> for a declining global stock of mobile international investment.</P>
    <P>Since there was so much talk in the House earlier today about targets and growth rates, it may be worth recording here again that all the targets set in terms of industrial development last year were met and in most cases exceeded.</P>
    <P>The new 10 per cent corporation tax for manufacturing industry being introduced from 1 January 1981 to replace exports sales relief will act as a powerful stimulant to investment in job creation for both Irish and overseas sources and will also constitute a further spur to existing industry to hasten the pace of modernisation and re-equipment programmes.  In designing this generous and imaginative incentive, it was recognised that the manufacturing sector has a major influence on the economy and must provide a large proportion of the new jobs that the Government have aimed to create in the coming years.</P>
    <P>If our industrial development efforts are to succeed we must identify and share in the international growth and investment that has taken place in certain sectors and subsectors of industry.  Projects in these growth areas offer the best prospects for producing goods of a high value added and for providing high quality and enduring employment.  The IDA intend to concentrate on such sectors as electronics, mechanical engineering, consumer goods, including household appliances, sport and leisure equipment, health care and chemical products and food.  Ireland is fast becoming one of the prime locations in Europe for the rapidly advancing electronics industry.  The growth of the health care and chemical sector in terms of output in exports in the past two years has been nothing short of phenomenal. This industry now employs about 5 per cent of the total manufacturing workforce.  An integral and equally important part of the IDA's sectoral strategy will be aimed at the development of industries based on our natural resources, particularly agriculture, timber, minerals and other resources. The benefit to the nation of the exploitation of new investment opportunities in some of these areas will be in the form of <Col N="2880" /> savings in our imports and exports expansion as well as the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>In 1978 the IDA approved for grant assistance projects with a job potential in excess of 30,000.  That was the highest rate ever of job approvals.  If the IDA are to maintain and improve on this performance in the next four years it will be necessary for them to have adequate physical resources.  A considerable part of their budget for 1979 which, incidentally, is well in excess of £110 million, is being expended on the acquisition of sites for the building of advance factories under the largest factory construction programme ever undertaken by the authority.  This will entail an investment of £27.5 million and the provision of two million square feet of factory space.  This is double the total floor area provided under all previous programmes combined. The authority estimate that more than half the overseas promotive projects which they will be endeavouring to attract in the next few years will be seeking to locate in advance factories.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is essential that in the face of growing international competition the IDA are in a position to offer advance factories as part of their incentive programme.  In 1978 the authority purchased 712 acres of land for industrial development purposes and since 1 January last a further 325 acres have been acquired.  Because of the time constraint that is all I have time to say for now in relation to industrial development. I would summarise my remarks by saying that we have ambitious programmes, programmes which the country and the authority are capable of meeting but as a nation we can create the obstacles.  Some external obstacles are created for us by, for example, the energy situation in recent months, but by far the greater and more important obstacles are those which are being created here at home.</P>
    <P>For the Opposition to describe these ambitious targets as foolish and to express the hope frequently that the targets cannot be met is an indication of the form of activity that passes for opposition in this House.  To say the least it is unpatriotic.  We have a considerable task on hands, but the nation should unite in <Col N="2881" /> trying to achieve the targets we set ourselves.</P>

      <P>Targets that are ambitious are much more worth while than targets which would be achieved in any event.  I wish to deal now with some aspects of the energy scene.  Ireland is assuming the Presidency of the EEC at a most critical point in the world energy situation.  In the past six months meetings of the Heads of Government of the Nine which took place in Paris in March and in Strasbourg towards the end of June were dominated by the energy problem.  Again, at the Summit meeting of the major industrial countries which took place in Tokyo on 28 June those present devoted the greater part of their attention to the energy situation, the seriousness of which was accentuated by the further increase in OPEC oil prices which was announced at that time.  As a result of the initiative taken on 18 June by the Council of Energy Ministers, the Community countries were able to adopt a leading role at the Tokyo Summit and were successful in pursuading the US, Japan and Canada to proceed on lines that have been approved already at Community level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of our Presidency, an immediate objective at Community level is to obtain agreement on a system of registration of prices of oil imports both from other member states and from third countries.  It is hoped that the establishment of such a system will bring more transparency into the oil market and will show the extent to which supplies and prices are affected by the spot market.  There is an obligation on the Community and on industrialised countries to bring activities on the spot market under control.  The oil-producing countries are encouraged to increase the official OPEC price when they see the ridiculously high prices that are obtained on the spot market.  In early September it will be necessary for us to undertake a major programme to give effect to the decision reached by the <Col N="2882" /> European Council in Strasbourg in June and by the industralised countries at the Tokyo Summit.</P>
    <P>During the past few months we have been facing the full implications of the fact that we are an energy-deficient country.  We are dependent on imported energy to the extent of more than 80 per cent and our oil import dependence level is in excess of 75 per cent.  In 1978 our total fuel consumption was about eight million tons of oil equivalent and in 1979 the figure is expected to be of the order of eight and a half million tons equivalent.  Of these, total oil imports accounted for about six MTOEs in 1978 and for about six-and-a-half MTOEs in 1979.  In recent years we have had one of the fastest growing economies in the Community with the corollary that our energy consumption, especially our oil consumption, has likewise increased substantially.  There has been a 50 per cent increase in oil consumption in the past ten years.  It is clear therefore the economic growth with its concomitant of increased energy usage will continue in Ireland, as productive employment for our growing population must be made available.</P>
    <P>The Irish oil market traditionally has been the preserve of the multinationals trading here who, between them, have about 85 per cent of the market, the remaining 15 per cent being shared by a number of smaller companies.  In the first quarter of this year, despite the shortages arising from the troubles in Iran, the oil companies delivered into consumption substantially more oil than in the corresponding period last year. This pattern continued in the second quarter, although not to the same extent, as the effects of the loss of Iranian oil began to bite.  Nonetheless, over the first six months of this year, total deliveries into consumption were still significantly higher than in the first six months of 1978.</P>
    <P>The complete certified figures are available for the first five months at the moment.  The six monthly figure will not be available for about another ten days. The certified figures for the first five months show that the deliveries into consumption of oil products here to the end <Col N="2883" /> of May will be 8.6 per cent up to the corresponding deliveries for the corresponding five month period in 1978. The fact of this increase does not, of course, alter the fact that there were shortages in some oil products.  We could not expect to escape unscathed from the effects of the widespread shortages in some oil products which many other countries are experiencing.  When we consider that both the US and the United Kingdom, despite their very substantial indigenous production, have had appreciable shortages in various oil products, we can perhaps regard ourselves as fortunate that the supply constraints under which we have laboured, relatively speaking, have not been all that great.</P>
    <P>In IEA countries generally, the shortfall in oil supplies across the board is now 3 per cent, a slight improvement on the shortfall of 4 to 5 per cent which existed earlier this year.  The shortfall is greater in some products than in others, notably gas-diesel oil, which is in widespread use in this country.  There is, therefore, some concern that sufficient products will not be available for all our needs this coming autumn and winter. The Government must, therefore, consider very carefully the manner in which available supplies of likely to be scarce products such as gas-diesel oil should be allocated, bearing in mind that the reasonable needs of essential industries must be met before all else.  This is the over-riding requirement.  As I told the House last week, some allocation of gas-diesel oil for domestic heating purposes will be made.</P>
    <P>As regards motor spirit, the supply position into the country has eased in recent weeks, and I emphasise the phrase &ldquo;into the country&rdquo;.  The oil companies are not expecting pressure on supplies of motor spirits in the immediate future, assuming they are in a position to import and distribute as they wish.  Assuming that the level of supplies continues on the same broad basis as it is at present &mdash;and I want to emphasise that assumption&mdash;no undue difficulty in getting supplies of motor spirit over the coming winter is anticipated at this stage.  There is, of course, the critical threat to supply <Col N="2884" /> and normal distribution arising from the current industrial dispute which has not yet been fully resolved.  There are difficulties at the moment in the internal distribution within the country of both motor spirit and gas diesel oil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which were accentuated in the past week or two by an industrial dispute.  That industrial dispute is at least partially resolved, as I understand the current position, and I hope very fervently that it is about to be fully resolved.  To say the least of it, it is very unfortunate that the difficulties we have had over a period of months should be so seriously accentuated at a vital time like this, particularly in terms of the tourist season, by this unfortunate development.  I do not want to say any more about that dispute, which I hope will be fully out of the way in the very near future.</P>
      <P>I want to turn now to the availability of certain fuels and sources of energy in the coming winter, and what the position is likely to be.  The availability of adequate solid fuel supplies is a major concern. I arranged for a series of meetings in my Department with the principal coal suppliers during the month of June so that the position could be reviewed in good time.  The companies fully appreciated my anxiety to have arrangements made to meet the anticipated increase in winter demand.  They told me they have sought very substantially increased supplies from Poland and, in some cases, they were looking at alternative sources.  My Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs have taken steps to explain our position to the Polish authorities and to press for the increased supplies which are being sought by the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar series of meetings held with the distributors of bottled gas confirmed that the companies in this fuel sector also anticipate a significant increase in demand and are making arrangements accordingly.  It is worth pointing out that, while one hesitates to make definitive forecasts of sources of energy <Col N="2885" /> supply for obvious reasons&mdash;the forecasts everybody in the world made a year ago were proved to be wrong&mdash; nonetheless the present indications are that liquid petroleum gas, or bottled gas as it is called here, is likely to be available in greater quantities, and more readily, than many other alternative forms of imported energy.  We are fortunate that the North Sea oil fields produce considerable quantities of liquid petroleum gas and that domestic demand for it in Britain is not as high as it would be <i>per capita</i> here, or in some other countries, because the British are very widely served by the huge quantities of natural gas they have and which they are able to utilise so widely.</P>
    <P>As Members of the House know well, turf production is very sensitive to weather during the harvesting season. The weather in the early part of this season was very poor and, as a result, Bord na Móna's current programme suffered an early setback.  The latest information I have is that a good deal of the leeway has been made up.  With continued favourable weather conditions &mdash;and this remains a critical assumption&mdash;the board's current targets of 880,000 plus tons of sod or machine turf, and 360,000 tons of briquettes, can be substantially achieved.  Weather apart, the quantity of briquettes which can be produced is limited by current plant capacity.  In the immediate future it will not be possible to meet all demands for this fuel.</P>
    <P>In due course there will be increased production from a new factory at Littleton in County Tipperary which is scheduled to commence production in 1981 and a further new factory which I announced recently at Ballyforan in County Galway which will commence production in 1984.  When the additional factories are in full production the total Bord na Móna briquette production will be 750,000 tons or more than double the existing production.</P>
    <P>I come now to deal with the question of the ESB.  It is an understatement to say the position about the electricity supply is not as I would wish it to be. The total generating capacity of the <Col N="2886" /> board is about 2,800 megawatts compared with a peak demanded of about 2,000 megawatts at the height of last winter.  Given these figures, any ordinary citizen would be forgiven if he or she had difficulty in understanding why we have been having power cuts during what amounts to a heat wave.  The present situation results from a complex combination of circumstances, some of them foreseeable and some of them not.</P>
    <P>At this time of year a substantial part of the ESB's generating capacity is out of use for plant maintenance.  It is obviously good policy to have all regular maintenance done within the period of least demand.  Due to a backlog of maintenance, the amount of plant out of line over the past few weeks has been considerably higher than would be normal. This backlog of maintenance has been carried forward from last year when no maintenance at all was carried out to the board's generating plant for a period of 14 weeks, due to an industrial dispute of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>The most critical factor in this difficult situation is created by the demarcation dispute at Poolbeg generating station in Dublin which has resulted in about 20 per cent of the capacity needed to meet current peak demand being out of service.  There is also force maintenance.  Certain items of plant which have developed faults have to be shut down temporarily for repair, which happens from time to time.  The general shortage in capacity has put a considerable strain on the hydro-stations, which are small and are no longer of great significance in the make-up of the board's generating capacity.  The water levels have run down because of the considerable use of these hydro-stations in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>They have reached the stage where the board cannot allow the level of our two main generating rivers, the Shannon and the Erne, to fall any further as it would interfere with the amenities on these rivers.  This is the factual situation. I am not suggesting that we should accept it with resignation or equanimity.</P>
    <P>The accumulation of problems has undoubtedly created a position of special difficulty.  The ESB and everyone in it <Col N="2887" /> have special responsibilities and in certain respects they enjoy special privileges.  Our whole system of centrally controlled utilities will run into serious difficulties if particular groups decide to pursue their own interests first and ignore their privileged status and the responsibility which they have to the public, including in particular their colleagues in other employments.</P>
    <P>While we have had numerous power cuts in recent months it is correct to say that at no time was the shortfall in the board's generating capacity in excess of 270 megawatts.  If, therefore, the dispute at Poolbeg between two unions had not existed the board would not have had any power cuts, which is the way we expect it to be and the way it should be. Even allowing for that dispute, if the board had not had to contend with the position that exists on the Border we would have been able to depend on the inter-connector which operated between 1970 and 1975.</P>
    <P>In no sense, therefore, can it be suggested that the management of the ESB has been lacking in making arrangements and allowances for normal demand and foreseeable increases in demand. It is now faced with the two situations, both of which are beyond its control and which are having a serious effect on the country.</P>
    <P>It has not been my practice to make comments on individual industrial disputes but this dispute is not a dispute between the ESB and any of its unions; it is a dispute between two unions about which union 13 men should be members of.  In other words, the dispute is whether union A or union B should collect the weekly union dues of these men.  The apparent enmity between these two unions can be carried to the extent that it causes losses in industrial production running into millions of pounds.  Apart from the losses caused to industry, the ESB have lost about £1 million because their biggest and most efficient thermal station is out and they have to generate electricity through a less efficient station and use more oil to generate less electricity.  The direct cost to the board in terms of oil costs alone has been £1 million.  The cost to the country is, of course, incalculable. <Col N="2888" /> In terms of lost production alone it certainly runs into millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>What worries me more is the kind of loss that one cannot quantify: the factories that will not now be established here because this has happened.  We have what is sometimes called a strict moral and legal code.  Some years ago I read in a newspaper a report of a person being sent to jail for 12 months for stealing one pound of butter from the shelf of a supermarket.  That person is regarded as being legally culpable and morally culpable.  I suppose at the time the cost of a pound of butter was 40p or 45p. That person got 12 months' imprisonment for the crime.  For all I know, that person may well have been hungry.  A small group of men can, without any apparent culpability, either legal or moral, steal thousands of jobs which could have been created for our young people.  I wonder if some moral cupability might follow if this House were to create some legal culpability.  It is something that we might well contemplate.</P>
    <P>I started my short contribution to this debate half-an-hour ago by setting out the existing situation in regard to industrial development, by setting out the achievements of last year and by setting out the enormous opportunities that exist in this year and in each of the next three years if we as a nation want to grasp them.  It is a matter of personal choice for all of us.  If we are prepared to condone and tolerate a petty squabble between two small British-based unions about who should control 13 men and collect their weekly dues to the extent that it destroys thousands of jobs for our young people, then we do not want to succeed.</P>

      <P>I am in a magnanimous mood today and will be pleasant, which is a change, as I can be abrasive on fisheries and other subjects.</P>
      <P>I have a certain amount of admiration for the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, much more than for the majority of his colleagues.  I find his contributions and his answers at Question Time to be forthright and honest.  He is very willing to give whatever information he has at his disposal.  It is a wonderful change to see a Minister in such a light especially when we have seen such a pompous ass as the Minister for Economic Planning and Development&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw it.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy made a very detailed, very relevant contribution today.  I am not in a position to contradict some of the figures given and some of the statements made. Many of them seem to be reasonable and make good sense.  No doubt some of the party spokesmen on my side of the House will contradict certain parts of the speech.</P>
      <P>I would join with the Minister in complimenting the officers and personnel of the IDA throughout the country.  As he stated, they are probably the most outstanding agency not alone in Europe but in the world when it comes to attracting industry.  It is a highly professional outfit and we should give them every encouragement irrespective of party affiliation.</P>
      <P>The Minister blamed several factors for our present industrial problems and for our energy problems.  He is quite correct in saying that there are external obstacles. We know that the cut-back in oil supplies, from the Middle East in particular, has affected industry and commerce here.  He also referred to internal obstacles.  I would point out that when it comes to internal obstacles it is the Government's job to see that these are overcome.  The Minister made an impassioned plea at the end of his speech about disputes primarily within companies such as the ESB.  My answer is that, as in all business, the buck stops somewhere at the top and the buck in this case stops at the front bench of the Government, the Cabinet.  It is their job to see that these internal obstacles are overcome.  They have got the power to legislate if necessary to see that those internal obstacles are overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that the nation should unite to achieve industrial prosperity and national prosperity.  Of course it should, but it is our duty to point out the shortcomings and the failures of the Government and their <Col N="2891" /> policies.  While we wish the Government well&mdash;and we would be poor Irishmen if we did otherwise&mdash;we say it is their job with a 20-seat majority to see that those obstacles are overcome.  There is not a lot that we can do other than give moral support.  We are not here to be destructive in our criticism but to point out where the responsibility lies.  Maybe the Minister should have made the speech he has made here today inside at a Cabinet meeting.  Maybe he should have spoken to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Finance and in particular to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  I do not see the relevance of his speech in terms of the general public unless the Government themselves are prepared to take action.  It is not good blaming inter-union squabbles unless legislation is introduced or unless the Minister for Labour intervenes to see that such squabbles and such pettiness do not ruin the economy which, as the Minister pointed out is the fastest growing in Europe.  It should be, because we are the most underdeveloped nation in Europe. It is not any great boast to say that we are the fastest growing economy; we expected to be the fastest growing economy.</P>
    <P>I was perturbed that the Minister told us here today that there is likely to be a crisis in regard to supplies of solid fuels in the coming winter because we had all assumed that the obvious alternative to the cut-back in fuel supplies from the Middle East, supplies of oil and petroleum, was solid fuel and various Ministers in recent weeks have announced a major scheme of grants for conversion from oil-fired systems to solid fuel heating systems.  We assumed that there was a never-ending supply of such fuel from Britain, the Continent and the United States.  The Minister's statement here today that these supplies are not unlimited and may not be as great as we have anticipated must give rise to concern.  The schemes which have been announced for conversion are welcome and are an obvious solution.  If we are not going to get oil we will have to find this solid fuel alternative.</P>
    <P>It is a grave matter of concern that we <Col N="2892" /> have power failures, even in the middle of a heat wave, as the Minister described it.  The fact that there is non-stop industrial unrest here is of major concern to every citizen.  We have had a series of strikes, particularly in the past six months, which have crippled industry. They have crippled the country and have done untold damage to commerce and to our tourist industry and now we are faced with more ESB dispues.  As the Minister rightly stated, we cannot expect progress and we cannot expect the rate of growth which we anticipated unless something is done.  Again I say it is back to the Minister and back to the Cabinet. It is their problem.  Let us see them doing something about it.  That is what the people of this country voted them in for in 1977.  They came in on a wave of euphoria with an overwhelming vote of confidence by the people.  Now they are half-way through their term of office and the public have shown their discontent by the massive anti-Government vote in the recent European and local elections. Surely the message must get home that the public out there in the streets and in the countryside are not satisfied?  They elected the Government to do a job and they have not done it.  They have two years left and they are now expected to see that what has not been done in the past two years will be done before the next general election is held, probably in 1981.  The message has not only seeped through, it has flooded through and we have seen the Parliamentary meetings of Fianna Fáil, official and unofficial, going on in recent weeks, holding inquests, blaming individuals for the hostile reception that the party workers got during those recent elections.  I have no doubt that that message came across.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Taoiseach and the other leaders of the Government will listen to the message and that they will act accordingly.  We saw a little bit of activity on the part of the Minister for Labour at the weekend.  As Deputy Tully stated, the man who was so militant, so aggressive during his time in opposition should be dealing with the type of disputes referred to by Deputy O'Malley but up to now one would hardly know that there was a Minister for Labour in the country.  Far too often small militant <Col N="2893" /> groups in key services such as the ESB are holding this country up to ransom. That situation cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The public expect leadership and direction.  Instead the Government are giving the impression of helplessness and hopelessness and appealing to the Opposition to help them out, blaming us for sabotaging certain aspects of their policy.  We are not here to sabotage: our criticism is constructive.  If we had a majority such as the Government have I have no doubt we would be taking strong action at present.  I cannot see why the Minister has to appeal to us to do what is the Government's duty.</P>
    <P>The most alarming aspect of the situation is that I do not foresee any imporvement in the immediate future or for several years to come.  There is an imbalance between the private and public sectors.  The prosperity of the 1960s and the 1970s meant that people in private enterprise, whether self-employed or in private industry reaped more rewards and gains than those in the public sectors. The natural reaction of those in the public sector is one of discontent; one could call it jealousy or greed but it is only natural, if we see somebody doing the same job over the same hours being paid considerably more, to feel a sense of injustice.  Probably it is not sinful to feel as they do because they feel underprivileged and they are beginning to kick.</P>
    <P>This is the root cause of our present industrial unrest.  It is coming primarily&mdash;not totally&mdash;from the public sector.  Well-educated people are being paid less than those with inferior qualifications.  It is quite common to see a young fellow who has left school without even passing the intermediate certificate examination five or six years ago now driving around as a company representative in a Mercedes or company car with all expenses paid and earning considerably more than a qualified engineer or other university graduate who is tied to a civil service or local government salary.  I see no overnight solution for that problem.  The discontent that type of situation evokes <Col N="2894" />&mdash;perhaps I am extreme in my example&mdash;is fairly widespread and something will have to be done.</P>
    <P>I have advocated that we should move more away from the public, nationalised industry type of society which we had been building over the years and turn back towards private enterprise in a bid to make ourselves more competitive so that people who are now tied down without opportunities of promotion or of earning more will have an opportunity to make the same progress as those in the private sector.  That will not be easy. Recently I have come across an everincreasing demand when an industry gets into financial difficulties that it should be nationalised&mdash;everything should be nationalised.  I think this very idea is retrograde.  We should be attempting to denationalise many of the State-sponsored bodies we have.  We live in a world of free enterprise and growth and progress will be stultified if there are too many national corporations where initiative is stifled and the level of income not on a par with private enterprise.  I should like to see Members of the Government adopting that theme or even discussing it, because at present we seem to be rather at a dead end.  Discontent in the public sector seems to be growing and as a result the number of strikes is daily increasing.  Their effect on the economy is absolutely crippling.</P>
    <P>As spokesman for transport, telecommunications and technology I have an interest in such semi-State bodies.  I often refer to them as nationalised bodies because I do not see the difference between nationalised and semi-State, which may be a nice way of saying the same thing.  I have only had that portfolio, so to speak, for a few weeks and it will take me some time to look into the workings of the bodies concerned.  Some of the bodies involved are Aer Lingus and Aerlínte, the B &amp; I, Irish Shipping and CIE, which is probably the largest. Last evening I advocated that in the case of a company like B &amp; I which cannot make sufficient profit, in what seems to be a very lucrative trade&mdash;the cross-Channel car ferry business and the passenger business&mdash;to provide for its own capital needs, the Minister should give <Col N="2895" /> serious consideration to handing over such a company to private enterprise or else amalgamating it with a shipping company which can make a profit.</P>
    <P>Last week I advocated that in the case of CIE, instead of cutting back services and creating thousands of redundancies, which is what CIE have been doing for the past 12 or 15 years and losing considerably more money&mdash;losses this year we are told will be about £50 million which will have to be provided by the taxpayers&mdash;instead of allowing that to happen and have the loss increasing from year to year, we should consider hiving off sections of CIE operations to private enterprise which has shown that it can make a handsome profit out of the less lucrative bus runs or freight runs. That should be our future objective.</P>
    <P>There are many other State companies either losing money or not making the money they could make if properly managed and if a proper spirit of co-operation was engendered in the work force.  That is the type of spirit and national pride the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy spoke about here today.  The best way to get that spirit is to hand as many as possible of these semi-State projects back to private enterprise and get a good working relationship between employers and employees.  The greatest failing at present in the public sector seems to be in industrial relations.  The last postal strike and the previous strike in the Post Office engineering section were totally unnecessary and could obviously have been settled in a matter of weeks if there was a proper public relations setup in the civil service section concerned.  I hope to see a move in that direction.  There may be resistance from the unions but it is in the interest of the employees to see that they get the best possible conditions of work and staff relationship.</P>
    <P>In my view that type of staff relationship can best be provided through the aegis of the private sector. As spokesman on telecommunications, I give a guarded welcome to the report adopted by the Government two weeks ago whereby the telecommunications sector would become a semi-State enterprise involving private investment <Col N="2896" /> potential.  That is a move in the right direction.  Whether it is sufficiently away from State involvement to private involvement I do not know.  I will get expert advice and do intense study on that matter.  The telecommunications and postal service should be taken out of the hands of the Civil Service.  There was the alarming fact that the Minister had not consulted with the unions on the matter as promised 15 months ago.  In answer to a question last week he said he hoped to redress that failure.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke at length about the employment prospects and maintained that the Government had a wonderful record of increased employment since attaining office.  I wonder. One can make statistics lie or one can twist them to suit one's own argument all the time.  The statistics that are put forward, which have been contradicted by this party, are not really correct.  I regard any employment as productive. A lot of employment given in the last two years has not been creative.  Much of it has been schemes such as the youth employment scheme which is very temporary and has no lasting effect.  It is a glorified way of giving people on the dole more money.  They do a certain amount of work but it is not productive or lasting.  I fail to see how it can be termed as a reduction in the unemployment figures.  A lot of new employment is being created in the public sector. That is non-productive.  We cannot clap ourselves on the back for increasing employment in such a manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to job losses. Unfortunately there has been a lot of those.  Overall the genuine creative employment content in recent years must be extremely small if we remove the type of public sector and temporary employment schemes to which I referred. They have been offset by many job losses such as those in the Minister's own constituency due to Ferenka and other such closures.</P>
    <P>In the Fianna Fáil manifesto great play is made of the fact that, if returned to office, they would see that vast employment would be created from the development of natural resources. Employment from such development is a <Col N="2897" /> minus quantity.  In answer to questions last week the Minister, who had been so vociferous in Opposition about the setting up of a zinc smelter and the amount of employment it would generate, admitted he had grave doubts as to whether the zinc smelter would ever be set up due to the fuel crisis.  It is one of the resources we were promised so much about which did not materialise.</P>
    <P>In my constituency and in neighbouring ones we have the near collapse of the leather industry which is based on native raw materials.  We have seen the closure of two of the only four timber processing plants in the country which used a vast amount of the output of State forests. Instead of expansion we are going in the reverse direction and have closures. There are opportunities for tens of thousands of extra jobs in this sector of the timber industry.</P>
    <P>As regards meat processing, which is referred to in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, meat processing factories are in dire straits and have been for some time.  A large part of the responsibility is due to the idiotic idea of introducing a 2 per cent levy on all major farm products. That has meant a serious cutback.  We have seen closures in Dublin as late as last week.  The development of native resources with a view to increased employment has been a colossal failure.</P>
    <P>I have been trying for the last three months to raise the question of the restrictions put on legalised salmon fishermen by the Minister for Fisheries. He has evaded the issue on every occasion. He promised me three months ago that he would introduce the Inland Fisheries Bill.  As yet he has not done so. There has been a serious cutback in the incomes of legitimate salmon fishermen who number some 3,000 people.  They have been coming to me looking for medical cards for supplementary welfare allowances because they cannot make ends meet.  The Minister and the Government promised them before the last election that if they got back into power they would increase their catching power by allowing them to fish a deeper net.  What has happened is that they have reduced the size of the nets the <Col N="2898" /> fishermen have been using.  They reduced the length of the season and the length of the fishing week from five days to four days.</P>
    <P>They have put good hard-working people into a poverty-stricken situation. It reminds one of west-British landlordism at its worst.  No excuse has been given nor has any attempt been made to compromise or consult with the fishermen concerned.  It is about time the Minister went out and met them.  One cannot take away people's livelihoods overnight with a wave of the hand and say the situation will be reviewed next year.  A lot of these people will have to go out of business.  No attempt has been made to compensate them for their losses. The Minister has tolerated illegal fishing by unlicensed fishermen on a large scale on the west, south-west and north-west coasts.  He has refused to review the system of allocating licences which would legalise the operations of a lot of the men presently being prosecuted for unlicensed fishing.</P>
    <P>There are a great number of anomalies in the present inland fisheries system particularly in the issue of licences to drift net fishermen.  The Minister should have brought in the Bill three months ago as promised so that we could discuss these anomalies and rectify the wrongs being perpetrated at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a stocktaking time, particularly on the backbencher and Opposition side, when we look at the performance of the Cabinet and the Government.  On a positive note, three major documents have come forward during this Dáil session.  Those documents were not debated in any detail here or outside.  I am referring to the recent review of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the IDA's plan for 1978-82 and the road development plan for the 1980s.  There will be many major consequences of the implementation or otherwise of those documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of implementing the IDA plan will involve total investment of fixed assets of £1,800 million.  For that investment it is proposed that we will receive 75,000 new jobs&mdash;not approved jobs&mdash;<Col N="2899" /> by the end of 1982.  That is an enormous investment in job creation.  The IDA highlight a number of areas which will have to be tackled as they progress through the plan.  The main areas concerned are infrastructure, telecommunications and co-operation.  They state that there will have to be willingness to eliminate red tape and bottlenecks where they exist, in the interests of job creation.</P>
    <P>The report on the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was referred to by Mr. W.A. Lynch in the course of a radio programme when he spoke on behalf of what I assume to be the administrative section of the Department. He felt his members would not cooperate with the implementation of the report on the basis that it would have certain upsetting effects.  Having read the report and considered its implications it is my belief that the staff of the Department, for the first time in many years, will have a wonderful opportunity for advancement if the proposed semi-State bodies are established.  Effort will be rewarded and progressive members of the staff will gain promotion.  They will all be part of a new and exciting development. It is important that the staff should study the report in detail before making rash judgments.  I understand that the union official I mentioned on that occasion had not studied the report in detail but he was anxious to outline what he felt were major barriers to success.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the review group and the Cabinet on the speed with which they accepted the recommendation put forward by the Minister. Hopefully, this will result in a major improvement in the telecommunications area.  However, that improvement will need a lot of commitment from staff at all levels but it is of such crucial importance that its implementation should be carried out in the shortest possible time. The implementation of the report will involve a topping-up of one of the first actions of the Government in voting £350 million to the telephone capital bill.  The amount of £650 million, as recommended by the review group represents a major commitment by the Government <Col N="2900" /> in a key area which will have significant spin-off benefits for the community.</P>
    <P>The third report I referred to deals with road development.  We all agree that there is a great need for major investment in infrastructure.  Last May the Minister laid this document before the House.  In introducing the report the Minister mentioned that it may not be possible to achieve the suggested infrastructural requirements.  He expects problems to arise in relation to planning and land acquisition, two areas which are completely wrapped up in that road plan.  I urge the Minister to acquire the necessary powers to implement this plan.  It is inevitable that some individuals will be offended by such a plan.  In many cases it appears that the rights of individuals take precedence over the general benefits which will accrue to the community.  In a political sense it is not always desirable that politicians say what should be said, because it may upset certain sections of the community or areas within their constituency. I represent a constituency acknowledged to be the most rapidly developing area of the country.  At present it is being choked to death by the three main motorways which pass through it, the western road, the Navan Road and the Naas Road.  The report acknowledges the need for investment to improve the infrastructure through that constituency.  I do not think there will be successful implementation of that plan unless the Minister is willing to acquire additional powers to assist him in the task.</P>
    <P>The Minister should set up a national organisation charged with the responsibility of giving the country the infrastructure it needs so that development may follow.  We must remember that the targets of the IDA are on the basis that the bottlenecks and red tape they referred to are removed.</P>
    <P>The main platform of this Government during this term is that of job creation. This is the correct policy and we on this side of the House fully support every word of that policy.  However, if there are certain aspects of legislation which do not allow us to press on with that policy, we must modify or rectify where <Col N="2901" /> necessary.  All of these documents are interlinked and are of vital importance.  I should like to see a co-operative approach being adopted in the implementation of these three reports.  They will have major medium and long-term effects on the country and will affect very much the success of the IDA report. Unless we can implement with all due haste the report of the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group and the Road Development Plan for the 1980s, then the third plan cannot be totally successful.</P>
    <P>In the development of an infrastructure it must be recognised that from county to county and even within certain counties, such as Dublin, there are two local authorities to be dealt with.  Local authorities must be depended on to implement a national plan right across the country.  Very often those local authorities have many other major commitments, water schemes, housing and so on.  Therefore I urge the Minister for the Environment to consider very carefully how he can further guarantee the implementation of the plan he has laid before the House this session. Indeed, the role of the Minister highlights areas warranting review and in respect of which I should like to see some action taken.  If I might quote from the Road Development Plan for the 1980s, under the heading &ldquo;The Role of the Minister for the Environment&rdquo; it states:</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment is the Minister of Government in whom is vested responsibility for national policy, legislation and financial arrangements in relation to roads and road traffic.  Existing road legislation is notable for the fact that it vests few specific powers or functions in relation to the road system in the Minister.  Nevertheless, it follows from the nature of the local government system and from the general code of local government law that road authorities operate under the general direction, control and supervision of the Minister.  Although each road authority has specific statutory responsibilities, the need for co-ordination of the activities of road <Col N="2902" /> authorities on a national basis has grown over the years and the tendency is a continuing one.  For this reason and arising from the system of road grants the Minister for the Environment has an important practical role in relation to the public road system.  The Minister has, of course, quite specific and wide powers, including the power of direction, under the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974, in relation to national roads and motorways.</P>
    <P>The Minister certainly has a major role to play and has wide powers vested in him.  He is also qualifying the fact that he is not the final decision-maker in respect of the many urgent decisions that have to be taken.  In regard to that aspect of Government policy I would advocate some form of co-ordination and that some central power be delegated to the Minister to guarantee its implementation.</P>
    <P>In a debate of this type it is appropriate to look at leadership and the many calls there are for positive leadership.  During this Dáil session there have been many areas in which leadership has been subject to scrutiny, at the political, farming and union levels, indeed all the major sectors that go to make up the economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the subject of farm leadership.  During the session just ending a tremendous amount of time has been devoted to the farming community, with questions being asked and answers being given about them, their future, their prospects for investment, or lack of such.  The 2 per cent levy has been bandied about in all sorts of areas.  It has been put forward as a disincentive, as constituting a very modern method of tax collection and so on.  I should point out, however, that the people elected by the farming community to represent them, in negotiations with the Government, to a certain extent have been unable to deliver, have been unable to fulfil the mandate given them.</P>
    <P>A system of proposed taxation was submitted to the farming community emanating from discussions with the Government which was, as far as I am <Col N="2903" /> aware, acceptable to the farm leaders in the main.  Then differences of opinion arose about the type of farming.  Certain sectors, whether it was the dairy farmer, or beef-producing farmer, had differences of opinion on agreeable arrangements for that sector contributing their fair share to the Exchequer.  The farming community, to use their own words, were agreeable to paying their fair share of taxation.  I call on the farming leaders to be positive and forthright with their members in recommending publicly the system they believe to be fair and equitable.  They were afforded such opportunity during this financial year.  It was not availed of.  The problem will not disappear.  We shall have to deal with it next year and, above all, we must ensure that agriculture is developed to its maximum potential.  It is a crucial area of our economy, constitutes our best source of foreign earnings, the life-blood of the country's finances, in respect of which there is no necessity for a lot of imported inputs in order to achieve the maximum export goal.</P>
    <P>Like everybody in this House, I am very conscious of the role played by our farmers.  However, as we progress as a nation, the farmer has a lot to contribute by way of implementing improvements in their living standards, a lot to contribute at national level by way of exports and also by way of their form of taxation.  I would urge the leaders of the farming community to be forthright and positive, accepting a fair system of taxation which we are all very anxious to see implemented, to be blunt with a certain sector of the farming community who do not appear to want such a fair system of taxation introduced because they contend it may bear more heavily on them. They can afford to carry that liability. That is what leadership is all about.</P>
    <P>In any democracy the elected government can show leadership to a limited degree.  Nowadays it is a complex business in a democracy to ensure that other democratically-elected leaders, representing certain sectors of the community, bear their fair burden of responsibility when they seek and accept such offices.  They must expect also possible <Col N="2904" /> critism from within their organisations and must be seen to be implementing a reasonable national commitment.</P>
    <P>One must progress then automatically to union leadership.  Looking at union leadership since the commencement of 1979 one could be excused for being somewhat confused.  We commenced with the negotiations for a national understanding. We had the president of the largest trade union in the country, a party to the committee negotiating, following many years of demands, contending that unions had a key role to play at top level in the community.  This Government, for the first time, recognised that, brought in the union leadership, brought in the employers. Indeed, one might recall that, at that stage, the farming leaders were upset because they were not included in the discussions.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the trade union aspect of the national understanding. The elected leaders of the trade union movement, the ICTU, sat down at the table with the employers and the Government.  A certain national understanding was agreed in our parliamentary party rooms, a press conference was called and the details of that understanding were released to the nation.  The president of the largest trade union should have had communication all along in the discussions with his vice-president, his general secretary and his executives.  However, that did not seem to be the case.  The union rejected the national understanding.  At their annual conference the president said that it could be resurrected, the vice-president said it could not be resurrected and the general secretary, devoting his address to many important aspects of everyday policy, broadened his contribution to embrace many national political matters including the North of Ireland.  He was quite entitled to do so, but all along the three elected key men of the largest trade union in this country were speaking from different angles with regard to what was satisfactory for the members of that trade union.  Peculiar as it may seem, what was rejected totally before the recent election seemed quite acceptable <Col N="2905" /> after the election with a few modifications and very insignificant percentages. Without reading too much into the political implications, one hopes that the recommendations of the executive of the ITGWU, representing such a large sector of employees will be acceptable.</P>
    <P>A major responsibility on the democratically elected leaders of the trade union movement is to be forthright and positive in their decision-making. We as a Government recognise their importance and that is why we brought them into the discussions on the national understanding.  In dealing with the trade union movement the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy has highlighted the ridiculousness of some of the situations that exist at present.  One big dispute which overshadowed this Dáil term was the strike in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Perhaps money was not the cause of that strike. Initially the executive of the union concerned decided to have one-day strikes and then, because of certain internal developments, we ended up with a ridiculously long strike.  All the efforts, moves, quiet diplomacy and hard-working efficiency of the Minister and this side of the House to resolve this dispute were fruitless for a long time.  The backbenchers on this side of the House urged the Minister to go on television and tell the nation the causes of the strike.  The Minister at all times shunned publicity on the basis of trying to claim benefit out of what might arise.  He continued to support the ICTU officials who gave many hours in an effort to solve this dispute.</P>
    <P>Until individual trade union members realise that a union card is no longer a licence to work but is very rapidly developing as a licence to stay in work, we will have the complications which we see at present.  Until the average individual who has played no real part in the workings of the union decides to turn up to his meetings, to express his viewpoint and to be involved in decision-making, we will have continually these petty problems which blow up into national crises and the spectacle of the nation being cut off from power, not because of money but because of internal <Col N="2906" /> infighting between trade unions looking for subscriptions.  We are back to power struggles within the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for people outside to ask what the Government, with their 20-seat majority, are doing about it.  A majority of one would allow the Government to function.  We are in a democracy.  We want everybody to have a fair and reasonable involvement in decision-making but, as the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy points out, we may have to take some action which we would rather not take.  We would rather see a strong democratically elected trade union movement working efficiently on behalf of their members. However, if in the national interest the trade union movement are not capable of a co-ordinated strong programme of policy, then it is the duty of the Government to take some very distasteful decisions in trying to solve these problems. Deputy FitzGerald said that he hoped to hear contributions from the backbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party and we have had references to the many meetings that we as a parliamentary party have had.  One of the major issues discussed and reported widely was that we would deal with labour relations.  I urge caution in this field.  I urge that membership of the ICTU would have a meaning.  I urge union leaders to treble the contributions which their members are making and to pay their officials better. I urge Ministers to make the necessary funds available.  Why have we not educational and training facilities for unions similar to those for management? Do we give union organisations adequate funds for training?  Union members do not contribute a quarter of what they should to their unions.  Union officials are not paid anything like what they should be paid for the commitment they have to their full-time role as union officials.</P>
    <P>There are power struggles when small unions try to become big unions.  The only way they can become big unions is to get more members.  The only way they see themselves getting more members is by becoming aggresive and promising improvement in incomes or conditions, <Col N="2907" /> and they become militant.  My constituency has seen the Roadstone strike and a number of other disputes.  Very often in these cases the trouble has nothing to do with staff incomes.  It arises because the unions want to increase membership and get more subscriptions so they can expand.  The Minister for Labour has set up a commission to inquire into this and if they do not report after two years we, the elected Government, will have to make some decision.  We wanted to compromise and to bring in the people who are elected and responsible for representing people. They have not come up with proposals. If we are not going to solve our industrial relations problems in that way we will have to think about it again.  It has been a dominant factor in this Dáil term and may continue to be so for the remainder of the term of this Government. I hope that the various trade unions, the employers and the Government can solve this problem.  Unless the trade unions are capable of bringing forward a co-ordinated responsible approach, it will be our duty on this side of the House to make decisions.</P>

      <P>From the clock I would have hoped that I had six, but I will accept your ruling, Sir, when the time comes.  In the very brief time at my disposal I cannot go into details of the Government's performance over the past year as closely as I would have wished.  In any case many of the criticisms that I would have made have been uttered before and to repeat them would not add a great deal to public wisdom about these events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to situate this debate in an overall context on national and international levels in order that some of the real, long-term choices facing the people of this country can be assessed and stated clearly.  I was sitting in these benches on 26 June when I heard the Taoiseach say in his statement on returning from the European Council that there had been at that Council &ldquo;strong emphasis on the need for intellectual  <Col N="2908" /> honesty&rdquo;.  With all due respect, the call to intellectual honesty on that occasion, coming from that side of the House, is worthy of derision.  Where was the intellectual honesty in 1974 and 1975 when there was an oil crisis which makes this present one pale into insignificance and when the then Government were berated from those benches as being the sole cause and arbiter of all our misfortunes?  Where was the intellectual honesty of the Fianna Fáil manifesto?  Now that the people have begun to realise that they made a wrong decision and they come back to Fianna Fáil, and ask them about this, that and the other, they are told to go away and read the small print, to digest and find out what was the exact nature and implications of all the famous mental reservations and the contorted phraseology that was designed to give the electorate the appearance of commitment while withholding the reality of such a commitment. There has been a low quantity of intellectual honesty from that party in Government and beforehand in Opposition.</P>
    <P>We must accept that the Government are not solely responsible for all our ills. That is my contribution to intellectual honesty in this debate.  It is becoming increasingly obvious that the degree of control that the Government can exercise over our national affairs and over the impact of international affairs on our economy and on our social life generally is very much smaller than they would like it to be and perhaps than the people of Ireland would like it to be.  The question we have to ask, based on that, is what form of political organisation is one which is calculated to give us the greatest possible degree of control over national, economic and social factors and international economic and social factors?  The Government have gone wrong, are going wrong and will continue to go wrong in their unshakeable belief that the capitalist organisation of society is the one which will guarantee us the maximum degree of control.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believe that the capitalist organisation of society will never provide us, nationally or internationally, with the required degree of <Col N="2909" /> control over our destiny.  It is sad to see the Taoiseach placing so much faith in his various remarks on such a weak system and one which has manifestly failed to deliver on its promises in the past.  In opening this debate he spoke of the maintenance here of a favourable environment for enterprise.  There is a belief that would be touching if it were not so pathetic, in the ability of private enterprise to solve our problems.  Of course, making a favourable climate available for enterprise here will create jobs but it will not create anything like the number of jobs the Taoiseach hopes it will create.  It will not create anything like the number of jobs that would be created in a society in which the wilder excesses of the capitalist organisation of society give way to a socially responsible method of control and organisation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke on several occasions about the need to moderate incomes. This is a classic catch phrase of this particular kind of society.  He also talked in this debate about a situation where groups use their key positions to make a naked grab for substantial increases. When Government Ministers talk about incomes they are talking about wages.  What about the groups who own capital in our society?  If we look at the <i>Sunday Independent</i> for last Sunday we will see that the average increase in dividends last year was 31 per cent.  Who are the groups there and what is the naked power on which they are basing their unreasonable demands in our society?</P>
    <P>We should not be talking here today just about changing leaders.  Somebody once said after a battle: &ldquo;Change generals and we will fight you all over again&rdquo;.  We should not be talking just about swopping tweedledum for tweedledee.  If we are to have a radical analysis in our society, if we are to challenge the political and moral bankruptcy in which the Government by their blind commitment to private enterprise have led us we must not be talking just about changing the Government but about changing the whole economic and social system under which we labour at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that only occasionally has this adjournment debate got to grips with the fundamental issues which face the country now.  The basic issue, as the Labour Party see it, is that the Government have, by and large, failed to deliver almost every one of their chief economic targets.  They have failed not because of the oil situation, not because of strikes but because, basically, they created a totally false climate of economic and social expectations in the past two or three years.  It is hard to believe that on 31 January, only six months ago, the Taoiseach said in this House that the Government targets are for increases of 25,000 a year on average in the numbers at work, for a reduction in the rate of inflation to 5 per cent at the end of 1979, for increases in national output of 6 per cent a year over the three-year period, 1978-81, and for a gradual reduction in the Government's borrowing requirement to a level of 8 per cent of GNP by 1981.  Last Friday in the House the Taoiseach ignominiously jettisoned all of those targets.  His whole approach now points to the fact that the country urgently needs a sustained period of real political and social leadership.  We need, more than anything else at this point of our economic and social development, an honesty of purpose in our leadership of the electorate. This is now sadly lacking from the Government side in particular.</P>
      <P>Real political leadership is called for to cope with the recession as we enter it and to explain with conviction to the people the very unpopular decisions we must now all face as a direct consequence of successive Fianna Fáil policies since the notorious 1977 manifesto.  The Government's very expensive honeymoon with the electorate is now well and truly over and, irrespective of the views one takes of the ESRI prognostications, nevertheless their forecast is a 2 per cent growth, a 13 per cent inflation and a £500 million deficit in our balance of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if one accepts that over the past two or three years the ESRI forecasts have tended to be somewhat on the pessimistic side and if there is a 50 per cent error on their part, even if one feels that <Col N="2911" /> the growth rate could be 3 per cent, 3½ per cent or even touch 4 per cent next year, even if one accepts that the Post Office dispute has knocked 1 per cent off the growth for this year, that the petrol situation and the loss of tourist revenue has knocked off another ½ per cent, and that we are right down to 2½ per cent or 3 per cent at the most, accepting all those qualifications and putting the best side on it, as the Minister for Economic Planning and Development attempted to do this morning, we cannot deny that the future looks grim indeed.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with much that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development says but I agree with one of his views: that we should always set ourselves the most ambitious targets in respect of inflation, employment and growth.  I agree that we should not be in any way defeatist in our ambitions but it must be stressed that ambitions in the absence of the steps necessary to achieve them, are not worth the paper they are written on.  Therefore, we need real political leadership and not a philosophy of a manifesto which merely pandered to every known human electoral soft option and which was designed by Fianna Fáil for a return to power at any cost.  The nation is now counting that heavy cost and as Ministers prepare their estimates for 1980 and as the Minister for Finance endeavours to assess what money will be available in 1980 to meet these estimates, we know that the cost is already very heavy and burdensome as we enter the second half of 1979.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the Fianna Fáil manifesto brought party political programmes into disrepute.  The electorate have a right to know where each party stand in terms of our economic and social future.  The manifesto was all the more regrettable in that down through the decades electioneering in general elections was conducted on the past records of successive Governments. The elections were fought almost exclusively on past records.</P>
    <P>We all recall that the only promise ever made by the late Mr. de Valera and the late Mr. Lemass at election time was to promise the people stable and sound <Col N="2912" /> government for a return to power.  The inter-party Governments were not entirely different and fought elections largely on the records of their achievements in government.  In 1973, however, there was a break with that tradition and the prospective National Coalition published what was admittedly a terse and very general 14-point programme, but that programme, together with the more important ground work it laid for an alternative administration after 16 years of Fianna Fáil rule, resulted in putting Fianna Fáil into bemused opposition.</P>
    <P>Then the 1977 manifesto was born. We had the removal of rates and of car tax and the abolition of the wealth taxes. Millions of pounds of taxpayers' money was given away to the Irish Trust Bank on foot of an indiscreet promise made in the election campaign by the now Minister for Finance.  Every speculative builder was given in effect the benefit of a £1,000 new house grant and in relation to income tax Fianna Fáil were not to be outdone.  There was a doubling of the personal allowances.  The impression was given during the campaign that there was money to be burned.  I recall a television programme which showed an election press briefing and when some ignoramus of a political correspondent dared to ask from where would come the £260 million to finance the Fianna Fáil wheel of fortune, he was asked by Professor O'Donoghue who looked coldly at him down the table whether he had ever heard of buoyancy of growth and was told that the Fianna Fáil programme would be self-financing with a 7 per cent growth in GNP during a five-year period.  Professor O'Donoghue went on to say that the money was available, that there was no reason for inflation not being reduced to 6 per cent and that workers would be happy with increases in incomes in the region of 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is hard to believe that the Minister spoke in that fashion only in May and June of 1977.  He concluded that press briefing by looking straight at the political correspondents and saying that this is what happens when there is real confidence in a country.  We know that the reality is totally different.  Is it any <Col N="2913" /> wonder, then, that some of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers had almost to be restrained from burning a copy of the said manifesto during their day-long European and local elections wake on Wednesday last?  I recall the blinding certitude especially on the part of the now Ministers for Finance and Economic Planning and Development with which that manifesto was peddled. Those of us who, from somewhat bitter but crystal-clear personal experience half way up those benches in government, predicted that the political chickens would come home to roost with a vengeance were treated at the time by the then Deputy Colley, to use a Cork expression, as a crowd of uninformed cábógs and we all know the meaning of a cábóg in Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The expression is used with a particular inflection in Cork. Those of us who were aghast that the limited and scarce financial resources of the State should be frittered away in the way being proposed by Fianna Fáil were treated as defeatist Jeremiahs peddling perpetual doom.  With that philosophy there took off the famous rocket of the Tánaiste but like Skylab that rocket has now come down slap bang in the middle of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>I make these comments briefly to expose the duplicity of that manifesto, not because I am in any way opposed to the idea of pre-election manifestos or to the idea of economic and social programmes or to the idea of democratic discussions on economic and social strategy.  I am all in favour of such programmes but unfortunately we have not had enough of that type of planning down through the years and, regrettably for the next general election at any rate that approach is somewhat discredited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, we need a new programme for economic and social development.  I would urge the Government above all that that programme be totally honest and objective in its content.  It should be based on the stringencies of economic <Col N="2914" /> facts and not on the type of wishful analysis for popular consumption that we have had from the Government in the past two years.  The Minister knows that even now, half way through 1979, our current budget situation is critical with a loss of vital State revenue because of the postal dispute and with the serious downturn in tourism as well as with the impact of oil price increases and the massive public service pay increases now in the pipeline.  To mention merely the national understanding aspects of public sector pay increases, the amount involved will be an additional £55 million in the current year, as the Minister told me in a written reply yesterday, not to mention the impact on other sectors. The Minister should tell the story as he really knows it.  He will not be thanked by his party, or by the electorate, for leading us further along the path of economic and social illusion.</P>
    <P>I have always belonged to the school of political thought which holds that, by and large, the only worthwhile options in economic policy are the ones we like least.  That is not a very optimistic frame of mind in approaching economic policy but it is true.  In America, or here, or in any other country, the real economic options facing people are the ones which are most unpopular.  Arising from the Government's strategy, I foresee that the budgets in the next two or three years will prove to be some of the most harsh in our history.  In this year's budget the Government deliberately made a highly optimistic revenue estimate of £2,467 million.  I asked the Minister many questions as to what it was based on.  He got himself into a ferocious tangle with Deputy FitzGerald on that issue.  It was based on a 6½ per cent growth rate for this year, a growth rate target which was felt by the Central Bank and the ESRI to be unattainable.  The Central Bank are very conservative admittedly and the ESRI tend to be cautious.  The Minister will admit that the highly optimistic revenue estimate for this year is not likely to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The debate boils down to who should pay, who should contribute, to keep the country solvent.  The issue is one of economic solvency.  The take&mdash;and it <Col N="2915" /> will be a take from people to keep the country solvent&mdash;must not be only from the very wealthy supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, but also the moderatly wealthy friendly sons of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Minister will have to face that fact if we are to have additional revenue.  The take will have to be from many more farmers whether we like it or not, if we are to stay out of the European bankruptcy courts.  The take will have to be from many more self-employed people, and it may well be that the take will have to be from some of our better off wage and salary earners.  As I see our budget deficits unfold in the next two or three years, the lesson is a bitter and a grim one.  There is no alternative if we are to keep the country solvent.  Only through this harsh course of action is there any prospect of maintaining and substantially developing our health services, our educational services, and our social services.</P>
    <P>Messing has gone on at Government level, notoriously over the back boiler grant system.  One day the Department of the Environment unleashed a proposal and the next day it was countermanded, and we still have not got the new regulations.  In relation to housing something is quite obvious from the Government's attitude to certain building societies.  In relation to education something is quite obvious even if you just take the minor aspect of the remedial teachers expenditure.  In those areas it is quite obvious that the Government are contemplating some form of cutback on public expenditure.</P>
    <P>I want to put it on record that the Labour Party are utterly opposed to any question of a cutback in essential public services.  That is where the Government run to every time revenue receipts are substantially diminished.  I totally reject the kind of approach proposed by the Director General of the Construction Industry Federation&mdash;and some of his solutions have been simplistic enough&mdash;that we should cut back on public service employment.  If State revenue declines dramatically in 1979, those in the community who can well afford to pay must pay.  The best course of action open to us if we are to salvage the <Col N="2916" /> economy&mdash;and we are in a salvage operation now to save the economy from the blatant, irresponsible and profligate approach of the Fianna Fáil Government in the past two years&mdash;is a succession of very tough budgets.  If we are really honest, they will contain radical measures which will bite hard on those with most income, keep our social services above water, and keep the country out of the bankruptcy courts.</P>
    <P>The moneys which I advocate we should seek must be devoted above all to maintaining the incomes of the lower income groups, to job creation, to job maintenance, to employment subsidies in areas which are badly hit by our EMS entry.  They must be devoted to assisting industries which are badly hit by increased energy costs and by imported inflation. That is where the money should be put and not given in Flash Harry handouts to the electorate, such as we had in the manifesto.  The alternative is more unemployment, more dole and more social stagnation.</P>
    <P>Some of the moneys the Government get in the next budget, which obviously they will be thinking about during the summer recess, may be needed to finance a level of domestic and international borrowing which might well be higher than we would tolerate normally. There is not a hope in hell of having borrowing down to 8 per cent of GNP by 1981.  That is gone out the door.  This year it will be above the 10 per cent general target.  We may have to cut back on current consumption and bring ourselves up to perhaps a 12 per cent level in international borrowing to keep the country above water, as we did in 1973/74 when we faced not just a 40 per cent increase but a quadruple increase in oil prices.  We did that by keeping a high level of international borrowing, cutting back on domestic consumption, and ensuring that we were in a position to finance our foreign borrowing without destroying our external reserves.</P>
    <P>It may well be that there will have to be a cut back in current consumption to maintain our social, economic and employment services.  It is a bitter pill for me to have to say that as an opposition Deputy but the alternative is stagnation <Col N="2917" /> and the kind of mystical Keynesian nonsense we heard from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development over the past six months about the kind of market economy which went out the door in the fifties.  We heard all this from the Minister as he carried the Cabinet around on his economic yo-yo over the past six months.</P>
    <P>To go back to my central point, I want to stress that nothing of what I have advocated can be done unless the burden of cost is fairly spread across the board.  The Government have failed to practise that concept.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, drove every married and single woman earning a livelihood on a wage-and-salary basis into total exasperation with his throwaway comments in the early part of the year.  The PAYE sector was provoked; those depending on the health services were provoked; the farming community was provoked by the bungling of the tax issue.  Across the board there is hostility and suspicion and cynicism among the electorate towards the idea that Fianna Fáil will treat people on a fair and equitable basis.  As a result, the climate in the community is such that no one is prepared to pay anything towards any other person's plight, no matter how bad the situation is, even if the same person will be in the same plight the following morning.  That is the kind of social and economic climate created by the Government's manifesto throw-aways. We have to lift the people into a sense of social commitment, a sense of community responsibility.  The way to do that is by the Minister for Finance proving that the cost of keeping the economy going, of expanding job creation and social services, will be spread equitably across the board.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's dispute with the Government is about the manner in which the weight of taxation is distributed in our society.  The Minister may be assured that the Labour Party will always defend the need for taxation to meet the substantial cost of public services. Therefore, we need real leadership on the fundamental issue of an equitable taxation system instead of the bungling of successive Ministers.  We need a clear <Col N="2918" /> system of taxation of all farmers based on farm accounts to be kept by all farmers.  We also need, and I agree with the idea, a basic land resource tax on those who do not work the land.  The double solution would be fair to those who work their land and fair to those who simply sit down and admire their holdings.  That solution has been self-evident since 1970.  However, moral cowardice and fumbled efforts and compromise such as the famous and notorious notional system of taxation, the notorious multiplier system and the hilarious levy system of the Minister for Finance, have not cleared the air on this basic issue.  Town was set against country on that kind of issue.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of a land resource tax because one of our main prospects for economic development lies in the full productive utilisation of every arable acre of agricultural land, particularly for cattle and for processed beef exports. Any land owner with minimal profits with no tax to pay from under-utilised land should be faced with an annual land resource tax.  Vast speculative profits were made in recent years from the sale of farm land, from the sale of house building sites and from the sale of industrial construction sites.  I say that as Vice-Chairman of Dublin County Council with daily knowledge of planning applications and of auctions throughout the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to deal with the situation, so much so that on a national basis the price of a new house is £21,000.  With mortgage interest rates at 14½ per cent, one would be damned lucky to get a house at £21,000.  In the greater urban areas the price of a new house could be as high as £30,000. Engaged couples and young married couples who are trying to buy new houses want something more from Fianna Fáil than a couple of T-shirts.  They want something more than a Cathal Dunne pop song.  They want action from the Government to curb the vast profits being made on the sale of building sites.</P>
    <P>We need real leadership to eliminate poverty.  It is now so unfashionable that we cannot even talk about poverty.  We leave it to the annual statements of the <Col N="2919" /> bishops or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  With persistently high unemployment, with 13 per cent inflation staring us in the face this year, with a lower than projected rate of growth of 2 or 3 per cent for 1979, with a rising proportion of our population either very young or very old, we must realise that the levels of poverty are being reinforced in our community. I hold that the January increase in the budget of a basic 12 per cent on the short-term benefits given has now been wiped out in real terms, especially since the cash increases are only now being paid out as a result of the postal dispute.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Government&mdash;and Deputy FitzGerald made the point in his speech in relation to Deputy Haughey&mdash;will go down in history as the Government of the total <i>status quo</i> in relation to social policy.  Nothing has happened in the past two years to alleviate basic poverty in our community. Our Minister for Social Welfare is as bland as ever.  He goes around announcing waiting rooms in hospitals.  Money earmarked 18 months ago by the health boards is re-announced and recycled, particularly by the medical correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i> who seems to have a capacity for supporting the Minister for Social Welfare.  We know that the exercise is purely cosmetic because Deputy Haughey is waiting for the Taoiseach to retire to Roaring Water Bay so that he can form a truly republican, truly Fianna Fáil, truly national government of his backbenchers.  He already claims to have 53 members lined up.  Deputy Colley has 23.  That prospect would be a most dangerous one for the future of the country.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, in relation to the portfolio of Deputy Haughey, with the cost of living gone up by 13 per cent for the calendar year 1979 and with the short-term social welfare benefits being a mere 12 per cent of the last budget, the burden of this recession is now being borne by the unemployed, the elderly, the retired, by those on disability benefit, by those with large families.  The disgraceful abolition of food subsidies by the Minister for <Col N="2920" /> Finance hit the lower income groups most.  It is disgraceful that as we go into the summer recess we have a situation where a miserable, lousy £17 per week is all that a widow gets on a contributory widows pension and that an old age pensioner on the best personal rate on 5 April last, which some of them have not yet got because of the postal dispute, gets a miserable £18.60.  Members would spend it in one night in the bar of Leinster House enjoying a pre-recession drink.  It is clear that since Fianna Fáil returned to office the position of social welfare recipients and those on low incomes has deteriorated and that there is no indication that the Government intend to reverse this trend.</P>
    <P>I spoke of leadership.  This country also needs real trade union leadership.  I speak as a member of a trade union.  We do not want the kind of trade union leadership which flashes in claims of 30 per cent and when they are asked what the basis of the claim is they say that it is 20 per cent for the cost of living and 10 per cent for relativity and that they want the 15 per cent of the proposed national understanding on top of that and that that is their claim.  Very often it is barely put down in writing.  As a trade union member for the past 23 years and as one whose family has a history of trade union membership stretching into almost a century at this stage, I demand better trade union leadership than that.  This country needs real trade union leadership and one of the things we can do even now in terms of leadership is to give a firm recommendation to all trade unions to vote in favour of the revised national understanding in the national interest.</P>
    <P>The workers of this country owe damn little at this stage to the Fianna Fáil economic strategy but our economy, our exports, our industrial development urgently need a sustained period of industrial stability.  A free-for-all here with no export orders abroad means no jobs, no growth, no wages in the short and the long run.</P>
    <P>It is my considered opinion that that national understanding should be fully supported and enacted without further delay.  We need a trade union leadership <Col N="2921" /> which, above all, would stress&mdash;and this may sound rather old fashioned&mdash;the solidarity of one group of workers towards other groups of workers in society.  That solidarity should mean that one group of workers should not and must not blackmail the jobs and the families of other groups in society simply to gain in the short-term at their brothers' expense.  It means above all that the power of disputes and of serving strike notice should be exercised with due consideration for the rights of others in our community.  Otherwise we shall live in a society where dog eats dog and that is not what trade unionism is about in its best and most democratic sense here.</P>
    <P>In addition, this country needs leadership from the Opposition parties. The leadership on this side of the House must encompass a genuine desire and a commitment to form an alternative political administration here.  I am convinced that it is within the competence and the capacities of those who are in the Opposition parties, and of those who will undoubtedly join these parties after the next general election, to form a competent, socially just and progressive alternative Government.  If we waste the next two years simply denouncing the arrant stupidities of Fianna Fáil, then when we are given office by the people we too will be in real danger of simply sitting in the back of a Mercedes every morning wondering in what direction we are going to face from day to day, as is quite obviously happening in the present régime.  Therefore, there is an obligation on the parties in Opposition to continue to put forward, as we have been doing, alternative social and economic policies. These have found a new respect among the electorate as is evidenced in the local elections and in the European elections.</P>
    <P>This party will contest the next general election on the basis of a sensible programme, a realistic programme, a social democratic programme of economic and social reform which will not include lavish promises to delude the people into believing that the road to economic recovery and social development will be an easy journey or will be the cheap journey of the 1977 manifesto. We will put forward detailed alternative <Col N="2922" /> policies.  I have no doubt that in Fine Gael that approach will come about also and is, in fact, very much in train.  I have no doubt that there will be sufficient common, progressive elements within the different approaches of the two parties which will contest the elections with their individual approaches.  I have no doubt that there will be sufficient commonality to enable an alternative administration to be formed.  We will put forward measures to restore the rate of economic growth, to bring it up to the best at the top of the European league; we will introduce measures to ensure full economic recovery here; we will introduce measures to reduce unemployment and to raise living standards.  I have no doubt that Dáil Éireann can speed this day.  Many of the electorate wish that it was not two years away.  But I have no doubt that in the national interest Dáil Éireann will so ensure in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a vast difference between two speeches here to-day, the one just heard from Deputy Desmond and the first one we heard this morning at 10.30 from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. Deputy Desmond's contribution was a rather low key, thoughtful and constructive approach to the problems facing us and his assurance that, as far as his party is concerned, that approach will be continued to and through and beyond the next general election is very welcome to us in Fine Gael and is in stark contrast to what the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Professor Martin O'Donoghue, said here this morning.  I was very sorry to hear such a contribution from a man of his very obvious ability who has so much to contribute to public life here and is the type of person of whom I would like to see many more coming into public life and taking part in the rough and tumble and the hurly-burly of party politics.  I was very pleased when he joined Fianna Fáil and took his part in public life.  It is a pity that he should do as he did this morning by devoting half an hour, in an important debate at a crucial time in the development of this country and speaking as a Minister in charge of a Department <Col N="2923" /> which would have the number one spot in the formulation of policies to assist the economy and to overcome the very evident problems that are there, to an abuse of members of Labour and Fine Gael and a defence of his attack on statistics, because that is what it amounted to.</P>
      <P>The Minister said, rightly, that we cannot always depend on figures nor do they work out sometimes as even the best economists would wish.  The real point is not whether they work out to the decimal place forecast but whether the indications of movement of growth in the economy are in the right direction, if inflation is being contained at about the level forecast, if growth is as storng as is necessary to carry the burden of borrowing and the increase in employment necessary to advance the economy is taking place.  The important thing is whether these trends are moving in the right direction not whether they balance out precisely.  Whether the ESRI have been historically pessimistic in their forecasts about the performance of the economy is not really important.  If they say the growth will increase by 6 per cent when in fact it increases by 6½ per cent that is not important.  They are now saying that, in fact, the Government are wrong.  But whether the 7 per cent of last December would down to 6½ per cent in January, to 5 per cent with the Taoiseach last Friday and to somewhat in excess of 4 per cent by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development last Monday and whether the ESRI prophecy of 2 per cent is correct, whether the movement of the economy is in that direction, is the important thing.  The Government try to gloss over that and confuse the House and the electorate by saying that there is no problem, that the country is on course as they predicted and that the 25,000 jobs target will not only be achieved but exceeded. If this is correct I hope the Táiniste will give us the basis on which the Government decided that this is the true position and do so in a less hysterical vein than that of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2924" /> It is not only the Government's reputation that is at stake here now as to whether they were right or wrong in what they said.  The important thing since we joined the EMS is the assessment made by people outside the country of all the institutions of this State, the Government, the Opposition, the economic forecasters and the general attitude and accuracy of predictions and of our determination to achieve the benefits that were obviously achievable last December when the decision was taken&mdash;rightly I think&mdash;to join the EMS.</P>
    <P>We must take note of three things in 1979, in the last six months, as regards our future.  One was entry to the EMS. Another is the effect on our economy of the increase in the cost of energy.  To write that off, as the Minister for Economic Planning and Development said as being on a par with what happened in 1973-74 when the cost went up by 400 per cent is not acceptable.  The Minister's answer was that it was only 8 dollars at that stage and it has now gone up by 8 dollars again.  This is not inaccurate but the attempt to cloud issues is what the people, and I particularly, find so distasteful about the Government.</P>
    <P>Joining the EMS, as was recognised I think at the time, gave us the possible benefits of lower inflation and lower interest rates.  The Taoiseach speaking on 17 October, as reported at column 418, volume 308, of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>The Government will have to operate fiscal and monetary policies which will sustain growth, encourage employment and keep down costs.</P>
    <P>In that connection he also said, speaking of the level of pay and costs:</P>
    <P>Expectations must be rapidly adjusted to the sharply lower rate of inflation that may be expected to rule in the EMS....  Failure to observe the disciplines inherent in the system will result inevitably in lower growth and less jobs.</P>
    <P>The Government, since they came into office have continually been stressing&mdash;and rightly&mdash;the necessity to maintain wage rates that are not excessive <Col N="2925" /> and that will not interfere with our competitive position abroad.  The difficulties in this were recognised when we joined the EMS at the end of last year. Yet, on the first day that the EMS was officially supposed to operate and while the Government were negotiating for a wage settlement they removed the food subsidies which added to the level of inflation, added to the cost of goods for the housewife and added to the expectations of workers in regard to the wages they should get.  The Government followed that with a budget this year which, even though there was an increase in the level of tax allowances, was again seen by the ordinary PAYE workers who are, by and large, the trade unionists seeking wage increases, as an attack on their standard of living.</P>
    <P>Two weeks later there was a massive protest march by PAYE workers.  The question of the credibility of the Government as regards wage negotiations and levels of pay goes back long before this. I have asked the Tánaiste many times in this House what he or the Government meant when he said in the budget debate of 1978 referring to the 5 per cent which Deputy Desmond mentioned in connection with the Fianna Fáil manifesto, that this was a most important strut to hold up the Fianna Fáil manifesto for our economic future.  I do not know if what Deputy Desmond said is true about an effort being made to burn that manifesto at the Fianna Fáil party meeting last week but I am certain, if it is not true that it was in many people's minds.</P>
    <P>The manifesto was a serious effort to guide the country into the eighties but it could have been drawn up an intermediate certificate student.  People claimed they were stuck in smoke-filled rooms at Fianna Fáil headquarters producing a document which any 15-year-old schoolboy could have produced in half an hour.  It rested on two things outside of the 5 per cent wage increase, the abolition of rates and car tax.  That is what the Fianna Fáil manifesto was. Any schoolboy will tell you people prefer to pay £1 per week every week for something rather than £40 a year.  If one knocks at ten doors and asks the people what they object to paying most they <Col N="2926" /> will say they object to paying out lump sums.  They do not mind paying out over a period.  The two big payments most people had in a year were rates and car tax.  So the Government decided to do away with them.  This was then economic strategy.  We were told that the economy would grow as a result of this priming of the economy.</P>
    <P>An important part of all this was the 5 per cent restraint in the growth of wages. This figure was referred to frequently. On 1 February, 1978 speaking on the budget at column 357, volume 303, of the Official Report the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>I should like to clarify aspects of the pay target proposed by the Government.  The target was formulated only after careful and detailed examinations of the requirements of the economy in both the short- and medium-term.  Demands for flexibility and for adjustments in line with inflation have to accommodate themselves to the need for pay moderation.  The Government's commitment is unequivocal and, if agreement to such moderation cannot be achieved, we shall have to take the necessary measures to ensure that excessive increases, if any, are recovered from those who secure them.  The Government would be failing the community if they did not take such steps.</P>
    <P>What was meant by that?  Was it just 50 or 60 words put into the middle of a budget speech?  Did the Government have any commitment?  The Minister for Finance will say that these were hanging over since the days of the Coalition Government.  We had put a restraint on special pay in the public sector.  That is true.  We did not make ourselves popular by doing so nor did we make ourselves popular by saying that the size of the public service was big enough and that we would not recruit any more people. We thought it was the correct thing to do.  It was not popular but it was in the national interest.  The Minister for Finance will say that many of the claims lodged had not been met.  That was known and was endlessly teased out in question and answer sessions before <Col N="2927" /> Fianna Fáil came to office.  Yet they still say the 5 per cent was an important part of their economic policy.  I have asked the Minister for Finance in every financial debate we have had what was meant by that.  Did it mean anything or was it so many words that could be shoved aside?</P>
    <P>Do the Government really think that excessive wage demands are damaging the economy?  Do they think that anything over 5 per cent, as laid down last year, would damage the economy?  I warned them at the time that the amounts being awarded in the private sector were far in excess of that, that they would spill over into the public sector and cause endless damage to the economy.  It is the comparison that is done outside this country that is the real tragedy.  On account of our joining the EMS and breaking the link with sterling all the actions of the Government will be put under a microscope and examined.  It is the yawning gap between statements like that by the Minister for Finance and actions by the Government of which he is a member that will damage the economy.</P>
    <P>Nothing has been done by the Minister to follow up his implicit threat if he believes the wages being paid are damaging the economy or to explain exactly what he meant if there was not a threat implicit in what he said.  He said that he would come back to the Dáil and introduce measures.  It is because of this gap that we have articles such as that which appeared in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 10 July which states:</P>
    <P>Until now, Mr. Colley and his colleagues seem to have been living in one of the heroic myths of Irish history.</P>
    <P>The heading on the article is &ldquo;Cold dawn in Ireland&rdquo;.  That might be funny and might not be damaging to the economy if it was written six or 12 months ago.  It is tragic that this is the view in a responsible paper.  This is not any yellow press journal produced on a Saturday night.  It is a responsible paper read by investors. We are constantly told of the importance of investment to the future of the country.  It is read every day by people <Col N="2928" /> with investments to make in this country.  The Government will have to put their cards on the table.  They will have to be honest with people because they elected them, with this House because we are all elected and, for their own sake, with their own backbenchers.</P>
    <P>Earlier on in the debate to which I referred Deputy O'Leary asked the Minister if he thought it was possible that there could be a revaluation of the IR£ and that it could become more valuable than sterling.  Deputy O'Leary asked if the Minister would agree that that was a remote possibility and the Minister said he would not.  I do not want to dwell on what has happened to the relationship between the £ sterling and the IR£ in the last six months.  It was unfortunate for the country and the Government that in that period, because of the energy crisis and, perhaps, because of the hope and realisation by high financiers of a change of Government in the United Kingdom, that sterling became so strong.  From what I heard on the news at lunchtime the punt slipped further against sterling today.  As was stated previously, it is not a question of the punt slipping against sterling but one of sterling increasing against the punt.  There is a difference but this scenario evidently was never visualised by the Government who did not have any contingency plans to deal with a situation if sterling increased in value over a period of time.</P>
    <P>We have been told that this situation is of value to exporters because it makes it easier for them to sell into the sterling area.  That is true.  Later I hope to deal with the situation in relation to tourism because this seems to give us a good opportunity to redress some of the damage done to this industry in recent times. However, this can be damaging to the economy in the long-term because 70 per cent of our imports come from the United Kingdom.  It is no harm if it makes the consumer proportion of our imports less competitive at home but if it makes the raw materials and machinery for further manufacture more expensive then it will increase our costs and, in turn, make the goods which we hope to exports less competitive abroad.  For that <Col N="2929" /> reason this is a worrying situation and I hope that the Tánaiste will be able to reassure people in that regard.  I understand that in a speech recently&mdash;I did not see the text of the speech and therefore I cannot be categorical about this&mdash;he said that he expected the parity to be restored sometime in the autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the Tánaiste should try to reassure those who are importing capital goods or raw materials from the sterling area for reprocessing here for export.</P>
      <P>Another matter which is having a downward effect on the economy is the cost of energy.  The OECD reckon that for every 10 per cent increase in oil prices there is a ½ per cent increase in inflation, that is if a Government are willing to take steps to avoid that 10 per cent increase in the price of oil getting into a prices-wages spiral.  If the latter occurs&mdash;my guess is that it will happen here&mdash;then the increase in inflation is 1 per cent.  If one takes a 40 per cent increase in the price of oil&mdash;a figure used by the Taoiseach last week&mdash;or a 60 per cent increase, as announced by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development this morning, the effect of the oil price increases this year will be an increase on the inflation rate of between 4 and 6 per cent.  If no corrective action is taken this will certainly affect our competitiveness and ability to export.  It will certainly affect our wage rates.  I should like to join with Deputy Desmond, as we have done before on this side of the House, in urging that the national understanding as now proposed be signed.  I do not think there is any justification for some of the wage demands that are being lodged at present in the private and public sectors.  I reckon that the national understanding is generous and as the Government, as their part of the bargain, have agreed to meet job-creation targets by the end of the year and a rebate of tax totalling £39 million, I urge that the national understanding be signed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the energy costs find their way into <Col N="2930" /> the wages spiral and on to inflation they will have an effect on our competitiveness. Such a situation will also affect our investment, an area to which we must now look.  The ESRI, and the Minister this morning, say that investment looks like being up this year.  I believe that is correct.  But investment this year was not decided on or planned this year; it was decided 12 months or two years ago in different circumstances. We should be concerned about the investment we want to entice here in 1980 or 1981.  We must ensure that the way we handle our affairs does not turn away that investment.  In this regard the attitude of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is not an enticement for people to invest here and he deserved the rap on the knuckles the Taoiseach gave him last Friday for his attitude towards the major oil companies.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the major oil companies are, to put it as politely as possible, extremely profit-conscious. However, by and large 95 per cent of the personnel making decisions here for the major oil companies are Irishmen.  Most of them were born and educated here and they are just as concerned about the advancement and expansion of our economy as the Tánaiste, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy or myself.  To treat them as Deputy O'Malley did and be so rude to them as to provoke one of the heads of those companies to walk out of a meeting with the Minister is not, when reported back to the head office of those companies, going to encourage investment here.  I am aware that at least one of the firms involved sent senior personnel from the United States to see the Taoiseach after that encounter to inform him that he should instruct his Minister in the economic facts of life.  The Minister engaged in a shouting match with the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the head offices of the oil companies were pushing the companies here to get a higher price for their product and I have no doubt that the top personnel of the oil companies here were equally concerned to present a good balance sheet to head office.  To say, as Deputy O'Malley did at one <Col N="2931" /> stage, that if he granted a price increase there would be plenty of oil, showed an extraordinary ignorance of the situation regarding energy in the world at present and over the last ten years.  That makes me feel that he is not fit to have the job of Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.</P>
    <P>Energy did not become scarce in March 1979.  For more than ten years we have listened to prophesies by OPEC that unless the western world, who refused to listen, cut down on their use of energy there would be a scarcity at the end of this century.  Instead of listening, adopting policies of conservation or making investment in alternative sources of energy all western countries went on their merry way but none to the same extent as the United States of America.</P>
    <P>If one discusses energy and its future in the world today one must talk about two countries above all others, one a producer and one a consumer &mdash;America as the consumer and Saudi Arabia as the producer.  I believe that if President Carter's energy package is taken seriously in the United States, if there is a genuine effort made there to conserve energy, to cut back on usage, and waste&mdash;it is waste about which we are talking really when we speak of conservation, and that applies to this country as well as to America&mdash;and if the Saudi Arabian Government increase their production by a significant amount for a considerable period of time then we could get over this hump next winter. Because we may get through next winter we should not fall into the same trap in 1980 that all the world fell into in 1974 when, once the immediate scarcity ceased, we reverted to our old, wasteful ways.  There is an energy shortage, at least oil-generated energy will be a scarce resource until an alternative is found.  At present we are told there are two alternatives only in that regard, coal and nuclear energy.  That is true at present.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government the same situation arose.  That must be rather terrifying for members of the present Government to see the same problems coming around again, like the hobby horse on the merry-go-round, <Col N="2932" /> demanding the same type of action as in 1973 after the oil crisis.  At that stage we as a Government decided unanimously that we had to go ahead and plan for nuclear energy.  We did this because, if alternative sources of energy production had not been found, say, in ten years &mdash;and at that stage it looked like ten years as well&mdash;then we could not be in a strong position as a Government, and the same applies to this Government or whoever succeeds them.</P>
    <P>One of the big faults with the present Government's attitude towards nuclear energy was that they were pushed into holding a public inquiry.  They have discarded whatever findings may emerge from that public inquiry before it has been held at all because of the statement by the Minister saying that they will be going ahead anyway&mdash;that is what I think he said&mdash;no matter what the public inquiry finds.</P>
    <P>It may well be that a nuclear energy station will have to be commissioned here in ten year's time.  At present alternative sources of energy do not appear to be available.  But the Government must have such a nuclear station ready in case, at that stage, nothing is found.  I would advocate that whatever its cost it should, if necessary, be written off.</P>
    <P>It must be brought home to the people between now and then that the choice for all of us could very well be a lower standard of living without nuclear energy or a maintenance of our current standard, plus jobs for our children in the future, with nuclear energy.  I hope it never comes to that.  But that may be the choice facing our people in ten years time.  It is not easy for a Government. There are horrible alternatives to think about, but they must plan on the basis that there may be no other choice available to our people at that stage.  A lower standard of living may be the price we as a people will have to pay if we will not accept nuclear energy, unless there are alternative sources of energy found in the meantime.  It is a paradox but in that regard the high price of oil suits this country at present.  The higher the level of prices for oil the more there is going into research into alternative sources, the more attractive the drilling becomes <Col N="2933" /> off our coast, with the chances of providing either some more oil from our own resources or of having wind, solar, wave, biomass or fusion&mdash;commonly held to be the most likely sources of replacement of oil-produced energy.</P>
    <P>I started off on this train when talking about the importance of energy for the economy and the amount of serious thought a Government must give it at present, indeed must give it in conjunction with our partners in Europe and in the western world.  That is why we thought it so necessary when we were in Government to join the International Energy Agency.  We considered it afforded a platform, a source of research and development, the results of which might become available to us if any progress was made in that field.  That is why it is important that there be in charge of that Department a Minister sensitive to the worldwide web of constraints and demands of the oil industry. That is why the present Minister in his attitude before Easter of this year may have potentially harmed the economy so much.</P>
    <P>We must remember that people who make decisions about investment here read everything about this country and are provided with portfolios containing the attitudes of all Government Ministers.  The attitude of that Government Minister, together with his attitude in refusing in a very petty way the payment of a dividend by the Dublin Gas Company, because he said they were being subsidised by the taxpayer, to my mind displayed ignorance on his part of the nature of the subsidy.  It was not to the Gas Company, it was to the consumers of the gas.  That attitude emanating from a party supposed to have a great rapport with the business community possibly is something else that has done great damage to this country.  These attitudes are now becoming very much more important since we joined the EMS.  On top of that there is the potential damage done to what is our No. 2 industry by the handling of the energy crisis and the postal dispute, something about which I am sure the tourist industry would prefer to forget. <Col N="2934" /> Unfortunately, they will not be allowed forget about it because of the high interest rates they are paying now, their low level of cash flow and because of the damage caused, which is something it may not be possible to redress for next year.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry for two reasons has had a very tough year.  The postal dispute went on far too long.  It continued all through the period when the tourist industry was endeavouring to negotiate bookings and encourage people to come here.  It has been damaged as well by the energy crisis and by what has been reported as a shortage of petrol in the Republic.  It appears that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy did not appreciate the importance to this country of the mobile tourist who comes here and drives his car.  When that Minister was persuaded eventually that special facilities were needed for tourism it seems that the scheme was not thought out and coupons for tourist petrol are not widely enough available.  I am certain that Bord Fáilte had made these points to the Department of Tourism and Transport, and there was no reason for the Minister for Tourism and Transport to come in here and shout across the floor of the House that we are in some way being unpatriotic when we draw to his attention the shortcomings in this scheme. We are at least as concerned about tourism in this country as are the members of the Government.  Unfortunately, this scheme is not working, and that is regrettable.  It can be corrected, and it is urgent that it should be and thus we can undo at least some of the harm that has been done.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte, the Department of Tourism and Transport and the Minister for Tourism and Transport are getting no sympathy and scant attention from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, and that is the problem.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or whoever is in charge now should tell the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy that it does not matter if the scheme is abused in some small way in some part of Ireland.  The important thing is to ensure that tourists coming in here can get <Col N="2935" /> petrol in every part of Ireland for the rest of this summer.  Last Friday night I heard on the BBC 6 p.m. news that petrol queues were growing again in Ireland.  I do not know if the damage that that kind of thing does to this country can be assessed.  I congratulate whoever corrected the misleading impression given about this country on the BBC a month ago on the <i>Tonight</i> programme.  It was corrected about a week later, and I hope that what I heard last Friday night will be corrected also.</P>
    <P>This needs fire brigade action.  I am glad that the Minister went out of the country and endeavoured to bring home to people the facts that in this country there is not a scarcity of petrol, that the Government will look after the petrol coupon scheme for tourists and that the postal strike is over.  It is right that he should have done that in the major centres like London, Bonn and Frankfurt.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry is important for the money it earns, for the fact that it benefits the more remote areas and also for the morale of the business community. The Minister for Finance is the correct person to whom to address these remarks.  An immediate grant of money should be made available to Bord Fáilte to allow them to amount a huge campaign in the UK to encourage people to come here in the August-September-October shoulder of the year.  That can be done and it will be sufficiently successful to offset to a large extent the damage done in the early part of the year.  However, money is needed immediately from the Government to Bord Fáilte in order to do it.  I urge the Minister, as a last plea in the last speech that I make from these benches before the Dáil adjourns for the summer, to do something urgently to bring back growth in tourist revenue in this country before the end of 1979.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy B. Desmond winding up this debate on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2937" /> He was painting a picture of an economy which I found difficult to recognise.  Suddenly I recognised the economy that he was describing.  It was the economy of this country when the Coalition Government were in power. Deputy FitzGerald pursued a line somewhat similar when he talked about a short-term cyclical crisis which he said Government policies and brought about in advance of the energy crisis.  The energy crisis&mdash;if that is the proper word&mdash;began with the Iranian revolution some months back.  If Government policies resulted in a crisis here it is remarkable that months later it is difficult to find evidence of this crisis.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is no such crisis. Economic growth is continuing, the numbers employed are rising and investment is growing.  These are not the characteristics of an economy in crisis. If they are, what word should we use to describe the situation that existed when Deputy FitzGerald was in Government? There is no dispute among commentators about the continuance of economic growth.  Of course, there are differences of view about the rate of economic growth and these will continue after 1979 is dead and gone.  Given the difficulties of measuring the growth of the economy referred to this morning by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, but particularly this year when the availability of statistics has been reduced by the postal dispute, I am prepared to wager that when the more definitive figures for 1979 come out in two years' time, growth will be shown to have been nearer our estimate of about 5 per cent than to the lower figures being produced by certain commentators.</P>
    <P>It is accepted universally that employment is rising.  The postal dispute held up production of the live register returns, but figures for the end of April show a year on year decline of about 11,300 before allowing for the change in conditions of eligibility for unemployment assistance for women.  Allowing for this change, the fall in the live register unemployment between April 1978 and April 1979 was 12.5 per cent, which is a very substantial cut.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2938" /> The data also show that investment so far in 1979 is buoyant.  For the first six months of the year cement sales were up 14 per cent on the corresponding period in 1978, despite the wretched weather that we had earlier this year.  Imports of capital goods are also continuing to grow very quickly.  Deputy FitzGerald referred to trade developments and in particular he pointed to the increase of £270 million in the trade gap over the first five months of this year.  It is necessary to look at the factors increasing the trade gap.  Over 70 per cent of the increase in imports in the first five months of 1979 was attributable to increased imports of producer capital goods and of materials for further production.  Imports of producer capital goods were by far the most buoyant category, rising as they did by almost 45 per cent in value terms.  These imports go to increasing the exporting capacity of the economy. The growth in industrial exports in the first five months of the year was strong. The performance of agricultural exports, however, was weak largely because of supply constraints following the high level of cattle disposals in earlier years and because of delayed marketing of cattle as a result of the late spring.</P>
    <P>These data help to put trade developments for this year so far into perspective. Because of the unexpectedly large rise in oil prices the balance of payments deficit will be higher than we had originally expected.  On the basis of current trends, it could be around £500 million or approximately 6 per cent of GNP this year.  This is far less than following the 1973 oil crisis when in 1974 the balance of payments deficit reached almost 10 per cent of GNP.  An increase in the balance of payments deficit was expected to follow the implementation of the Government's programme for growth.  In the White Paper <i>National Development 1977-80</i> we stated that the deficit was expected to rise to over £500 million or 6¼ per cent of GNP in 1980. A deficit of about the size anticipated in 1980 is now in prospect this year mainly because our oil import bill will be about £100 million more as a result of the recent OPEC decisions.</P>
    <P>We accepted the likelihood of a higher <Col N="2939" /> deficit because we believed, and continue to believe, that growth and its benefits, particularly on the employment front, are worth running some risks for, but the risks must not be allowed to become too big.  The same White Paper said that continuous monitoring of the external situation would be necessary so that corrective action could be taken if developments proved more adverse than anticipated. The position is being monitored.</P>
    <P>We have then an economic situation showing many positive features and some that will need careful watching. This could by no stretch of the imagination be described as a crisis and it should not be described as a crisis because of the damage that this could cause.  The initial impact of an adverse economic development can be compounded if consumer, and perhaps more important, investor confidence is impaired.  Investment is, as I have said, growing fast this year.  A blight should not be thrown on this growth by talk about a crisis that does not exist.  Deputy FitzGerald's irresponsibility in this matter is to be deplored in my opinion.  The Government's planned approach to the economy has come in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's <Col N="2940" /> planned approach to the economy has come in for criticism in this debate.  Our targets for this year or any other year were never, of course, an assessment of what was likely to happen if events were allowed to follow their normal course. On the contrary, they were, as I made it clear in my budget speech, a statement of what could be achieved if external circumstances were favourable and if the full support of the social partners was given.  It is, of course, self-evident nonsense to suggest, because these conditions were not fully met and targets have to be adjusted, that the policies designed to achieve these targets were and are wrong.  The targets were in a sense set as a challenge to our people, to use their efforts and talents to the full to improve their lot and the prospects for their children.  That challenge has not been fully met.  Even before the external environment took a turn for the worst it was becoming clear that the wholehearted response we sought to our policies was not forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Despite the measures taken in the budget to advance growth in output, employment and living standards demands for special treatment by many categories of workers continued and the industrial relations climate deteriorated markedly.  Already, as the Taoiseach has pointed out, the number of man-days lost through industrial disputes is well over one million, which will in this respect make 1979 the worst year since the war.  The postal strike alone caused considerable damage to the economy. The industrial relations climate is still unsettled with evidence of continued willingness to cut off essential supplies and services regardless of its economic or social impact.  If our society is not to disintegrate into a collection of warring interest groups squabbling bitterly and ruthlessly over what will inevitably be steadily reducing spoils, we must arrive at an ordered way of dealing with industrial disputes and wage determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have worked long and hard to create such a way in the proposals for a national understanding. It is a completely new departure, it is a comprehensive social contract designed <Col N="2941" /> to meet the aspirations of those at work for higher incomes, to protect the underprivileged, to improve employment prospects for those out of work, to move towards a more equitable sharing of the tax burden and to fortify the growth prospects of the economy.  It has profound significance.  It has been the first attempt in this country to develop a system in which Government, employers and unions will work in harmony together as partners to promote the wellbeing of all.  The Government were unusually open, both in the talks with the social partners leading up to the national understanding proposals, and in being prepared to enter into conditional commitments on a range of matters.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the terms of the original national understanding were not endorsed by the trade union movement. In view of this, and because of potential dangers inherent in the situation that was developing, the Government had no option but to act as they did and announce a norm for pay in keeping with the requirements of the economy.  Since that announcement was made the social partners arrived at revised proposals on pay increases for 15 months from the expiry of the 1978 national agreement.  The Government have indicated that they will implement the provisions of the national understanding, pay and non-pay, if the pay proposals are ratified by ICTU and by the employer organisations.</P>
    <P>I would like to make my position clear in relation to those revised pay terms.  It would be less than frank of me if I were not to voice unease about them.  In fact, they must be considered as being too generous, having regard to the situation now facing the economy.  The negotiations on the national understanding and the events surrounding the pay issue took time and during this time the world economic outlook took a distinct turn for the worse.  Nevertheless, the Government are prepared to abide by the revised pay terms and to implement the other provisions of the national understanding in the belief that an agreed, concerted and committed approach by Government and social partners to the <Col N="2942" /> problems confronting us is better than any alternative.</P>
    <P>It is my hope not only that the revised national understanding will receive the endorsement which the original undertaking failed to get, but that the period of industrial peace which we so badly need will follow.  We need industrial peace not simply to repair the revages of the past few months.  We need it because any other course in the situation before us could be economically suicidal for many enterprises.  The world economy is going into a down-turn and international competition will inevitably become much tougher.  We can be certain that any weakness on our part on home or export markets will be ruthlessly exploited.</P>
    <P>The Government's economic policy from the day we took office aimed at inducing a note of confidence into the economy and getting things moving again.  I remain confident in the strength of our economy and in its ability to grow, but I am equally confident that attempts to abuse that strength, to pile demand on demand, obstruction on obstruction, will in the much tougher world economic climate emerging now, rebound to the cost of those involved and of our people in general.</P>
    <P>In historical perspective 1979 will be seen as a notable year because of the Government's decision to participate in the EMS and because of the break in the link with sterling.  Securing for this country the degree of economic dependence appropriate to our political independence has been a long and difficult task and no steps in this process have been more important than the decisions to which I have just referred, decisions that reflect the Government's faith in the maturity of the economy and in its ability to participate on an equal footing with our Community partners in this new European system.</P>
    <P>The EMS is only a few months old but we can draw satisfaction from the performance to date of our currency in that system.  The recent appreciation of sterling against our £ and against the currencies of most other countries, including some regarded as being among the strongest economies in the world, <Col N="2943" /> has been seen in the wrong light so far as much comment has been concerned. Sterling has appreciated because of factors peculiar to the British economy, notably the possession of large oil reserves.  These factors are irrelevant so far as Ireland is concerned and it would not have been sensible to allow our £ to appreciate in line with sterling even if the EMS had never existed.  Such a course would have resulted in an over-valued Irish £ with a consequent loss of competitiveness for our producers on both home and export markets.  If our currency had appreciated in line with sterling we would have heard much during this debate about the jobs that were threatened as a result.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald asked about the likely movement this year in external reserves and said that the external payment situation, in conjunction with Government-induced inflation, is now threatening to undermine the Irish £ in relation to EMS currency.  The reserves at the end of 1978 stood at £1,250 million, representing about 4.1 month's imports. At the end of June the reserves were £994 million, a fall of £255 million. The widening of the trade gap is the main reason for the decline.  In addition, the reserves at the end of 1978 were almost certainly inflated by inflows of a speculative nature which have been reversed since.  Given the pattern of external trade, a seasonal decline in the first half of the year is normal.  In 1978 the reserves fell also in the first six months and were £960 million at the end of June 1978.  A recovery can be expected in the second half of the year. The reserves are still high by international standards and will remain so.</P>
    <P>The outlook between now and the end of the year does not give any cause for concern in that regard.  To date the Irish £ has withstood the test of the EMS and it can continue to do so provided there is an appreciation of economic reality by all sections.  But almost as important is the need to ensure balanced comment on the exchange rate and to avoid the type of misreporting&mdash;to use Deputy FitzGerald's word&mdash;that has occurred in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2944" /> The unfortunate tendency of Irish people at times to denigrate themselves and their achievements ought to stop short of readiness, wittingly or otherwise, to undermine the confidence in our currency.  Britain continues to be our largest single export market. Because of the movement of our respective currencies, Irish goods must be more competitive now on the British market.  Our exporters must exploit that situation to the full.  It is a situation that could not come at a better time since it offers a way of offsetting the negative impact on world trade arising from the oil price increase.  We should not overlook the fact that this divergence in the currency also improves the competitiveness of Irish manufactures on the home market in competition with British imports and on third markets in competition with British imports.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, while our entitlement to the £225 million in loans and £45 million by way of capitalised subsidies each year for five years was never in doubt, its implementation was blocked by British insistence on access to the interest subsidies in the event of their full partipation in the EMS.  This position was not acceptable to the other members.  Last Monday I managed to find a solution covering the British position with which my colleagues on the Council of Ministers would agree and which protects the Irish and Italian positions. The way is clear now for a rapid formal adoption of the enabling regulations which will assure the receipt of £45 million by way of capitalised subsidies this year.</P>

      <P>In June 1977 the Government were returned to power with a massive vote of confidence in our strategy for economic and social reconstruction as set out in our election manifesto.  That manifesto contained a set of coherent proposals designed to deal with the nation's economic ills. These proposals were elaborated on further in a series of planning documents published in the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2945" /> We will not be deflected from our planning strategy, the fruits of which are already apparent in the achievements of 1978.  The restoration of the planned approach towards regulating the economy is central to the Government's overall strategy.  In 1978 our plan involved a temporary rise in the borrowing requirement in order to boost growth, to increase employment and to reduce inflation. In all of these areas we met with success.  It is ludicrous to suggest, as Deputy FitzGerald did, that we gave away almost £250 million a year in the 1978 Budget.  The tax concessions given, which would serve to reduce the consumer price index, and the increased expenditure in the area of the job creation were all part of a carefully worked out plan, the success of which can be seen in our achievements in 1978.  I wonder is Deputy FitzGerald suggesting that the tax concessions we gave should now be undone.</P>
    <P>The democratic system of Government at times such as these imposes farreaching obligations on every individual adult citizen.  These individual obligations are every bit as important as the individual rights which democracy confers. Unless these obligations are recognised the democratic system itself and the individual freedom of choice which it enshrines is put at risk.  The democratic responsibility of the citizen today does not end with casting a vote this way or that in an election.  Free societies cannot function today without a broad range of agreement on fundamentals. These responsibilities are as pertinent&mdash;sometimes even more pertinent&mdash;in the work place as they are in the polling booth.</P>
    <P>Those who put forward outlandish wage claims must face the plain fact that by their actions they are, as surely as night follows day, going to deprive other people of their livelihoods.  People in the public service who advance exorbitant claims must face up to the fact that they are asking the taxpayer to pay more taxes.  The ultimate absurdity, of course, is when public sector groups who are themselves pursuing excessive claims become vocal in the next breath <Col N="2946" /> demanding tax cuts.  The Government are tackling the whole problem of income tax.  I defy anyone on the Opposition benches to deny that our two budgets have given greater tax concessions than anything done by the Coalition. Indeed, the Coalition through their tax policies played havoc with enterprise and the whole work ethic in this country.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, we are working in a determined way to improve the tax system&mdash;to ensure that the burden of income tax is more equitably shared.  To achieve this requires throughout the community that deep sense of responsibility I have already mentioned.  Particular sections of the community who have come off lightly in the past do themselves and the community a disservice when they over-react to tax proposals which are moderate and reasonable.</P>

      <P>Some of those prominent leaders in the farming community who raise the roof at the mere mention of any effective taxation&mdash;that is taxation which will actually yield real revenue&mdash;are misleading their followers in a most irresponsible way.  Whether they realise it or not, they are trying to lead the farming community on a truly dangerous road.</P>
      <P>A situation in which farmers are not paying their fair share of the tax burden must inevitably generate ugly tensions between the rural and urban communities. Such tensions and divisions could in the long run have tragic consequences and could imperil the system of family farm ownership itself.  I would, therefore, address a special appeal to those who lead our farming organisations to address themselves honestly to this problem, fully conscious of their responsibility not only to the farmers of today but to the next generation of farmers.</P>

What did he promise the IFA before the June election? <Col N="2947" /> Did he not tell them they would have no tax to pay if Fianna Fáil were returned to office?

      <P>The Deputy will get much more to shout about in a few minutes.  He should wait for it.  The terms of the proposed national understanding extend the range of democratic participation beyond anything achieved to date.  If the proposals are agreed and adhered to we will have created the climate necessary for a united approach to the difficult problems facing our people. I would like to see that concept extended to include the farming community and I would hope that when next the Government and the social partners sit down to chart a united course the farm representatives will be at the table ready to play a constructive role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most frequent criticisms levelled at this Government has been that we have raised people's expectations too much, that our plans have been too ambitious.  Much of this criticism has come from Fine Gael and it has also come from the parliamentary Labour Party.  A couple of days ago the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Cluskey, told us to abandon our plans.  I suppose I really ought not to be surprised.  During the last Coalition that is precisely how Fine Gael and Labour reacted to the oil crisis of a few years ago.  They threw up their hands in horror, furled their sails, battened down the hatches, and drifted wherever the storm carried them.  In the memorable words of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, they thought of this nation as being a helpless cork upon the waves.  That is an approach that we in this party will never accept. Of course, there are circumstances over which we have no control but the philosophy of Fianna Fáil now, as in the past, is that the more difficult the external <Col N="2948" /> situation becomes the greater is our responsibility as a people to exercise control over our internal problems.</P>
    <P>We have been told by Fine Gael that the manifesto was too generous.  There have been snide references to the &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; in the manifesto.  These were part of a package designed to boost growth and get our economy on the move.  They succeeded and let it go on the record that they meant thousands of jobs for our young people.  I repeat again that we have since coming into office put more people to work and created more new jobs than any other Government in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>Let us be a bit more specific about the goodies which Fine Gael and Labour profess to despise so much.  Would Deputy FitzGerald, if he were now in charge, re-impose domestic rates?  We are entitled to a straight answer to that question and I will yield to the Deputy for a yes or no answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <P>I wonder would Deputy FitzGerald or Deputy Cluskey reduce the income tax allowances to the level they were at when they were in office. They are saying that what we did was wrong.  Are they going to correct the situation if they ever get back into Government?  The people are entitled to know what they would do about the situation.</P>

      <P>We know that Deputy FitzGerald prevaricated on the subject of wealth tax.  Let him tell us now whether, in return for Deputy Cluskey's support, he would re-impose wealth tax if he were now in charge.  It is well <Col N="2949" /> known that Deputy FitzGerald, from his ivory tower over in Iveagh House, was able to impose the wealth tax on his more prudent Fine Gael colleagues. Others carried the can on that occasion. Now that he is Leader of the Fine Gael Party, it is strange that Deputy FitzGerald is less enthusiastic.</P>
      <P>These points in the manifesto are ancillary matters.  I will come to the central point in the manifesto: Fianna Fáil's commitment to jobs and to full employment for our young people.  That is the target which Fine Gael and Labour want to see abandoned.  Make no mistake about it, there is a brutal equation which could work out temporarily in somewhat easier times for those who have good jobs and who are in a strong position.  If resources are not earmarked for job creation and industrial development they cannot be diverted to other purposes. One could, for a while, allow those in a strong bargaining position to win higher incomes.  One could buy one's way out of unpopular decisions, out of difficult strikes.  One could even do popular things on the tax front.  However, the price would be paid by our young people who, in their thousands, would have to make their futures in other lands.  This country would lose their energies, their talents and their youthful initiative.</P>
      <P>I should like to put it on the record that we in Fianna Fáil will keep faith with the young people.  &ldquo;Jobs in Ireland for our people&rdquo; remains our priority.  In spite of current difficulties, it is our aim to put the future of our youth before all other considerations.  We are not going to buy temporary popularity by selling our young people short.  That is precisely what Deputy Cluskey is advocating when he tells us to abandon our programme.  He is saying, &ldquo;Let us do it the easy way and scatter our youth to the winds of the world.&rdquo;.  At least he is being consistent.</P>

      <P>In advocating that we abandon our plans he is being consistent. Every single Member of the Coalition Government, whatever his official <Col N="2950" /> title, including Deputies FitzGerald, Barry and Corish, was a minister for unemployment. In asking this Government to abandon their plans and programme they are being consistent.  That is what they did when they were faced with problems of oil and so on.  I want to assure the House and the people, particularly the young people, that this Government will not abandon them. All those who make irresponsible Disneyland wage claims are saying the same thing, too.  That is also the message from those who are unwilling to accept a fair share of the tax burden.  It is the message of those who foment unofficial, irresponsible industrial action.  Let me say on behalf of this party and on behalf of this Government that we would prefer to go into defeat honourably than to retain popularity by selling our young people down the river.</P>

      <P>Over the next few months it will become clearer that in the run-up to the European elections we suffered a temporary loss of popularity because we defended the public interest. The Deputies over there may fool the people for a short while, but they cannot succeed in doing so for very long.  In a while the people will be able to recognise those who jump on bandwagons for what they are.  The most valid criticism of this Government is that we have not succeeded in getting our message, our achievements and some of our problems across to the people.  But our opponents need not take too much confidence from this because we intend to do something about it and to find our own means of communication through which to keep our people fully informed.  In times of difficulty in the past, when our people fully understand the problems which <Col N="2951" /> they faced as a nation they responded manfully.  Unfortunately for Deputy <Col N="2952" /> L'Estrange and his colleagues, they will do so again.</P>
