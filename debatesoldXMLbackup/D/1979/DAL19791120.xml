    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>During my recent official visit to the United States, I was invited to address editors, correspondents and journalists at the National Press Club in Washington on 9 November 1979.  My address was followed by a question and answer session.  One of the questions put to me was:</P>
      <P>What is the significance of the recent Anglo-Irish air corridor agreement on the border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, and why have details of that agreement not been disclosed?</P>
      <P>I was surprised that what started as speculation in this country was being represented as fact at the National Press Club which is probably one of the most widely representative organisations of journalists in the world.</P>
      <P>I decided that I should get rid, as far as I could, immediately and definitively, of this destructive myth, the first account of which appeared, as I recall, even before the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Justice met their counterparts in London when this idea of an air corridor is supposed to have been agreed.</P>
      <P>In the course of my reply I said, and I quote from transcripts of the meeting:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1919" /> May I say in relation and in particular to this so-called air corridor&mdash;that it's without foundation. This is an assumption made by certain people that has no, well perhaps not no, basis, but very little basis in fact.  Since 1952 we have had in our legislation provision whereby&mdash;the name is &ldquo;Military Overflying (Foreign Aircraft) Regulations, 1952&rdquo;, under which a military aircraft from any other Government can fly in over our territory to a very limited extent&mdash;certainly not a ten mile corridor&mdash;after application is made and only after application is granted.</P>
    <P>We decided to improve this situation very, very slightly, but there is certainly no question of a free corridor, north or south, between the North and the south of Ireland.  And this is perhaps an emotive problem in our country because people believe that something has been conceded, some degree of our sovereignty has been surrendered, that wasn't conceded or surrendered before.  That is not the fact.  We have improved in so far as we can, within our rights and the sovereignty of our own territory, no more than was available under legislation going back as far as 1952, which was availed of by three or four successive governments.</P>
    <P>The points I want to stress are made in that paragraph.  First, there is no &ldquo;air corridor&rdquo; as that term is commonly understood. There has been a lot of speculation in the media about 15- or even 20-mile &ldquo;free corridors&rdquo; where planes or helicopters can patrol freely on either side.  That is complete nonsense.  I am not implying that there are no overflights: for example taking the past five years, there were 57 in 1974, 146 in 1975, 110 in 1976, 119 in 1977 and 64 in 1978.  Even if there had been no London meeting there would have continued to be overflights.</P>
    <P>Overflights are permitted under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft), Order, 1952, which superseded <Col N="1920" /> even earlier regulations dating from the 1930s.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is no diminution of sovereignty.  Overflights, once they are agreed to by the government of a State, involve no diminution of sovereignty whatsoever.  Civilised governments allow such things as a matter of course, mainly for reciprocal ease of navigation, to defeat terrorism or to protect human life.</P>
    <P>And thirdly, what has been agreed is a slight variation, no more, of what was agreed by the previous Government&mdash;of which Deputy Cluskey was a junior member.  Because of the understanding on security at the London meetings, I am not at liberty to reveal details of that variation but I can say that it is so slight that it will not necessitate any amendment of the 1952 Order to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I want to add and it is clear from what I have said that I did not, as has been alleged, reveal any details in Washington of what was arranged in London.</P>
    <P>But these issues, important as they are, are not the major issues as I see them.  I have already assured this House that what was agreed in London involves no diminution of our sovereignty; that is not what is in question with us here today. But it is most definitely in question among the groups against which the agreed security measures are directed, among those who do not hesitate to bomb and to kill in an attempt to get their way, among those who would most dearly like to know precisely what was agreed, so that they can change their tactics and make them even more effective against the people of Ireland, their representatives and their interests. Sovereignty is an issue with them because they are out to destroy it.  In case there is any mistake about what I am saying let me quote from an article in the American magazine <i>Time</i> dated 19 November carrying an interview with a person who is described as a political leader of &ldquo;the movement&rdquo; speaking on IRA aims.</P>
    <P>Obviously, even the term United Ireland means that the Government <Col N="1921" /> that has been set up in the Republic must come down.  The working class majority from Ulster&mdash;Protestants and Catholics&mdash;don't simply want to be absorbed into a decadent state ... Obviously that Government has to come down and they know it.</P>
    <P>All governments since this State was founded have been elected by the Irish people at free elections under what is one of the most democratic systems of election in the world.  The men of violence have been elected by no one and speak only for themselves.  It is to the type of enemy who speaks in the <i>Time</i> article that elected representatives and others could well address their minds&mdash;as I know many of them do&mdash;when they consider security issues.  He is an enemy who has no use for persuasion or consensus or democracy.  It is important that all issues and all commentaries affecting security be considered in the light of that basic fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Taoiseach that with regard to his description of the aims and motivations of what he described as &ldquo;the men of violence&rdquo;, I totally agree with his assessment of these people.  But we would like to know whether or not there has been an agreement between the British Government and this Government for the operation of British security forces within our territorial jurisdiction.  The Taoiseach in his reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking for clarification on this point.  The Taoiseach indicated that there had been an extension of the 1952 Navigational Orders, agreed in the recent meeting between the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach which would allow British forces to operate within our jurisdiction.  In view of the inherent dangers in that agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very controversial nature of this agreement and the inherent dangers in it, would the Taoiseach consider it to be in the national interests to place this matter before the Dáil either for ratification or rejection by the elected representatives of this Parliament?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated, when Deputy Cluskey was a junior member of the Government in 1976 an arrangement was made, much along the lines of the arrangements made last month, and that arrangement was not discussed in the Dáil.  Deputy Cluskey may not be aware of it.  But, as far as the dangers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought to discuss the matter with some of his colleagues.  As I indicated, there have been literally several hundred of these overflights.  In the case of any overflight, there is an inherent danger but the danger involved in overflights now is no more critical than the danger involved in overflights during the time when Deputy Cluskey was in government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what the Taoiseach said in the final part of his statement and I hope that all Members of the House will endorse it.  I also accept that an understanding on further administrative arrangements made under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952 involves an exercise of sovereignty, not a derogation from it.  I cannot comment on the Taoiseach's statement that what is now agreed involves so slight a difference from previous arrangements, as not to make any significant difference, because I am unaware of what has been agreed. To that extent I am in a difficulty in that matter.  I am aware of what our Government agreed and of what they rejected, but I cannot make further comment on that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Why, when the Taoiseach told this House that it was not possible for him to convey any information in this regard additional to that conveyed in the communique, and when in this House no reference was made to anything to do with military aircraft in any shape or form, did he feel it necessary when in the US to refer to the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952?  In addition to the Taoiseach's statement that this does not permit incursions of more than ten miles&mdash;which is inaccurate&mdash;he went on to say that we had decided to improve the situation very slightly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A brief question, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach had not divulged to this House information as to the nation's security arrangements to the extent that they relate to the overflying by aircraft, why did he disclose that in the US?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1924" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated the reasons why in the original answer.  The question asked was what was the significance of the recent Anglo-Irish air corridor agreement.  I was conscious of the fact that I was in one of the most influential organisations of journalists whose reports are widespread and I felt it only right to scotch there and then any suggestion that there was such an agreement providing for an air corridor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Taoiseach's statement that sovereignty is not an issue, he says that there is an improvement in the 1952 Order, yet it requires no amendment.  Does this mean that military or other security aircraft will, under the 1952 Order, be given permission to come in over our territory to a degree that they have not done or had not the permission to do under this order up to now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Permission will always have to be given.  The overflights are regularly being monitored and reviewed month by month, so there is no question of anything being done that would affect our sovereignty.  I do not want to elaborate any more because, as I indicated to the House, we agreed in the course of these talks not to disclose details of the arrangements made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct that the 1952 Navigation Order was in respect of overflying by military aircraft of other nations?  This agreement is in connection with Border security.  Will helicopters and planes of British Forces flying over our territory carry arms, under whose <Col N="1925" /> control will they be when operating in our territory, and will the Taoiseach explain why he has not sufficient confidence in the capacity and capability of our security forces to operate whatever security is necessary or desirable on the Border?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The aircraft permitted to overfly will overfly under the same conditions and with the same type of personnel as the hundreds of aircraft that overflew the Border area during the period when Deputy Cluskey's party were in power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to a supplementary question on my Question No. 3.  Would the Taoiseach accept that it is difficult for this House to regard the Washington Press Club as a more influential forum as far as we are concerned than this House?  Will he accept that, whatever the desirability of, as he says, scotching the story about the air corridor&mdash;and that depends upon one's definition of an air corridor&mdash;in his own terms as expressed in this House it was undesirable to disclose the nature and character of one of the security arrangements outside this House if he felt it inappropriate to disclose it within this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to dispute the respective merits of the two fora, but certainly the forum in which I decided to scotch this speculation was one from which could emanate, more widespread around the world than from any other forum perhaps, speculation that was not true and was false.  I felt that I should take the opportunity when I found that there was unfounded speculation or belief that the speculation was a fact, that I should immediately scotch it at the first opportunity.</P>

      <P>On 18 October 1973, the next day, in reply to an adjournment debate, Deputy Donegan, then Minister <Col N="1928" /> for Defence, referred to two of my colleagues.  I quote from the Official Report of 18 October 1973, column 289 of the same volume:</P>
      <P>If Deputy Colley, Deputy Meaney, or anybody else in the Fianna Fáil Party wishes to know the piece of legislation under which such permission is granted</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is permission for overflight&mdash;</P>
      <P>it is the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, S.I. No. 74 of 1952... under this authority permission for foreign military aircraft to fly over our land must be granted expressly by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan continued to the effect that he was glad that he could continue this arrangement if it was saving lives.  If Deputy Cluskey would inquire from some of his former Cabinet colleagues about the meeting dated 25 June 1976&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to reply to Deputy Blaney.  There are many aspects of security in which co-operation is given between the security forces here and the security forces in the North.  If one was asked questions on each aspect of those and was obliged to answer yes or no, by a process of elimination those against whom these security measures are designed could identify what is and is not being done.  It is better that there be no answers yes or no and no answer that would indicate either the negative or the positive in these matters in the interests of security.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government policy concerning a settlement for the problem of the Middle East was set out in the Minister's address on behalf of the nine EEC countries to the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September last. A copy of this speech has been deposited in the Library of this House.  To summarise, the Nine believe that a comprehensive settlement must be based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, applied in all their parts and on all fronts and on the following principles: (i) the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force; (ii) the ending of the territorial occupation maintained by Israel since the 1967 conflict; (iii) the right of every State in the area, including Israel, to live in peace within secure and <Col N="1940" /> recognised boundaries; (iv) recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians, including their right to a homeland and their right, within the framework set by a peace settlement, to determine their own future as a people.</P>
      <P>An aspect of the Middle East situation which is of particular concern to the EEC countries and of special interest to Ireland is the situation in Lebanon.  The Nine have frequently reaffirmed their support for that country's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, most recently following the meeting of Foreign Ministers in Dublin on 11 September. On that occasion they recognised the courageous efforts made by the Lebanese Government to promote the security of its people and the restoration of its authority over the whole of its territory.</P>
      <P>The views of the Nine have been set out on numerous occasions at the UN General Assembly.  These views, as well as the concern of the Nine in regard to specific developments, are brought to the attention of governments in the area as circumstances require.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that in replying to his Question on this matter on 17 July last the Minister for Foreign Affairs outlined the basic position regarding the setting up of UNIFIL by the UN Security Council and the functioning of the force under the overall direction of the UN secretary-General.  The Minister pointed out that the UN constantly uses its best efforts to reduce the harassment of the force and that in this context, and in the interests of our troops, we have helped and supported these efforts of the UN.</P>
      <P>Attacks on and harassment of Irish troops serving with the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) over the past 12 months have taken the form principally of:</P>
      <P>&mdash;firing and shelling at or near Irish troop positions;</P>
      <P>&mdash;attempts at infiltration into the Irish Battalion area;</P>
      <P>&mdash;attempts to restrict the movements of Irish troops as, for example, by road blocks.</P>
      <P>The source of the harassment of Irish troops has been principally the <i>de facto</i> forces which, as the Deputy will be aware, are supplied and supported by Israel.  There has also been some difficulty with certain Palestinian and Lebanese elements in the area but these incidents have tended to be less frequent and less serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1943" /> January, April, May, June, July and August were months of particular harassment of Irish troops.  Incidents in some form or other were, however, taking place on an almost daily basis up to September.  Since the beginning of September there have been fewer incidents overall.  A relative cease-fire obtains which, it is hoped, will enable the force to make further progress in the implementation of its mandate.</P>
    <P>During the period to which the Deputy refers a number of incidents give rise to particular concern.  These included:</P>
    <P>&mdash;heavy shelling of two villages in the Irish battalion area in early January;</P>
    <P>&mdash;shelling and firing at UNIFIL HQ in Naqoura on the night of 18-19 April last during which six of our soldiers were injured;</P>
    <P>&mdash;at least five incursions by Israeli Defence Forces into the Irish Battalion area between May and August;</P>
    <P>&mdash;since July, the taking up by the <i>de facto</i> forces of two positions along the outer part of the Irish Battalion area.</P>
    <P>Given the almost daily nature of the events to which the Deputy's question refers, it would be difficult, as I feel sure the Deputy will appreciate, to provide him with full details of every incident. The Minister would be glad, however, to provide him with details available to him of any incident which may be of particular concern to him.</P>
    <P>As regards assurances from the Israeli authorities concerning harassment of our troops, the Deputy will recall that in his reply to his last question on this subject, the Minister referred in particular to the representations we had made to Israel and to the Israeli Prime Minister's undertaking that Israel opposed without qualification any firing or shelling at units of UNIFIL.  Since that time we have continued formal representations to the Israelis through diplomatic channels <Col N="1944" /> as occasion required.  The Minister personally conveyed to the Israeli chargé d'affaires, when he visited Dublin at the end of August, the grave concern of the Government at the increase in harassment of our troops at that time, referring in particular to the incursions by Israeli troops into the Irish battalion area.  On the same day as this meeting, the Irish Permanent Representative in New York made known our concern to the UN Security Council.</P>
    <P>During his recent visit to the United Nations at the end of September the Minister met with the then Foreign Minister of Israel, Mr. Dayan, and reiterated to him the concern of the Government over the harassment of our troops by the <i>de facto</i> forces and urged that Israel would use its influence to help maintain the relative truce which has obtained in the area since the beginning of September.  More recently on 12 October the Minister for Defence, Mr. R. Molloy, T.D., during his visit to Irish troops in the Middle East, called on the Israeli Minister for Defence, Mr. Weizman, in Tel Aviv.  At that meeting Mr. Weizman assured Mr. Molloy that Israel would do its best to ensure that the <i>de facto</i> forces did not fire on Irish troops.</P>
    <P>The UN Secretary-General has recently stated that UNIFIL is performing an absolutely essential task of conflict control in one of the most sensitive and explosive parts of the world.  The Government share this view and will continue to assist the Secretary-General in his efforts to reduce the risks faced by the force and to enable it to carry out its mandate.  The Minister is satisfied that the Government and the United Nations are using every channel open to them to bring about conditions under which the Force can operate effectively.  I am sure this House will again join with him in paying tribute to the courage, discipline and restraint of the officers and men of our Defence Forces serving with UNIFIL who are carrying out their difficult tasks in the cause of world peace.</P>

      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of endorsing the last <Col N="1945" /> paragraph of the Minister's statement. However, I believe that the best tribute we can pay to our troops is to be concerned about their security.  Do I gather from the Minister's reply that while there has not been any serious incidents in the last two months, the harassment and firing at or near the positions of the Irish troops continues on a daily basis?</P>

    <Title>Statement by the Taoiseach on Visit to United States.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year, my wife and I accepted an invitation from <Col N="1991" /> President Carter to pay an official visit to the United States.</P>
      <P>Since Ireland holds the Presidency of the European Community for the six months ending 31 December next, my visit afforded an opportunity of discussing not only matters affecting Ireland and United States-Irish relations generally but also aspects of European Community affairs.  I was accompanied during the visit by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Mrs. O'Kennedy.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the official party, formally and most sincerely, to express my thanks to President Carter for his invitation and for the hospitality with which we were received in the United States.  We were treated with the generosity for which America is noted.  Official, protocol and security arrangements, at all levels, could not have been better.  It is a fair conclusion that the historically good relations between Ireland and America were affirmed and reinforced by the visit. I took the opportunity of the visit to invite President Carter and his wife to come to Ireland on a mutually convenient date in the future.</P>
      <P>At our meeting on 8 November with President Carter, Secretary of State Vance and National Security Adviser Brzezinski, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I discussed the fundamental identity of interest between Ireland, the United States and the European Community in the world today which was clearly apparent.  The President was most understanding on the need for American investment in Ireland, North and South.  As the press statement issued after the meeting indicates, both of us condemned support for organisations engaged, directly or indirectly, in campaigns of violence in Northern Ireland, which only delay the coming of peace and reconciliation and retard economic, political and social progress on this island.  I have arranged for a copy of that statement to be laid before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other American officials or representatives we met included Vice President Mondale, Speaker O'Neill, Senator <Col N="1992" /> Moynihan, Congressmen Foley and Boland, the chairmen and other members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  We also met Treasury Secretary Miller, Energy Secretary Duncan and Deputy (Energy) Secretary Sawhill, Governors King, Garrahy and Carey of the States of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York, and Mayors Jane Byrne, Morial and McConn.  Again at these meetings we discussed matters affecting Northern Ireland, American investment in Ireland and EEC-US relations.  Towards the end of our tour we had discussions with the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Waldheim, and afterwards with the President of the Security Council, the President of the General Assembly and the President of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. We discussed matters affecting world peace and security and in particular Cambodia and Ireland's peace-keeping role in the Lebanon.  Our respective heavy schedules made it impossible for Senator Kennedy and me to meet but we had a long and useful telephone discussion on the major issues of common concern.</P>
    <P>Much of my time during the visit was taken up also with briefing on the situation in Ireland and in Europe for editors, correspondents and other media representatives.</P>
    <P>Throughout our tour, we met with many other representatives and officials and discussed with them&mdash;as I did with President Carter and his colleagues&mdash;matters such as</P>
    <P>&mdash;issues facing the United States and the European Community in the world today,</P>
    <P>&mdash;bilateral issues as between Ireland and the United States and</P>
    <P>&mdash;policy affecting Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to Europe, we discussed, in a general way, the major problems facing both our communities in the world today, including the increasingly serious shortage of energy, the impact of modern technology on employment, the <Col N="1993" /> shift in trade as between developing and industralised countries and the demographic changes affecting the values and nature of society in many countries.</P>
    <P>We discussed also at some of the meetings the issues which are likely to arise in the immediate future such as the completion of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations, the question of the convergence of the economies of the Nine and the budget of the European Community. As Deputies will be aware, the latter items are likely to be considered at the European Council of Heads of State or of Government, at which I will be presiding, in Dublin later this month.</P>
    <P>An essential objective of my visit was the affirmation of the good relations between Ireland and the United States. Everywhere we went, we were met with friendship and understanding.  The Irish community in America, estimated at about 20 million strong, have much to be proud of in their contribution to the country of their ancestors and to the country of their adoption.</P>
    <P>About half of the new foreign investment in industry in this country originates in America.  This investment may be influenced by the closeness of the bonds between our two countries, by a common language and by the common values of the American and Irish peoples. But essentially the investment comes here because of the welcome which the Irish people and all of our Governments have given it and because of the high rate of return it can now achieve in a market of 260 million people. Location of American industry in Ireland does not hurt employment or investment in America but gives access to the European market which would not otherwise be available.  During my visit I announced details of further investment by nine American corporations, involving capital commitments of about £13 million and about 1,600 new jobs, when fully operational.  These industries include firms producing electronic, pharmaceutical, medical, leisure and chemical products, all in high demand and most on the frontiers of technology <Col N="1994" /> in the world today.  The representatives of other firms, some of them in similar lines of business, and some among the most advanced in their particular fields of operation in the world, indicated their intention of deciding soon to locate in Ireland; but in accordance with a wise and well-established practice, we do not announce details until the decisions are made.  These new industries whose names will become apparent in coming weeks and months will continue the drive we are making to establish Ireland as an important manufacturer and supplier, in the world today, of electronic and other high technology products.</P>
    <P>So far, in what I have been saying I have been concerned largely with economic and social affairs.  I want now to turn to the third of the major concerns of my visit.  This was to outline Government policies on Northern Ireland and to give the American people everywhere as wide and as deep as possible an understanding of the issues involved.  The essential principles are clear.  I have outlined them many times before in this House&mdash;most recently in reply to Parliamentary Questions on 17 October 1979.  I do not intend to go again in detail into these issues here today.  It is sufficient to say that everywhere we went there was widespread support for and understanding of the Government's aims and policies and an extraordinarily high measure of abhorrence for those conducting campaigns of violence or supporting them, directly or indirectly.</P>
    <P>An obvious question is whether the visit was a success.  I think that it was&mdash;in the understanding I received from President Carter and other leaders, in the support which is patently now so widespread among the American people for the Government's aims and policies, in the creation of prosperity and employment from the new investment which the visit so obviously encouraged, and in the extent, veracity and immediacy of the coverage we received from the media both in Washington and elsewhere.  But Deputies need not accept my assessment. I need refer only to Senator Kennedy's congratulations in his formal <Col N="1995" /> statement after our discussion on our &ldquo;extremely successful tour of the U.S.&rdquo;&mdash;and to Governor Carey's assessment of the visit as being a &ldquo;profound success&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of this statement by the Taoiseach on a visit which is clearly an important and historic one in so far as he was present in the United States not merely in his capacity as Taoiseach of this State but as President of the Council of Ministers. His discussions with the United States President and other senior officials in his administration related to European Community matters as well as to matters of purely Irish concern.  The Taoiseach has referred to these discussions as relating to issues facing the United States and the European Community in the world today.  At a later stage he seems to refer to what some of these subjects may have been.  I was somewhat concerned to notice that the list was more economic than political and I wondered whether on this occasion the political issues on which the member states of the European Community, through the European political co-operation mechanism, have formed a common view, and where the communication of that view could be helpful, might not also have been discussed.  I hope they have.  This is the case in relation to the Middle East.  We are not told whether that issue came up for discussion. There are other areas of the world such as Iran and Namibia and&mdash;although this is in a sense at present <i>sub judice</i> and discussion might not necessarily be helpful&mdash;the problems of Zimbabwe Rhodesia where the Community has an interest and has shown its concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of this trip is evident in its contribution to the further improvement of the understanding of the United States of the true character of the Northern Ireland problems and of our policy.  I say &ldquo;our policy&rdquo; rather advisedly because in its essentials&mdash;that is in the priority for developed self-government, the dangers of <Col N="1996" /> British withdrawal in advance of a political solution, as spelled out by the Taoiseach in his <i>Time magazine</i> interview before going&mdash;it is one common to the political parties democratically elected by the people of this State.  In any event, I speak for my own party in that respect.</P>
    <P>The work energetically undertaken by the Taoiseach, in no way sparing himself in what was a long and, I am sure, very tiring tour, is work which he had started in a previous administration as Taoiseach at a time when it was perhaps more difficult and more unpopular to challenge some of the preconceptions of certain Irish-American groups.  That work was continued by the National Coalition Government culminating in the visit of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Liam Cosgrave, to the United States in 1976 when he had the unique privilege of addressing the Joint Houses of Congress, and his address had a profound effect on opinion in the United States.  The effects and impact of the work carried through in those years, culminating in that address, were to be seen when a year later the four Irish-American leaders issued a joint statement on Northern Ireland and the subject of violence.  The immediate credit for this statement was to go to the deputy leader of the SDLP, John Hume, but the advance planning and preparations had been carried through right from the period when the Taoiseach was in office previously and through our period in Government.  The efforts during our period in Government also provided the foundation for the Carter initiative and, I believe, for the new sense of involvement of the United States administration in Northern Ireland affairs, and the communication of this to the United Kingdom Government has already had profound effects on British attitudes and must have contributed to today's White Paper, on which it is premature at this stage to make any comment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in this visit, carried on this process which had been undertaken by his predecessors and initiated by himself back in 1972.  The evidence appears <Col N="1997" /> to be that he was successful in this work and, indeed, in spelling out the attractions of this country as a base for United States investment.  Despite the cloud thrown over the visit by what I must regard as his unwise disclosure to the US press that security arrangements agreed with the United Kingdom involved a new type of provision for overflights, and even more so by the reactions of members of his own party during his absence, the Taoiseach is right in saying that the visit was a success in the American context. It would appear from what little it is possible to glean at this stage that the kind of reactions created here did not feed back to the United States on such a scale as to damage what he was trying to do for our State.  For my own part I was brought up to believe in the duty to support one's Government abroad unless there is a total gulf on a crucial issue affecting democracy.  I felt it my duty to do this and, when the polls closed and indeed immediately after the by-election defeats of the Government, to make it clear that we had fought this election on economic issues and that these defeats in no way reflected upon or weakened the Taoiseach's authority to speak on Northern Ireland matters in the United States on behalf of the people of this State on the basis of the common ground set out in his interview in <i>Time</i> magazine.  I would only add that the duty which is imposed on the Opposition and also on all those outside politics to support the Government in circumstances of this kind and to leave criticism to another place and another time within the boundaries of our own State is a duty which is shared even by members of the Government party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Taoiseach for making this statement and for continuing with the practice of making a report to the Dáil in this fashion to give leaders of Opposition parties an opportunity to comment after meetings held abroad with Heads of State in other countries.  The only exception to that since the commencement of this Dáil was after the meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1998" /> The failure to make that statement and allow members of the Opposition parties to comment has led to considerable controversy both in and out side this House on the subject matter of the meetings which the Taoiseach would not report to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The visit of the Taoiseach, accompanied by his wife, Mrs. Lynch, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his wife, and his party to the United States was in some respects very beneficial to the Irish nation.  We should express our appreciation of the very arduous task undertaken by them during those nine days.  Some people have the impression that going abroad is one long holiday.  Anybody who was aware of the schedule of meetings and commitments undertaken by the Taoiseach and Mrs. Lynch and his party will appreciate the considerable service they have done to this nation. They were all very hard pressed to fulfil the many engagements and commitments which I consider to be desirable for them to undertake on visits such as this one.</P>
    <P>There were a number of positive aspects to the visit.  Considerable IDA initiated investment was concluded.  The Taoiseach was able to show some positive results in relation to investment here and job creation resulting from that investment.  I should like to refer briefly to my party's position on this.  While we fully appreciate the need and desirability of foreign investment here, I would again refer to the concern of my party and, indeed, a concern shared by people outside my party&mdash;Irish business circles included&mdash;that there is an undue percentage, particularly of our manufacturing sector, going into foreign hands.  This is something we would again urge the Government to look at seriously in the interests of the Irish people.  However, the efforts made by the Taoiseach could be regarded as beneficial and we recognise that fact.</P>
    <P>On the question of the support the Provisional IRA and any other groups engaged in violence here enjoyed among certain members of the Irish-American community, there has been a very <Col N="1999" /> prolonged and intensive campaign by successive Irish Governments, and by our diplomatic missions to the United States, to try to convey to Irish-Americans the abhorrence with which the vast majority of the Irish people view the men of violence here.  I fully endorse the Taoiseach's description, in America, of these people as being &ldquo;the true enemies of the Irish people and of Irish democracy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We, in this party, both in Government and in Opposition, on any occasion when we had an opportunity of speaking to Irish-Americans&mdash;whether politicians, officials, or ordinary American citizens of Irish extraction&mdash;have, at all times, very forcibly confirmed the Taoiseach's view and description of these people as being the real enemies of the Irish people and also his description of the people who support them, either financially or otherwise, as falling into the same category.  That is something which we, in this party, fully endorse.</P>
    <P>It was somewhat regrettable that what could have been a major success, as far as this country's interests were concerned, was somewhat marred and the benefit diminished by certain events which took place both in the United States and within the Fianna Fáil Party here at home and the reaction to the democratic voice of the Irish people in the recent by-elections which started off a chain reaction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>During the visit of the Taoiseach to the United States, one of his official duties was to hold a press conference in the Washington Press Club, at which he elaborated considerably, in my view, on the recent agreement concluded between the British and Irish Governments with regard to Border security.  In reply to a question in this House today the Taoiseach gave as his reason for giving more information in America to a group of media reporters that he regarded them as highly influential and I think he used the word &ldquo;prestigious&rdquo; in their field.  Now, is one to conclude by that that the Taoiseach regards the Washington Press Club as being more important, more influential and more prestigious than Dáil Éireann?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I, in this House, endeavoured, on a number of occasions, to elicit information from the Taoiseach regarding the agreement which had been concluded between the British Government and ours in relation to Border security.  The Taoiseach persistently refused to give any information whatsoever with regard to that agreement and <Col N="2002" /> gave as his reason that it would be contrary to the interests of national security to either deny or confirm whether an air corridor had been part of that agreement, or whether permission was given for British Security Forces to operate within our jurisdiction and under what circumstances that agreement had been arrived at.  However, the Taoiseach, for some extraordinary reason, saw fit to give, to a group of journalists, additional information which he refused to give to this House and to the Irish people.  One is entitled to ask what prompted the Taoiseach to refuse to give legitimate information in the proper place and subsequently to give it abroad to a group of journalists?  There are only two conclusions that one can come to, first, that the Taoiseach was afraid, at that point, to disclose the nature of the agreement that had been arrived at because he would not get the support of the Fianna Fáil Party, or the majority of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, regarding its items, or he was afraid of what impact the disclosure which he made in Washington might have had on the results of the Cork by-elections.  One can only conclude that when the results of the Cork by-elections were conveyed to him he then decided it was politically allowable to disclose somewhat more information than he had disclosed to this House and to the Irish people in response to legitimate questions I had tabled in this House in relation to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question of agreement on security matters with the British Government has been going on for some weeks and it has not yet been concluded.  I want to make one thing perfectly clear.  So far as this party are concerned our position regarding violence or organisations that advocate or participate in violence is well known.  Our attitude towards security is also well known.  However, we are considerably disturbed by the distortions, the red herrings, the smoke-screens and the deliberate misuse of words that has been engaged in by the Taoiseach during the course of this controversy over Border security.  We believe that British forces operating within our territorial <Col N="2003" /> jurisdiction would not be effective with regard to security.</P>

We believe that the Air Navigation Order, 1952, was not made for the purpose for which it is now being used.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Taoiseach's statement on his visit to the United States, the agreement with regard to an air corridor and what he described as a very slight improvement on the 1952 order clearly indicates that the order is being misused.  It was made in 1952 in relation to military overflights in our territorial airspace for such operations as those carried out by countries involved in NATO exercises or travel on <Col N="2005" /> other legitimate business by foreign military aircraft.  The air corridor and the extension of the 1952 order is clearly in relation to Border security and indicates that it would be a military operation engaged in by the security forces of another country within our territory. Would they be armed?</P>

      <P>In relation to the statement made regarding overflights, air corridors and security arrangements along the Border, surely it is proper that a Member of this House should ask a simple question?  If there are overflights by military aircraft who are going to engage themselves operationally in the question of security, surely it is the case that the Dáil, at least in principle, would give permission for such flights?  The permission given by the Dáil under the 1952 agreement did not envisage that type of operation.  The Taoiseach's references to what the former Government, past governments or future governments have done or will do is of no interest to me.  I am concerned about what this Government are doing, what agreement they concluded with the British Government and what the effect of allowing British security forces to operate within our territory will be on the almost total commitment of our people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a short Bill.  Its purpose is to increase the ceiling on borrowing by the Agricultural Credit Corporation from the present limit of £350 million to a figure of £600 million, and to increase, similarly, the maximum amount of borrowing which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>It is desirable to have the Bill passed urgently.  Borrowings by the corporation are approaching the statutory limit and, as Deputies are aware, I recently authorised the corporation to borrow £25 million abroad for on-lending to the agricultural community for productive purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When introducing consolidating legislation on agricultural credit&mdash;the Agricultural Credit Act, 1978&mdash;I gave a considerable amount of information to the House about the history and activities of the ACC, and, having regard to the nature and scope of the present Bill, I do not think it necessary for me to go over the same ground in the same degree of detail as before.  However, to recap briefly, the ACC, one of the first State-sponsored bodies in this country, were established in 1927 in order to provide a specialised credit service for agriculture, particularly long-term credit. For many years the volume of business was small, reflecting the general <Col N="2011" /> economic climate and a reluctance of farmers to borrow.  Today the corporation are a highly-developed lending agency investing well over £100 million a year in Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The rapid increase in business began in the late sixties with improving market conditions, a growing confidence in the agricultural industry and the increasing willingness of farmers to invest heavily in other enterprises.  ACC lendings which totalled £10 million in 1965 rose to £25 million in 1970.  Business expanded with increasing momentum during the seventies. The corporation themselves did much to encourage greater investment and to adapt their own organisation to the new production and trading environment. Investment in agriculture increased dramatically as farmers availed themselves of the opportunities presented by membership of the EEC and the many benefits flowing from the common agricultural policy.  The recognition of the importance of a high level of investment and planned development is one of the very encouraging features of the agricultural economy in recent years.</P>
    <P>By 1978 the amount of advances issued by ACC had increased to £143 million representing over 23,000 individual loan transactions.  The total amount owing to the corporation, which stood at £130 million at the end of 1975, had reached £320 million at the end of September.</P>
    <P>During the present decade the corporation also established a wide network of offices throughout the country bringing their facilities within easy reach of the farmer.  They are continuing to extend this network, thus ensuring that they can maintain close contact with the varied problems of the individual customer.</P>
    <P>In recent years the corporation financed a large proportion of their advances through the medium of deposit income. The other principal source of funds is repayments on existing loans.  Deposits proved a buoyant source of income.  Net deposit inflows averaged £55 million <Col N="2012" /> over the past few years, and the total amount now on deposit with the corporation is £265 million.  The deposits carry a State guarantee and enjoy the status of trustee security.</P>
    <P>The corporation may give loans and hire-purchase facilities for any purpose which, in their opinion, is of benefit to agriculture or horticulture.  The main demands are for loans for purchase of livestock, land purchase and improvement, buildings and machinery, seeds, grain and fertiliser, working capital, debt funding and family settlements.  They give loans to farmers and to firms in the agricultural processing industries such as creameries, meat factories and grain mills. Repayment periods are from one to two years for short-term loans to 15 years for land purchase.  Current rates of interest range from 17½ per cent for seasonal loans payable within one year to 18¾ per cent for term loans of ten years and over.</P>
    <P>A particularly successful innovation in recent years was the scheme of development loans designed to encourage planned development of farm enterprises.  Loans are given on the basis of plans submitted by prospective borrowers and repayment terms are geared to suit the type of project involved. Over £25 million was advanced for such loans during the present year bringing the total development loans issued to £54 million.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be interested to know that in the near future the activities of the corporation will be reviewed by the Óireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  The committee's findings will be awaited with considerable interest both by myself and, I am sure, by Deputies in general.</P>
    <P>Because of the continuing expansion in the corporation's business it is now necessary to raise the maximum amount which they are authorised to borrow. The new ceiling is £600 million for the total amount borrowed and outstanding at any one time.  The Minister for Finance is authorised to guarantee borrowings by the corporation.  It is accordingly proposed also to increase the <Col N="2013" /> ceiling on such guarantees to £600 million.  Given the likely future pattern of growth by the corporation, I think that the new ceilings should take care of their borrowings requirements up to mid-1982. I would be glad to have the co-operation of the House in having the Bill passed quickly because of the decision to borrow £25 million abroad which I mentioned at the beginning.  I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We will facilitate the Minister in giving him all Stages of the Bill as soon as the contributions from this side of the House have been completed. I do not see any problem about any of the sections of the Bill.  I am a little confused about the following statement by the Minister of State:</P>
      <P>Borrowings by the corporation are approaching the statutory limit and, as Deputies are aware, I recently authorised the corporation to borrow £25 million abroad for on-lending to the agricultural community for productive purposes.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Minister must underwrite the borrowings by the corporation but I understood that they were empowered to borrow abroad anyway. Since the Minister authorised the corporation to borrow £25 million abroad, would that not put them over the statutory limit of £300 million as agreed to in the consolidating Bill which we passed here two years ago?  The £350 million that was authorised at that stage was supposed to last until the beginning of 1981.  Can the Minister tell us when replying why within a very short period his Department or indeed the Agricultural Credit Corporation could be so wrong and so out of focus in their predictions about what money they wanted and how long it would last?  Are we sure that the £600 million that the Minister is now asking us to pay will last until mid-1982 or will he be back again in 12 months time seeking to raise the ceiling again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to see how that amount of money will be lent to farmers when in his speech the Minister says: &ldquo;Current <Col N="2014" /> rates of interest range from 17½ per cent for seasonal loans payable within one year to 18¾ per cent for term loans of ten years and over.&rdquo;  Given the present conditions of the agricultural industry it is hard to see people borrowing huge sums of money at these penal rates of interest.  I know that in other lending institutions the basic interest rates are comparable and are sometimes higher and I know that rates of interest are tending to go up all over Europe but given the depressed state of Irish agriculture after its long healthy run, it is difficult to understand how farmers could warrant borrowing money at these rates of interest when the future does not appear to be bright in the agricultural industry. Either the Minister's Department or the Department of Agriculture should consider subsidising these interest rates. It was done before in relation to the TB eradication scheme.  Interest rates were subsidised and were brought down to as low as 2½ per cent to encourage farmers to keep cattle rather than sell them.  The same applies now and the Minister should consider subsidising the extremely high interest rates particularly at the short end of the market where the rate is 17½ per cent.  If that rate is brought down to about 10 per cent it might encourage farmers to keep their cattle rather than put them on the market, thus further depressing the price of cattle which is at a very low level at the moment.</P>
    <P>A section of the agricultural industry which demands the attention of the ACC, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is the egg producing business.  This section of the agricultural industry has in the last 12 or 18 months come up against heavy competition with which they cannot cope.  The volume of native Irish egg producing business has been halved in that period.  If something is not done urgently from the point of view of subsidisation or protection from the importation of eggs, the native industry will be wiped out and the egg producing business here will be entirely controlled by outside interests or else the market <Col N="2015" /> will be supplied with imported eggs which is happening now to a large extent.  It is no secret that in an effort to diversify their interests the British Imperial Tobacco Company have invested in the industry through Ross Foods.  They recently bought a 50 per cent holding in one of the egg producing companies in the Republic and to gain a foothold they cut the price severely and have wiped out half the industry here.  Their ambition is to reach the dominant position in the Republic that they have in England and in the North of Ireland, which is 40 per cent of the market.</P>
    <P>When the producers here saw this position coming about they contacted the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy to seek protection under the Monopolies and Mergers Bill.  They just got a shrug of the shoulders from the Minister concerned who said that she could not help them, that the case did not come within the scope of that Bill. These people said they found very little appreciation of or interest in their industry in the Department of Agriculture, and that they could not get the Minister there to concern himself with what everybody admits is a small section of the market compared with beef, dairying and grain industries.</P>
    <P>There were about 2,000 engaged in earning their living in this industry, and the numbers are dropping fast because of outside competition.  The Minister for Finance can help under this Bill through the Agricultural Credit Corporation. Co-ops, yards and sheds in the egg producing business have a relatively limited life and because of the historical coincidence of the industry here most of them will be coming up for renewal very shortly.  If the Minister gave an undertaking through the Agricultural Credit Corporation to allow these people to replace their equipment and still remain in business by heavily subsidising interest rates, we could keep egg production as an Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Some dramatic measure is required urgently of the Government to keep this industry alive.  I am not talking about <Col N="2016" /> next year when the matter has been considered but about positive steps being taken in the next few weeks.  It is quite definite that the reinvestment will not be made after Christmas, that many people will go out of business, and that the major egg producing company here will be 50 per cent owned by the Ross Company and then by the Imperial Tobacco Company in Great Britain which has had the effect in England of virtually wiping out individual egg producers.  In the north they have a huge investment and are producing eggs cheaper than the small producer which has a very damaging effect on them and the same thing will happen in the Republic unless something is done urgently.</P>
    <P>Egg producers here are in the minority and they spread from Monaghan to Cork and from Galway to Dublin, right across the country.  They are not a large number of people in any one area but they will be out of business in 12 months' time unless the Department of Agriculture take an interest or unless the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy protect them under legislation.  I suggest that the Minister interest himself in them and instruct the ACC to immediately enter into negotiations with them to provide them with capital at nil interest rate for the replacement of their equipment.  At least that would be a sign of interest, a sign which they have not got from the Government up to this.  On that side nobody has shown any sign of interest in the fact that in 12 months' time the Irish involvement in the production of eggs will be almost wiped out. The immediacy of the problem is not appreciated in the Department of Agriculture.  A cursory glance at the legislation available in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, would not, on the surface, appear to be applied to them, but I am suggesting what they have not suggested, that something can be done through the Department of Finance which needs to be done very urgently.  That is the major point I want to bring up.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that of course we welcome this and we welcome any investment <Col N="2017" /> in agriculture, but the time has now come, because of high interest rates and the depressed condition of the agricultural industry, when the Government will need to start thinking about subsidising interest rates if they are going to stop a very serious erosion of confidence in the industry in the future.  This was done previously under the TB eradication scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to comment on two further points.  One is the news item in this morning's papers about the setting up of a farmers' bank as announced by Mr. Maher yesterday.  I quote from this morning's <i>Cork Examiner:</i></P>
    <P>Mr. Maher saw the emergence of a new finance institution as &ldquo;a logical step&rdquo; for co-ops.  &ldquo;It is not logical that farmers wearing one hat are taking out money at 18 per cent and wearing another hat are putting it into banks at 12 and 12½ per cent,&rdquo; he said.</P>
    <P>For the Minister that should be a very disturbing news item.  On the very day that he is coming in here looking for extra borrowing facilities for the agricultural institutes, farmers' co-operatives are announcing that they are contemplating and, even further than that, have maybe perhaps made arrangements for the setting up of a farmers' bank.  At least on the surface that would appear to be a mark of no confidence by the farmers in the ACC, although that is not apparent when you talk to individual farmers.  They have nothing but praise for the way they are treated in the offices throughout the country by the officers of the ACC.  They use the ACC pretty extensively; they are given a very sympathetic hearing by the company generally and they have a lot of confidence in them which they did not always have.  That is at individual farmer level dealing with one of the many offices that there are in the country.  Yet at the top level of the farmers we have this announcement that the farmers themselves are thinking of setting up a bank, presumably providing an overlapping service with the ACC, unless the item in this morning's papers is incorrect or unless I am misinterpretating what they <Col N="2018" /> have in mind.  The Minister should at least give an indication of the first reactions of his Department to this news this morning and he should let us know how they intend to keep the ACC in competition and in business if the farmers take what Mr. Maher described this morning as &ldquo;this logical step&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The other point, the last I want to make, is that when the consolidating legislation was brought in in the past two years, it contained a section which allowed money to be lent to the fishing industry and it was introduced for the first time under ACC legislation to allow money to be lent to the fishing industry. Exactly how much use was made of that section of the 1978 Bill?  Did the fishing industry take that up and, if so, to what extent and to what purposes?  I would be grateful if the Minister would give me that information when he comes to reply to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, we support the purpose of this Bill.  Agriculture remains the most important industry in the country and as a national resource its development at any stage must not be held back.  However, I would like to make one or two points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A reflection on the serious economic situation facing the country is the fact that the Minister towards the end of his speech talked about the rates of interest on seasonal loans at 17½ per cent.  The mind boggles at the economy of the agricultural operation which can repay loans at interest rates of that high level and 18¾ per cent for term loans of 10 years and over.  Irish agriculture this year is not as prosperous as in recent years.  This is not one of its best years. In the context of this Bill it is unlikely that the present price support mechanism that we have known in the European Community over recent years which has been responsible in large measure for the prosperity which has come to Irish agriculture will continue into the indefinite future.  The point must be made, and it has relevance to the operations of the ACC, that if it is necessary for the Minister now to look for an increase in the ceiling of loans permissible <Col N="2019" /> under statute, there is a question mark over the whole future of the present prices system in Irish agriculture in the sense here that the political support for the common agricultural policy of the EEC which we have known since our entry into the Community is now clearly on the wane.</P>
    <P>Obviously, this has serious implications for the kind of agricultural policy pursued by the country to date and for the future operations of the ACC themselves. The Minister has explained that he wants support for this measure.  We give support for this measure in the sense that credit is necessary for Irish agriculture, but credit to be made available for agriculture in the years ahead must be chosen very carefully and must be the product of calculation of the kind of policies to be pursued in agriculture by the EEC.  At present it would be a mistake, a grievous policy error, to conclude that the CAP as we know it will remain intact over the years immediately ahead.  I do not believe it will and political support for the present CAP is on the wane.  The implication of that for Irish agriculture is that Irish agricultural leaders must now consider what strategy they would like us to adopt for the benefit of agriculture in this changing system in relation to CAP.</P>
    <P>I would like the ACC to review that part of their credit facilities which apparently, to some extent at any rate and in the last two or three years particularly, was concentrated on loans for the purchase of land and constituted a very large part of their operation.  Especially in the context of the kind of agricultural policy which we would be facing in the EEC&mdash;which after all is the overall context in which the Irish agriculture is prosperous or not&mdash;they must review the proportion of their business which at present is occupied with the purchase of land and, instead of concentrating on the land purchase needs of the farmer of 200 or more acres, they should now perhaps give greater attention, in the context of changing agricultural policy, to the man <Col N="2020" /> who is referred to by many political parties as the smaller farmer.  I refer to the farmer with under 100 acres.  His development needs should now be looked at afresh and perhaps greater attention paid to his development needs in the period immediately ahead.  The criticism can be made that the ACC have unduly concentrated their activities in recent years on land purchase, particularly at the upper end of agricultural holdings.  The case can be made that they have contributed to some extent to the over-pricing of agricultural land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the banks are more to blame but the ACC have to some extent contributed to the tendency to over-price agricultural land.  I do not believe that the immediate outlook before Irish agriculture could sustain the kind of prices that have been paid for land in the last year or two.  There has been a change downwards recently but it is a very belated change.</P>
      <P>In the European Parliament all the Irish members voted together to retain CAP as we know it.  The four Irish Labour members, the Fine Gael members and the Fianna Fáil members voted to retain CAP intact because of what we considered to be the national interest, that as other Community policies had failed to produce assistance here we could not see agricultural funding damaged by any voting of ours in the European Parliament.  We all voted to retain CAP in its present form, irrespective of what our political groupings in Europe had so decided.  The House is aware that the socialist group had already changed their attitude towards CAP and they voted for large scale changes in it.  The Irish Labour Party voted against the nine member socialist grouping, of which we are members, to defend what we considered to be a national interest, especially as we saw that items like socialist policy and regional policy had not lived up to expectations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that the Irish members voted together on this issue because we considered that the net national advantage was to maintain CAP.  Political support for CAP in its present form is on the wane.  Leaders of Irish agriculture should consider this situation.  They should meet this changing situation constructively and not behave Canute-like, hoping that CAP can be maintained intact without a change in its present form.  I do not believe this is possible.  This Bill is not a debate on this and I do not propose to go into the matter at length.  It is relevant to the Bill but is not the main subject of it.  I am only making the point about the changing future of Irish agriculture and the impact this must have on the operations of the ACC.  The ACC are probably looking at this situation very seriously.  I advise them to concentrate their activities much more closely now than they did in the past when land purchase had an undue portion of their attention.  In the context of the development of the medium sized farmer, the farmer below 100 acres, more attention should be paid to his needs in the more difficult period now before us.</P>
      <P>We cannot any longer depend on automatic price increases under CAP coming from our membership of the Community.  It is clear that the future direction of the agricultural policy in the Community will concentrate increasingly on an efficient agricultural sector in Europe.  This should, theoretically, assist us if we have, as we have had, many advantages in maintaining our agricultural efficiency.  We have many conditions which favour our maintaining efficiency.  This kind of policy need not be as disastrous as some of those who support CAP in its present form would maintain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ACC have a vital role to play in this very competitive situation opening up for agriculture.  It is in the national interest if agriculture is maintained in as efficient a state as possible and that we <Col N="2022" /> maintain as many people as possible on the land if only because unemployment will face them in the city areas.  If we can delay departure from the land for as long as possible then our unemployment situation will be saved from getting that much worse.  It is obviously an objective of political parties in the House to keep as many people as possible on the land but it is not possible to keep as many people as we would like on the land in the standard of living they now desire. Nobody wishes to maintain a low standard of living for any person in any part of the country.  The demand of the electorate is for an improved standard of living. That can be done in agriculture only if it is maintained in as efficient a condition as possible.</P>
    <P>The agricultural spokesman of our party, Deputy Bermingham, has said that he would like to see the ACC move into the purchase and leasing of land.  He has advanced the argument that such land should be leased to farmers who are not considered by the ACC to be in a position to own land of their own.  He has said that he is anxious, presumably in the interests of efficient agriculture, to see those best qualified to manage farms being able to do so.</P>
    <P>One of the alarming features which sociologists have noted about Irish agriculture is that such an important national resource is on many occasions managed by those long past the age of considering competitive factors at all.  A large proposition of land is owned by septuagenarians, those with no families and no particular interest in maintaining their holdings at an efficient level.  This is a loss to the country.  Agriculture is too important an industry to allow this type of fate to befall a good deal of agricultural land.  Nobody wishes to see any person deprived of an asset.  People are buttressed in the Constitution in regard to ownership of that asset.  It is a fair point, which any person on the other side may concede, that it is nothing less than a national tragedy to see so much good land allowed to run into disuse for the sole reason that the vagaries of inheritance have made those holdings the <Col N="2023" /> property of people with no interest in managing them in an efficient way.  I am sure the ACC consider those problems in their offices up and down the country but it is outside the scope of this Bill for us to advance solutions to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he hopes the ceiling he is looking for will make it unnecessary for him to come back to the House for any increase until 1982.  I hope he is correct.  He has referred to a very important development, the setting up of the Oireachtas Joint Committee, which from now on will have the opportunity of meeting with the ACC and considering how their operations should be shaped in the future.  A lot of money is involved in the Bill.  Although we are giving the Minister a speedy passage to the Bill we are giving him an increase of £300 million.  It is very praiseworthy that the House should set up a committee which will on future occasions make an in depth study of some of the matters I have referred to this afternoon, which I believe will become much more serious concerns in 1980 and 1981 because the good old days of automatic price increases have gone.</P>
    <P>That message must go out from this House and it should go out from farm leaders.  They are leading their followers up a <i>cul de sac</i> if they are holding out the prospect of automatic price increases coming from Brussels into the eighties. Common Market or no Common Market, only properly managed and financed farms will survive into the eighties.  It is important that agriculture, on whose prosperity so much else depends, should be given wise management, constructive leadership and correct information over the next decade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which increases the ceiling on borowing by the ACC to £600 million.  The ACC have been one of our more striking success stories.  As the figures show, they have increased their lending to farming from £10 million in 1965 to £143 million last year.  This money was lent to 23,000 <Col N="2024" /> farmers.  I do not agree with the previous speaker who said that they have aided the spiralling price of agricultural land. There is a limit to the amount of money which the ACC can lend to farmers.  It is only fair to say that the ACC have a prudent lending policy.  Their success can be gauged by the increase in the amount of money lent and by the improvement in agriculture.  As recently as 1960, the total value of our agricultural exports was £89 million.  In 1970 our agricultural exports increased to £200 million and are now valued at £1,000 million.  It is only fair to give the ACC credit for allowing the farming community to develop.</P>
      <P>Although progress has been made, agriculture is still in an undeveloped state.  We have only six million head of cattle.  Our stocking rate is one animal per two acres and our milk yield is the lowest in Europe.  There is room for improvement in agriculture and I am glad that the ACC have been given additional facilities to help the farming community.</P>
      <P>Another recent praiseworthy development of the ACC is the opening of offices in many of our rural towns.  Their offices are staffed by outstanding personnel who give advice not only on the financial implications of loans but on the best way to use them.  This is an important development, as finance must be given to farmers for general development plans.  The staff of the ACC are doing a great job in helping farmers to plan their developments.  I hope the ACC open more offices in rural areas.  If this is not possible, perhaps they would consider holding a weekly clinic in towns where they have not opened permanent offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the processing sector of agriculture should be funded by the ACC.  Our main problem today is getting good prices for agricultural products.  We seem to be processing products for which there is not a ready market.  The ACC should give sympathetic consideration to applications for finance for the re-equipping of processing plant.  In order to increase our agricultural productivity, we should process products which are in demand. <Col N="2025" /> There is no doubt that we can double our stocking rate and quadruple our milk production.  In order to gain lucrative markets for our products we must diversify and modify our products.</P>
    <P>This year has been a difficult one for farming.  The low growth rate in agriculture this year is a tragedy for the economy.  Its influence on the balance of payments is greater because of this year's difficulties.  Those who are not involved in agriculture have a narrow view of the industry.  They look upon agriculture as basic farming in which 23 per cent of our population is engaged. The difficulties this year have made many people realise that agriculture affects the service and processing industries. If the people employed in the service and processing industries are included, the total number of people engaged in agriculture is 43 per cent of the population.  This shows that an improvement in agriculture benefits the whole economy.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister's speech, the amount of money advanced for planned development has been increased from £25 million to £54 million.  I believe that that amount should be further increased because the emphasis is now on planning.  Under the farm modernisation scheme farmers must have plans and must keep accounts.  More emphasis should be placed on agricultural planning.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a progressive step and we all welcome it.  Some of the increases in borrowing power needed by the Agricultural Credit Corporation may be due to inflation.  That is not a criticism of the Bill.  We do not know whether the figure asked for until a certain date in 1980-81 is correct.  I hope if it is not correct the Government of the day will come back here with a similar Bill looking for more borrowing power for the ACC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right for somebody who has been associated with the borrowing end of the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a <Col N="2026" /> long number of years to think about the beginnings of the corporation in 1927.  I am sure the House would not object to my mentioning a man whose funeral occured the other day, the late Mr. Patrick McGilligan, S.C., and his influence on the ACC in their formative years.  We should remember that during the formative period the father of Deputy John Kelly, the late Mr. Joe Kelly, was secretary to the ACC.  I celebrated my 56th birthday a short time ago but, as long as 27 years ago, I borrowed money from him.</P>
    <P>Those men must be mentioned and remembered as well as many others such as a chairman appointed by this Government, Mr. B. Considine, who happily is still with us.  He was a very good chairman and played an executive part as well.  We must all thank him for his contribution. Another man who followed the late Mr. Joe Kelly as secretary, and who is still hale and hearty, is the redoubtable Mr. G.R. Pearse, B. Comm., B.L.  We have to remember those men and the work they did for the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  It is on the foundations they built that we have what we have today. They should be remembered by all sides of the House.  We should remember all the men from all sides who gave everything they could to this great institution.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it has been announced that the Agricultural Credit Corporation are to borrow £25 million, in Deutschemarks as I understand it.  They borrowed money abroad before and they lost out on the deal because of the way the currency went.  They showed a special loss on that transaction.  I understand this borrowing is at a very favourable rate of interest.  It is most important that the ACC should show a profit each year and that the Minister for Finance, who is charged with looking after them and seeing that they follow the proper lines, will be reassured by the results.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the results as examined year by year.  The repayment record by Irish farmers is absolutely marvellous.  Over the years there <Col N="2027" /> was very nearly no such thing as a bad debt.  When you lend as a bank lends&mdash;and the Agricultural Credit Corporation lend in that way&mdash;it is very hard to have a bad debt because you are dealing with somebody who has property, such as a farmer.  The creditworthiness still holds good.  The ACC should give heart to all politicians and to everybody who would like to see this Bill bearing fruit.  That creditworthiness still holds good.  The Irish farmer will repay.</P>
    <P>The outturn on the previous occasion when money was borrowed from abroad did not affect farmers because they had made their bargains with the ACC and those bargains were carried out faithfully.  At the same time, the corporation must be prudent and see to it that they lend their money at a proper rate. Later I shall join with speakers who referred to the high rate of interest.  Just as goods have to be bought money has to be bought, and it has its price.  We are in a bad market today.  However, I will have more to say about that later.</P>
    <P>There were times when relations between the ACC and the Fianna Fáil Government were not of the very best.  I remember an occasion years ago when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance and there was the matter of the difference between £1.6 million and £2.3 million, I think, and whether the Department of Finance and the Government would make up the deficit, if there was a deficit, and if the funds did not turn up from the resources of the ACC.  I was refused bluntly by the then Minister for Finance and I availed of my right to raise the matter on the Adjournment.  After a pretty hard drubbing on the Adjournment he gave in.  That is on the record of the House.  I have not got the reference with me but, if anybody wants to read it, I will produce it.</P>
    <P>The hope is that there will be the best of relations between the Department of Finance and the ACC in the years to come.  This is vitally important to the Irish farmer.  The Department of <Col N="2028" /> Finance have been described as an inverted Micawber.  They are not like Micawber always waiting for something to turn up, but always looking for something to turn down.  We are not in that position in regard to this Bill.  I hope the ACC will be free in their business efforts, free in their efforts to borrow money abroad, and free to take commercial risks when all the risks have been assessed by the best people they have and on the best advice they can get outside their own organisation.  When that is done I hope the permission we are granting to borrow money will lead to more money for farmers at lower rates of interest if possible.</P>
    <P>One of the great advantages the ACC have, and should continue to have, is the sinking fund operation whereby the farmer who borrows money for capital requirements is asked to repay on two gale days, 1 May and 1 November, in two half-yearly repayments which include principal and interest.  That suits the farmer because on 1 November he has received his cheque for his harvest, and on 1 May he will have sold the stock he has been feeding for the winter.  That is an old system: 12 May was hiring day and 1 November was the end of another period in farming.  The system of having two gale days is the best one for the Irish farmer.  It was instituted by the men I mentioned.  It is the right way to do it.  It is the best way for the farmer and it should be kept.  It spreads equal payments over the period of repayment.  That helps the farmers.  With inflation, in money terms the money repaid could be worth less than it was on the date of borrowing. This system is better than the bank's system and it should be continued in the future.</P>
    <P>In relation to interest rates, we are in the position of being able to go into the market place to buy money in the same way as we buy goods.  I have occasion from time to time to borrow money in respect of my business and all I can say about these interest rates is that they are the prevailing rates.  I do not think it would be possible to borrow money today at lower rates in the ordinary market <Col N="2029" /> place but I should hope that the licence being given here to the ACC regarding the manner in which they may conduct their business will mean that in the years to come they will be able to lend money at interest rates lower than those prevailing in the common market place at the time.  But I appeal strongly to the Department of Finance not to get in the way of the corporation.  I suggest that the ACC should be let off the leash in this regard and that as time passes and opportunities arise they may be in a position to borrow abroad at better terms and, consequently, be able to lend the money to the Irish farmers on more favourable terms.  The Department should not interfere with such a perfectly ordinary commercial operation.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the pig industry and to the poultry industry.  There is a problem in this regard because there is a loss of £2 or £3 on any pig that is not being fed whey or skimmed milk. Most efficient operators will be able to prove this from their accounts.  There is a similar problem in respect of the egg industry. Deputy Peter Barry mentioned the great takeover and the vertical integration. If the very big combines can take over an industry we may all end up in the situation of having to work for them because the small, medium-sized or ordinary large farm operator, those people who for the most part are Irish nationals, will find themselves squeezed out.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this is not a time to be faint-hearted or for saying that the industry has not been paying for the past six to twelve months and that another six months may elapse before the situation is righted so that in the meantime money will not be made available to the industry. There should be a policy line in the ACC in relation to the lending of money so that those facets of Irish agricultural industry that are suffering a temporary setback should not be allowed to die from malnutrition but should be nourished by the input of capital on a planned basis.  In this way we will ensure that at the end of the bad cycle there will be an opportunity for <Col N="2030" /> production and profit, that the factory-farm enterprises will not be taken over entirely by the very big multinational and national combines and that undesirable vertical integration to which I have referred will be avoided.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is very important and which concerns me greatly is the question of the housing of stock.  Far too many cattle are left out for too long during the winter.  There is nothing as bad for land as having it trampled on by cattle during the winter months.  This results, the following summer, in land that is covered in weeds and thistles but with very poor grass.  Regardless of the cost of housing stock and of the ensilaging of grass, expenditure in this sphere will pay dividends.  In the first instance, the cattle will be better and even if profit is reduced as a result of the cost of feed and so on, it will be recouped in the following year by reason of grassland that is properly managed producing a good deal more grass than would be the case otherwise.  Therefore, there should be a strong policy within the ACC in regard to the provision for housing for cattle and for winter feed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we must not charge the ACC with neglect in this area but in many instances we can accuse the farmers of such neglect, though we must remember that the road has been long and hard.  I have a self-servicing silage unit for 100 cattle which 17 years ago cost me £4,800.  This year I bought an identical unit for £30,000.  Therefore, the cost of that unit has increased sixfold in those 17 years.  Such cost present difficulties but this is where the long-term financing comes into operation.  There has been reference to a ten-year period but I have borrowed money from the ACC for a 21-year period.  I have borrowed money from them also on a 15-year term and I have borrowed money from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, under the Grain Storage Loans Act, for 25 years at a four-and-a-quarter per cent.  When one <Col N="2031" /> considers the increased cost of housing cattle and the absolute necessity for housing them if we are to achieve full production from the land, the longest time quoted in respect of a period of repayment is too short.  Consequently, the period should be extended for specific purposes where it can be proved that the need is great and that the advantages are also great.</P>
      <P>I agree with those other speakers who have said that there has been a situation in this part of Ireland in which land purchase was accelerated by the banks. As somebody said recently all that was needed was one's signature and a kind face in order to borrow money to buy land.  The price of land rocketed because one bank manager was vying with another to give money for the purchase of land, the price of which was far in excess of what it should be if ordinary farm enterprise were to repay and show some profit.  But I would not blame the ACC in this regard.  They are prepared to advance money to those seeking to render a holding more economic.  I understand, for instance, that if there is a question of the consolidation of two holdings into a more viable single holding, the corporation will not be totally inflexible.  When one considers that about a year ago the price of agricultural land in England was about half the corresponding price here and that the price there now is still less than two-thirds our price, taken in terms of a business enterprise, the price of land here was on a scarcity value basis and was far too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand this because, for instance, there would not be any point in my buying ten acres of land in County Wexford because of the difficulty that would be involved in administering such land from County Louth but in the event of a holding coming on the market and there being adjacent to it three or four farmers who had sons and who had always been very good in terms of repaying loans to the banks or to the ACC, it would be only natural for those farmers to be prepared to commit the <Col N="2032" /> following year's profits in addition to whatever they might have in order to acquire that extra bit of land which might provide them with their last opportunity of being able to get another holding in the area.  That represents a scarcity value situation and is something we must live with because there will never be enough land for everyone.  At the same time there has been too much lending for that kind of buying.  Perhaps the ACC are a little loose in that regard but I would not like to see the situation being continued whereby farmers pay far too much for land with the consequent high repayments that such operations require.  I wish both the Government and the ACC well in regard to financing agriculture.  I want to see the Department of Finance acting not as a complete watchdog on them but allowing them to do their thing in a commercial and progressive way.  I would like to see them go ahead with this approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which is a follow up to the Agricultural Bill of 1977, passed here in 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ACC have made a major contribution to agriculture and this is recognised by everybody in the House. They are playing an important role and it is a continuing one.  A very important development took place at yesterday's conference of the ICOS and it has a bearing on the future of the Irish agricultural banking institutions.  The Minister stated that it was intended to place the affairs of the ACC before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State Sponsored Bodies.  I welcome this decision because there are tremendous opportunities in agriculture which are not being availed of by the ACC to the extent that they should be.  It would be a retrograde step for the ICOS to form an alternative banking system to the ACC. A far more logical approach would be for the ACC, by arrangement with the Irish farming organisations, to form in time a truly Irish farm banking system which would entail the full extension of the facilities which they have at this stage.  At present the ACC are not in a position to provide the full banking <Col N="2033" /> facilities available to the farming community from the commercial banks and I cannot see the logic in not, at some stage, extending the services of the ACC by giving them full cheque book facilities and other banking facilities for their customers.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Joint Committee on State Sponsored Bodies will come up with such recommendations so that it will be possible to combine the efforts of the ICOS, the IFA, the National Land League and all the other farming organisations to form a major banking institution.  This institution would be in competition with the present lending organisations.  These organisations are not in competition with each other and they form a major cartel with excessive profits of about £20 million per annum. Indeed, their profits are so excessive that they represent what I would call the unacceptable face of capitalism.  The only alternative is to extend the facilities of the ACC so that they can become a fully operative bank in competition with other commercial banking organisations and, by providing full facilities for their farming and other customers, they would be in a position to compete fairly and squarely with the other organisations.</P>
    <P>It is not just a coincidence that the major banking groups offer preferential treatment to farmers.  The lending rates for farmers are about 1 per cent less than the normal rate for non-farmers.  This is an indication of the effects of the ACC at present.  They are providing services for the farming community and they are obtaining finance for them.  As a result the banking organisations are very anxious to obtain the farmer customer, because he is a very good customer.  As Deputy Donegan has said, the farmer is such a good customer that very little of the funds have been written off by the ACC and that is evident from the director's report dated 31 December 1978.</P>
    <P>To develop the point I am making in relation to the ACC, they should be given more freedom to operate in the market place.  The need to come before the Dáil at regular intervals to increase their borrowing capacity should be dispensed <Col N="2034" /> with.  Certainly they should be supervised by a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas at regular intervals, but having to come back here to increase their borrowing capacity is restrictive.  In this case there was sanction for £350 million. They are now seeking £600 million.  I hope this will satisfy them for some time, but if it does not it is unfortunate that they have to come back here regularly to get permission to obtain the finance. This situation should be looked at and they should be given more flexibility.</P>
    <P>At the moment the interest rate on deposits is from 11 per cent to 18 per cent depending on the type of funds that are being made available to the ACC. This compares with the commercial banks' rate for deposits at from 10 per cent to 13½ per cent.  The lending rate of the ACC is from 17 per cent to 19 per cent and this compares with the commercial banks' AA lending rate, which is one of the best rates they have, at 16 per cent; but I suspect that in reality the commercial banks charge much more than that.</P>
    <P>The ACC could attract more funds if they had all the facilities of the commercial banks.  The commercial banks have a major advantage: they have funds on deposit and cheque book facilities available.  So far as the cheque book facilities are concerned they have to pay no interest but only to provide a service for overdrafts and mortgages.  The ACC could quite easily be geared to provide such services.  They have roughly 6,000 employees at the moment.  They have excellent facilities throughout the country. They have top level management.  They need a new incentive.  The suggestion by the ICOS to form a banking institution could be the opportunity for the ACC to combine their efforts and to provide a truly Irish farm banking institution which will provide finance not only for the farmers but for the co-operative movement.  It is a remarkable situation that at the moment, as was stated at the conference last night, it is costing the co-operatives about £60 million per annum for loans.  That is a lot of money which could be used in the development of <Col N="2035" /> agriculture.  The total combined turnover is about £2,500 million per annum and with that type of money in circulation the combined efforts of all the major farm banking organisations would be viable and succesful.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to review the situation, because if it comes to pass that the ACC would be operating in all the marts and in all the co-operatives where facilities and offices are available they could provide facilities there for a national farm banking institution.  There is great potential.  It is a great opportunity and the Minister should consider it.  The Department of Finance should look into that matter and when it comes before the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies this idea would be worthy of their serious consideration. There are great opportunities there. Agriculture is our most important business and we have not the banking facilities to meet the needs of the farmers. Credit is due to the ACC for their tremendous work but they are being restricted to a great extent.  Consideration should be given to the possibility of having the ACC formed into a public company quoted on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>Their top executives do not receive an adequate remuneration for their talent, ability and contribution to a company which, in the year ending 1978, had a profit of around £3.290 million, which was added to the revenue reserve service. The ACC are being restricted by the Devlin Commission in relation to remuneration in the public service, but if they were taken out of the public service and provided with a State bank in line with all the other organisations, there would be a different approach to remuneration.  The interesting point is that probably the chief agricultural advisers to some of the banks would be getting equal remuneration to the chief executive of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. Though they are getting a lot of money and are well paid, the incentive is not there, compared with the incentive for the chief executive of the commercial banks; there is no comparison between <Col N="2036" /> the two salaries.  If such a company were set up, there would be a board of directors, with representatives of all farming organisations, able to advise the directors and the management on the trends of farming and to ensure that funds would be available to the area of greatest need and greatest potentiality.  As Deputy Donegan has said in relation to housing for cattle priority must be given to cattle housing because it is an expensive item on any farm at the moment, as is provision of silage facilities.</P>
    <P>The ACC are playing an important role in providing funds for farmers for the development of these facilities on the farm.  They could assist more, perhaps, in relation to the provision of finance for farmers building houses and for making improvements in their homes.  If further funds were made available for this, it would relieve the loan situation of the commercial banks and the councils, and would assist generally in the provision of houses in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The welcome increase from £350 million to £600 million, as stated in this Bill, is a clear indication of the healthy state of agriculture here at the moment. Contrary to the pessimistic views expressed by certain people, I feel that agriculture has the greatest potential for development.  The Minister for Agriculture and the Government are encouraging it in every way possible and the fact that this Bill has been brought speedily to the House to increase the borrowing facilities of the ACC is an indication of the commitment of the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture in relation to the development of our agriculture.  1980 will see even greater success in the agriculture field.  Finance will be required for the building of houses for holding cattle over the winter and I know the ACC will not be found lacking when the farmers ask for further assistance in retaining cattle.</P>
    <P>In regard to the annual report of the ACC, dated 31 December 1978, it is very interesting to note that the operating profit for the year was £4.056 million and the consolidated profit for <Col N="2037" /> the group, after taxation, was £3.290 million.  That is a tremendous contribution and a great success story for the company, which is State-sponsored and principally engaged in the provision of finance for agriculture.  The advances during the year amounted to £143.3 million compared with £114.4 million for the previous year, which is quite an increase. The loans and hire purchase contracts outstanding at the balance sheet date amounted to £290.9 million.  The net inflow of deposits during the year amounted to £74.9 million, as compared with £56.4 million in the previous year, and at the balance sheet date deposits stood at £254.4 million.  The total assets increased by £75.3 to £313.8 million.  It indicates the viability of the farming community at present that these funds are being made available by the community. In that connection, I would say that the funds for the Agricultural Credit Corporation are not just being made available by farmers but are made available to the ACC by the ordinary average depositor and this should be recognised.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland, shopkeepers, workers and ordinary people, have deposited their savings with the ACC and have made a contribution towards the development of this country. Without their support the money would not be available for the farming community. The fact that the ACC is a State body, guaranteed by the State, is a particularly attractive feature, which would have to be maintained under any arrangement.</P>
    <P>I come from the rural constituency of Roscommon/Leitrim.  We are fortunate to have in both these counties ACC offices. As Deputy Walsh said, Roscommon town has an office staffed with excellent, talented people who do not only make the finance available but give excellent advice to the people coming to them and they should be commended for their activities in bringing about the development of agriculture in these two counties.  I hope their contribution will continue and expand in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one of extreme <Col N="2038" /> urgency and our party will do everything possible to facilitate its speedy passage through the House.  The proposal which it is designed to support&mdash;that the ACC will borrow a substantial amount of money in other EMS currencies abroad and lend it to Irish farmers because the money is not available in our own currency&mdash;is very urgent, a matter of days.  Because of the credit squeeze, money from domestic sources is not available through normal channels to the farming community.  If this Bill were delayed for a week, or two weeks, damage would be done because money was not available.  Indeed, I am sorry that the Government did not bring this Bill in even sooner than they have done.  In the last week farmers have been in difficulty in stocking their farms and have been unable to buy cattle at marts simply because they have not the money. Because of this, the farmers wishing to sell cattle had to sell at a very serious loss, which very few could afford to bear.</P>
      <P>Small farmers in the west without silage, or sufficient fodder to feed their cattle over the winter, have to sell; and because the people who should be buying their cattle from them have not sufficient money, they have to sell at a very great loss.  The effects of this are twofold. Firstly, they and their families will be a great deal worse off than they would otherwise be; and, secondly, they would be far less inclined to engage in building up cattle numbers in the future.  Indeed, our land at present is carrying as few cattle as it could possibly carry.  We are seriously understocked.  Our land could carry, with ease, twice as many cattle; in fact, we are carrying fewer cattle than was the case when we entered the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an alarming but true fact which people do not seem to realise.  The effect of the credit squeeze and, in particular, the serious slump in cattle prices will be to make farmers even more reluctant to stock up in the future.  The present trend in downward numbers will be maintained and even accelerated because of the crisis of confidence that is <Col N="2039" /> taking place this year in cattle production as a result of the credit squeeze and other factors.  Unless urgent measures are taken to restore confidence and give farmers in the cattle industry reasonable grounds for confidence in the future, that damage will be with us for many years long after the credit squeeze has been forgotten.  Farmers have long memories. If they have a bad year in 1979 that will inhibit them from investing and going into debt in order to expand.  That fear will be with them even in 1989.  That is the background against which we are operating.</P>
    <P>The initiative of the ACC in going abroad to get this money and in forcing the Government to introduce this legislation to facilitate them in extending their borrowing capacity is the only measure of a confidence-giving nature being taken by any Government agency in the face of one of the most acute crises of confidence in agriculture.  I could almost say that the ACC are doing the Government's job for them so far as agriculture is concerned.  The ACC are showing a sense of initiative and urgency which the man chiefly responsible, the Minister for Agriculture, is most assuredly not showing.</P>
    <P>I have said already that we are carrying far fewer cattle than we should be carrying and this has the effect that many of our meat factories are working at half-capacity.  They have the capacity to slaughter almost twice as many cattle as they are slaughtering now.  Because our land is understocked, because farmers have not the confidence to invest, the number of cattle being slaughtered is much less than it should be.  It is up to the Government and to the State agencies to give farmers grounds for confidence. That is not being done.</P>
    <P>There is another area where the credit squeeze has caused particular problems. I refer to the most efficient farmers in the country who in recent years expanded their farming businesses to such an extent that they were carrying the absolute maximum number of cattle&mdash;mostly cows, because I am thinking of dairy farmers&mdash;that <Col N="2040" /> their land would bear.  If these people were to go on expanding they had to buy extra land in the past year or two in order to maintain the pace of development they were setting in the national interest.  Many of them have come in for snide criticism&mdash;I heard it in this House today&mdash;because they have bought up the extra land.  They have been treated as some kind of criminals, some kind of anti-national people.  Most of them are among our best farmers. They have made the best possible use of their existing land and they would have continued to make even better use of additional land were it not for the crisis of confidence mentioned and the acute pressure many of them are put under because they are so heavily in debt.  They borrowed last year to buy land at the going price but they now find that the value of the land is falling as is the value of what they are selling, and the pressure being put on them to repay the money is increasing.</P>
    <P>All of those three phenomena combining at the one time are putting acute pressure on our most progressive farmers, the people who are making maximum use of their land on a per acre basis.  I can see serious problems, almost amounting to bankruptcy in some cases, among some of the more progressive farmers because of the credit squeeze. These are the men who are supplying our processing factories, who are keeping people engaged in the processing industries in employment.  If they go out of production the processing industries which are working at undercapacity&mdash;this applies not only to meat but also to milk plants&mdash;will be in danger and employment in them will be affected.  These progressive farmers are in acute difficulty because of the credit squeeze.</P>
    <P>A third category of problem has arisen because of the credit squeeze, namely, a problem among the processing co-operatives.  They are in debt but they are not being immediately affected.  Their farmer clients have been unable to meet their repayments to the co-ops for seasonal facilities with the result that the <Col N="2041" /> effect of the credit squeeze on farmers is being transferred to the co-operatives.  In fact, the effects of the credit squeeze are seeping right through agriculture from the farmers to the co-operatives and I foresee them being in acute financial difficulties. This will particularly affect the more intensive co-operatives who have been involved in seasonal credit to their farmer clients this year.</P>
    <P>I hope that with this money the ACC will be cognisant of the three areas of difficulty I outlined that have arisen because of the credit squeeze.  The three areas are: first, the problem with the cattle industry, particularly the low prices at which cattle are sold; secondly, there is the problem with regard to the intensive farmer who bought land in the recent past and who has acute solvency difficulties and, thirdly, there is a problem with regard to the co-operatives.  The three areas should be given serious attention.</P>
    <P>A question must be addressed to those who are responsible for the credit squeeze on agriculture.  Do they realise that Irish agriculture has one of the best debt equity rations in Europe, that Irish farmers have more security for thier loans and have more capacity to repay their loans in real terms than almost any of the farmers in Europe?  We have a debt equity ratio of 93 per cent; in other words, for every £1 loaned, without taking the land into account there are goods on the land ready to match it to the extent of 93p which could be disposed of there and then to repay the loan.  That is a very sound position to be in.  In Denmark there is only 50p for every £1 loaned to Danish farmers.  Taking the industry as a whole, Irish farmers are in a very good position to make repayments. Yet that is the sector being told now: you cannot borrow any more from the banks because the banks have loaned too much this year.</P>
    <P>I question the economic wisdom of putting on the brakes at this time of year in agriculture in Ireland.  I do not believe it will serve the objects which the Central Bank are seeking to achieve.  The Central Bank's chief reason for imposing the credit squeeze was that our balance of <Col N="2042" /> payments was in difficulty, there was a danger that our currency&mdash;now in the EMS, maintaining quite a high rate of parity, quite a high value within the EMS&mdash;would be forced to devalue if our balance of payments situation continued in the bad shape in which it was and still is to a great extent.  The Central Bank said: we will have to put the brakes on; we will have to restrict credit so that we can, through that, restrict imports, thereby bringing the balance of payments back into balance.</P>
    <P>But the effect of a credit restriction in agriculture will be precisely the opposite. As Deputy Walsh correctly pointed out, agriculture is our largest export industry. Ten per cent only of every £1 worth of agricultural exports is represented by imports of raw materials whereas 80 per cent of every £1 worth of industrial exports is represented by raw materials.  If one cuts credit to agriculture one is directly cutting our largest export earner. Therefore in an effort, through this credit squeeze, to restrict imports&mdash;thereby restraining the balance of payments&mdash;the effect the Central Bank will achieve will be a restriction in exports in agriculture, which will require an even further tightening of the screw to reduce credit to other sectors which are importing, when we will be on the classic downward spiral of economic decline and depression which characterised the economies of Europe in the late nineteentwenties and early nineteen-thirties.</P>
    <P>I believe there are grave reasons for doubting the wisdom of the credit squeeze as it affects agriculture at present particularly in view of the basic solvency of Irish agriculture, the fact that we have a 93 per cent debt-equity ratio, the fact that agriculture is an exporting industry and that any depression of agricultural output will immediately hit exports and, therefore, the balance of payments in precisely the opposite way the credit squeeze was designed to achieve.</P>
    <P>Why has the credit squeeze occurred? I have indicated already the basic reason&mdash;the desire to maintain the value of our currency in a difficult balance of <Col N="2043" /> payments situation in the EMS.  But the unfortunate aspect of it is that one sector only of our economy is being asked to bear the burden of keeping our currency in line.  It is the productive sector only which is borrowing from the credit institutions. There is an 18 per cent limit being imposed on borrowing from the associated banks but there is no 18 per cent limit being imposed on Government borrowing.  I should like to know if our Government will keep their borrowing with the 18 per cent limit.  I very much doubt it.  In fact one of the reasons that this credit squeeze is necessary is that Government borrowing&mdash;hence spending by the Government, hence imports by the people who are receiving the results of that spending&mdash;has gone completely out of control in the recent past. That is what has brought us into our present balance of payments problems.  Instead of the Government cutting back on their borrowing, the people being asked to cut back are those whom I have mentioned in export industries, such as agriculture.</P>
    <P>I should like to revert to the basic rationale behind this Bill, which is one of confidence in agriculture.  What the ACC are saying to us today, through the Minister, is that whatever else there may be grounds for not investing in, there are good grounds for investing in agriculture.  I agree heartily with that proposition.  There have been points made already in this debate which would appear to query to a degree the validity of that proposition.  These have arisen chiefly from the current very weighty attacks being made on the CAP, which is the ground upon which confidence in agriculture can be based.  Indeed in many circles there seems to be a sort of fatalistic approach to the prospects for the forthcoming price negotiations and for the CAP.  There seems to be tacit acceptance that: well, there is not much we can really do about it; the budget of the Community is in serious difficulty; far too much money, it is alleged, is being spent on agriculture; I suppose we will have to accept serious cutbacks.  I wonder <Col N="2044" /> if that attitude of fatalism and quiescence, in the face of the attacks being launched on the CAP, is justified on any ground.</P>
    <P>It is worth analysing the reasons the CAP is in difficulty, to see where they lie.  The CAP is under attack chiefly because of the very substantial amount being spent on supporting the milk market.  The are five basic facts I should like to put on record in relation to the milk market which might indicate that the problem is one that can be solved, that it is certainly not one created by Ireland, and that it is up to the people who created the problem in the milk market to solve it.  First of all, I should like to point out that imports of milk products from outside the EEC, from New Zealand, are equivalent to Ireland's entire production.  Secondly, there is only a surplus of milk in the Community equivalent to 60 days' comsumption, and we must have milk and food if we are to survive.  Yet the very Community which throws up its hands in horror at a surplus of 60 days in milk is the Community that insists that we should have 100 days surplus of oil products in case we run into difficulty.  But we need food just as we need oil.  If stocks of oil are justified, then certain stocks of food are justified also.  The Community must have self-sufficiency in food if it is to be safe in a very unstable international situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying merely to establish the basic justification for investing in agriculture and for not being too pessimistic.  I should like to point out further&mdash;and this is the last point I want <Col N="2045" /> to make on this&mdash;that the milk surplus is due primarily to production in Germany and Holland based on soya imported at artifically low rates of duty from the USA.  If that soya was bearing the same duty the wheat imported from the USA bears that production which is flooding the milk markets of Europe would not be possible.  If one wants to solve the milk surplus situation one can do so by stopping the imports of soya, or at least by imposing the same level of tariff on imports of soya as are being imposed on imports of wheat from the USA.  Thus, this uneconomic, energy-intensive production of surpluses of milk in Germany and Holland&mdash;which is not what we are doing&mdash;could be stopped and the surpluses got rid of overnight.</P>
      <P>I believe there are very good grounds for investing substantially in Irish agriculture through the ACC.  I believe there are grounds for confidence in the industry and, as Opposition spokesman on Agriculture, I should like to put my shoulder to the wheel and make it clear that, whatever anyone else says, I have confidence in the future of agriculture.  As a country producing most of our products from grass we have a competitive advantage over those other countries who rely on imported energy-intensive concentrates to produce their milk and beef in competition with us.  In the long run in any competitive situation we will win out and they will lose because we are more efficient, cheaper and we have the climatic advantages they do not have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stated already that Irish farmers are more credit-worthy than others because they are under borrowed, but our yields are far lower than those of farmers on the Continent.  We produce 603 gallons of milk per cow while the average production in the EEC is 870 gallons per cow.  On that basis we have great grounds for catching up on them. That can be done without using concentrates. It can be done by better stocking rates, the making of better quality silage, better farm planning and more compact calving.  We have also a big number of talented young men and women in <Col N="2046" /> agriculture only waiting to get money to get going in farming.  Our agricultural colleges at present are packed out.  A few years ago there was difficulty in getting people to fill places in those colleges, but it is now extremely difficult to get into such a college.  The Government, I believe, will have to build another agricultural college in the near future to cope with the number of young men and women who are anxious to be educated in agriculture to make the best possible use of their land.</P>
    <P>I have given some of the reasons why I believe confidence is well founded in Irish agriculture.  However, there are areas where I believe the ACC should become more involved than they have been in the past.  They should help to make better use of the farms which are spread throughout the country&mdash;many are to be found in the west but, also, elsewhere&mdash;and are owned and managed by farmers who are very advanced in years or, if they are not so advanced in years, have no identifiable successor: they are bachelors who do not have a nephew to take over the farm at any foreseeable time.  Such farmers do not have any incentive to keep their place tidy because they do not care who it goes to.  In most cases such holdings are left to cousins in England or elsewhere. Unfortunately, such people are not being reached by the advisory services or any of the services in the community.  Many of them are living in circumstances of deplorable poverty and yet they are owners of assets worth thousands of pounds.  They have no incentive, ability or motivation to work their holdings properly.  That is one of the main reasons why we are so far behind our potential as far as agriculture is concerned. The ACC should give more thought to devising means, in conjunction with the Government, to get such land into proper production.</P>
    <P>I should like to make two suggestions which the ACC should look at.  They should investigate the possibility of financing on favourable terms the long term leasing of such land and the question of the formation of partnerships between <Col N="2047" /> such people and another local farmer who would be interested in working the land.  I accept that old people would not be prepared to sell such land but I am sure some of them would be prepared to enter into a contract whereby they and the farmer who would be doing most of the work would share the profits.  At the end of the partnership the land would remain in the ownership of the older party.  That is an attraction of a long-term lease.  It does not threaten the basic ownership of the land by the older farmer.  Nobody is going to hand up land easily, even if such a person is living in deplorable poverty.  Land gives such people a place in the community.</P>
    <P>Any scheme, such as the retirement scheme for farmers, which is based on the idea that people should be encouraged to sell their holdings and give up farming, even if such a person's income is to be trebled in the process, is doomed to failure.  We must let farmers keep their basic ownership of land and keep their position in the community but permit them to enter into a partnership, either on a leasing system or through a co-operative basis, whereby the land would be better used than at present.  The ACC should devise model partnership deeds which could be made available to and entered into by young farmers who need more land and can use it properly and older farmers who have land but are not able to use it properly.  The ACC should make the money available to finance such arrangements and also do a lot of the ground work in devising the legal terms under which such arrangements can be made.  I believe that somewhere in that area we will achieve real progress in Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>If we concentrate solely on improvements in prices we are not going to get results.  We have had massive improvements in prices in recent years.  We must be honest about this.  Up to this year we had a fairly favourable situation as far as cattle prices were concerned.  This year we experienced a bad slump which is causing a serious lack of confidence but over the years cattle prices rose and <Col N="2048" /> yet the number of cattle on our land did not increase.  I believe that the underlying reason is a human one rather than the physical capacity of the land or the financial availability of the resources. Something along the lines I have suggested could do a great deal to ensure that the land which is not being used properly at present is put to good use in the future.  The Government must give the direction to the ACC.  They must give an indication that, if the farmer invests and expands, the markets will be there and that they will take measures to support the farmers.  We were told that economic planning would be introduced, presumably including agricultural planning, when Fianna Fáil were elected to office. But, in fact, no such plan has appeared for agriculture any more than plans for any other sectors of the economy.  That is one of the reasons why confidence is lacking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden made a point with which I do not agree: that the ACC should no longer be required to come back to this House to obtain authority for any increase in their borrowing.  I strongly agree that increases in the borrowing limits of the ACC should be made and they should be sufficiently generous to meet foreseeable demand for a number of years ahead.  It is evidence of bad planning that in a Bill passed only two years ago the limits set were completely inadequate.  Notwithstanding the fact that the total lendings by the ACC this year have not increased at all on those they made last year, they are bursting their limit this year when they want extra money.  That indicates bad planning on the part of the people advising the Minister or by the Minister in setting the limit last year.  I agree that there must be a statutory limit because all of these borrowings are being guaranteed by the State.  If for one reason or another the ACC or any other Government agency default on the loans they enter into the Government and the taxpayer will have to pay.  The Government will ultimately raise the tax necessary, so the Government must have some overview of the total amount of borrowing being made against a guarantee which <Col N="2049" /> the Government have given.  This control is necessary.  The only alteration I would make in the practice so far would be to set limits on a reasonably generous scale.</P>
    <P>In the 1977 Agricultural Credit Bill, which did not become law until 1978, a number of new powers were given to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  We are entitled to know during the course of this debate what has been done in the exercise of these new powers.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation were not solely to be a credit giving institution. They were given powers to engage in the provision of hire purchase and leasing facilities.  They were given powers to undertake, promote, engage or participate in, manage or supervise any scheme or project which in the opinion of the corporation will or is likely to increase either directly or indirectly the productivity of or otherwise be of benefit to agriculture and fisheries.  They were given the power to go into business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the point, and I hope the Minister will be able to reply to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point I am worried about, which was also mentioned by other Deputies, is the control on the salary of the Chief Officer of the ACC.  In law, the salary of the Chief Officer must be approved by the Minister for the Public Service but any other person in the ACC could be paid any salary they liked.  We have a situation where the second in command in the ACC could be paid more than the Chief Officer and that situation occurred <Col N="2050" /> on one occasion.  That is not a desirable situation because it gives no incentive to people in the organisation to seek the top job, to work to the ultimate of their abilities so that they will get the top job. Could anything be more ludicrous than the situation where promotion means a cut in salary?</P>
    <P>The ACC have a very large degree of freedom in their operations and must compete, on the basis of the salary they are able to pay, with other banks for their personnel.  If they are not able to offer their chief executive a salary equivalent to those available to people in other banking institutions where the same competency is required, the likelihood is that the ACC will not get the best men and that the other competing institutions, such as the associated banks who are looking for people with similar capabilities, will be able to draw the best personnel from the ACC because they are not subject to the control of the Minister for the Public Service and are free to pay a higher salary.  One could question the whole philosophy of whether people should seek these high levels of salary or whether the differentials in income are justified, but that is another matter.  If a good man working with the ACC is offered £5,000 more to work in the Bank of Ireland it will be very hard to keep him in the ACC and we will ultimately be the losers.</P>
    <P>We should have a good look at this whole system and we should examine the various types of State agencies.  Where a State agency is entirely self financing they should be free to pay whatever salary they deem necessary to get the best personnel.  On the other hand, if a State agency is heavily subsidised there should be a control on the salary of the chief executive.  Such an agency is in effect an arm of the Government in all but legal terms and the chief executive is no different from any other civil servant because he is simply administering money paid by the State.  We need to define clearly these two categories of State-sponsored body&mdash;the autonomously financed one, where there should be no control on the salary of the <Col N="2051" /> chief executive, and the subsidised one, where there should be a control.  If an organisation cannot operate without State subsidies it should be treated in the same way as the civil service.</P>
    <P>This is an urgent Bill.  The money it is making available is sorely needed in agriculture because of the depredations being wrought by the credit squeeze, which has led to a dramatic decline in cattle prices which in turn will lead to a reluctance to invest in cattle in the future.  As a result, many of our most progressive farmers in the milk sector are being forced to the brink of bankruptcy because, having bought land in the recent past at high prices, they are now unable to meet their repayments. Some of our best people will be driven out of production.  Also, many of our co-operatives are facing difficulties.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides some money, perhaps not enough, in the form of credit for agriculture and it deserves the full support of the House.  The ACC are to be congratulated on the initiative they have taken in going abroad to get this money and putting it where it will yield a good return, in Irish agriculture.  They are showing the confidence which the Government are not showing.  This year the amount of money made available to the Department of Agriculture by the Government is being cut, whereas the amount of money being made available to industry is being increased by 40 per cent.  That is bad economics.  It is not where the money should be going, and cutting agricultural investment as the Department of Agriculture are doing this year is a wrong policy.  At least the ACC are showing that they are not following the same line, by going abroad and getting money which they will be well able to repay because of the confidence that this investment will generate in agriculture.  It is the right policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives greater scope to the ACC to increase the ceiling of borrowing and provides for the corporation to spend approximately £600 million and to raise the amount from the <Col N="2052" /> existing £350 million.  This is coming at a time when there are rumblings in our media and from many sources, particularly EEC sources, that in the future we cannot rely on the same stability in the CAP as heretofore.  This is an attempt to condition the minds and the plans of our farming community to accept lower prices generally at the moment and to be satisfied with lower prices in a period of very high inflation when costs of inputs and fertilisers into the farms are increasing rapidly and when we have to pay much higher prices for machinery.  With that background, this Bill might go some way&mdash;I hope the full way&mdash;to restoring full confidence to the people engaged in agriculture that there is for the people who live on the land and those intending in the future to live on that land a worthwhile living for themselves and their families.</P>
      <P>Since the ACC were brought into existence in 1927 when very limited funds were made available to them, they have always provided a source from which farmers could borrow, but it was only in recent years that this method of borrowing was utilised fully by farmers.  At present too few of our smaller farmers rely on this area within which they can borrow.  One Deputy who spoke here said that offices of the EEC could with advantage be moved out to remote, peripheral areas rather than having farmers moving into offices in central areas. If this practice were introduced there would be a better line of communication between the offices and the farmers.  I refer particularly to the type of farmer who has not the courage that people better off than he have.  The small man has a conservative outlook.  He dreads massive borrowing because he fears that with recurring recessions and instability of prices his means of repayment can never be assured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment we have a type of recession and a credit squeeze which are affecting the small farmers in a very big way.  At present a farmer of limited means who has a high stocking rate is compelled at the end of the year, after the harvest and coming on to the winter, <Col N="2053" /> to reduce his stock.  All over this country, particularly in areas where store cattle are reared, farmers have now to sell off stock at a reduced price, a price lower than that which they paid maybe in early spring.  In common sense can we expect such people to go on producing stock continually in the years ahead when there is no stability within the market?</P>
    <P>This situation has recurred maybe every five or six years, maybe more often. It is peculiar that with all our advisory services, our agricultural institutes and our Department of Agriculture, not even one person can give an alert, an early warning of a breakdown in our price structure and that our farmers must put on the market a glut of stock when prices are at their lowest.  I will refer to our ACC executives in particular later, but I wonder whether a combination of the people I have mentioned would consider in the future that it is necessary to give some early advice to the people about trends in market prices to be expected at different periods of the year.  This is vital.  A person is entitled to know what price he can get for the goods he has to sell.</P>
    <P>Another depressing fact in our economic life is that we are being conditioned in agriculture to assume that in the years ahead the prices we will get for milk at our creameries through our different co-operatives cannot be maintained at present levels.  I doubt whether the Government are helping when they put unnecessary levies on milk sold by our farmers.  I doubt if the payment of income tax which has been introduced on an accounts system and which will capture a very high yield from our varied farmers is going to be helpful to ensure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry for broadening the scope of this, but it has relevance to the need for a greater expansion of our credit to the more needy sections within our community who have limited acreage and limited finance to play about with.  I refer to the people who are trying to rear their families on such farms.  We welcome credit being made available from different sources.  I would like to see another lending agency established which would provide those engaged in our major industry with money at a lower rate of interest.  They could borrow, on the recommendations of our advisory services or the ACC, money which is vitally necessary for expansion. This is very important for people with small acreage whose land is poor.  I do not see anything wrong with existing farming organisations encouraging farmers around the country to invest heavily in the ACC and we hope in the future in a banking system composed of the farming organisations and others. This would provide an alternative to the old-established banking system, which was never very generous with the small farmers on the western seaboard, people who probably never wanted to borrow too much.</P>
      <P>It is important for small farmers in the years ahead, if they want to continue in operation, to provide good outhouses and to improve their land.  It is important for them to have good sheds and silage pits.  Several Deputies have mentioned that what could be provided for £3,000 or £4,000 about 15 years ago will now cost £30,000.  This means that farmers have to have an income adequate enough to invest in such necessary accommodation. If there is not a proper understanding by those who lend money and research done into price trends, we cannot envisage an outlay on adequate premises being made by small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know how, in periods of recession, people who borrow at 18¾ per cent can maintain their repayments? This is a worry to many borrowers. Perhaps those people could be given a little boost by reduced rates during a period of recession.  The number of <Col N="2055" /> borrowers using the credit available from the ACC has gone up to 23,000, I believe it is the man with the higher acreage who is using that money.  I hope that the officers of the ACC will encourage the people with limited means to avail of the credit now available.</P>
    <P>In my county 70 per cent of the people are on a valuation of £20.  I would like to see a large proportion of the money available going to those people who have never had good quality land and have never enjoyed the concessions available to people in better off areas. The executive secretary of the ACC comes from my county.  I would like to compliment him and all the other officers in the corporation for the understanding way they approach problems and do their best to meet the needs of farmers. This man was treated with a very scanty reward for the initiative he showed, although he does not consider that aspect of the matter.  Another man from my county also played a very important role in developing the ACC.  It makes for a greater degree of understanding now that men who have degrees in agriculture are going out to see farmers.  If in the years ahead agriculture is to be recognised as our major industry and if the buoyancy of that industry is to be maintained, it is important to have officers in the ACC who have established a liaison between the corporation and farmers.</P>
    <P>It is very important that farmers should continue to borrow money from areas where it is available and with it improve their farm building.  The rate of investment in the ACC could be much higher although it has shown an increase recently.  The buoyancy of the corporation depends on having deposits made. This must be an ongoing process, because the need will become greater as the years go by.  It will be recognised by all that the necessary expansion can only be made if capital is available.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is with a sense of frustration that I came in here to move this Bill because it was on 6 May 1975 that I moved a Private Members' Motion for the appointment of an ombudsman.  The motion was accepted by the House.  Subsequently, an all-party committee was set up to deal with the matter. The committee met nine times.  I can truly say that the committee were unanimous about the appointment of an ombudsman. Every aspect of the matter was debated until agreement was reached.  Deputy R. Ryan, who was then the Minister for the Public Service, was chairman of the committee.  The Fine Gael members of the committee were Senator John Boland, Deputy Brendan Total and myself.  The Labour Party members of the committee were Senator Evelyn Owens and Deputy Seamus Pattison. The Fianna Fáil members of the committee were Deputy George Colley, Deputy Hugh Gibbons, Deputy Robert Molloy, Deputy Desmond O'Malley and Deputy Paddy Power.  The Independent member of the committee was Senator Augustine Martin.  The officials of the Department gave us excellent service. The document was not hastily put together but was processed slowly and thoroughly.</P>
      <P>Before the Coalition Government left office a Bill was drafted, but events overcame it.  It never occurred to me that there would be any delay in presenting the Bill because of the manner in which the matter was handled.  However, the Government had been in office for two-and-a-half years and there is still no sign of a Bill.  The reason for the delay cannot be the number of Bills being introduced in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2057" /> Do Fianna Fáil fear the appointment of an ombudsman?  Under the terms of reference he had the right to examine files and make recommendations.  He could not tell the Departments what to do but he had the right to investigate complaints.  We sought the appointment of an ombudsman because we felt that Departments could withhold information. We believe that grievances must be thoroughly investigated and reported. This Bill has been gathering dust on the shelves of the Government.  This is typical of the Government's attitude towards legislation.  They are not too sure where they are going or what they want to do.  They do not like the idea of someone breathing down their necks.</P>
    <P>There can be no argument against the appointment of an ombudsman.  A survey was taken which showed that 17 per cent of the people do not expect fair play, which must lead to frustration with the establishment.  As legislators, we have a duty to ensure that people are treated fairly.</P>
    <P>The report of the committee is a long one and a good one and should be read by everybody, especially those involved in public life.  The main avenues of redress for the individual citizens aggrieved by actions or decisions of public officials are through the courts or through elected representatives.  We know that the courts are only available to the well-heeled members of our society.  Elected representatives can ask questions but cannot get complete answers.  Therefore on many occasions we feel aggrieved.</P>
    <P>A problem throughout the country today is the delay in the payment of social welfare benefits.  We can ask questions here until Tibb's Eve but we do not seem to get the right answers.  We cannot get at the nitty-gritty of what is happening in the Department of Social Welfare and why these delays are occurring.  An ombudsman could have power to investigate this small area which is causing tremendous hardship.  People are being left for weeks and weeks without money. They are supposed to live on fresh air or to go cap in hand looking for some supplementary welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2058" /> No wonder people become cynical about politics.  This makes people cynical.  It is up to us to eradicate that cynicism where we can.  As public representatives we can ask questions and go to Departments.  Not everybody wants to go to an elected representative. Why cannot people pursue these matters in their own way?  We recommended that a member of the public should be able to process his own complaints directly through an ombudsman.  If somebody did not want to go to an elected representative he should have that alternative.</P>
    <P>I was anxious that this Bill should cover all the Government services and the local authorities, but it was agreed to keep it within the Government Departments with the option of extending it to local authorities and other bodies.  We should be able to set up the machinery to deal with general complaints.  I hope it will be possible to have an ombudsman to deal with general consumer affairs with power to investigate all avenues of discontent.</P>
    <P>Why have the Government shied away from this matter?  They have so many internal problems that possibly they need an ombudsman to investigate them and sort them out.  After that, they might see the light, and the reason why this Bill is necessary and desirable.  There was broad agreement on the necessity for this proposed Bill but obviously there was no great sincerity or goodwill on the part of Fianna Fáil.  When they were in Opposition they went along with it, but as soon as they took over the reins of Government they said: &ldquo;We are the allpowerful party.  The people gave us a mandate.  We know what is good for the people.  We will tell them what to do&rdquo;.  A government who adopt that attitude do so at their peril.  Events in the past two-and-a-half years have proved that.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to accept this Bill.  There is nothing revolutionary about it.  It will not overturn our society. It will not encroach on the powers of this House.  On the contrary, it will give the House a better standing and a better image. Possibly people will have more <Col N="2059" /> respect for it because they will know they can get fair play.  I am not saying officials set out to make bad decisions, or that governments set out to do wrong but, where there are grievances, we should have the machinery to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Society is becoming more and more complex.  There are more demands on the State.  It is becoming more of a welfare State and, as a result, it is necessary to appoint an ombudsman as soon as possible.  I would not envisage the ombudsman dealing with the various day-to-day problems which are dealt with by public representatives, but there are cases in which it is necessary to have such a person.  I do not anticipate a deluge of problems on the desk of any ombudsman, but there are serious problems which justify the creation of this position.</P>
    <P>Almost all democratic countries have some type of ombudsman because they realise the need for such an appointment. Because of the complexity of government today, the appointment of an ombudsman is necessary.  People's rights can be eroded and usurped, not necessarily deliberately, but because of the pressures on the Government's time and on officials.  With the overall complexity of Government welfare services, and of the various Government agencies who disburse funds, people may feel they are not getting what they should be getting.  Because of the way the system works, they feel they have no redress.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take this Bill seriously just as he was serious in regard to the discussions in which he was involved and which formed the basis for this measure.  The setting up of an all-party committee in respect of this legislation was an example of the openness of the last Government.  They were not prepared merely to go into conclave and to decide on the type of legislation to be produced.  Instead, they invited members of the then Opposition to participate in the discussions in the knowledge that the more people who are involved in such discussions and the more views that are <Col N="2060" /> put forward, the better will be the legislation that results.  On that committee some people indicated that they themselves could do the work that would be required of an ombudsman while others had no doubt about such an appointment; but at least we sat around the table and during our nine meetings considered all the various points of view.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why the Government have not moved in this regard long before now.  Their failure to introduce the appropriate legislation represents a denial of democracy.  No one can doubt our sincerity so far as this legislation is concerned.  In addition to the setting up of an all-party committee, we invited the expression of all shades of opinion on the issue.  Indeed, that may have been the first time that democracy operated really well here.  There was not any question of the legislation being kept on one side of the House.  Having covered all the ground painstakingly and being aware of our responsibility in this regard, we proceeded to prepare a Bill.  Yet, two-and-a-half years later the Government have not made any move in regard to appointing an ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The Government should be ashamed of themselves for the way in which they have dealt with this matter.  Their attitude highlights their total lack of commitment in the area of providing help for people who require it.  The Government are indifferent to the problems that people may have to face, adopting the attitude that the system will suffice and will provide what is necessary.  But such a policy will no longer be tolerated.  People nowadays think for themselves.  They want to know the answers and they need to be told what is happening.  They need an ombudsman to give them the answers that they cannot get otherwise.  That in itself may be part of the reason for the Government shying away from the problem.  However, I hope that I have given some of the answers.  Obviously, we are anxious to hear what the Government side have to say.  Hopefully, they will be in a position to tell us that they are accepting this Bill, a Bill which cannot be regarded necessarily as a Coalition <Col N="2061" /> Bill having regard to the taking into account by us of all the various points put forward by the then Opposition in relation to the framing of the Bill, a procedure that was followed throughout the drafting of the legislation.  If the then Opposition held any serious reservations about the Bill, they failed to voice them at the time or else they were merely paying lip-service regarding the necessity to appoint an ombudsman but hopefully that was not the case.</P>
    <P>The Bill would not appear to contain anything that might be considered to be in conflict with what was contained in the report.  The provisions relate to the appointment and tenure of office of an ombudsman, to the question of staff and so on.  In the report which was laid before us there was reference to the way in which complaints would be dealt with and to the question of evidence and investigation. When one examines that report and compares it with what is in the Bill, one fails to find anything in either that would conflict with what is in the other.  What, then, is the reason for the delay?  There are many reasons for appointing an ombudsman but to go into those now would only involve a rehashing of all that has been said before on Private Members' Motions and during the meetings of the all-party informal committee.</P>
    <P>When on this committee I was of the impression that everybody on it was serious and wanted the implementation of the recommendations of the report and the appointment of an ombudsman. I believed this.  As time drifted on I felt that something would happen, that the committee could not close their minds to something they themselves were involved in.  Three of the present Ministers were on that committee, the Minister for the Public Service and two other Ministers. So there is no question that they have not the muscle or the influence to initiate legislation.  That is why I am worried.  If they were now backbench Deputies and had not the same clout then we could say that there was some reason.  But here we have senior members of the Government who were involved in that committee showing total unconcern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2062" /> No matter what way this matter is looked at it is in no way contentious; nobody is misled; it is not a matter of a report being made and watered down and twisted to suit the needs of the government of the day.  There is no question of that whatsoever.  That is why I believe the Government are being less than honest in relation to this report and the Bill that was being initiated before the Coalition Government left office.  It is not as if the Government had to initiate a Bill.  It is there for them but they will not accept it.  I do not know whether they are being bloody-minded because this is not their legislation or whether they are inept and just not concerned about whether people have grievances or not.  I do not know the reasons but I do know that it is the work of a government who do not care, who are not concerned about whether people have grievances, genuine or not.</P>
    <P>Here is an area that will not cause any problems, that will not upset the balance of power or interfere with the authority of this House or of the Ministers because, although the ombudsman has the right to go in and examine files and to bring problems to the notice of Ministers, Ministers can in their wisdom or otherwise reject that although I believe it would be a rather foolish Minister who would.  Maybe Ministers do not like the idea of people coming into their Departments and pointing out problem areas.  Perhaps it is arrogance which prevents the Government from bringing in this legislation.  I believe that is the case.  They are ensconced now and why should any individual whom we appoint in this House or who is appointed by the President come into their Departments and tell them where they are not doing an efficient job and that people's lives are being affected as a result of some of their inefficiencies or some of the orders they make?  Why should they allow this?  The people elected them, therefore they have all power.  That is a dangerous philosophy particularly in modern times.  People have rights and this House has an obligation to ensure their rights are protected and if there are areas where people may be suffering <Col N="2063" /> from one thing or another because of bad administration then it behoves this House to appoint a person or persons who will ensure that the rights of individuals are upheld at all times. Otherwise we are only paying lip service to democracy and we all know democracy was got at a hard price.</P>
    <P>When I look at the delays, when I look at the legislation before the House and when I look at the report of the all-party committee, I am at a loss.  I can only say that there is no good reason why this Government will not accept it except that they do not like interference from anybody.  If we cannot accept advice and if we cannot accept people probing and questioning the reasons why we do this, that or the other, then we are drifting away from the mainstream of democracy and I believe that is what the Government would like to do.  It is a sad thing to say but one can only come to that conclusion when one sees the delays and the frustrations this House has had to put up with because this legislation has not been laid before it before now.</P>
    <P>I sincerely ask the Minister to accept the Bill and if he will not accept the Bill to spell out quite clearly why he will not in the light of the all-party committee report.  There may be something I do not see that is wrong in this legislation.  I can see nothing wrong with it.  In conforms with the report and therefore it behoves the Minister who was a member of the committee to accept it.  If he does not, given the circumstances of this legislation, he is not being fair.  Fianna Fáil, as an Opposition party, were brought in on the informal committee and agreed to the report and now at the end of the day they are running away from it.  It would seem therefore, that all-party informal committees may not be a good idea at all and this is something I would regret very much.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I appeal to the Minister for the Public Service to accept this legislation.  It is worthwhile and will not cause any problems, but will in fact help governments and make them more efficient, given that in the terms of <Col N="2064" /> reference the ombudsman will make reports, with worth-while ideas and ideals for governments to act on.</P>

      <P>Just listen for a moment, <Col N="2065" /> please.  What are the facts?  Deputy O'Brien seems to think that it was a great thing on behalf of the previous Government that they had an all-party committee including the Opposition.  All-party committees existed a long time ago, before and since, and in some cases worked very well.  I would agree with Deputy O'Brien that this was a committee which, in my opinion, did work well. Deputy O'Brien's approach to it at the time, and in the committee, was one of quite genuine commitment.  I cannot say the same for his party.  The evidence shows that, when it came to the crunch, his party were more concerned with political opportunism than with getting a worth-while ombudsman system set up here.  I say that for two reasons.  Firstly, the committee having met over a long period and having worked very well, a meeting was called by the chairman, my predecessor, Deputy Ryan.  It was called on 18 May 1977, with virtually no notice to the Opposition members, and the whole object was to rush it through in time for the election to show the great job the Coalition Government were doing. It was known, and communicated to Deputy Ryan at the time, that the Opposition members, for good and genuine reasons, primarily due to the ridiculously short notice, would be unable to attend. This was where the political opportunism came in.  The then Opposition party had worked hard and genuinely and in good faith to produce the best possible results, but when it came to the crunch, the effort was made&mdash;and succeeded at the time&mdash;in rushing the report through, in the absence of the Opposition and the points which the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a clear indication of the situation in this House that Deputy O'Brien spoke for 40 minutes without interruption and when I have spoken for only five minutes I have been interrupted virtually the whole time.  The fact is that we sought certain amendments and I was about to add that they were relatively minor amendments, but that did not matter.  Deputy Ryan was determined to drive the report through, so the meeting was held in the absence of the Opposition, on 18 May.  The report, as it then stood, was adopted and was submitted by Deputy Ryan to the then Government on the following day.  That fact alone gives an indication of what was happening.  The Government authorised the publication of that report on the following day, 19 May, and copies were released by the Minister at a press conference which he held on 23 <Col N="2067" /> May.  The first thing which made me think that Deputy Ryan had informed&mdash;or misinformed, rather&mdash;Deputy O'Brien of the situation was that Deputy O'Brien said on a number of occasions when speaking here this evening that the previous Government had prepared a Bill and we did not do anything about it, sat on it for two-and-a-half years, he said.  If Deputy Ryan did not tell Deputy O'Brien that, where did Deputy O'Brien get this fairytale, because it is a fairytale?  There was no Bill prepared by Deputy Ryan, or on behalf of Deputy Ryan.  I am not criticising him for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The report was there and if the Deputy will listen to me, I will mention something which he will probably remember then.  One of the things that the committee recommended was that when the report was completed it should be publicised, because there would be groups who would have views to offer which should be taken into account before the legislation was drafted. I do not know if Deputy O'Brien remembers that, but if he looks at the record, he will find that is so.  There was no Bill, therefore, prepared.  As far as I was concerned I was starting from scratch with a report which had been rushed through in the way I have described.  I arranged for advertisements to be issued and submissions were sought.  In fact there were 18 submissions received which were examined closely.  Then it transpired that there were a number of quite difficult legal points arising out of the committee's report.  We had sought to keep as precisely as possible to the recommendations in the report; these difficulties came to light and necessitated consultations with the Office of the Attorney General, even before the drafting could commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to indicate to the House some of the difficulties.  They were not, of course, taken into account in this Bill now before us and that is the reason why <Col N="2068" /> I said, at the outset, that the Bill is not good enough.  Unlike the picture painted by Deputy O'Brien of a Government which did not care, the fact is that we cared so much that we wanted to make sure it is absolutely right, and have taken every precaution to try to ensure that as far as it could be done.  The Bill has, in fact, been drafted, approved by the Government and in the process of tidying up, relatively small points have come to light which have to be submitted again to the Government and will, I hope, be dealt with very shortly and the Bill will be published.  It has already been introduced by long and short titles.</P>
    <P>I charged the Fine Gael Party with political opportunism in this matter, firstly because of the circumstances in which they&mdash;and Deputy Ryan, in particular&mdash;tried to rush it through for the elections, in the absence of the Opposition who had co-operated fully in preparing this all party report.  Secondly, I accuse the Fine Gael Party of that because the Fine Gael Whip was told clearly that the Government had this Bill almost ready and would be circulating it quite shortly.  They insisted, as they are entitled to do within the rules of this House, on bringing in this Private Members' Bill.  I suggest there is only one reason for that.  It is because they want to suggest the Government have deliberately held up the Bill.  It is the same pattern that we had prior to the last general election when an effort was made to try to reap the kudos for the work done by Deputies from all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>If I am in possession I hope the Deputy will leave it that way.  I said I would point out some of the difficulties that arose which caused detailed legal consultations and matters which have been omitted or overlooked in the Bill before us.  First, the all-party committee envisaged the ombudsman's remit as being limited in the initial stages of his operation to Government Departments but with local authorities, health boards and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies being brought within his jurisdiction at a later stage.  Indeed, I understood from Deputy O'Brien that he thinks this is in the Bill but it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will recall that the reasoning behind it&mdash;and I think it was very sound&mdash;was that if we were to bring in all of these bodies together the ombudsman and his office would be swamped. It just would not work at the beginning and it would be discredited.  Section 5 (1) of the Bill before the House would bring in all these bodies under the scrutiny of the ombudsman from the first day of operation, the very thing the committee said should not happen.  The all-party committee explained their approach as being one of cautious pragmatism.  They did not elaborate on the report but I do not think Deputy O'Brien would disagree with me if I said that underlying this idea was that as the ombudsman and his staff would be breaking new ground they should confine <Col N="2070" /> themselves to a limited area of governmental activity until they got the procedures and the work methods firmly established.  As I said, there was a danger that if all these things were brought in from the beginning the ombudsman would be swamped and the whole operation would be discredited.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We are providing for adding to it without additional legislation. Secondly, the committee recognised that &ldquo;certain decisions by Ministers where they were required or allowed to make value judgments should be subject to investigation, probing and censure only by the Houses of the Oireachtas themselves and should, therefore, be excluded from the ombudsman's remit&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the House makes no provision for this category of decision. As an example of the effect of this, we would have a situation in which, for example, petitions to the Minister for Justice in regard to mitigation of prison sentences would come within the investigation of the ombudsman, something that was envisaged by the committee as not happening and something that should not happen.  During the years the Oireachtas has provided that certain decisions taken by officials should be subject to appeal or review either by the courts or by certain statutory mechanisms specifically created for that purpose.  Some examples of that would be appeals to the Commissioners of Income Tax and appeals to An Bord Pleanála.  When the committee considered this and also considered whether matters which were already subject to existing appeals facilities should be brought within the ombudsman's report, they regarded the danger of citizens pursuing complaints both through the facilities which existed <Col N="2071" /> already and through the ombudsman as objectionable and suggested that these should be excluded from the ombudsman's remit.  The committee went on to make a distinction between appeals to bodies outside the public administration, that is, appeals to independent tribunals and appeals to career civil servants who would be, perhaps, subject to the administration, for instance, in the case of social welfare appeals officers. They recommended that the ombudsman should not investigate where there is an independent facility available but should investigate where the appeal is to somebody who is part of the general administrative system as, for instance, in the case of social welfare appeals officers.</P>
    <P>This Bill before us has no provision to deal with this problem.  It would leave it open to a complainant&mdash;to quote the report&mdash;&ldquo;having pursued a meritless case through the full range of appeals facilities to have the same matters looked at again by the ombudsman&rdquo;.  The income tax appeals commissioners deal with about 20,000 appeals each year and I am sure it will be clear to the House the scope for duplication under this Bill if it were implemented in this way.  There are a number of other matters of a similar kind that I could point out to the House but I do not think it is necessary.  All I am seeking to do is to point out that there are a number of difficulties involved even following the recommendations of the all-party committee as closely as possible.  That is what we have tried to do.</P>
    <P>This Bill put forward by Deputy Ryan on behalf of Fine Gael does not deal with these difficulties.  That is why I said at the outset that we are opposing the Bill because it is not good enough but I reject categorically the charge that we had a Bill ready when we came into office which was prepared by the previous Government and that all we lacked was the will to implement it.  Deputy O'Brien seems to think that was the case.  As I have tried to point out, that is as far from the truth as it could be.  We had no <Col N="2072" /> such Bill.  We had to advertise for submissions. We got the submissions, we examined them and we discovered even before drafting the Bill that there were a number of very complex problems.  In fact, the Bill that we will bring before the House shortly is one of the most complex Bills the parliamentary draftsman has had to deal with.  It will be before the House very shortly and Members will see that it adheres as closely as possible to the report of the all-party committee and that it is a far more satisfactory Bill than this Bill which has been put before us now for reasons of political opportunism.</P>
    <P>I feel&mdash;I think I said this earlier and, if I did not, I want to say it now anyway&mdash;that Deputy O'Brien's concern in this matter has been genuine; he has shown that in the past and in his work on the committee.  I cannot say the same in regard to Deputy Richie Ryan.  I cannot say the same in the regard to the Fine Gael Party and their approach at the time before the election when they tried to rush through the report in the absence of the Opposition, and now in rushing forward this inadequate Bill when they know that the Government Bill is just about to appear, the one that has all the expertise available applied to it, an expertise which has been fully taxed in preparing this very complex Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that, as far as this Government are concerned, they are committed to the whole principle and idea of the ombudsman.  I made that clear in reply to a Parliamentary Question shortly after we came back into office. We have been pushing this forward as hard as we could and the House will see the results of that very shortly, I would hope within a matter of weeks. For all of those reasons we must oppose the Private Members' Bill now before us and reject categorically the charges that have been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and Deputy Ryan have been engaged, for part of the Minister's speech, in a wrangle which is disedifying to say the <Col N="2073" /> least.  The Minister described the Fine Gael Party's action in moving this Bill as inadequate.  He said it was a Bill that was not good enough and defended his opposition to it by saying that Deputy Ryan, when in office, had been guilty solely of political opportunism by rushing into print with some thing that did not have the full consent of an All-Party Committee.  The Minister in his speech could certainly not be accused of political opportunism but he could certainly be accused of political bankruptcy.</P>
      <P>How otherwise can he justify a situation in which, two-and-a-half years after assuming office, he has to come before the House and tell us that his Government's Bill is not yet ready.  He attempted to justify this by saying that, when they came into office, they invited submissions and discovered that there were various technical problems of a very complex nature associated with the draft Bill.  This attitude is very reminiscent of the advice tendered by, I think, Hilaire Belloc, to a fearful child: always keep a hold of nurse for fear of getting something worse.  The attitude on the Government side of the House in relation to this Bill seems to be: do not bring it in until it is perfect.  It is easy to suspect that following this attitude rigidly would lead to total paralysis on the Government side of the House.  Indeed there are times when it seems that this is not an unfair description of what is going on.  If one was never to do anything until one had got it absolutely right, then the chances are that one would never do anything at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To look at the leisureliness with which the Government have approached this problem one would think that they were going on the basis of an assumption that they had 50 years before them in office instead of the remainder of a term of five.  Of course while one appreciates the Government's intention that any Bill they bring before the House should be a reasonably well worked out document there comes a point at which the Government's obsession with having everything in the Bill absolutely right has a very <Col N="2074" /> strong implication&mdash;that there is nothing that this House can add to this or perhaps any other Bill.  I would remind the Minister that this House is also an All-Party Committee and that, if we did not have this rampant infallibility complex on the part of the Government, we might just occasionally be treated to the sight of the Government introducing a Bill in some hope, some humility and in the expectation that it might actually be improved on its passage through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There seems to be little of that kind of sensibility on the Government side of the House.  It amounts to a reflection on the ability of this House to conduct its own business, on the ability of this House to make a constructive series of suggestions, amendments, proposals, whatever to a Bill under discussion.  It was perfectly open to the Government to accept the Second Stage of this Bill introduced by Deputy Fergus O'Brien and to amend it as the Government saw fir in its passage through the House.  I suspect that even the thought of an Opposition Bill&mdash;even one on which there is such a substantial measure of all-party agreement as this one&mdash;passing through this House, and perhaps the other House, in the lifetime of a Dáil in which Fianna Fáil are in Government is anathema to the Government Party.  They govern.  Of course they govern; we know that but that they alone must govern is the hidden creed of that Party.  In that Party it is not the Dáil that governs; it is the Party that governs.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to two broad areas in support of the Bill.  I want to refer to the whole question of the public service and the way in which an ombudsman might be expected to bring his attention to bear on it.  I want to refer to the role of the public representative because I believe that the function of the ombudsman&mdash;and in broad terms I welcome this Bill although I would have some quibbles with perhaps some of its sections&mdash;takes place at the intersection of the role of the public servant and that of the public representative.  That is why it is important for us to discuss these two roles in a reasonable way.  First of all, in <Col N="2075" /> relation to the public servant, we can state without contradiction that the role and scope of public administration has increased enormously in the last 50 years.  In itself this is not a bad thing.</P>
    <P>People are very ready to assume that the growth of public administration, that the ever-lengthening payroll of the public service&mdash;which is not lengthening as fast as we would like on this side of the House&mdash;in some way implies that ordinary individuals in society are losing out to the great impersonal State machine.  It has to be remembered that this growth in administrative personnel has accompanied a very substantial growth in the involvement of the State and the public services generally in the welfare of a very large number of individuals. To put it quite bluntly, we simply could not have a welfare system, an educational system, a health system, a legal system; we could not have a system of benefits of anything like the degree of flexibility that we have today without a system of administration that is in itself complex, flexible and fairly numerous in terms of the personnel involved.</P>
    <P>It is a pity in a sense that the word &ldquo;bureaucracy&rdquo; has come to have such a pejorative ring about it.  I know many public servants&mdash;and I am sure every Member of this House knows them as well&mdash;whose contribution to the public service, very often at cost to themselves in terms of what they might be earning in comparable employment in the private sector, has been very substantial, and whose concept of public service is in no way inferior to that of any of us in this House.  It is also true to say that the growth of the public service into many corners of our society where formerly they never set foot, has also created problems.  If the system is to be administered properly and correctly and fairly, it needs ever-increasing numbers of people and yet, the more you increase the personnel, the more you increase the chance that something somewhere along the line may go wrong.</P>
    <P>It is also true to say that in many areas there are extraordinary powers of <Col N="2076" /> discretion.  This in itself is not a bad thing, as I will come back to argue in a minute.  It remains true that the exercise of discretion also carries within it potential problems.  We all have to strike a balance in our minds between what kind of discretion in a public service is appropriate and what is not.  Without making the slightest reflection on any of the individuals concerned, I should like to give as a prime example of the area in which administrative discretion is over-large the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely extraordinary that a Department who administer a departmental budget of almost £500 million a year should be governed by so little legislation.  When you think of the reams of legislation which circumscribe the operation of the Department of Social Welfare, when you think of the mountainous Acts and regulations beyond number which govern the administration of the Department of Health, the Department of Education is a puny stripling indeed and, as I have said, a prime example of the doubtless innocent way in which administrative discretion has exceeded what might be regarded as reasonable bounds.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the question of discretion because it is plain that discretion exists, and discretion ought to exist, and if as I hope we will, we establish the office of ombudsman, many of his investigations will be into areas in which this exercise of discretion has either injured an individual or has appeared to an individual to have injured his interests. There is a very ambiguous attitude in the public mind towards discretion.  Very often there is a desire to criticise public servants who use discretion.  Ironically, at the same time, there is also a willingness to criticise public officials who are too hidebound by the rules, the famous red tape syndrome.  I do not think we recognise often enough what the rules were put there for in the public service originally.  They were put there to eliminate, or at least to reduce, the likelihood of nepotism, of patronage, or of corruption.</P>
    <P>When we attack the rules we have to <Col N="2077" /> be very careful about what we are attacking. When we attack the so-called bureaucrats, when we attack the so-called red tape, we have to ask ourselves are we attacking the existence of rules in themselves?  Are we attacking particular rules, or are we attacking the particular use that may be made of a certain set of rules?  We really cannot have it both ways, and yet we tend to try to.  This is probably especially true in the public eye and in that part of the public eye which is reflected in our media.</P>
    <P>Where there is a particular case in which there is a whiff of corruption, in which a public official may have been slack, in which a public official may have been careless, there is a call from the public to tighten up the rules, to make sure this cannot happen again, and to sack the official concerned.  If in another case somebody is denied a benefit popular opinion feels he or she ought to have had, if a person or category of people is excluded from a benefit because of the application of a certain set of rules, the cry goes up: &ldquo;Cut the red tape.  Away with all this pettifogging nonsense.  Let justice be done.&rdquo; There is a danger in all this that simplistic critiques of administration may disregard the strengths of a well-worked out and soundly based system of public administration.</P>
    <P>One point I should like to make in passing is that I suspect many of the problems which arise in relation to the public service, and which may well find their way onto an ombudsman's desk, relate to what happens at the point of contact between a member of the public and the public service.  I feel personally that public servants who work at the point of contact, at the interface if you like, between their service and the public, tend to be too junior and tend, as they are promoted into areas in which administrative practice and discretionary procedures are elaborated, to move further and further away physically from the public they are supposed to be serving. I should like to see a recruitment and promotion procedure in the public service that brought public servants to <Col N="2078" /> the interface with the public at a comparatively senior point in their careers.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the role of public representatives in any administrative system.  No public representative who has ever reached this House will be unaware of the way in which he or she is regarded as an essential cog in the administrative machine.  He or she may regard himself or herself as having been elected in order to decide the fate of the nation, but he or she will find himself or herself interfering with various levels of the public administrative system and service on behalf of individual constituents to an inordinate degree.  I recently sent out a survey to a cross-section of my constituents and was interested to find out that their estimation of the amount of time I spent in here as compared with the amount of time I spent looking after their problems was almost exactly the reverse of the situation that exists.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which is that constituents do not often differentiate between the different sectors of public administration.  They do not often recognise that as a Member of the Dáil or Seanad one need not have any direct input and that unless one is a councillor one does not have any direct input into a whole series of problems and difficulties that are the preserve of the local authority.  Likewise it works in reverse if one comes to a councillor with a problem that a councillor has nothing to do with.  There are some areas where public representatives overlap.  For example, housing is both a national and a local concern but telephones are purely a Dáil matter and a councillor would have nothing to do with the provision of a telephone.</P>
    <P>It is clear that at the moment constituents who feel aggrieved use their public representative at all levels, regardless of the relevance of the role that he may have to play in other areas, as a kind of ombudsman.  We are either underpaid as public representatives or else we are the most overpaid secretarial service in the western world in that we spend so much of our time in writing letters to public Departments on behalf of <Col N="2079" /> people who have neither the time, the resources nor the degree of familiarity with the system to make these representations themselves.  We are not ombudsmen in the full sense of the word. We do not make the judgment on an individual case.  In any case in which a constituent has a grievance, Members of the House are usually clear in the first three or four minutes of meeting the constituent whether he has a genuine grievance or whether he is just hopelessly doing the rounds of all the public representatives in defence of a case that he is not sure of.  In the case where a genuine grievance exists it seems that by our intervention we can ensure that the case is re-heard at a higher level of administration than the level at which it was originally decided.  This is important, but I wonder if it is the work he ought to be doing.  This is not to say that decisions against which constituents are appealing are unfair.  In fact, I would prefer more discretion rather than less at all levels of the public service.  It is just that every system needs an appeal court. However, it is very unclear as to whether this Chamber should be performing that function.</P>
    <P>The proportional representation system may be partly responsible for the creation of the client system in politics, which is encouraged by overworked public officials who argue that if anybody has a real grievance it will come through the TDs or the councillors and they therefore confine their administrative attentions more and more to cases that reach them through these channels.  It is also encouraged by the TDs because it helps them to build up their file system, their client list and their groups of political dependants.  That is not the right way to go about it.  The appointment of an ombudsman is an essential first step in breaking away from the client system in politics the only justification for which is that occasionally it produces justice where justice was probably quite innocently denied through the administrative process.  If there is one other major <Col N="2080" /> benefit from the establishment of an ombudsman it is that it might begin to put an end to the system of patronage which has disfigured this country for decades.  I do not know that any administration has entirely clean hands in this regard, but it was quite extraordinary to hear the Minister for Labour on a public platform during the Cork by-election, saying that Fianna Fáil did not believe that one had to go cap in hand to any politician to get a job.  If Fianna Fáil did not invent the system of patronage here I do not know who did.</P>
    <P>We must differentiate between patronage and patronate.  If it is in one's power to make political appointments as a government, for example, naturally one will appoint people, by and large, all other things being equal, who share one's political beliefs.  I do not believe in a system of patronage which involves an interference in administrative procedures whether at the level of local administration, national administration, the law courts or whatever, in the allocation of housing, jobs and in the public service. Many of the people we represent find it difficult to differentiate between these two kinds of patronage.  It is important in the democratic exercise to do so.  We all meet people who believe that political influence will get them something to which they are not entitled.  This is particularly true in relation to housing.  It is certainly a slur on the housing officials in the local authority with which I have most dealings, the Dublin County Council, but it exists as a kind of folk memory from when people thought things were different. That is why we need more openness.  A member of my party has a motion down in Dublin County Council at the moment urging the council to make all housing applicants fully aware of their position on the housing list well in advance of any allocation of houses so that if any mistakes of an administrative nature have been made they can be corrected before the houses are allocated.</P>
    <P>It is sad that some politicians and public representatives do not see the need for this kind of openness and for this <Col N="2081" /> different way of doing things.  It may be that at a time when so much effectiveness and power is being removed, especially from local authorities, but also from the Dáil, they like to continue having people believe that their intervention can have a political effect.  We must strike hard at that.  An ombudsman is not the ultimate solution to all the problems I have talked about this evening but this Bill goes a considerable distance towards satisfying the things that I have outlined.</P>

The initial release contained data extending up to and including December 1978.  The series had to be temporarily discontinued, however, because of the intervention of the postal dispute.  Publication was resumed on 1 November 1979 when the figures for July 1979 were issued together with the corresponding indices for the first six months of the year, for which data had to be collected retrospectively. As is the practice with the monthly agricultural output price index, the input index will be issued monthly in future as the index numbers become available.</P>

      <P>The Council, in establishing the draft budget for 1980, entered commitment appropriations of 826 million EUA for the European Social Fund.  That figure represented an increase of about 7 per cent over the corresponding figure in the 1979 budget.  Of that total, commitment appropriations for measures for handicapped persons were agreed by the Council at 70 million EUA, an increase of 9 million EUA or 15 per cent over <Col N="1951" /> the corresponding amount in the 1979 budget.</P>
      <P>The total amount of 826 million EUA decided by the Council was less than the amount proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget, that is, 1,000 million EUA.  It should be emphasised that the decisions of the Council in budgetary matters are taken by qualified majority and that the proceedings of the Council are confidential. Accordingly it would not be appropriate to go into detail in regard to the positions taken by member states in the course of budgetary discussions. While some member states including Ireland supported the amounts proposed by the Commission for the main areas of the social fund there was not the required qualified majority to retain in full in the draft budget the amounts proposed by the Commission for most headings including measures for handicapped persons.  In the latter case, where the Commission had proposed 75 million EUA, the highest figure on which a compromise could be reached was 70 million EUA.</P>
      <P>It might also be pointed out that the establishment of the 1980 draft budget by Council is only the first stage in the Community's lengthy budgetary procedure.  There remains the clear possibility that the appropriations entered for the social fund in the draft budget will be increased before the end of the budgetary procedure.</P>

      <Col N="1953" /> Under section 2 (h) of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, persons employed by or under the State are excluded from the provisions of that Act, with the exception of persons designated under section 17 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969. The persons so designated comprise (a) State industrial employees and (b) civilian employees serving with the Defence Forces (employed under the Defence Act 1954), who have access to the Labour Court for determination of pay and conditions of employment.  The total number of employees in the designated categories, a detailed list of which is appended, is 8,200 (approx.). The date of designation of these employees under the Industrial Relations Act, 1969 is 8 October 1969.</P>
    <P>No State employees other than the employees listed in the appendix are designated under the 1969 Act.  Accordingly, all staff in the non-industrial civil service, whether established or unestablished, are excluded from the scope of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  The total number of staff in the non-industrial civil service is 52,000, the main groups being as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Progress to date in the implementation of the proposals in the Report of the Working Party on Training and Employing the Handicapped has been as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  Ten new community workshops have been established and facilities at existing workshops and training centres improved and extended.</P>
      <P>(2)  Fourteen additional placement officers and 16 additional youth employment officers under the National Rehabilitation Board have been approved.</P>
      <P>(3)  An advisory committee on the occupational rehabilitation of the visually handicapped has been established.</P>
      <P>(4)  The completion of registers of persons suitable for vocational rehabilitation in each health board community care area has been undertaken.</P>
      <P>(5)  A series of courses has been held under the aegis of AnCO for persons involved in the training of handicapped persons.</P>
      <P>(6)  All new AnCO training centres have been designed to be fully accessible to the physically handicapped and existing buildings are being modified so far as possible to make them accessible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1959" /> (7)  A pilot scheme to train the disabled in AnCO centres was initiated in 1975, since then approximately 850 disabled persons have been trained in these centres.  The range of courses successfully completed by handicapped trainees has also been expanded substantially.</P>
    <P>(8)  The organisation and staffing of the National Rehabilitation Board is under review with a view to strengthening it as the main executive agency concerned with the implementation of rehabilitation policies.  The recommendations of a firm of management consultants in this connection are under consideration.</P>
    <P>(9)  Proposals for a special assessment unit for cases requiring prolonged assessment are under examination by the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
    <P>(10)  Consultation is proceeding between the National Rehabilitation Board and the Department of Social Welfare concerning procedures to bring persons in receipt of long-term benefits under the Social Welfare Acts to the notice of directors of community care of health boards.</P>
    <P>(11)  The effectiveness of industrial units in psychiatric hospitals is being improved with assistance of European Social Fund grants.</P>
    <P>(12)  Organisational and operational standards for rehabilitation workshops have been recommended by a committee of the National Rehabilitation Board and are under examination in my Department.</P>
    <P>(13)  Allowances and conditions for trainees in special training centres and for sheltered workers are being steadily improved.  I made a special additional allocation available for this purpose during the year.</P>
    <P>(14)  A pilot scheme of grants to employers for special facilities for the handicapped will be introduced by the National Rehabilitation Board in 1980.</P>
    <P>A full list of recommendations are set out in summary form in pages 60 to 65 of the report.  The implementation of these not already dealt with will, of course, depend on the rate at which the <Col N="1960" /> necessary resources become available and on competing demands of other health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on 1978 statistics, the average cost per patient per week in voluntary public hospitals was approximately 19 per cent higher than the corresponding figure for country hospitals.  The higher average for voluntary public hospitals is due broadly to the fact that the figure is based on costings which include major voluntary teaching hospitals which provide a wide range of specialities, including national and regional specialities.</P>

      <P>Based on 1978 statistics, the average <Col N="1961" /> cost per patient week for voluntary public hospitals generally was exceeded most significantly by the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, St. Laurence's Hospital, the National Children's Hospital and Jervis Street Hospital.  In the case of these hospitals the average cost was exceeded to the extent of approximately 65 per cent, 48 per cent, 38 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Individual hospital costs are influenced by a variety of factors including the range of specialties provided, whether teaching or non-teaching, and the general activity level of the hospital.  It will be appreciated that the average cost for voluntary hospitals covers hospitals which differ significantly in character and in costs.  This accounts for the excess of costs in the hospitals mentioned over the average for all hospitals in the voluntary public hospital category.</P>

      <P>I indicated in my reply to a question by the Deputy on 4 July last (Official Report, Volume 315, columns 17171718) that it is my policy to end the further admission of mentally handicapped persons to psychiatric hospitals as soon as sufficient alternative accommodation has been provided in special residential centres.</P>
      <P>It is not possible, however, as a general policy, to transfer existing mentally handicapped patients from psychiatric hospitals.  Apart from the problem of providing the necessary number of residential places for such patients it is doubtful if many of them because of their age would benefit significantly from a change of environment.  Those remaining in psychiatric hospitals are, as far as possible, segregated from other types of patients which facilitates the provision of services to meet their specific needs.</P>
      <P>These arrangement do not rule out the transfer to special residential centres of very young patients or others who would clearly benefit from such a transfer.</P>

The North American and Canadian market is under continuous review by the company with a view to increasing sales.  The success of Aer Rianta's endeavours to date is indicated by the sales figures for 1977 and 1978, which amounted to £2,510,291 and £2,619,839, respectively.  The projected sales figure for 1979 is £3,170,000, which would represent an increase of 21 per cent on the 1978 figure.</P>

    <P>It is estimated that terminal passenger traffic at Shannon during 1980 will increase by approximately 5 per cent over 1979 as a result of normal growth, while the increase in transit traffic should be of the order of 10 per cent.  Aer Rianta have agreed with Aeroflot, the Soviet national airline, to provide separate fuelling facilities at Shannon and this mainly accounts for the expected increase in transit traffic.  Operations by Aeroflot through Shannon are due to resume in mid-1980.  Terminal freight traffic (excluding mail) showed an increase of 6.2 per cent for the ten months January to October 1979 as compared with the corresponding period of 1978 and the increase for the 12 months of 1979 as <Col N="1973" /> compared with 1978 should be about 6 per cent.  It is estimated that terminal freight traffic in 1980 will increase by about 5 per cent over 1979.</P>

      <P>The market for skim milk powder in the EEC is currently rather tight and is expected to remain so for the first few months of 1980.  Available supplies should, however, meet Community requirements in this period.</P>
      <P>The sharp reduction in skim milk powder stocks in the EEC during the course of the year has been due to an improved market situation generally and to Community support to encourage the usage of skim milk, both in liquid and powder form, for animal feed purposes.</P>

      <P>The Regional Fund Regulation provides that the fund may contribute to the financing of investments which individually exceed 50,000 European units of account (£33,500).  However, it specifies that member states shall give priority to the presentation of requests for contributions towards large investments. Therefore in selecting projects for submission for Regional Fund assistance priority is given to large projects.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless where smaller projects such as small sewerage schemes are of importance to the development of the region in which they are located they may be included in our applications for fund assistance provided that they comply with the requirements of the fund regulation.</P>
