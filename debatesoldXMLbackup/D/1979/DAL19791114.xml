    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was speaking about the Estimate for CIE.  I would like to take this opportunity again to refute the statement by Deputy Bruton in relation to the contribution being made by the taxpayers to the running of CIE.  Last night Deputy Bruton stated that the first £100 paid by the average family now goes to maintain CIE.  I request Deputy Bruton to substantiate that statement or withdraw this unfair attack on the management and staff of CIE, a company who are giving good employment to their 16,600 employees&mdash;that was the number in December 1977 according to their annual report.  Deputy Bruton does not seem to take into account the contribution of £26 million in payment to the State by the employees of CIE and also the £28.3 million spent on the purchase of goods of Irish origin. Those figures are stated in the annual report of 1977 and surely Deputy Bruton must take those into account when making his allegations in relation to income tax contribution.  He has cast an unfair slur on the workers of CIE who have given loyal and faithful service to the country.  They are all employees of CIE through the Department and they should be commended for their efforts over the years.  They are working in a very difficult area and their contribution should be recognised.  They are in an area which is providing a service which the public require and I would be very upset at any curtailment of the services being provided.  The public are getting a good return for their investment, and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that a level of contribution and support for CIE will be maintained which will ensure that they will provide not only stable employment <Col N="1535" /> for their employees but also the improvement and continuation of their service to the public.</P>
      <P>It should be noted also that the staff of CIE were reduced by 3,400 between May 1975 and December 1977.  Part of that time was during our period in office but the greater part of it was during the term of the Coalition Government.  That reduction in the staff probably was necessary, but it is regrettable because we should be in the area of job creation and CIE can play their part in the creation and provision of employment.</P>
      <P>In relation to the purchase of goods of Irish origin by CIE, the management of the company should be always on the alert to ensure that they will continue this policy of buying Irish.  Recently in one of their dining cars on the route to Roscommon I found that some of the items supplied were not purchased in Ireland.  This matter should be investigated by the Department.  I will give the Minister further details and he should request the purchasing officers of CIE to ensure that only Irish products are provided on the national railway and on the national transport service generally.</P>
      <P>I have been seeking to obtain the up-to-date annual report of CIE and I understand that the latest annual report available is that for 1977.  As this is 1979 the 1978 report should have been issued by now, and I wonder what is the reason that this report is so late in coming out. Any company should have their annual report issued early and on time.  I have failed to obtain a copy of the annual report for 1979.  I understand from the Oireachtas Library that it has not been issued and is not available. If I had that report I would be able to make a more accurate contribution to this debate from figures which would then be available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to another point I made last night in relation to the transportation of goods for industry, it is vitally important that industries be made aware of the excellent services available in CIE for the transport of freight to different locations throughout Ireland.  The IDA <Col N="1536" /> should play a part in encouraging the carriage of goods on the rail services, thus helping to eliminate some of the very heavy traffic which is now using the inadequate roads of Ireland to transport goods from the ports in Dublin and other parts to industry throughout Ireland, particularly in the west.  A very serious look should be taken at the situation regarding transport of certain products to the Asahi plant in Killala, Mayo.  We have an opportunity now to review our safety precautions and we want to ensure that the near tragedy which occurred in Canada would not and could not occur here in Ireland.  One product transport is extremely dangerous and CIE management should take every precaution in relation to the transportation of this chemical to the Asahi plant.</P>
    <P>With regard to the hotel section of CIE, the Coalition Government took a retrograde step by closing so many of their fine hotels.  The CIE hotels at Sligo, Mulranny, Bundoran and Kenmare were closed but there was an opportunity to develop them.  CIE are a State company involving tourism and they should not have been allowed to sell them.  The Coalition Government were supposed to have many so-called Socialists in their ranks and I fail to understand how Socialist Ministers in the Coalition Government could have allowed CIE to sell four of their hotels.  The returns from the sales were so little that it should be obvious that a very bad decision was taken.  I feel that under a Fianna Fáil Government such a decision would not have been taken.  It deprived many people of good employment.</P>
    <P>The situation in relation to the Russell Court Hotel in Belfast is still creating difficulties for CIE.  It is costing approximately £360,000 to pay the interest on the original loan.  I understand they have difficulty in converting it to an office block because of the grants they were paid by the Northern Ireland authorities. I also understand CIE are awaiting a decision from the Government about the future of this particular building in Belfast, which I hope at some stage can be used again as an hotel.  It is closed at <Col N="1537" /> the moment.  It was damaged by bombing in 1974 and after it was re-opened it was bombed a second time.  This hotel was built at a time when there was an improvement in the situation in the North and it would have made a contribution to the financial affairs of CIE if everything had worked out well.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increased subvention required by CIE it is worth pointing out that the increase in oil costs alone was over £5 million and the increase in labour costs not provided for in the original Estimate amounted to over £9 million.  This would take into account the National Understanding which CIE are obliged to honour.  The Government must provide a subvention to ensure that the employees of CIE are given the full benefit of the National Understanding. The shortfall in the anticipated revenue amounts to nearly £4 million, which has also created difficulties for CIE and resulted in them having to come before the Oireachtas for a further subvention.</P>
    <P>What would be the actual saving to the State if much of the transportation on the public roads was eliminated?  If we had not the services of CIE the total fuel bill for the State would be much larger.  This should be taken into consideration when the public are assessing the quality of the services provided by CIE.  They are playing a major contribution in the reduction of our oil imports and they should be commended for this. I believe that in the future CIE rail services will be availed of by more of the public.  A retrograde step was taken some years ago in closing down many of our rail services, particularly in parts of my constituency in County Leitrim, where the rail service was completely removed.  The people who made that decision had little foresight.  That railway could provide an excellent service to County Leitrim and would assist in the provision of industry in that part of my constituency, which requires every assistance the State can give.</P>
    <P>With regard to Bord Fáilte I would like to congratulate the management and directors of that organisation for their contribution in earning £400 million this <Col N="1538" /> year as against £376 million in 1978. This is a tremendous success for Bord Fáilte, when one takes into account the effects of the postal strike and the oil and petrol shortage this year.  It is also a success for the Minister who spearheaded the drive for further tourists in England, Germany and the Netherlands.  Tourism is a major earner, and Bord Fáilte are an efficient organisation. I understand that Bord Fáilte have commissioned a special film on the Pope's historic visit here.  They will be using this for further promotion, which is a very realistic approach to the visit of the Pope.  Bord Fáilte will now be promoting places like County Mayo, Clonmacnoise and other historic locations visited by the Pope.  This will play a major contribution in the tourist drive in the eighties.  I feel that during that time we will see a further marked improvement in the revenue earned by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>The new proposals announced by Bord Fáilte in relation to the hotel industry are very welcome.  I look forward to their contribution to my constituency to ensure that the hoteliers in Roscommon and Leitrim obtain support for the expansion of their present facilities, which they are anxious to go ahead with. It is appropriate to compliment the work done by the regional tourism organisations, particuarly the Midland Regional Tourism Organisation, which covers part of my constituency, and the North Eastern Tourist Organisation, which covers the Leitrim part of my constituency. Those organisations are playing a very positive role in the promotion and development of tourism in County Roscommon and County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>The grants for the development of the tourism information offices and for local authority amenity improvements schemes are very welcome.  Hopefully, there will be a continuance of the necessary financial support for local authorities to help them improve tourism facilities.  I take this opportunity of appealing to the Midland Regional Tourism Organisation to ensure that areas such as Portrun in Roscommon and other such areas receive further <Col N="1539" /> assistance in order to ensure the expansion of the existing facilities both for the Irish tourist and for the tourist from abroad, because tourism is not merely a matter of provision of facilities for people from abroad.  We must cater, too, for our own tourists.  The contribution that Bord Fáilte have been making in this regard is to be highly commended.  I am confident that everyone here will support the extra grant to the board so that they may be able to continue the good work they are doing.  We are fortunate that there is such a good working relationship between the board and the Department of Tourism and Transport.  The Minister has played a very important role in regard to the number of tourists who visited Ireland this year.  His quick action in relation to the issuing of fuel vouchers earlier in the year was a big factor in the success of the tourism industry.  The voucher system worked very well.  During the fuel crisis the Minister was never out of touch with the situation.  He went on BBC television and other media to explain the situation here and to reassure the many tourists who intended spending their holidays here.</P>
    <P>I regard as totally unfair the attacks on CIE by members of Fine Gael whose attitude on this occasion cannot be very encouraging to the management and staff of that company in carrying out their work.  It is too easy for politicians to knock an organisation such as CIE but recognition should be given to the important part that the company are playing in the wellbeing and development of this State.  On an occasion such as this we should not miss the opportunity of paying tribute to the management and staff of CIE both at local and central level.  I have the highest regard for CIE staff in my constituency, from station masters to the people who drive the buses and also those people involved in the school transport system.  These are a dedicated bunch of people who are working in very difficult circumstances but who never fail to assist in any way possible those people who avail of the transport services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> The standard of maintenance at railway stations is very high.  This situation is appreciated by the public who, of course, are entitled to the best possible services and standards.  I would appeal to the Minister, though, to do something about the improvement of the rolling stock on the western route because we in the west should have a service equal to the service being provided in any other part of the country.  From my contacts both with the Minister and with CIE I am aware that usage of the rail services in that area has increased by 30 per cent. That is a situation that should be recognised.  It warrants the provision of additional funds for the rail services in that area.  I have been informed by CIE that they are awaiting a decision from the Department in relation to the rolling stock situation on the western route.  In the circumstances I would appeal to the Minister to give the matter his immediate attention.</P>
    <P>There is a need, too, for a further service from Westport, leaving, say, at about 10 a.m. and reaching Roscommon at about 12 noon, with another train leaving Heuston Station at about 8 o'clock each evening.  The service on the western route was curtailed during the time of the Coalition Government but I am confident that the situation will be rectified by this administration.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the excellent work he is doing in the Department. Now that his responsibility in relation to Posts and Telegraphs is to be assumed largely by another body, he will have all the more time for concentrating on his Tourism and Transport portfolio and, consequently, for expanding this very important industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton was critical of the Minister in regard to his commissioning a report into the affairs of CIE but it is only right and proper that the Minister would seek the advice of the best possible consultants in regard to the development of the company's services. However, Deputy Bruton failed to point out that during the Coalition's term in office, CIE commissioned the consultants Martin and Voorhees Associates <Col N="1541" /> and Henderson, Hughes and Busby to undertake jointly a study of the southwest rail corridor.  According to the company's annual report for 1976, the objective of this study was to assess the best long-term investment policy for the Dublin-Cork and Limerick-Limerick Junction railway lines taking account of policy for national and regional development. On page 9 of the report we read that:</P>
    <P>It was designed to examine such issues as electrification, train frequency, speed, phasing of improvement, the future role of the railway and the impact of rail investment on other transport modes.  It will have particular regard to the influence of changes in population, fuel costs and fare levels.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will be able to let us know the outcome of the investigation, an investigation which must have some bearing on the development of those aspects of CIE services.</P>
    <P>It is not for me as a Deputy from the west to concern myself too much with the transport situation in Dublin except to point out that traffic hold-ups in Dublin affect travellers to the west in so far as they may spend an hour travelling from the city centre to Heuston Station. Something must be done about the situation in Dublin.  I understand that there is to be an experiment in the Parliament Street area in respect of bus clearways. Perhaps this is the sort of development that will help solve the congestion in the city.  If the experiment proves successful I expect that it will be extended to other parts of Dublin and an increased number of people will avail of the bus service.  At the moment the service is inadequate and it is frustrating for both the travellers and the management of CIE.  I feel sure that when the Minister sees the result of the first experiment he will consider, in consultation with the Department of the Environment, a further expansion of this proposal.  It is a worthwhile proposal and it could ensure the viability of the service in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I congratulate CIE on <Col N="1542" /> their activities.  Unfortunately they are not making money but if the rail lines could be taken into account on a different accounting system and maintained directly out of State funds without CIE having to come before the Oireachtas for extra subventions then the real picture of CIE could be clearly shown.  CIE should be given encouragement.  I know the Minister is giving encouragement and leadership to CIE.  I hope that this will continue so that in the years ahead we will see a true picture of CIE and will have a service which will be second to none.  We have a national transport service which we should be proud of and we should do everything in our power to encourage it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind Deputy Leyden, and indeed some other Fianna Fáil Deputies I have heard speaking in this House, of the proper pronunciation of the name of this party. If we were to change the emphasis on the various pronounciations we might get the word &ldquo;fiáin&rdquo; which implies that we are all wild.  We are not.  The name is Fine Gael.  At least, that is what I was taught.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear from the Minister that there has been an increase in the amount of passengers and in the tonnage of freight carried on the railway lines. The day of the rail line is not ended.  If the matter is taken in hand in the proper manner there is a very bright future indeed for our railway lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I want to take up a point made by Deputy Leyden in relation to the western line.  I understand CIE are awaiting the approval of the Minister for extra finance to purchase new coaches to bring the standard of the western line into line with that of the southern and eastern lines.  I would not mind if we were speaking of the Moscow to Vladivostok line but it is not that length; it is only about 150 or 160 miles.  CIE have introduced changes in the running times of the trains on this line and have also increased the speed of the train from Westport to Dublin.  They purchased <Col N="1543" /> some new engines some years ago but due to the condition of the western line and due to the inability of some of the arches to keep up the weight of some of these new engines they were not put into use except on a very limited scale on that line.  In fact many of the trains now coming from Westport to Dublin have two engines pulling them giving them a horsepower of about 1,800 as against 2,500 for the newer engines which were purchased some years ago.</P>
    <P>There can be no question but that the west has often suffered at the hands of successive Governments in the provision of equal facilities with other parts of the country.  The Minister should take in hand immediately the provision of equal facilities on the western line.  The state of the trains on this line after football matches or large sporting events leaves a lot to be desired.  This results from vandalism on the trains but it is also because of the lack of the necessary number of coaches which leaves no time for the workers to have the coaches which were used on the day of the sporting event properly cleaned before being used again.  I remember being in communication with Mr. St. John Devlin of CIE.  He was very courteous and efficient in his reply.  He stressed that he thought we were looking for air-conditioned coaches.  The coaches are air conditioned as they stand but it is not the type of air conditioning that is designed in many of the modern coaches.  I do not know if the Minister has ever travelled on the western line but if he heads into a gale force wind somewhere west of Roscommon air conditioning is very real at that stage.</P>
    <P>Due to the amount of emigration we have had down through the years our railway lines and railway stations, particularly in the west, have played an historic part in relation to our people. Many a harrowing scene has been witnessed at railway stations.  Many a person has left the railway station with visions of glory in his eyes as he headed for Holyhead and the darker areas of London.  It is sad to see the closure of <Col N="1544" /> many of these railway stations.  Successive Governments have been responsible for this.  If things are handled properly there is a very bright future for the railway lines here.  The visit of His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, to Knock in County Mayo, has opened up new possibilities for the introduction of a railway line into the Knock area.  Never before in the history of this country has such a crowd descended on such a small village.  I do not believe that such a crowd will ever descend on it again but the number of pilgrims who are now visiting the shrine since the visit of His Holiness has increased on a vast scale in that short period and it is something that should be considered seriously.  If the development at Knock continues on the same scale, in ten or 15 years' time there will be complete chaos on successive Sundays in that part of the country unless there is a greater improvement in the roads into the area.  The Minister should consider this within his portfolio. He should provide the finance to allow CIE to purchase the necessary coaches to enable the western line to provide equal facilities with those of their neighbours on the eastern and southern lines.</P>
    <P>In relation to Bord Fáilte, with all the difficulties we have had this year the situation was not as bad as was originally forecast.  This was not due to the weather we had in 1979&mdash;somebody said we had summer on a Tuesday this year.  The Minister has two jobs as Minister.  He must impress on the people of the Continent, of the United States of America and elsewhere that the troubles here do not extend over the whole of the 32 counties.  Many of the people of the Continent have the impression that they cannot walk any street in any town here without being shot at or harrassed in some way by subversive organisations of one sort or another.  The Minister's tours and promotional campaigns abroad can have a very important bearing on this. Many continentals do not recognise the existence of Ireland at all and those who do seem to think that the whole country has been engaged in an all out state of war for the past 50 years.  The Minister <Col N="1545" /> should promote the truth on this matter.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest drawbacks and one of the worst impressions tourists come away with is not of the weather or of the people but of the amount of refuse and the general lack of hygiene in many of our towns.  Our beauty spots and historical sites are being destroyed by refuse and rubbish down through the years.  The anti-litter campaign conducted during the past few years does not seem to have been very successful in this area.  It leaves a very bad impression if tourists come here and find that the standards of hygiene in restaurants, cafés and in toilets are not up to the standards obtaining in their own countries.  Bord Fáilte is headed by a man from my own county and he deserves credit for the magnificent work he has done, often under tremendous pressure.  I am glad to see that the Minister is giving the board an increase in funds.  Naturally, we wish it could be more but I suppose the Minister also is bound by financial constraints.</P>
    <P>The future is bright for tourism in Ireland.  The persistent quality that has shone through every difficulty is the genuine Irishness and warmth of our people in receiving tourists.  This is something that money cannot buy.  It is something that has always been there and it is much appreciated by people from abroad.  We have an inherent quality of receiving others from distant shores, just as they received our people during the years, and of making them feel at home here.  If the relatively minor difficulties that arise are attended to by the Minister I can see our tourist industry improving tremendously in the next 20 years to the benefit of the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate does not give any great hope for the future of CIE other than that McKinsey and Company are going to report on where the losses are occurring.  That may be a useful exercise but it will not solve any of the problems in CIE.  That organisation are charged with transporting people from A to B and also with delivering <Col N="1546" /> cargo and goods throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The passenger services, particularly in city areas, are both expensive and of poor quality.  In his statement the Minister referred to losses incurred in this city and a figure of £11.7 million was quoted.  There was mention also of a drop in the number of passengers.  One would not expect anything else in view of the exorbitant increases in bus fares and the deteriorating service.  People have to make their own travel arrangements and this is causing further traffic chaos.  People no longer can depend on public transport for one reason or another.</P>
      <P>I do not see anything in the Minister's speech indicating proper development of the city services.  For many years CIE have tried to get a commitment from the Government to develop a rapid rail system from the centre of the city to the satellite towns around Dublin but nothing has happened.  The Minister mentioned that there is an increase in the use of the services operating on the suburban lines and this indicates that there is a clear desire for further development in this area.  The rapid rail system will cost approximately £200 million, possibly more having regard to inflation. We are talking in terms of £50 million per year over a four-or five-year period. At the moment CIE are incurring a loss of more than £1 million per week and this cannot be sustained.  If we are to cut that loss we must think positively.  The only way we can give people a proper service is to develop the rapid rail system as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should improve the system that exists at the moment from Howth to the city and also that operating to Greystones.  Areas such as Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin and Ballymun have large populations.  We are building these towns outside the city but we are not providing facilities for commuters.  The roads are totally inadequate to deal with the traffic and obviously the only way to provide an efficient service is by the rapid rail system. I do not know why there is no great desire to have this scheme in operation.  I <Col N="1547" /> know that some kind of consultative transport commission has been set up to look into the question but it is just putting the matter on the long finger. The facts and figures for the rapid rail system show that it is necessary and could be viable.  If the rapid rail system were in operation there would be beneficial effects for the centre city.  People from Tallaght would be able to commute in 19 minutes.  The traders in the centre city would also gain financially and it would give new life to the inner city.  However, it does not seem to have the blessing of the Government.  We tabled a Private Members' Motion on this matter some time ago but nothing has happened.  I ask the Minister to examine the matter.  If the Government inject the necessary finances the losses we are talking about now would be reduced substantially.</P>
    <P>It is time we did something about bus lanes.  I am a member of the local authority and I can tell the House that we are introducing a bus lane in Parliament Street.  Admittedly it is only one short street but at least it is a start.  The Government will have to examine this matter and see what constraints can be put on private motorists from coming into the city.  However, it is not possible to put an embargo on private cars if an alternative is not provided.  People will use public transport if it is efficient and reasonably priced.  They are not using it at the moment because it is not efficient or reasonably priced.  If the Government are serious about fuel conservation they should encourage more people to travel by public transport.  This would cut down the number of cars on the road.  If we have bus lanes in operation the service will be quick and efficient.  There would be no need for any more rolling stock because the available buses could travel much more quickly.  In that way one would operate at an efficient rate in bringing people to and fro, and they know they could get to work and home again in a reasonable time.  Obviously this will have to be done in conjunction with the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> A Government committee should be set up to examine the whole question of transport and to eliminate the chaos in our cities.  I spent a few weeks in Cork during the by-election campaigns.  I thought Dublin was bad, but in Cork there is complete chaos.  There is a great need for a commitment in that city to a positive transport policy.  As in Dublin city, there does not appear to be the will to have this commitment.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest blunders in our transport system was the closing of the Harcourt Street line.  That was vandalism at its worst or its best, whichever way you like to describe it.  The bridges were taken down and the lines were taken up.  Part of the line was sold off which makes it nearly impossible to reopen it.  Perhaps we could have some type of bus lane in that area where there is a large population.  I believe it would be a money spinner.  It is a pity that decision was taken many years ago.  Given the fact that Dublin had to expand one cannot imagine why such a decision was taken.  Something should be done about the Harcourt Street line.  A two-way bus lane would be a useful service.</P>
    <P>If we are to take our transport difficulties seriously, rather than setting up committees here and there and bringing in groups to see how we can cut corners, we should have a positive transport policy.  The Government do not appear to be prepared to have this policy.  CIE have put forward policies which have not received the support they should have received.  When losses of this magnitude crop up, the Government tend to point the finger at CIE.  Bringing in consultants is welcome so far as it goes, but it does not solve our transport problems.</P>
    <P>The Government must make decisions quickly on a positive transport policy.  Not too many years ago the Dublin transport service was profitmaking. Now it is making a loss of nearly £12 million.  There is something radically wrong, and it is not easy to know what it is.  There is chaos on the roads.  There is no forward planning by the Government.  All CIE can do is make plans and, if they do not get the <Col N="1549" /> wherewithal to put them into effect, they can do no more.  Apparently all the Government are prepared to do is to top up the losses every year.  We have now reached crisis point at the figure of £56 million which is £21 million more than the figure last year.</P>
    <P>It is chaotic to think we are losing £1 million a week on our transport service. Definitely something is wrong and it calls for accountability.  The Government should look at positive ways of improving our transport system.  Our population is increasing.  Our cities are expanding. We are building towns around them.  To me that suggests a climate for a profit in the transport services.  Instead we are having loss after loss because there is no proper planning and no commitment.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to commit themselves to the rapid rail plan for Dublin city.  I have no doubt that it would reverse the loss-making situation. It would not eliminate it, but it would reverse the serious trend which is setting in.  Unless we do that we will come in here every year and talk about ways and means of cutting CIE losses without any positive policy.  Unless the Minister is prepared to make a commitment to the rapid rail system, the days of our public transport system are numbered.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether we should examine the feasibility of allowing private companies into the sphere of transport. It might be possible for people to get licences and to be given designated areas in which they could operate.  If that were allowed, we would not have to subsidise transport at the rate at which we are subsidising it at the moment.  We will have to eliminate these losses having regard to our financial resources and what we require in other areas such as housing and education.  We cannot continue to make this type of subvention on a yearly basis. The money is not in the kitty.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day the position in regard to tourism will be satisfactory despite the setbacks early in the year.  I am pleased about that naturally, because it will bring in much-needed revenue. Since we are well-established in Europe <Col N="1550" /> now, I should like to see a hard-sell policy in the European market.  I realise that many Europeans come here but we are still only scratching the surface. Many people will not tend to come here. The sun worshippers tend to go where the sun is.  We have much to offer with our open countryside, our fishing facilities and other activities.  We can attract the upper bracket of the continental market if we provide a first-class quality service.  We have many amenities which they have not got in Europe consequently we should be looking at the upper market in the tourist industry, because a great deal of money is spent by continental tourists.</P>
    <P>Obviously the American and other markets are being looked after but there is still a great deal of work to be done on the continental market.  This is not a criticism of Bord Fáilte who are and have been doing a very good job.  It is up to the Government to finance them and ensure they have the necessary tools to do the job and it is up to the public representatives to ensure the continental market, particularly those in the upper bracket, are encouraged to visit Ireland. We should send our best sales force to the continent to sell Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to get a transport policy moving quickly and to adapt a rapid rail policy as a matter of urgency. If he does that he will stem the tide&mdash;£56 million now and next year it will be even more&mdash;because the money needed will soon be out of all proportion and, as a result, our public transport system will grind to a halt.  Nobody wants that.  A country must have a positive transport system.  Again I appeal to the Government to get a transport policy moving and to provide the finance necessary to improve rolling stock and to provide a rapid rail service, bus lanes and so on.  I had various complaints about the sub-standard, cold and uncomfortable transport system.  I was told that last winter snow was coming through a carriage roof.  This will not encourage people to use our buses or trains.  We must provide a comfortable, efficient service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate relates to the principal spending areas for which moneys are provided by the Oireachtas, that is, inland transport and tourism.  It is not surprising that the discussion covered a very wide field since tourism and transport are interdependent in many ways, nor that the debate ranged beyond the topics specifically dealt with in the Estimate.  I would like to take this opportunity of replying to some of the points made by Deputies.  In particular I want to refer to the large subvention to CIE to cover the additional costs, which are mainly attributable to labour and oil costs.</P>
      <P>I have already expressed my concern at the trend in CIE's subvention and have outlined the latest measures I am taking to have the position reviewed. Both the work being undertaken by McKinsey and Company and the Transport Consultative Commission will provide valuable contributions towards the formulation of a future transport policy.</P>
      <P>On the tourism front the indications are that despite the difficulties encountered early in the year this will be a successful year for the industry generally and will be equal to, if not better than, last year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the continuing losses made by CIE and wanted to know what their future was.  It must be understood that public transport services, particularly rail services, cannot be provided on a scale necessary to meet the economic and social needs of the community on a commercially profitable basis.  We are not unique in this respect. In fact, many highly developed countries like Germany, Japan, Britain and the United States, with much larger population centres and much longer travel journeys, are not able to provide viable public transport services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons are various.  Public transport is highly labour-intensive and, therefore, very severely affected by increases in wages and salaries.  The recent increases in fuel costs are obviously a serious problem.  In addition, the great <Col N="1552" /> growth in private car ownership and the consequent aggravation of urban congestion have affected the quality of city transport services and the level of passenger carryings.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the suggestion that CIE have been deprived of financial support by the State.  The great improvement in the quality of mainline rail services has been possible only because of the substantial Government support both in terms of capital investment and current subvention.  This Supplementary Estimate provides full confirmation of this, as does the recent decision of the Government to electrify the Howth-Bray rail service.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of an efficient public transport service is essential for trade, economic development, tourism and social purposes.  The question is whether we are getting the best service for the level of financial support we provide and whether we are getting good value for the subvention we provide.  It is mainly to deal with these questions that I engaged McKinsey and Company to undertake an independent and objective assessment of the position and to see what measures can be taken and what options are open.  In this connection, I have to say that the board, management and staff of CIE have received a lot of criticism and abuse, much of it undeserved. There has been very significant progress in the improvement of productivity, in raising the level of efficiency and in attracting additional traffic, especially in the rail passenger services. Nevertheless, the particular escalation of costs which arose this year&mdash;due mainly to cost increases for fuel and labour&mdash;are a matter of great concern. Therefore, I look forward to the review and the recommendations of the consultants. In this process I attach a lot of importance to the co-operation and assistance of the staff of CIE and the unions in the consultants' studies.  In the final analysis it will be a matter for me as Minister and the Government to weigh the results of the consultants' work, to examine their recommendations in consultation with CIE and to determine <Col N="1553" /> what modifications may be necessary in future transport policies.</P>
    <P>There was some criticism by a number of Deputies of the engagement of McKinsey but I think I should make the point that the previous McKinsey report contained a very good analysis of the problems of CIE and their recommendations met with broad acceptance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the speed of the implementation of reports of this kind.  When the Post Office Review Group reported to me and the Government, that report was acted on very quickly.  The interim boards recommended in that report have already been set up and have commenced work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton seemed to believe that if we abolished CIE we would save the money used to subvent public transport and that the money thus released would be available to assist housing development, to promote industrial development and so on.  This is a very unreal approach to the matter.  The abolition of CIE or the withdrawal of the subvention would in no way eliminate the need for public transport services or the need for financial support for public transport. Deputy Bruton is also on weak ground in assuming that housing construction or industrial development can be seen as alternatives to public transport subventions. In fact, these activities are interdependent. Housing development and industrial development create a demand for public transport, and transport services are a necessary precondition for all other social and economic development. The fact is that capital resources are limited and we must allocate these resources to the best overall public interest, with due regard to the need for public transport as for other public services, whether they be housing, education, health and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden referred to the new coaches for the mainline railway.  CIE have been carrying out a rail modernisation programme involving the upgrading of the mainline services, including greater comfort, improved frequencies and reduced travelling time.  In order to extend the benefits of this programme <Col N="1554" /> further through the mainline network, CIE have drawn up proposals for the acquisition of an additional 100 mainline carriages.  The cost of the additional carriages is likely to be of the order of £20 million.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in the number of rail passenger journeys in recent years and I am sure that CIE could attract further passenger traffic to the railways with the introduction of additional modern rolling stock.  The CIE proposals are being examined in this light and in the context of the various other considerations which arise, notably the cost of the additional carriages and the overall capital demands arising in the public sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden referred to the transport by rail of chemicals for the Asahi factory in Killala and quite rightly said that transport by rail was preferable to transport by road.  CIE observe very stringent precautions in relation to the carriage of these chemicals and they have assured me that the equipment used is designed and built to the highest standards and that the transport arrangements are in accordance with the best international practice.  Moreover, following consultation between CIE and the State agencies concerned, a scheme has been drawn up to ensure that in the event of any mishap there will be a quick, coordinated response from the emergency services concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy seemed to suggest that we ought to compel traffic to move from road to rail.  I am afraid that the Deputy is unrealistic in his comments on the question of transferring traffic from road to rail.  It is recognised all over the world that the margin for transfers from road to rail is extremely limited.  The rail is virtually fixed to certain bulk traffic for which that mode is especially suitable.  In fact, less than 5 per cent of freight is estimated to move by rail.</P>
    <P>Efforts to restrict the road haulage industry in the belief that freight would transfer to rail proved unsuccessful in the past.  The results of that policy were an inefficient road transport industry and a great increase in &ldquo;own account&rdquo;<Col N="1555" /> haulage.  It is unrealistic of the Deputy to suggest that we should now again revert to a policy of restriction and compulsion. A more positive approach is needed and I shall be tackling the matter in a positive spirit when I have the results of the study of the road haulage sector which the Transport Consultative Commission will be undertaking in due course.  The idea of compelling freight to go by rail is a legacy of 30 or 40 years ago.  This approach was revived with little or no success in other countries, for example, in Britain and Germany during the sixties.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell suggested that CIE were damaging the rail freight service by promoting their road freight services.  It is true that CIE promote and advertise those services.  It would be very uncommercial if they failed to do so.  The fact is that CIE road freight services have been contracted in recent years and not expanded. Overall, CIE road freight services carry not more than 5 per cent of the total volume of road freight, the bulk of the freight being carried by private hauliers and by &ldquo;own account&rdquo; transport.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell also suggested that industrial relations in CIE are very bad. We should get this matter into perspective. CIE are a complex and far-flung organisation with over 16,000 people engaged in a wide range of activities in all parts of the country.  The majority of these people have rarely if ever been involved in a strike.  For example, as Deputy Leyden pointed out, the railway, which account for the greatest number of employees, have not had a significant stoppage for many years.  There have been a number of interruptions in the Dublin city services and some of these stoppages were unofficial.  The problems, social and industrial, which affect the operations of the city bus services are notoriously complex.  I am sure that both management and unions are anxious to avoid these stoppages and the machinery to help them to achieve this is available.</P>
    <P>Deputies Deasy and Bruton referred to the question of private enterprise in <Col N="1556" /> the transport sector.  There are frequent calls for a greater role for private operators in the provision of passenger transport services.  It is true that CIE operate most of the scheduled bus services in urban areas and throughout the country.  However, private operators dominate in the field of private hire.  In recent years private hire operators have made big inroads in the provision of weekend services between Dublin and the provinces.  It has been suggested on various occasions that an element of competition should be introduced into the operation of scheduled passenger services and that private operators should be allowed to compete with CIE for the right to provide services on specific routes on an equal basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton's suggestion regarding the selling of blocks of bus routes to private operators would involve setting up elaborate administrative and control arrangements to specify routes and frequencies, to operate a tendering system and to monitor operations.  There is no reason to think that this would eliminate the necessity for subsidisation of the services or lead to an improvement of the services, as private operators operating on the scale required for urban areas will encounter exactly the same problems as CIE.  There are few, if any, private operators organised or equipped to take over urban services on the scale required. Considering the various aspects I am not satisfied on the arguments presented here that such a system would offer a satisfactory substitute for existing arrangements either in terms of service or cost to the public.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that there is no possibility for a modification of existing policy.  One of my objectives in establishing the Transport Consultative Commission was to have an examination made of the appropriate role of public transport.  This matter will be considered as part of the general review of transport policy which will be undertaken in the light of the reports of the Transport Consultative Commission, the study of CIE which is being carried out by the consultants, McKinsey and Company and of <Col N="1557" /> the recently issued report on CIE by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  The report of the Oireachtas committee is a well balanced and useful report.  It has been examined in my Department and will involve consultations with other Government Departments concerned.  The report will make a valuable input to other studies in relation to public transport at present in progress including the McKinsey study of the financial position of CIE and the study of the Transport Consultative Commission of urban passenger services in the Dublin area.  It is not possible to say yet what decisions will be taken on the recommendations contained in the report of the Oireachtas committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton tended to believe that the increase in the number of cars has been as a result of the removal of car tax.  In my view he is on very poor ground.  The burden of car tax represents only a small proportion of the total cost of car ownership.  When one considers the capital cost of the car, the interest charges on HP or other borrowings, the cost of petrol, insurance and all the other running expenses it will be clear that there is no justification for isolating car tax.  The main factor in the growth of car ownership has been the tremendous increase in living standards and the fact that many more people are in a position to buy and run motor cars.  The problem is how to reconcile that fact with the need to maintain an efficient and flexible public transport system.  This is one of the major tasks of the Transport Consultative Commission from which we will have a report very soon.</P>
    <P>There were many comments in respect of the fact that the Dublin city services paid their way some time ago.  That was true but it was because at that time relatively few people owned cars.  When I set up the Transport Consultative Commission in 1978 I recognised that one of the most pressing problems in the transport field was the growing traffic congestion in urban areas and particularly in the Dublin area.  I requested the commission to accord priority to the question of the provision of urban <Col N="1558" /> passenger transport services particularly in the Dublin area.  I understand that the commission have been concentrating on the Dublin problem and expect to be able to submit a report to me early in the new year.</P>
    <P>The question of special routing concessions for Dublin buses, that is bus lanes, was raised by a number of Deputies.  That is largely a matter for Dublin Corporation subject to the general regulations to be made by the Minister for the Environment concerning road signs and markings and any necessary amendments by the Garda Commissioner to the Dublin traffic and parking by-laws.  I understand Dublin Corporation have given their approval for the introduction of a contra flow bus lane in Parliament Street in Dublin.  It is hoped that this bus lane will relieve congestion on the north quays and Winetavern Street.  I understand that the necessary statutory regulations to implement the bus lane are at present being drafted and it will be the new year before the scheme will be introduced.</P>
    <P>There was a bus lane in operation in Fairview some time ago but the experiment was considered to be a failure because it appeared to add to traffic congestion in that cars were compressed into a more limited area.  My own feeling is that the experiment ought to have been persisted with longer.  It did not give a real opportunity to people to decide to leave their cars at home and travel by public transport.  It might have been successful. However, this is another matter which is being examined at present.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Deasy to Rosslare Harbour.  The position is that Rosslare Harbour is not covered in the subvention paid to CIE and is operated at a profit.  The present development scheme at Rosslare Harbour is being financed from profits, from borrowings and from a harbour grant of the same category as those available to other harbour authorities.  In other words, Rosslare Harbour is in receipt of no special preference in the context of harbour policy.  An important consideration in the case of Rosslare is the fact <Col N="1559" /> that the development scheme now under way and the limited grant support being given to the project is necessary to eliminate acute congestion arising in that port and to facilitate the continuing growth of tourism, particularly motoring tourism, into Ireland.  If we failed to deal with the bottleneck there we would limit the volume of tourist traffic, particularly that into the southern areas.  It is for that reason that I allowed a grant for Rosslare Harbour.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien spoke about the need for expanding the suburban rail service and in particular the rapid rail plan.  The Deputy will already be aware that I have approved the electrification of the Howth-Bray line.  The question of the rapid rail transit system arises in the overall context of Dublin city transport problems which, as I have said, are under study by the Transport Consultative Commission.  The cost, which is approximately £200 million, is formidable and must be considered in the light of whatever recommendations are made by the consultative commission and in the context of other very heavy demands which are made on available capital resources.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy O'Brien and others to a positive transport policy.  There is considerable confusion about the idea of an overall national transport policy and a great deal of loose thinking and facile thought. People who refer to the need for a national plan or policy never seem very anxious to say what exactly they have in mind.  Indeed, I suspect they have given the matter very little thought.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien mentioned on a number of occasions in the course of his speech, a positive transport policy, but he did not make any attempt to elucidate what exactly he meant.  It must be remembered that, while the transport industry is subject to a reasonable degree of regulation, the country's transport services are not all in State ownership nor are they under direct State control. Is it suggested that there should be <Col N="1560" /> greater central and public intervention in the transport industry?  Is it envisaged that the State should determine which transport mode should be used for different journeys or traffics?  Those who apparently advocate an extension of State direction of transport and travel should face up to these questions and refrain from simple, glib suggestions that the publication of some new form of plan would eliminate the losses on railways, or improve the quality of transport services, or in some way serve as a panacea for all transport problems, problems which, I might stress, continue to defy solution in almost every other country.</P>
    <P>I must make it clear that I reject the suggestion that there is a lack of policy and planning in the transport sector here.  Policy in the various areas has been clearly enunciated in a number of ways, in legislation, in economic development plans and in Government and ministerial statements.  In the case of CIE overall policy is set down in legislation and a more detailed delineation of policy is effected through the level of financial support which the Government determine each year.  There have been clear statements of policy in regard to the railways, the road freight services and so on.  Policy statements are not confined to CIE operations.  In the sphere of road haulage generally, where CIE have a minor part of the market only, my policy in regard to the future of the industry and movement towards liberalisation, subject to quality control, was clearly stated in the debate on the Road Transport Act, 1978.</P>
    <P>Of course, transport is a service for the community rather than an end in itself. Therefore, it must be responsive to changing needs and must adapt to developing circumstances.  This requires some degree of flexibility and a willingness to review policy on a regular basis.  The setting up of the Transport Consultative Commission was motivated by the Government's desire to have the benefit of informed, independent and mature advice on the complex issues which affect the shaping of future transport policy.  There is room for public discussion and debate on these <Col N="1561" /> issues and I welcome realistic and constructive debate by all interested parties.</P>
    <P>On the tourism front I should simply like to repeat what I said in my opening statement: that while it was perhaps too soon to predict the final outcome for this year, I am confident that, while some areas and sectors will have done better than others, overall at least we will have held our own with 1978, which was the best year ever.  I pointed out also that the preliminary figures at my disposal would suggest that we will slightly exceed last year's overseas tourist numbers and that the total revenue will exceed the £400 million mark for the first time.  Here was an industry which was faced this year with what appeared to be insurmountable problems.  But let me say&mdash;to the credit of everybody concerned in the industry&mdash;that they all showed perseverance, grit and courage, backed by the application of practical proposals. They showed an imaginative approach to the problems and perhaps most of all a determination that they were not going to allow whatever difficulties faced them to damage one of our most important industries. The effort made by all concerned is an example to people in many other areas of our economy and shows what can be done when effort and determination applied.  The Government reacted very quickly to the problems facing the industry at an early stage, first of all, by ensuring that oil was available for cooking and heating and then by the implementation of the voucher scheme for the provision of petrol for tourists&mdash;a much criticised scheme in the sense that whatever was done seemed not to have been enough.  We were told on numerous occasions that many people were unable to get petrol and that the voucher scheme was not working.  I had to repeat many times in this House that it was working, was working well and the results of the year's operation show now that what I said then was factual.  I might refer also to the great efforts of Bord Fáilte, to the promotional tours undertaken by myself, and to point out the tremendous effort by all concerned has yielded a worthwhile result.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand why <Col N="1562" /> the Opposition persist in saying that this was not a good year for tourism despite the figures I have given.  Of course, the fact of the matter is that it was an exceptionally good year; from all appearances it will have been better than last year&mdash;not very much better, but somewhat better&mdash;which was a spectacular one for the tourist industry. Deputy Deasy suggested that if we had not the problems we would have done better.  There is that possibility, but it is not as positive as it might appear because there was a downturn in the economies of a variety of countries from which tourists come and this naturally would have affected tourist traffic in any case.  There were some references made to the European market.  The European market, with the number of tourists coming from Europe this year, was about 11 per cent up on last year.</P>
    <P>It is very wrong that we should have constant repetition of references to a disastrous and calamitous year and so on. Even Deputy Hegarty, who is a very reasonable man, referred to this as being one bad year.  This is not one bad year; this is a good year.  Unfortunately, experience shows that if one keeps repeating that something is disastrous or calamitous it becomes part of the mythology.  I have no doubt that in years to come, depending on what speeches or what newspaper articles are read, we will still find 1979 referred to as a disastrous year.  It reminds me very much of the time of the technician's strike in the Post Office when one individual said we were losing £3 million a day.  Sometime later, when put under pressure as to how he could account for this, he was unable to give an answer of any description.  He had nothing with which to back up that figure.  Yet even today we find people talking about the £3 million a day loss.  It is unfortunate, particularly in relation to an industry so very important to this country.  We should underline the fact that we are doing well, that we have done well, very much of it due to the efforts of those involved and equally to the major attribute we have in relation to tourism, that is, the friendliness of our people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1563" /> Let me say, of course, that I will accept that there were some areas which did not do as well as others.  Just in case the argument might be made that Dublin or the east coast were the only recipients of visitors last year, I should like to point out that friends of mine who tried to book in West Cork were unable to get a booking.  I mention west Cork because Deputy Hegarty referred to that area last night.  I should also like to refer to an interview given on 7 November on Radio Éireann by a hotelier in Gweedore.  The interviewer asked the hotelier if the season had been as bad as some people made it out to be.  The hotelier replied: &ldquo;Not at all; I do not accept that because we had a brilliant year and if next year is as good we will be quite happy&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In the tourist industry, like other industries, there are two different types of operator, those who look for the business themselves and those who expect business to come to them. Naturally, those who look for the business fill their hotels more quickly.  As far as the Department and Bord Fáilte are concerned, we did everything possible to ensure that 1979-was a good year and we will continue to develop this, our major industry.  It has been recognised as such by the Government who have added tourism to the title of my Department. The Government have also recognised that by making large sums of money available to tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty suggested that the aid to the hotel industry should be extended to aspects other than bedrooms and bathrooms.  When I introduced the Tourist Traffic Bill earlier this year I explained in detail my approach to the problems of the hotel industry.  The main problem in the last two seasons was that at certain entry points such as Dublin, Cork, Shannon and other major tourist areas like Galway and Killarney where there was great difficulty in getting bookings, <Col N="1564" /> especially during the peak season. The main objective of the grant scheme which was recently announced was to come to grips, as soon as possible, with that problem, to devise a scheme which would be flexible and easily administered so as to get new bedrooms on stream as quickly as possible, and not to make excessive demands on capital resources.  It is my belief that we have met those criteria in the new scheme.  I understand that Bord Fáilte have a big number of applications for grants under the new scheme and expect by closing date, 23 November, that sufficient development will be in prospect to meet the needs of the next few years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty also referred to facilities and amenities for tourism.  The Deputy appears to have overlooked the fact that the Tourist Traffic Act, 1979, was enacted last July and that it provided additional funds for the development of facilities.  Many of the amenities he advocated are being assisted by Bord Fáilte.  I should like to assure the Deputy that there is full liaison with the Minister for the Environment and the planning authorities to ensure the best possible standard of amenity and to ensure that we retain our appeal as an attractive and relatively pollution-free country.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Research and Standards (Amendment) Bill, 1979: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with some of the points raised during the course of the Second Stage debate on the last occasion. I concentrated mainly on the points raised by Deputy Enright about the annual allocation made to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the role of that body in dealing with the question of import substitution.  Deputy Desmond spoke about the consultancy study being undertaken and was interested to know if that would be confined to certain areas.  Earlier this year, in the light of demands now being made on the institute, and demands likely to be made in the future on the Exchequer by a major building programme which began some years ago, it was decided that the time had arrived to undertake a detailed examination of the activities of the institute in relation to the expanding needs of industrial development here over the next decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That examination is not so much concerned with the role of the institute in the context of scientific or technological development&mdash;that would be a matter in the first instance for the National Board of Science and Technology&mdash;but with its role as an instrument of industrial development.  The consultancy study <Col N="1566" /> would cover such matters as the future role and approach of the institute in meeting national needs for scientific and technological services to support industrial and related economic development, determining the implications of such future role on the requirements of institute staff, staffing policy, accommodation and facilities, organisation and finance.  It will also assess and comment on the particular role of the institute as advisers to Government Departments and local authorities and advise as to the future development of this role.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore and other Members, spoke of the role of the institute in dealing with consumer complaints.  I should like to tell the House that during 1978 the institute handled 1,198 complaints. Such was demand for this service that at one time it was necessary for the institute to refuse telephone calls for a period in order to catch up on the huge backlog.  The main product categories on such complaints were received in 1978 were clothing, footwear, floor coverings, household equipment and furniture.  A total of 29 per cent of those complaints were found to be unjustified; 21 per cent were doubtful, and that left 50 per cent found to be valid.  Of these valid complaints all but one-quarter were settled satisfactorily.  The 1,198 complaints included some 219 complaints which were referred to the IIRS by the Irish Goods Council in connection with the &ldquo;guaranteed Irish&rdquo; campaign.  Sixty per cent of these were settled, 29 per cent were not valid, 8 per cent were doubtful, 2 per cent could not be settled because the supplíer would not co-operate and 1 per cent could not be settled because firms were in liquidation.  The institute continue to play a very important role in accepting consumer complaints. Possibly a lot of pressure may be now taken from the institute with the setting up of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>The role of the institute in relation to energy was raised by a large number of Deputies.  This year the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy assigned an active and leading role in the area of energy conservation to the IIRS.  The initial <Col N="1567" /> programme proposals that the IIRS have include the setting up of a national boiler testing service to test every nondomestic sized boiler for combustion efficiency and to report on its performance to the organisation concerned.  Considerable progress has been made in this area, the service has been set up and the systematic testing of every industrial boiler has begun.  Their second proposal is the appointment of regional energy conservation officers whose work will include visits to factories, buildings and other installations to provide on-the-spot advice and to identify areas for further action.  Another proposal is the formation of four regional energy managers' associations.  The final stages of this proposal has been received and the associations are expected to commence operations early next year.  The IIRS also propose to offer support advice to the IDA which will ensure that all new industries and grant-aided industries are energy efficient in industrial processes and in factory buildings.  Discussions will continue with the IDA in this regard. They also propose to establish an energy task force to set energy consumption reduction targets for various industrial sectors.</P>
    <P>They propose to provide a building energy advisory service which would provide technical support to contractors, developers, owners/occupiers, architects and engineers in the implementation of the new thermal performance standards for building and other energy related building and construction matters.  They also propose to provide public building energy management which will be a support service to Government Departments and other agencies in the energy management of public buildings such as schools.  The IIRS will have discussions with the various Departments and with the other public agencies involved.  In relation to the production of brochures, handbooks and so on, on various aspects of energy management, the institute are holding a series of one-day seminars in 15 centres around the country on efficient boiler operation, of interest to <Col N="1568" /> boilermen, plant engineers and energy managers in industry and in the public service.  In co-operation with Bord Fáilte the IIRS are running a series of seminars on energy conservation in hotels throughout the country.  These matters will be publicised through the normal publicity channels, the television, newspapers and magazines as well as through the issue of booklets.  In view of the tremendous importance placed on conservation this year and in view of the various difficulties we had early in the year it is important that at this time of the year this service should be available and that the IIRS are the body given the responsibility for the promotion of this service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ciaran Murphy wondered about the fee fixing by the IIRS.  Under section 38 of the IIRS Act, 1961 the institute have the power to draw up their fee charging bases and to review these from time to time.  Deputy Murphy also made the point that some Deputies had visited the IIRS in Glasnevin and all of us who visited there certainly benefited from the visit.  The institute are to be commended for the tremendous hospitality they extended.  I am sure that it is inconvenient in a place such as the institute to have large numbers of visitors on the premises, but it is important for all Deputies who visit the institute to see at first hand what the institute are doing and what they are capable of doing.  Deputy Murphy also referred to the on-lying information computer services with links to international sources of information from Europe and the United States on technological processes.  One can virtually press a button to obtain the most advanced information available in the world.  This had been in operation in the IIRS for less than two years but some 38 organisations including seven industrial concerns have obtained passwords giving them access through the IIRS to the computerised information services of the European Space Agency and the British Library and this is very important to industry. The IIRS have developed an international reputation as an active information <Col N="1569" /> marketing organisation of unique character.</P>
    <P>Deputy L. Lawlor made the point that where possible the various parts of the business of the IIRS should be relocated outside of Dublin.  This is Government policy.  Where possible any agency that can survive outside of Dublin as an entity should go to the country.  The Deputy mentioned one agency which has gone to the mid-west region.  The IIRS plan to commence work early in 1980 on a western regional laboratory for concrete testing and advice on construction technology.  This building is to be in the Spiddal area of the Connemara Gaeltacht.  The laboratory will initially employ five people and will provide a very important service to builders and contractors and to industry generally in the western region.  It is important to note that this type of service was only available before from Cork or from Dublin and it is important that such a service should be provided in an area where so much building is taking place. This is something which all sides of the House will welcome.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies have portrayed the Bill as a subterfuge for the alleged inadequate funding of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  In section 2 (1), the proposal to give the IIRS an overdraft facility, it is claimed by the Opposition Deputies that this would not be needed if the present Government funding were adequate.  All of us would agree that any institute or any State agency would never get to the stage of asking for X pounds and on receiving X pounds would be happy.  That is a Utopia we can strive for, but that will never be reached.  The purpose of the Bill is to alleviate the Institute's problems arising from delays in receiving their own income from their own clients.  The IIRS set their level of services to match their Government grants plus their envisaged income.  Unless the Institute were to be wholly funded by the Government, it will have a cash flow problem from time to time, especially when there are delays in clients paying bills and there must be an income&mdash;expenditure cash flow problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1570" /> Section 2 (2) has been depicted as forcing the IIRS to mortgage their lands and buildings to buy capital equipment, which is not true.  The institute already purchase substantial amounts of capital equipment from their grant-in-aid.  The borrowing power for capital equipment is to facilitate the institute in purchasing more equipment, where this expenditure can clearly pay for itself out of the fees earned.  The rationale is clearly in line with what Deputy John Bruton put forward last March, when borrowing powers were being sought for An Foras Taluntais, on the Agriculture (An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta) Bill. The purpose of this provision is simply to give greater flexibility to the institute to meet the situation where, in the course of the year, they found that, to meet the widening needs of new industry, particular equipment was urgently needed and could be seen to pay for itself over a period.  If that equipment can be provided out of the existing allocation, the question of borrowing will not arise. If the need for the equipment had not been anticipated before the end of the previous year when the Estimates were being prepared, then the other demands for the institute's allocation would not permit them to use some of that money towards the purchasing of the new equipment needed and they would have to put in a claim for a supplementary estimate.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill give a welcome flexibility to the institute, without any loss of effective control and are not new, as has been claimed by some Opposition Deputies.  At present, the Industrial Development Authority, Córas Tráchtála, Bord lascaigh Mhara and An Foras Talúntais have borrowing powers, while the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, which services most of those organisations, and certainly provides a tremendous service for industry throughout the country, has no borrowing powers.  This Bill rectifies what we consider to be an anomalous situation.</P>
    <P>To be more specific, in section 2 (1), Deputy John Kelly queried the phrase <Col N="1571" />&mdash;and I quote: &ldquo;borrow temporarily by arrangements with bankers&rdquo;.  He claimed that this form of words was unusual and there was no precedent.  His actual words were that if there were precedents, he would like to know what they were. The same form of words appears, for example, in the following Acts: firstly, in the Sea Fisheries Act, 1962, section 20; secondly, in the Export Promotion Act, 1959, section 17; thirdly, in the Industrial Development Act, 1969, section 20.  As I have explained before, the words simply refer to short-term overdraft facilities being provided, which the IIRS have had to use since 1975 to meet their year end problems.</P>
    <P>The wording of section 2 (2) regarding capital equipment simply makes it clear that the borrowing powers are to be used where the institute's fees from a particular piece of equipment can cover the cost of the acquisition of the capital. Deputy Kelly stated that the IIRS income is only one-third of the cost of the institute, which is true, but the one-third is an average, covering 66 different services, some of which, obviously, have much more fee-earning potential than others.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with all the points raised during the course of the debate and would like, once again, to thank the many Deputies who expressed an interest in the work of the IIRS and, particularly, the facilities being provided for the institute under this Bill.  I hope that the House will accept the Bill.</P>

      <P>This is a question.  While I appreciate that the Minister has dealt with the contributions of other Deputies, she clearly evaded the issue of the question put to her concerning section 2 (2). She did quote the IDA and Bord Iascaigh Mhara as having a fund-raising capacity by legislation, but the question asked was, did they have to mortgage their assets to do so?  The answer to this question has not been forthcoming.  I would again ask if a precedent has been created here under section 2 (2) in that the IIRS has been asked to mortgage <Col N="1572" /> their fixed assets in order to raise funds for capital equipment.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that question, while the Minister touched on section 2 (1) she did not answer the question, why the Minister for Finance was not, in this instance, guaranteeing the loans raised by the IIRS.  An example of where the Minister does guarantee loans is the Agricultural Credit Corporation. In this instance, why is the Minister specifically being excluded from guaranteeing the mortgaging of the premises?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems as if we are going to keep the Dáil going today as well.  I was replying to the Second Stage debate, which was a reasonably lengthy debate and not unusually so in that the whole position of trading stamps and the regulation of them is a matter of concern to all consumers.  The point had been made by Deputy Barry Desmond that trading stamps should be prohibited rather than regulated, and most of his comments on the Bill were based on the <Col N="1575" /> fact that anyway he did not agree with trading stamps, that they should not be there and if he was in my place he would be getting rid of them.  He agreed with me that we could not discuss a lot of the points made on that basis.</P>
      <P>It has been certain for a long time that the features of the trading stamps scheme have presented most of the problems down the years.  The problems are low cash redemption value and indiscriminate alterations in exchange values in catalogues.  It is these features as distinct from the schemes themselves that have presented the problems and the desired objectives could be achieved by controlling those aspects of the business rather than going to the extreme length of prohibition itself.  All the information that we have would suggest that the consumers are disposed favourably to trading stamps.  Deputy Enright made the point that they represent a method of saving.  Consumers go to a place and buy something and get a number of stamps and they feel that this is a saving they are not making intentionally, it just happens incidentally, as it were.  The consumers are disposed favourably in particular to the redemption of stamps by goods.  The stamps provide consumers with an alternative means of obtaining some luxury items which normally would not be available to them.</P>
      <P>The provision in the Bill which makes it compulsory for a trading stamps company to redeem for cash trading stamps with an aggregate cash value of not less than £1, and particularly the provision in section 6 which enables the Minister by order to prescribe the cash redemption value of trading stamps when he feels they are too low <i>vis-à-vis</i> the redemption value of the goods, will enable the Minister to control indirectly the profit level of trading stamps companies where he feels that excessive profits are being made at the consumer's expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Enright also made the point that there is a need to ensure that only reputable firms are the promoters of trading stamps schemes.  Whether a firm who are a promoter of trading stamps <Col N="1576" /> schemes are reputable really can be assessed only after the company have commenced business.  However, section 2 of the Bill is designed specifically to ensure that only a firm in corporate form with a place of business within the State will be enabled to carry on a trading stamps promotion business.  This will ensure that proper auditing requirements and standards in relation to the firm's accounting will be maintained.  It will ensure also that the Minister can investigate their affairs if, for example, fraudulent dealings are suspected, and it will ensure also that the delicate areas of business such as loans to directors can be regulated.</P>
    <P>In addition, the general privilege provided to private companies exempting them from the requirement to annex certain documents to their annual returns is being taken away from a private company who are promoting a trading stamps scheme.  This will ensure that the buying public can have access to the essential facts about the promoters' financial state and the likelihood of their remaining solvent.  If the privileges which are conferred on private companies generally were to continue to be enjoyed by private companies engaged in a trading stamps scheme the buying public would be frustrated from having access to the essential financial facts.  One of the main purposes of making it unlawful for any person other than a company to operate a trading stamps scheme would accordingly be defeated.  As Deputy Enright suggested, it is envisaged that regular checks would be made in the companies' offices to make sure that companies involved fulfil their obligations under the Companies Act.</P>
    <P>One Deputy made the point that there is a need to ensure that stamps are not witheld unreasonably from those wishing to partake in a trading stamps scheme.  This is one of the features in the scheme in its present form that is most disturbing to consumers and to the commission as well.  Section 3 of the Bill caters specifically for this contingency.  It states explicitly what is already implicit under the Restrictive Practices Act, <Col N="1577" /> 1972, that any person who considers that trading stamps are being withheld unreasonably from him has a statutory right to have his grievance investigated by the restrictive practices machinery. Criteria for assessing that the withholding of stamps is unreasonable are laid down in the Bill.  The fixing of criteria which would be applicable universally is not possible because their determination clearly can depend so much on the circumstances of individual cases and, therefore, it will be a matter for the courts to decide.  However, the investigative machinery available under the Restrictive Practices Act enables the different circumstances of various cases to be taken fully into account.</P>
    <P>The point was also made that the alteration of catalogues and the alteration of the number of stamps required for particular goods so often by a company often meant that a consumer who had saved stamps for a certain length of time&mdash;probably it had taken a considerable number of weeks for the stamps to accumulate&mdash;in order to exchange them for the product advertised in the catalogue, on going to redeem the stamps was told at the desk, &ldquo;We are sorry, but you need X number of stamps more than you have.  The catalogue has altered in the meantime&rdquo;.  Definitely this needs to be regulated, and sections 6 and 7 of the present Bill regulate the content of the catalogues, the period of their validity and the procedure which must be gone through before their exchange values are altered.  If the worth of stamps is to be indicated in merchandise so that rational comparison can be carried out and exaggeration prevented, a prerequisite will be that adequate information in relation to the goods offered in exchange, the number of stamps for which each item will be exchanged, the name and address of the registered office of the promoter and the date on which the catalogue will cease to be valid should be available to the stamp holders.  These are essential pieces of information which are clearly of the greatest importance to the person who is collecting the stamps.</P>
    <P>In relation to the period of the validity <Col N="1578" /> of an existing catalogue this will be at least six months after the date on which the catalogue became operative.  This date will have to be announced by a promoter in at least one daily newspaper which circulates throughout the State. At least one month's notice will have to be given of a proposal to change a catalogue.</P>
    <P>A point was made that there is a need to ensure that the implied terms, such as fitness for purpose, merchantable quality and so forth, which are inherent in every contract for the sale of goods, are equally applicable to contracts involving the redemption of stamps for goods.  Section 8 of the Bill provides specifically that the implied conditions and expressed and implied warranties in every contract of sale contained in the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, will apply equally to goods redeemed for stamps as to goods purchased for monetary consideration.</P>
    <P>The point was made that it was important to educate consumers in relation to trading stamps.  I have often said in the House that it is important to educate consumers on all aspects of consumer legislation, which is what the Trading Stamps Bill would come under.  This will be a matter in the first instance for the Director of Consumer Affairs, but educating consumers in something which we all can lend a hand in.  I do not believe it can be said often enough that we should warn consumers against purchasing or becoming involved in a contract which may seem to be a bit doubtful.  This can be said about trading stamps and it can be said about all sorts of purchases consumers make at any time during the course of their lives.  You can legislate and you can bring in all sorts of legislation to protect the consumers, but you can never legislate for what the consumers will do in private matters.  Deputy Desmond made a very reasonable comment in that regard on another Bill some weeks ago.</P>
    <P>The point was made that the penalty ceiling for minor and major offences was too low and that no provision is made for continuing offences.  The Bill creates various offences, both summary and indictable, <Col N="1579" /> major and minor, and the various penalties laid down are tailored to what is a subjective assessment of the seriousness of the offences involved.  I am sure that Deputy Enright, who is a member of the legal profession, will agree with me when I say that the level of penalties included in the Bill are fairly standard for criminal legislation.  There is no reason to believe that the activities of trading stamp businesses need to be more stringently controlled.  The courts, in regard to both the Consumer Information Act and the Trading Stamps Bill, will always be aware of whether the offence involved is a second or a later offence and could within the upper limit for both summary and indictable offences impose heavier penalties at the court's discretion.  It is the Government's intention that the provisions of this Bill be strictly adhered to and that proceedings will be promptly instituted for violation of its provisions.</P>
    <P>I believe I have covered most, if not all, of the points that were discussed during the course of the Second Stage.  I would like again to thank the large number of Deputies who took part in the debate and to say that I hope the Bill will receive favourable consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the liability of the seller under the <Col N="1580" /> guarantee.  There is a problem here.  The section states:</P>
      <P>Where the seller of goods delivers a guarantee to the buyer, irrespective of when or how it is delivered, the seller shall be liable to the buyer for the observance of the terms of the guarantee as if he were the guarantor, unless he expressly indicates the contrary to the buyer at the time of delivery.</P>
      <P>This could be used as a device for escaping responsibility under the section.  The seller, by a number of devious ways, could try to get out of this.  The term &ldquo;expressly indicates&rdquo; is used.  This means that it will be both verbally expressed and in writing.  If somebody is trying to sell some product through a well thought out form of words that person may pass on some item to an unsuspecting purchaser.  I feel that the phrase &ldquo;expressly indicates&rdquo; can be used by a seller to try to escape liability.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether she intends this to be verbal or written.  Does she agree that there is a distinct possibility of some person evading his or her responsibility through some device?</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that, if matters of this nature go to court, a lot of verbal evidence will be given and there will be written evidence supplied as well. The court will construe a lot of what was discussed and will take into account things said at different times.  A person who has widespread experience in selling may be able through this particular term to escape responsibility by some type of words and get around what the Minister wants to do in this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to the wording in the section &ldquo;unless he expressly indicate the contrary to the buyer at the time of delivery&rdquo; irrespective of when or how the guarantee was delivered.  That would include either a written or an oral guarantee.  There are specific provisions to ensure that the seller need not resort to devious means to exempt himself from responsibility for the guarantee but we are not providing <Col N="1581" /> that the manufacturer or the supplier can exempt himself from his responsibilities. It would be in the seller's interest to give the undertaking in writing because this would save arguments later when the onus is on the seller.</P>

      <P>He would incorporate either the manufacturer or the supplier.  We are not referring to the retailer in this context.  We have disposed of his involvement by saying that the retailer may expressly indicate that he will not stand by any guarantee and in such circumstances the purchaser takes his case either to the manufacturer or to the supplier.  If the product concerned were manufactured in this country it would be an easy matter to go to the manufacturer, but in the case of the goods being manufactured outside the country there would obviously be a supplier here who would have to honour the terms of the guarantee and who could be reached easily by the consumer.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the exclusion of the buyer's rights under guarantee and these rights are defined as not in any way excluding or limiting the rights of the buyer at common law or pursuant to statute.  It provides, too, that every provision in a guarantee which imposes obligations on the buyer additional to his obligations under the contract shall be void.  We welcome this section because it helps to strengthen the law in this regard.  Up to now there have been clauses in guarantees that have prevented claims being allowed in court.  Line 45 refers to every provision in a guarantee which impose obligation on the buyer.  I am wondering if there are ways whereby a vendor might shun his responsibilities in this connection.  Can the Minister visualise this happening by the use of various forms of words, for instance? Let us take the case where a person expressly indicates something during the period of negotiation.  What position would arise here?  Can the vendor, by discussions or discounts or in some other way, avoid this section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Deputy spoke about the type of exclusion clauses that might be used.  The most common form of wording which purport to exclude a buyer's rights under the tort of negligence is: &ldquo;This guarantee is in lieu of and expressly excludes all liability to compensate for loss or damage however caused.&rdquo;  If those words formed part of the contract and if something went wrong causing loss or damage, the consumer had no come back.  Now, under this section no exclusion clauses can be included as part of the contract to which a buyer becomes a party.  It protects a buyer's right at common law as well.</P>

      <P>The Bill is helping to strengthen the procedures whereby the purchaser of goods is protected.  The subsection is excellent but it places the responsibility on the person who wants to bring a claim to bring an action in court.  Has the Director of Consumer Affairs any powers to get involved here so that a person can avoid the expense of having to go to court?  Could the Director of Consumer Affairs, or some person acting through the Department, help in the first instance to safeguard the rights of the purchaser of goods?  Would it be possible to include a further section <Col N="1585" /> which would enable people to avoid the expense of going to court?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs is not a public defender and therefore cannot become involved.  Under this section the only course open to a person aggrieved would be to go to the courts.  Initially in all such matters the person would try to have it worked out between himself and the seller, supplier or manufacturer.  Going to court is something that a person thinks of as a last resort.  It would not be the function of the Director of Consumer Affairs to become involved in a matter of this sort because this is a civil law measure and it is up to the consumer to make up his own mind about what he wants to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the validity in practice of what the Minister is saying. In practical terms it appears to be the final answer.  In her capacity as public representative over the years and, having dealt on many occasions with people who have purchased property and had problems, the Minister will appreciate my point.  Let us take the person in poor circumstances who has spent a considerable amount of money in purchasing some property and is faced with the problem of taking court action.  Even in regard to matters of this nature there are columns in some newspapers, and some radio programmes, which have far greater effect on the manufacturers, suppliers and sellers of goods.  &ldquo;Action Call&rdquo; is an example.  Some person who feels he has been badly done by in regard to repairs might communicate with the paper running that column and find that, through fear of being exposed for failing to provide a service, the firm will immediately have the repairs carried out or make a refund of money.  This is only one example of pressures that can be applied and all it costs the person involved is the cost of writing to some newspaper with a column such as &ldquo;Action Call&rdquo;. That gives a person a remedy which is in many cases very successful.  The point I am making is that the Director of Consumer Affairs or somebody in the <Col N="1586" /> Department could help to have genuine complaints investigated.  The Department should have powers whereby they would be able to communicate with the manufacturer or supplier in the first instance to see what type of remedy they can obtain for a person who has a grievance.  The way this is worded in the Bill at the moment leaves the person with no alternative but to go to court.  It allows people to evade their responsibilities. At the moment we do not have free legal aid to deal with the case where a person is sold defective goods.  I should like to see this section widened in order to safeguard consumers.</P>
      <P>The Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy have many resources at their disposal.  They should be able to ensure that pressure is put on manufacturers and others to carry out repairs where they are necessary.  A safeguard such as this should be incorporated in the Bill.  The Minister knows there are many ways of highlighting matters of complaint.  I have written to the Department on occasion and I know that the action of the Department in investigating complaints has rectified the matter in question.  If the Director of Consumer Affairs were given the necessary powers it would be some safeguard for the consumers. Such a provision should be incorporated in the Bill.  Many people write to newspapers when they wish to air a grievance or a complaint against a firm for failure to carry out repairs or for selling a sub-standard product.  Because of the publicity created as a result of such exposure, very often the firm in question will carry out the necessary repairs. However, for the one person who will write to the newspapers there are many others who will not because they do not want the publicity.  It should be possible for those people to have the Director of Consumer Affairs or some official from the Department act on their behalf and ensure that the matter is resolved satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>Based on a recommendation from the National Prices Commission, I approved in August last of an increase of 10.96 per cent on <Col N="1588" /> average in the consumer price of town gas in Dublin.  This price increase, which was implemented by the Alliance and Dublin Consumers Gas Company with effect from 20 August 1979 was designed to compensate the company for an increase in the cost of their principal raw material.</P>
      <P>Since June 1977 the consumer price of town gas in Dublin has increased by 55.5 per cent on average.  I should point out that the Alliance and Dublin Consumers Gas Company are in receipt of a very substantial Government subsidy and but for this fact the consumer price of town gas in Dublin would be more than 15 pence per therm dearer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on a recommendation from the National Prices Commission, I approved with effect from 1 April 1979 of an increase of 11 per cent on average in the price of school text books published by the dominant Irish text book publisher.  The increase was designed to compensate the publisher for increases incurred for raw materials, labour and overheads.  A similar increase was subsequently implemented by the smaller Irish publishers of school text books.  I understand that an increase of the order of 15 per cent has taken place in the price of imported school text books.  In addition, various rates of surcharge were imposed on top of this 15 per cent increase in imported school text books, as a result of variations in exchange rates.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive examination of the animal feedstuffs industry was carried out in 1973 by a firm of management consultants on behalf of the National Prices Commission, and the results were published as Occasional Paper No. 11. The examination did not include an investigation of the effect of port charges on animal feed prices.  Having regard to the very wide product range available in the case of animal feedstuffs, the variety of raw materials used and the variations in the proportions blended, as well as the wide range and variety of port charges, it is doubtful if such an investigation would be of benefit to the NPC in their consideration of animal feed prices.  For that reason, the National Prices Commission have not been asked to carry out a study of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since January 1975 the commission have commented on port charges in four of their monthly reports, and have referred to the desirability of an overall review of national ports policy.  The <Col N="1593" /> commission have expressed the view that a national ports policy was urgently required and that an effective ports policy would serve to improve the efficiency of our ports.</P>

That compares very unfavourably with any other port in the Community and puts industry and agriculture at a disadvantage. Will the Minister use her influence to do something about that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if, in view of the decision of the Government to sanction increases in motor vehicle insurance premiums from 1 March 1978 of 61 per cent to 80 per cent per annum, he would now set up a State-sponsored system to provide an alternative insurance cover for motorists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced that, in the circumstances of the Irish market, a State-sponsored motor insurance scheme would have the effect of reducing the rate of premium increases.</P>
      <P>There are 25 authorised motor insurers in Ireland and I recognise that one company, through the operation of market forces, has grown to hold a large part of the market for private motor insurance but the share held by many other insurers is quite significant.  I consider that the interests of the motorist are best served by trying to ensure that an open active competitive market in motor insurance is brought about.</P>
      <P>In 1978 the increases in motor insurance premiums approved were: (a) in respect of one insurer of motor cycles&mdash;18 per cent; (b) in respect of ten insurers of cars and commercial vehicles&mdash;average increases of from 5 per cent to 35 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the overall limits of the increase <Col N="1598" /> in premium income to arise in each case from these average increases, each company was allowed to vary the rates of increase as between the different sectors of its motor premium account.</P>
    <P>In 1979, the increases approved were: (a) in respect of one insurer of motor cycles&mdash;30 per cent; (b) in respect of nine insurers of cars and commercial vehicles&mdash;average increases of from 10 per cent to 26 per cent.</P>
    <P>The spreading of the average increases at varying rates between the different sectors of the companies motor premium accounts was again permitted.</P>
    <P>Because the third-party element represents the greatest risk and attracts the heaviest claims, the application of the average increases at varying rates to the different sectors resulted in increases in third party insurance higher than the overall average increases permitted to the companies.  Thus, the increases in third party rates ranged in 1978 from 5 per cent to 50 per cent and in 1979 from 10 per cent to 31.5 per cent.  Where the policy provided more than third-party cover the increases were less than the average permitted and in some cases there were decreases in respect of the rates for fire-and-theft and accidental damage.</P>
    <P>The increases approved were necessary to enable the motor insurers concerned to offset continuing and increasing losses arising on the underwriting of motor insurance risks. These losses arose directly from the continuing growth in the cost of claims which rose by 28.4 per cent in 1977 and by 41.8 per cent in 1978.  In considering the rate of increase in motor insurance premiums I regard the consumer price index as having a very limited value indeed. The increases in premium income for any year must take into account the full estimated cost of settling all claims then outstanding, or to be incurred, over the following two to five years on current policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the very considerable public concern about the relative efficiency and the underwriting practices of the motor <Col N="1599" /> vehicle insurance industry generally?  In these circumstances will the Minister agree to institute some investigation, even at departmental level, into the merits or otherwise of setting up a State-sponsored system which would give absolute security and would be infinitely more efficient and effective than the current rather questionable system we have in operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Starting a national insurance company would not ensure that premium rates would be kept to a minimum because the reason for most premium rates being so high is the cost of claims.  In the past the Minister stated publicly that he questioned the feasibility of assessing claims without juries because this would probably limit the amount of damages which would be awarded thereby keeping premiums at a low rate.  Having a national insurance company, without this being done, would not ensure that people would get lower rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, irrespective of the anomalies of the jury system of claims, if that basic reform was undertaken all the indications are that the insurance companies would proceed to- look for further massive increases?  When one contrasts the operations of the industry with, for instance, the VHI there is a glaring deficiency and failure on their part to provide reasonable insurance for motorists at a reasonable cost.</P>

      <P>All policies now issued by life offices in Ireland are expressed in Irish pounds.  The only contracts which were expressed in sterling were those issued prior to 1960.  Following the break in parity between Irish and UK currencies most life offices have given holders of policies expressed in sterling the option of selecting between the two currencies with future premiums to be paid in the currency selected. Given the fluctuations which can arise in the value of the two currencies, the only action which I consider necessary is to ensure that, where policyholders are entitled to be paid in a particular currency, that right is not denied to them.</P>

      <P>The Buy Irish campaign is a three-year programme for the promotion of Irish goods and has a target of channelling the equivalent of an additional 3 per cent of personal consumer expenditure to Irish goods with a similar increase in industrial purchasing.  A final assessment of the effectiveness of the programme cannot therefore be made until some time after the completion of the three-year period.</P>
      <P>A review has been carried out of the operations of the programme during the first year and the results of this review indicated that the programme was progressing satisfactorily towards achieving its target.</P>
      <P>In the first year the programme aimed at creating a public awareness of the importance of buying Irish products and the quality and value for money represented by such products.  The review showed that this phase of the programme was very successful.  It is gratifying that a survey by independent consultants showed that the Guaranteed Irish symbol was practically universally recognised and that a high proportion of respondents stated that the symbol influenced their purchasing decisions.</P>
      <P>In the current year the programme has entered a second phase which involves capitalising on the awareness which has been created by persuading retailers to stock more Irish products and by encouraging manufacturers to pay more attention to the home market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures indicate that the numbers discharged have increased. That answers the first part of the Deputy's question.  A number of reasons could be given as to why that has happened. One is that the availability of employment in the economy generally has improved substantially and that has had its effect.  Also, a large number of men came to the end of their three-year enlistment period in the years 1977 and 1978. When one looks at the percentages they show a deterioration, but it is not as rapid as the actual figures would appear to indicate.  The percentage of NCOs and men discharged from the Curragh Camp on completion of their three-year period in 1976 was 24.26 per cent; in 1977, 29.06 per cent; and in 1978, 33.22 per cent.  I am not satisfied with the figures or complacent about them.  That is the very reason I initiated the recruitment campaign.  There are quite a substantial number of vacancies in the Defence Forces, which was the reason for the major recruitment campaign which got under way recently.</P>

The Deputy will accept that conditions have improved greatly over the past seven, eight or ten years.  There has been a very rapid improvement.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that during the period from 1 January 1979 to 12 October 1979 the number of armed robberies&mdash;including attempted armed robberies&mdash;and aggravated burglaries involving firearms recorded was 203.  Particulars of the value of property reported taken in the course of each of these crimes and of the amounts recovered are given in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities say that the total value of all property reported taken in armed robberies, kidnappings and aggravated burglaries involving firearms during 1978 was £2,303,686.  The corresponding figure for the period from 1 January 1979 to 12 October 1979 was £1,747,766.</P>
      <P>When the present Government took up office almost two and a half years ago they immediately set about stepping up Garda recruitment with the result that in the intervening period the strength of the force has been increased by more than 10 per cent bringing the total numbers to approximately 9,500. A further 500 men are at present being recruited which will bring the strength to the greatest ever level of 10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the increase in strength, various measures involving reorganisation <Col N="1613" /> tion of the force have been and are being implemented with a view to improving Garda efficiency.  The detective force has been increased by 300 and the assistance of the Army has been invoked to provide additional armed protection for large cash consignments in transit.  Other features include the setting up of the special task force to deal with terrorist type crimes and the provision of substantially increased technical and scientific assistance to the force.  Moreover, as a result of discussions and consultations with bank managements there has been a considerable improvement in security <Col N="1614" /> measures at bank premises.  Talks are continuing with the banks and other concerns with a view to having the position improved still further.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, in spite of all the measures that have been and continue to be taken, the level of armed robberies continues to give cause for serious concern. The situation is under continuous review with a view to seeing what additional measures can be taken to deal with this threat.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    <P>Armed robberies (including attempted armed robberies), and aggravated burglaries involving firearms during the period 1 January 1979 to 12 October 1979 (inclusive): Reported value of property taken and amounts recovered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the time is overdue for a top level review of our present security system?  I have in mind the possibility of a highly specialised grouping of the police force which would concentrate on detection and prevention of this kind of crime which is on the increase, according to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Deputy that there is room for great concern and that there are numbers of armed people in existence throughout the country who carry out armed robberies. I agree that every effort must be made at all times and that new methods must be found in an effort to combat the activities of those engaged in armed crime of this nature.  It is encouraging to see that there has been benefit from reorganisation and improved measures that have taken place in recent times. For the information of the House I give briefly one or two other figures which should be of help in getting this into its proper perspective.  In 1976 there were 185 armed robberies and in 1977 there were 298.  There was a slight decrease in 1978 when the number was down to 287 and the figure for the present year is down to 203.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I said up to 12 October. I hope that the efforts of the Garda will be more successful than they have been, and they have been quite successful. Proper consultation takes place at the highest level between myself and the Garda to see to it that new and improved <Col N="1618" /> measures can be introduced that will be of benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be slight improvement with the general trend towards more serious crime by armed groups.  Does the Minister think that the time is opportune for a review of our present methods?  There have been successes to the police but whether simple recruitment into the Garda Síochána is the only adequate answer is questionable since we are dealing with an increasingly serious situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not fair of the Deputy to say that the new measures in operation by the Garda have been only slightly successful.  Again I point out to him that in 1977, for half of which year he was in Government, the figure was almost 300 and the figure for almost ten months of this year was down to 200. That in itself is a substantial improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While knowing the number of armed robberies which when annualised do not suggest any significant reduction, is it not the case that the amount taken is running at about four times what it was prior to June 1977?  Is the Minister disturbed that the amount per robbery appears to have doubled since the Minister came into office? Drawing conclusions from that, are there any steps that he can take to combat the greater efficiency with which these robberies are being directed towards places where there are large sums of money?</P>

      <P>I did not hear it because I was in the middle of my reply to Deputy FitzGerald.  I am, as is every citizen in the country, concerned about the amount of moneys that have been taken.  Let me say again that in 1977 the amount of money taken was £.9 million whereas to date for 1979 it is not four times that amount as the Deputy suggested it was.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will recall figures given in reply to earlier questions which if I recall them correctly show that in the period immediately preceding June 1977 the average amount per annum was £600,000.  We are now talking about £2.3 million last year and a figure which at the present looks like being close to £2.3 million this year.  If that, as he says, is from a smaller amount of <Col N="1620" /> robberies, it means that the amount per robbery is running at over four times the average figure for 1976 and the first half of 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have no evidence that grave difficulty is often experienced by members of the public in contacting Garda Metropolitan Headquarters at Dublin Castle by telephone. In fact a complaint made by Deputy Mitchell on 25 September last appears to be the only one received about the matter <Col N="1625" /> in the commissioner's office over the past two years, and the difficulties which the Deputy complained of on that occasion occurred in the week preceding the Papal visit when all Garda telephones were particularly busy.  The Garda authorities are aware of course that, apart from any delays that might arise in circumstances outside the control of the Garda, some delay can arise at Garda switchboards, particularly during peak periods, but in general they consider that the available telephone facilities at Dublin Castle are reasonably adequate for current Garda needs.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it is recognised that, by reference to expected future needs improvements in the Garda telephone facilities in the Dublin Metropolitan Area are desirable and certain plans to secure such improvements are at present under examination in consultation with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.

The jury added that they regarded the death as suicide.</P>

      <P>I understand that the person in question was arrested late in the evening, at about 9.45 p.m., and taken to the station and that the gardaí there arranged a visit to him that night by a friend and gave him also the facility of making a trunk telephone call to a relative.  There is no suggestion that the man was ill-treated in any way or that he was treated with anything but courtesy. In fairness I should say that neither is there any suggestion of his having misbehaved in any way at the station.  I understand that his relatives were represented legally at the inquest.  His wife was present at the inquest along with those who had been in his company shortly before his arrest.  These people gave evidence and evidence was given also by the various gardaí, including all those members who had any contact with the man from the time of his arrest until he was found hanged.  The solicitor for the relatives asked a number of questions which were answered apparently to his satisfaction.  A full account of all the circumstances was given, therefore, to the jury by way of sworn evidence.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That Section 18 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we reported progress I was dealing with subsection 2 which reads:</P>
      <P>(2)  A provision in a guarantee which purports to make the guarantor or any person acting on his behalf the sole authority to decide whether goods are defective or whether the buyer is otherwise entitled to present a claim shall be void.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is an excellent piece of legislation but what concerns me in relation to it in general and in relation to this subsection in particular is that we are letting <Col N="1640" /> pass an opportunity of legislating in a way that would avoid the necessity of all these cases coming before the District or Circuit Court.  The ordinary man in the street is anxious to avoid if possible the cost of going to court.  As I said earlier, there is no civil legal aid available for matters such as this.  This means that a person bringing forward a case is taking the risk of losing the case and of having to cover the expenses.  We should be trying here to bring about a situation in which some person such as the Director of Consumer Affairs, would act as an arbiter on matters arising in connection with the sale of goods.</P>
    <P>There are a number of examples that we could follow in this regard.  For instance, there is provision for an arbiter in respect of redundancy payments.  If there were similar provision in this Bill, a person who still held a grievance after the arbiter's decision would have redress to the Circuit Court.  That would be a desirable situation.  The only way in which people who have grievances in regard to goods purchased can draw attention to their situation is by writing to the newspapers, to the Department or to their Dáil Deputies.  In other words, there is no real redress for them.</P>
    <P>The area of the building societies is one in which there is provision also for an arbitrator.  The Register acts in this capacity in the event of disputes.  In regard to redundancy cases, a full court hearing is not involved but there is provision for a full hearing to be held with the person concerned being entitled to legal representation.  The employer, too, is entitled to be represented legally.  The whole process is quite a simple matter, regardless of whether there is legal representation.  There is a full hearing of the case, a decision is made and an award granted which is binding legally. Because these hearings are informal, there are absent some of the features which might be offputting for individuals in a more formal court hearing.  They are not as nervous going into them but nevertheless they achieve the ultimate aim of getting grievances heard, sorted out and finalised.  Here there is an opportunity to provide a similar remedy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1641" /> All we are doing now is leaving a situation where the only remedy a person has is to go to court.  This will lead to a considerable amount of additional litigation and our courts are slow enough at present without having this further legislation thrust upon them.  We can appoint more judges if that is what the Government desire but I am concerned about the interests of the consumer.  The vast majority of consumers are shy about going to court and when looking for redress they take an easier course of action such as writing to newspapers.  It is good that such a remedy is available. While this is good and desirable it is not sufficient and we should certainly have this further redress whereby an aggrieved person can go before somebody such as the Director of Consumer Affairs who would have the power to hear witnesses, take evidence and make decisions which would be binding and all of which would be subject to appeal if either party were not satisfied at that stage.</P>

      <P>In this section we are dealing with guarantees and we could talk for a month about the points Deputy Enright is making.  It is one of the things I am very conscious of.  There is a tremendously slow process that the ordinary consumer in the street has to go through in order to get his rights under our court system.  Discussions are in progress between officials of my Department and of the Department of Justice to see if we can arrive at some sort of system of small claims courts to deal with these claims in a non-court atmosphere so that hearings would be held on a regular basis and people can present <Col N="1642" /> their cases more easily.  We could talk about the merits or demerits of that. Subsection (2) is more or less saying that no man can be a judge in his own case. We are correcting the law as it was up to now when the supplier or seller could include a provision in a guarantee that he would be the person who would decide on the merits of a case if something went wrong.  It was up to him to say whether it was dangerous or defective and so on.  In that way he had the opportunity to get out of his responsibilities to the consumer. In this subsection we are making sure that cannot happen and that is something that all of us agree with.</P>

      <P>Would it not be possible at this stage to include the provision I am speaking about?  I accept the Minister's good will on it but what will happen here is that we will pass this section and this Bill and it will become law. Then at a later stage in order to encompass the points we are discussing now we will have to introduce amending legislation which will take time.  A lot of people will have to suffer the teething troubles of this legislation and they should not be asked to do that until after discussions are finalised between the Minister's Department and the Department of Justice.  Now is the time for discussions. These matters should be dealt with now and put into this legislation. What I am suggesting would be relatively simple.  There are numerous examples of powers appropriate to this type of case.  All we are doing here is throwing the situation back to where people will have to take their chance in court.  In this instance we should be endeavouring to appoint a Director of Consumer Affairs who would act as an arbitrator and after he has decided in a relatively inexpensive process a person can, if he is still aggrieved, take his case to court at that stage.</P>

      <P>In this subsection, &ldquo;buyer&rdquo; includes all persons who acquire title to the goods within the duration of the guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things that interests me is the period of the duration of the guarantee. <Col N="1644" /> Let us take the example of a television.  If somebody buys a television and discovers something is wrong with the colour and brings it back to have it repaired it may be going back and forth from the supplier to the manufacturer and so on for a number of months.  At some stage the person who has purchased the television set suddenly realises that the period of the guarantee&mdash;12 months is normal&mdash;has expired while the repairs were being carried out. Is the period of the guarantee suspended while the television set is with the manufacturer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me give an example. I have seen cases where a person purchases an item and leaves it back to have some small repairs carried out.  In the meantime the person finds that the period of guarantee has run out while the item is with the manufacturer and at the end of 12 months he finds that he has been led up the garden path.  When he gets the item back the guarantee period has elapsed and he cannot take any action in the matter.  Will the Minister consider this matter and try to ensure that people are not caught in such a situation?</P>

      <P>As I understand it, the situation envisaged by the Deputy where a person buys a television set with a year's guarantee and where he is being put off, he would be covered under that section.  I should imagine that the most common item a person would get rid of within the guarantee period would be a car.  If a person buys a car with a six months' warranty or guarantee and if he sells it to another person after three months, that second person would have the same rights as if he had bought it in the first case.  On the point made by the Deputy with regard to a television set, my understanding of the section is that although the repairs took longer than the guarantee period they would be included under the guarantee in that they came to the notice of the manufacturer within the guarantee <Col N="1645" /> period and they were not repaired by him as they should have been.  In other words, the manufacturer would lose out if he decided not to repair them until after the guarantee period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point made by the Minister to some extent. However, I am concerned that there is no built-in protection to ensure that the consumer is safeguarded for the period the item in question is with the manufacturer.</P>

      <P>It may be necessary to insert a clause to cover that situation.  I am sure the Minister is aware that during the years manufacturers have tried to avoid carrying out repairs.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>

      <P>In page 11, line 23, to delete &ldquo;after the lapse of a reasonable time&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;without good and sufficient reason&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section amends section 35 of the 1893 Act by extending the time-limit before a buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods.  The advantage thereby given to the buyer is that prior to acceptance of the goods, breach of the implied terms can, where appropriate, be treated as breach of condition with the right of rescission, whereas after acceptance it must be treated as breach of warranty when the right to rescind the contract is lost.  Acceptance is deemed to have occurred when, <i>inter alia</i>, &ldquo;after the lapse of a reasonable time he retains the goods without intimating to the seller that he has rejected them&rdquo;.  A United Kingdom Appeal Court decision&mdash;Lee-<i>v</i>-York Coach and Marine 1977, RTR 35&mdash;ruled that a consumer who had not &ldquo;rejected&rdquo; a defective motor car during the period of six months while attempts were being made to have it mended or to persuade the garage to acknowledge their legal obligations, meant that the consumer had &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; the car.  She was, therefore, unable to reject it and claim back her money.  She was entitled only to damages for breach of warranty, the cost of making it roadworthy.  It is felt that this operates against the interests of consumers and that it would improve the position if the text were amended to refer to retaining the goods &ldquo;without good and sufficient reason&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;after the lapse of a reasonable time&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 42 to 57 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the buyer deals as consumer and there is a breach of a condition by the seller which, but for this subsection, the buyer would be compelled to treat as a breach of warranty, and</P>
      <P>(b) the buyer, promptly upon discovering the breach, makes a request to the seller that he either remedy the breach or replace any goods which are not in conformity with the condition,</P>
      <P>then, if the seller refuses to comply with the request or fails to do so within a reasonable time, the buyer is entitled:</P>
      <P>(i)  to reject the goods and repudiate the contract, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> (ii)  to have the defect constituting the breach remedied elsewhere and to maintain an action against the seller for the cost thereby incurred by him.</P>
    <P>(3) The onus of proving that the buyer acted with promptness under subsection (2) shall lie on him.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is purely a drafting amendment and the meaning of the subsection will not change as a result.  The subsection contains one of the important innovations in the Bill, that is, the consumer's right to request the seller to replace defective goods and, if the seller fails to do so, to reject the goods.  However the subsection is rather long-winded&mdash;116 words in all, and is difficult to follow at present.  Since it is a measure of direct interest to the buyer, dealing as consumer, it was felt that its presentation and layout should be simplified to make it more easily understandable. This has been achieved by breaking down the subsection as shown in the amendment and creating two subsections from the existing one.</P>

Such a person obtains the goods, brings them back here when perhaps our laws would be disadvantageous to him.  If so, do I take it that it is his bad luck in those circumstances. This is something that may warrant elaboration on the part of the Minister's Department, perhaps something in the form of a booklet explaining the position as it will affect people who purchase goods outside the State and who bring them back here for sale.  The law could be very disadvantageous to such people, who could find themselves with actions being taken against them here in Ireland. Perhaps the Minister should consider the issue of some form of booklet elaborating on this and the next section. Certainly I am not clear on them myself.</P>

      <P>We decided at the very beginning that this was a very legal Bill and that there definitely would be need for the issue of a precise document by somebody, probably by the Director of Consumer Affairs, in order to educate the public on their rights under the Bill.  Naturally the sections with which they would be particularly concerned would have to be spelled out in detail.  All of the passages that would not be clear from an ordinary person's reading of the Bill would have to be explained in whatever explanatory booklet was issued after the Bill became law. That would probably take into account <Col N="1651" /> the point made by the Deputy about consumers not being clear on various parts of it.  But they cannot exclude their rights under our law by referring to their rights under the law of another country. It would prevent the parties to a contract from providing that the law of some other country which did not imply certain conditions, warranties and contracts for the sale of goods should govern the contract.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for her interest in this matter. The Act passed in England in 1973 did not affect bloodstock sales.  Some sections of the 1977 Act provided that no unfair terms be introduced in the written conditions of sale.  Some of the conditions of sale at auctions have been amended to comply with that Act.  The bloodstock industry here are afraid that a person, after making a purchase here, might try to get out of that purchase using the provisions of this Act.  Will the Minister look into this matter?</P>

      <P>These four amendments are being introduced for the same reason as that applying to the proposed amendment to section 12 (2) of the Table to section 10, implied undertakings as to title in the case of sale of goods.  It is considered to be as desirable in a hire-purchase situation as in a sale of goods, that an absolute obligation be placed on the owner of the goods involved&mdash;in the case of hire purchase this will be the hire purchase company&mdash;to disclose to the hirer any charge or encumbrance there may be on the goods.  That amendment was agreed to by the Opposition.

Section 13 deals with an implied condition, not a warranty.  This amendment is aimed at rectifying the reference to a warranty in section 34.

    <P>Section 34, as it stands at present applies the condition that the motor vehicle must be free from defects&mdash;that is under section 30 (2)&mdash;only to the dealer and not to the finance house.  Because of this, section 34 is inconsistent with section 14, since under the latter section the finance house is enjoined to the implied <Col N="1658" /> conditions contained in section 13 (2). Accordingly, it was felt that section 34 should be amended, to make the finance house, as well as the dealer, liable for breach of the implied conditions under 13 (2).</P>

      <P>I am glad that the finance house will share some responsibility. It has been a matter of some concern to me.  People have been getting very unsatisfactory motor cars and have been able to obtain finance without any proper investigation as to the quality of the vehicle or its suitability.  After relatively short periods, the motor car has been found to be unsatisfactory or useless.  Large instalments are due on it and the finance houses are taking action against the buyers.  Hire purchase companies have been suing them and they, in turn, have had to sue the garages, which is causing a great deal of problems.  I am glad that the hire purchase companies will have to be responsible in this manner. I would ask the Minister two questions: first, does this apply to new and second-hand cars and, secondly, is the Minister satisfied that the same responsibility will fall on the shoulders of the people who are involved in the motor trade only on the sideline and who are turning over money without really providing services, as on the highly reputable and honest dealers with established businesses?</P>

Genuine motor dealers will welcome the decision; it will ensure that those who have always given a proper service&mdash;the majority of them anyway&mdash;to the people will be enjoined with that type of dealer to whom the Deputy refers, who will also be included and will not be able to get away from providing services.

    <P>Where materials are used in the provision of a service they will normally undergo a change through the performance of the contract, for example, sand and <Col N="1661" /> cement used in the building of a wall. However, in certain contracts for services, goods supplied under the contract may not undergo a change in performance of the service, for example, where a fridge is installed.  Thus a consumer who is supplied with goods in a contract for services is in the same position as a consumer who goes out and buys them himself.  Thus, it is logical to ensure that goods so supplied are treated in the same way as goods sold and therefore, to provide that they should be of merchantable quality.

Let us take, for example, the conversion of a central heating system and a person installing a back boiler.  We have been told about cowboys and others installing those and houses being destroyed.  There are many people who believe they have the necessary skill to do work of this nature but they have not the expertise to do something technical of this nature and they may or may not use the materials.  Has the Minister any safeguards for somebody who depends on the skill of one of those people?  What safeguard have I if I get John Brown to come into my house to do a job of this nature but he does not know anything about it?  What remedy have I if he blows the side of my house into the next garden?  If I have any remedy, against whom have I got it?  Does the Minister feel it is necessary to have some type of remedy provided?  There will be an action against somebody but where do I go if a neighbour of mine has not the means to put back the side of my house, which has been blown away?</P>

      <P>The point the Deputy made about the back boiler is particularly relevant because we have <Col N="1662" /> had a lot of questions asked about the type of people who have installed back boilers.  The Minister for the Environment and my Minister have, publicly on various occasions, implored people to ensure that they only get somebody who has a perfect knowledge of what he is doing to do a job like this.  In the case of something going wrong it will be a matter for the courts to decide whether or not the person was competent to do the particular job.  If something goes wrong the consumer will have the common law remedy, damages for breach of contract. No matter how informal an agreement is reached between the Deputy and John Brown, as he mentioned, for carrying out services in return for payment, it is a contract and, therefore, the Deputy's rights will have to be protected.</P>

      <P>The reason for this drafting amendment is similar to that for the proposed amendment to section 31 (2).  In this case we want to make it clear that subsection (2) of section 37 relates only to implied terms in a contract for the supply of a service and not to a sale of goods or to a hire purchase situation.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> In page 18, line 18, to delete subsection (7).</P>
    <P>Line 18 contains subsection (7) of section 37 and states that this section is subject to section 39.  Perhaps I should discuss first the proposed deletion of section 39.  This section provides that, in the case of international contracts for services, parties to such contracts will be free to negative or vary their implied obligations under section 36 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Irish Insurance Association have objected very strongly to this section during the past few months.  They argue that it would have the effect of creating an unfavourable distortion of competition for their business.  They maintain that foreign firms selling insurance in Ireland could do so with less statutory obligations regarding their contracts than would be the case of firms selling here at home.</P>
    <P>While it was accepted that the IIA had a valid point, it was decided that the position of the exporter needed to be looked at and the broader implications of this section reviewed.  It was felt indeed that strong representations opposing a section by perhaps the major sector likely to be affected by it warranted a comprehensive reappraisal.  The same applied, it will be remembered, in the case of section 13.</P>
    <P>The original decision to include this section was prompted by a comparable provision in relation to goods at section 24 where the interests of the Irish exporter of goods are protected by not tying his hands in relation to international contracts. The fact that the importer is also freed under section 24 is not considered significant because the vast majority of cases of the importation of goods would be trade deals where the importer, as a distributor, would be answerable to the buyer for the rights conferred on the latter by the Bill.  This point is important because the protection of the exporter's position is incidental to the consumer orientation of the Bill and is justified only in so far as the consumer's position is not jeopardised.</P>
    <P>A different situation, however, is found to arise in relation to section 39. <Col N="1666" /> Primarily, it is not unusual for an Irish consumer directly to import a service as in the case of insurance agreements or contracts relating to correspondence courses.  The Bill, accordingly, is viewed as being an instrument which should provide necessary protection for the consumer in such situations in the context of a consumer measure though not necessarily in spite of the interests of the Irish exporter of services.</P>
    <P>A problem, however, arises in so far as the European Communities would be unlikely to tolerate a measure which stood as a barrier to trade by discriminating against an importer alone. Thus the first option for an amendment to section 39 was rejected.  The only remaining option then became the deletion of the section in its entirety.</P>
    <P>This amendment is justified solely on the consumer lines set out above and further supported by the following considerations: First, the UK in the Unfair Contract Terms Act of 1977 did not see fit to extend the exemption for international contracts for goods to the services situation.  Secondly, Irish companies, including insurance companies, will not be placed at a comparative disadvantage on the home market compared with their foreign competitors. This will meet the IIA point.  Thirdly, Article 5 of the EEC Draft Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations provides that in a contract the object of which is the supply of services to a person for a purpose which can be regarded as being outside his trade or profession, a choice of law made by the parties shall in no case prejudice the application of the mandatory rules of the law of the country in which that person has his habitual residence.  Fourthly, specifically on the insurance front, Article 9 of the Freedom of Services Directive provides that the insurer must comply with any mandatory provisions of the country where the risk is situated.  So if section 39 is allowed to stand this would have the effect of nullifying the intentions of this directive and the EEC Draft Convention.  Finally, considerations (3) and (4) in fact now obviate the <Col N="1667" /> need to protect the exporter in the manner originally intended.</P>

      <P>In page 19, line 4, to delete &ldquo;the Act of 1893 and this Act&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;this Part&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The significance of the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of the Act of 1893 and this Act&rdquo; is as follows: under the 1893 Act a claim may only be made for rescission of a contract where there has been a breach of a condition as opposed to a breach of a warranty.  Furthermore, under the 1893 Act a breach of a condition after the goods had been accepted only entitled the plaintiff to damages for breach of warranty.  However, under section 53 (2) of the 1893 Act, as inserted by section 21 of this Bill, a buyer may rescind for breach of condition despite the fact that acceptance has taken place provided he deals as consumer and acts promptly on discovering the breach.  The above relates to the requirements which must be satisfied before a person is entitled to rescind a contract.  However, the parliamentary draftsman felt that the word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; in section 41 of the Bill adequately covered these requirements and that therefore the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of the Act of 1893 and this Act&rdquo; were superfluous and should be deleted.  The words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Part&rdquo; relate to the provisions of section 42 (2).  It was felt that it was necessary to insert this phrase because under that section a court may declare a contract subsisting and award damages instead of rescission in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>We are not talking about advertisements at all.  We are talking about directory entries.  I will outline the type of situation that occurs. The normal procedure adopted by these individuals is that a demand notice is sent to a business often containing a proof note of a directory entry.  The receiving company is asked to check that the note is correct and to send the form back.  Immediately this has been done a letter comes back asking for payment of a certain amount of money with a large stamp on the Bill offering a substantial discount for prompt payment in the hope that the person who receives the bill will probably be a secretary or an employee of the company and will note the discount and agree that their boss or employer would like to take advantage of the discount and will therefore send back the money immediately.  Once the proof form has been returned there comes an offer of advertising space or an advertising agent calls on the firm pointing out that they have supposedly taken a place in the directory and suggesting that they should take an advertisement to get a larger space.  Very often it has been found that these directories never appear or, if they do, they appear in such a limited form that it is of no benefit to the person who has paid his money to have his name included in it.  We felt it was time to tidy up the situation because it was becoming a problem for people in business.</P>

    <P>It has been established with the parliamentary draftsman that this section was intended to relate only to unsolicited groups and directory entries as provided for in sections 44 and 45.

    <P>There were particular difficulties in having such wide scope.  It was felt that, in order to make it clear that an invoice is to be regarded as a demand for payment only in the cases of unsolicited goods and directory entries, it was necessary to relate the provisions of section 46 to the previous two sections I mentioned and not to leave it open-ended as it was.</P>

I should like to know if the Minister will set out a particular amount and, where contracts are over that amount, will they be required to be in writing?  In the old Sale of Goods Act there was provision that where contracts were more than a certain amount they had to be in writing and there had to be part payment.  The section states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by order provide, in relation to goods or services of a class specified in the order, that a contract for the sale of any such goods or the supply of any such service shall be in writing and any contract of such class which is not in writing shall be unenforceable.</P>

      <P>There is a popular belief that all contracts must be made in writing but that is an illusion and it forms no part of common law. Some contracts must, by statute, be made in writing; a bill of exchange must be in writing and a bill of sale is void unless it is in a certain form.  Contracts are made by people every day and they cannot always be written and, in fact, are not written very often.  They can be entered into by various means, the most popular being by word of mouth.  An example is the normal sale in the shop where there is a contract between the customer and the seller at the point of sale.  This section enables the Minister to provide by order, in relation to goods or services of a particular class to be specified in the order, that a contract for the sale of any such goods or the supply of such services should be in writing and that any contract that is not in writing will be unenforceable.

That is a fairly sweeping power to <Col N="1674" /> include in the Bill at this late stage.</P>
      <P>The second point that occurs to me is in regard to the examples the Minister gave of such things as bills of exchange and so on which are normally given in writing.  I accept that they have always been in writing and will continue to be in writing.

      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 22, subsection (1) (b), lines 23 and 24, to delete &ldquo;he considers that, in the public interest, such examinations are proper&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the <Col N="1675" /> Director considers that, in the public interest, such examinations are proper or the Minister so requests&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This section enables the Minister to confer additional functions on the Director of Consumer Affairs.  One of these functions under subsection (1) (b) would be that of carrying out in the public interest examinations of any practices arising out of the new provisions of the Bill.  As worded at present the initiative for such examinations would lie solely with the Director of Consumer Affairs.  However, it might well arise that the Minister, being the member of the Government with responsibility for consumer policy, might wish to have a particular practice examined. The result of such an examination might well be that further legislation might be required in order to curb a particular practice at a particular time. Therefore it is considered desirable that the Minister be in a position to ask the Director of Consumer Affairs to carry out such examinations and the amendment, as it now stands, would enable that to happen.  Of course, it must be emphasised that this would not in any way diminish the power of the director to act on his own initiative; it merely gives extra power to the Minister himself.</P>

      <P>Subsection (d) says:</P>
      <P>without prejudice to the powers or functions of any other prosecuting authority, to bring or prosecute summary proceedings for an offence under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would that encompass some of the powers I mentioned earlier?  I made the point that the initial cases might be brought and heard by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  In this instance is it being stipulated that the Minister may, by order, appoint the Director of Consumer Affairs to bring actions against third parties?  I should like the Minister <Col N="1676" /> to elaborate on this.  I want to know is the Director of Consumer Affairs being appointed as a type of arbitrator, first of all, and, if not, is the Minister considering appointing him as a prosecutor, as distinct from an arbitrator?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not considering appointing him as an arbitrator. He is a prosecutor as it is under the Act which set him up, which was the Consumer Information Act.  This section gives him extra functions attaching to this Bill in addition to those he has already under the Act which set him up in business.  The point the Deputy was making before was something on which I said we were having discussions, and we would have to have discussions with the Department of Justice to ascertain if we can get around the problem obtaining.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the duties that should be delegated to the Director of Consumer Affairs should be that along the lines of acting as an arbitrator.  I dealt with this at considerable length earlier.  Certainly this is something that should be fully considered by the Minister when making an order&mdash;that the Director of Consumer Affairs would be appointed as an arbitrator so that he would be able to hear fully in evidence cases brought by an aggrieved consumer and, after the case had been fully heard, the person could then appeal to the Circuit Court.  That should be one stipulation included in the order.</P>
      <P>The functions set out here are many and widespread in regard to matters which could be and should be investigated by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  There are a lot of sharp and shabby practices, people finding that they are being caught under contracts negotiated through sharp practice.  That is one example only.  There are many other matters that need to be reviewed.  I would hope that the Director of Consumer Affairs would be able to have these matters investigated on their being brought to his attention.  When does the Minister of State expect that the Minister will be making the order after the passage of the Bill?</P>

      <P>This section sets out details of certain properties held in trust by boards of conservators which are being transferred to the central board.  Particulars of title are set down in the Third Schedule of the Bill.  An integral part of the hatchery at Mallow, County Cork, which is being transferred, is a weir at Rosnalee which is owned by the Lismore Board of Conservators.  It is considered advisable to refer to Rosnalee weir specifically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the amendment.  On section 2 I mentioned that it was a pity that the Minister did not consider taking over the fisheries <Col N="1679" /> section of the ESB to be run by the new central board.  Fishery interests agree that anything to do with fisheries should be put under the umbrella of the Department. I cannot understand why we still have a separate fisheries section in the ESB, a concern which deals with electricity. When the ESB took over the Lee, the Shannon, the Liffey, the Crolly and the Erne they gave a guarantee to the fishermen that the stocks of salmon would not be endangered.  Even though the board have done a certain amount of good work, the time has come when the fisheries section should be taken under the umbrella of the Department.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt that the stocks in the rivers concerned have deteriorated drastically.  Figures for the Clady, the Erne and the Liffey indicate that the situation is disastrous.  One of the reasons is that we are not operating a proper hatchery policy.  There is a hatchery at Parteen on the Shannon and one on the Lee and the figures show that where a hatchery is situated salmon stocks did not deteriorate as much as they did on the Clady, the Erne and the Liffey where there is not a hatchery.  It cost the ESB roughly £250,000 to run the fisheries section and that amount could be subscribed to the Department if it was decided that the central body should take over the fisheries section of the board.  We must consider whether it would be feasible to take over that section of the board and other fishery interests. It would be easier if all fishery interests were under the Minister.  I am not anxious to convey that the ESB have not done their best but they are not the concern who should be looking after hatchery interests.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is only concerned with existing properties held by boards of conservators and ensuring that they are transferred to the central board. The specific hatcheries and weirs involved <Col N="1680" /> are set out in the section.  I suggest to the Deputy that the Parteen hatchery on the Shannon is not a good example because the ESB have a highly progressive fisheries division, one of the outstanding organisations, connected with fisheries in the world.  The skilled personnel in that division are regarded as experts and they have done a tremendous job on their own fisheries.  They spent in the region of £500,000 in restocking and they are committed to continuing that programme.  There is no reason why the central board should interfere with an organisation that is doing so well.  The section deals with existing hatcheries under boards that are being amalgamated under this legislation.  It is obvious that we must have some control over those hatcheries but the ESB operation is being run so well, the investment commitment is so strong and the personnel involved so skilled that I am certain that the fruits of the investment in financial terms and terms of personnel can be readily seen.  I do not feel warranted to interfere with an organisation that is devoted towards this development and which has shown its commitment in recent years in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the Minister in what he said about the intrinsic work of the ESB and the role the board have played in regard to fisheries. We are not saying anything against the ESB or the role they are playing. Nevertheless, there is a widespread concern that in the formulation of the Bill it was not found possible to bring under the umbrella of the central body the ESB fisheries section and other independent agencies such as the Salmon Research Trust and the fresh water research section of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is concern about the fragmentation involved.  It is felt that it would also be extremely costly.  The feeling abroad is that everybody's business in the end is nobody's business.  There are practical examples of horrific situations where a variety of agencies are responsible for fishery matters.  This was brought home to us very clearly in the situation appertaining to Lough Ennell, where we had <Col N="1681" /> the ESB, the Inland Fisheries Trust, the board of conservators, Foras Forbartha, the Department of the Environment and certain local authorities all having responsibility for safeguarding this lake. The result of such diversification of staff was that the lake died.  That is why I support my colleague in the view that it is a pity that all these agencies were not brought in under this Bill so as to avoid this duplication&mdash;to have one central authority in control.  I do not know the basic reasons for not doing so.</P>
    <P>The Minister has paid a big tribute to the ESB; no one would discount it.  There is no reason why the ESB personnel involved in fisheries could not continue to do the work they are doing but under the aegis of this Bill.  This is a pity, especially in the matter of pollution, where the Department of the Environment are so much involved.  I have adverted to Lough Ennell, but the same regrettable situation maintains in respect of my own river, the Suir, which is a very polluted river.  Here again too many agencies are involved and the board of conservators are unable to do their job.  Would the Minister, on Report Stage, see if these bodies could not be brought in under the control of the Bill?  It would tidy up the Bill and make for better organisation and effort, eliminate costs, duplication and fragmentation of the kind we are talking about now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no argument with what the Minister has said.  Deputy Treacy and I agree that the ESB have certainly done very good work as far as conservation, in particular, is concerned and as far as the hatcheries on the Lee and the Shannon were concerned.  Now is the chance to have all these bodies enjoined under the Department of Fisheries.  I can see no reason why the specialists working for the ESB the Minister refers to cannot be transferred to the Department of Fisheries and perhaps help that staff with their expertise and specialised knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures speak for themselves.  Admittedly, conservation of the estuaries and of our shores is the most important <Col N="1682" /> matter we are dealing with.  There is no doubt about that.  We probably all agree that the main reason for our declining stocks is illegal fishing, which we will be dealing with in a later section of the Bill. If you look at the figures, for instance, for the Erne, provided 14 or 15 years ago, we had 16,000 or 17,000 salmon coming up through the fish pass and this year we had something in the region of 400.  Something must be done to restock the Erne.  That the ESB have no hatchery programme on the Erne river is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the position as far as the Clady is concerned.  In 1978 133 salmon went up the Clady river.  Again, there is no hatchery policy there.  We can praise the ESB as much as we like, but they are not putting the hatchery fish into these rivers, and until restocking is done there is no point in our talking about salmon which will just not be there.  The Minister may feel that now is a bit late but serious consideration should be given to this.  If there is blame and if the Department of Fisheries are not doing their job, let it be laid on their shoulders instead of talking about three or four semi-State bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made in regard to the ESB.  I am, unfortunately, bound by the whole complex ESB legislation, which has been there for over 50 years.  These waters are vested in the ESB.  They are primarily there for generation purposes and, as an ancillary to that they are the property of the ESB for fishery purposes.  The ESB have been taking a very enlightened attitude towards fishery production and have established a fishery division within their organisation.  Frankly, their problem is what we are seeking to do in this Bill&mdash;we are back to the chicken and egg situation.  The ESB are not going to develop more hatcheries unless there is better protection.  In regard to their hatchery investment at Parteen the ESB have money losses exceeding £½ million on the Shannon estuary.  The return has been very poor and has not justified the investment because of piracy of salmon in the Shannon estuary by illegal fishing. <Col N="1683" /> They are not going to repeat that development on the Erne, the Clady or elsewhere unless we, through this Bill, come to grips with illegal fishing.  This applies to hatchery development throughout the country.  I welcome the notion of hatchery development.  Excellent papers have been produced and we have had all the scientific data on how they should be developed.  But, side by side with this, it will be a waste of money and of energy to think of a hatchery policy until you have a protection system.  There would be no point in developing more hatcheries if, at the end of the day, the fish are going to be illegally caught.</P>

      <P>That is precisely what I hope&mdash;that under this Bill we can so oragnise the protection and the enforcement situation that we will see some sort of management of our fisheries and, in particular, of our salmon fisheries and that that situation will then justify investment in hatcheries.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Treacy's point of pollution on the Suir, the Central Pollution Council are looking into that as a main priority and I hope that the situation will be rectified; similarly in regard to Lough Ennell.  Mistakes have been made but I understand that Lough Ennell is being rehabilitated.  There were mistakes made there in the past in regard to a local authority discharging uncontrolled sewage into the lake.  In that case it was not a plethora of bodies but one single body which made the mistake.  That situation is now being rectified.  We are not merging all the bodies, I agree, but we are taking a very large step forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>The electorate are to be divided into different panels but how does the Minister propose dealing with this panel situation?  I know he has said that it should be on the lines of the Seanad panel but I should like him to spell out how the votes for the various interests are to be divided in terms of the <Col N="1689" /> panel.  While we must endeavour not to elect too many people to each regional board, it is important that each interest is represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy on the importance of this section.  What I envisage is not set out here but will be done mainly by way of order subsequently. On the passage of this Bill I must consult with each angling organisation and fishery interest in the different regions, decide the relevant strength of each interest in each region and then decide the weighting for the votes of each panel accordingly.  Therefore, there will be a panel in respect of salmon net fishermen, of fishery owners, of trout fishermen, of sea anglers, of coarse anglers and so on.  Depending on the relevant strength of each interest in each region, the weight of the votes will be decided.</P>
      <P>In Deputy Treacy's area, for instance, the drift net salmon fishermen on the south-east coast have a very strong voice in the Lismore area where there is a very strong tradition of drift net fishing.  Consequently, the panel there would be much stronger than panels on the eastern coast where there are not the same numbers engaged in that type of fishing.  Similarly in the north Shannon area in particular there would be a strong panel representing the coarse fishing interests.  In the Mayo-Galway region the salmon and trout anglers interests would be very strong.  Salmon angling is important also in the Lismore area.  In Deputy White's area angling interests would be very strong.  I do not think there is a strong coarse fishing interest there but there is good trout fishing, so that the trout fishermen would have a strong interest there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Roughly, that is the basis on which this matter will be worked out.  It is something that will be occupying our time during the next few months and that is why I want this interim period during which I can nominate the board and set up the various panels so that by the end of next year we may have the first election for the ensuing five years.  The <Col N="1690" /> details regarding the respective panels will be set out by way of order and laid before the House in compliance with this and other sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>How many people will there be on each of the boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is being left flexible in order to accommodate more interests in some regions than in other regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disagreeing with the Minister on this but at this point he should specify the number of people who are to sit on each of the regional boards. It would be unfortunate if the boards should be too big.  Of course each of the fishing interests must have a voice on these regional boards but I would not like to see a situation in which we would have boards comprising 20 or 25 people when a more efficient board would be one comprising eight or ten people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a conflict there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>There are too many big boards that are only talking shops.  We are dealing here with the fishing industry so we must ensure that we do not end up with boards that are inefficient because of their being too big.  I suggest boards of eight or ten members.  If the situation is left flexible the Ballyshannon area could have eight members while the Ballina area could have 15 members and the Lismore-Waterford area could have 20 members.  Naturally, the drift net men in the Waterford area are entitled to more seats on the board than would be the case for their counterpart in some other areas, but I am concerned that the weaker sections might not have proper representation.  It is imperative that each of the many interests involved in fishing have a voice on the boards.  Having said that, I would consider big boards to be inefficient.  However, can the Minister say how many people he envisages being on the boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not decided yet on the numbers but in order to have all <Col N="1691" /> interests represented we would be thinking in terms of boards approaching 20 in membership.</P>
      <P>As a counterpoint to what Deputy White has said, these new boards will operate rather like county councils operate <i>vis-à-vis</i> the managers.  The key people will be the chief executives of each of the regional boards.  We hope that these will be well paid, professional people who are secure in their jobs and free from influences and who would have a properly structured staff comprising people who also are independent, professional and properly trained.  This would be similar to a county council staff <i>vis-à-vis</i> the council.  County councils have their advisory and consultative functions <i>vis-à-vis</i> county managers.  I would envisage a similar situation between the representatives of the new board and the professional staff.</P>
      <P>In that sort of situation it does not matter very much whether the board is a little bigger than it might be.  What is important is that each board is representative of all the interests involved. Perhaps I could go along with Deputy White if the board itself were in an executive position and getting the work done but I do not envisage them as such. I see them more as being in the nature of consultative and advisory bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be kind enough to elaborate a little more on the panels he envisages as representing the various categories of fishermen? How many seats does he envisage on each panel?  Are we unable to say at this stage how many people will be on the boards or how many shall be elected to each panel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are anxious to get this legislation through, but the composition of the panels and of the boards is a matter that requires difficult and sensitive consultation with the various interests concerned.  The criteria will be the strength of an interest in any area, taking into account the number of fishermen and their input into the industry.  Where <Col N="1692" /> the input is very strong there would be stronger representation on the panel for that interest.  We might have, for instance, a fairly strong grouping with four on their panel and a weaker group having two on their panel.</P>
      <P>That is the sort of thinking we want. Where one interest is twice as important as another interest in a region it would have twice as many seats for it's panel as the other group.  This will obviously take some working out and that is why I want this interim board.  It would take some months to work this out going around all the regions trying to get the interests into shape and allocating the number of seats on each panel depending on the strength of interests in the various regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">

One would be only stirring up trouble for oneself.  This is not a contentious Bill, as shown by the approach adopted on both sides of the House.  We must accommodate all interests in as sensible a way as possible.  The reason why I did not do that before bringing in the Bill was because I wanted to do that first and then settle down to this job.</P>

How much will the chief executive of each of the regional boards be paid?  How much will the secretariat be paid and what will be the salary of those who will look after conservation?  These are the people who will do all the hard work ensuring that there is no illegal fishing and so on.

      <P>Having regard to what the Minister has said pertaining to staff, I avail of this opportunity on this section to appeal earnestly again to the Minister to be as generous as possible with the staff he is obliged to transfer from Dublin to Galway.  The Minister will be aware of the early anxiety and distress experienced by the staff of the Inland Fisheries Trust on hearing of this radical change.  He will be aware also of the discomfort involved and of the financial implications for the families of the personnel concerned.  I am sure the Minister will be aware also that Galway has become recognised as the most expensive place in Ireland to build or purchase a new home or to find an old home.  All of these factors will need to be taken into account.  Therefore, the disturbance money should be of a very generous kind.</P>
      <P>I feel the Minister would do much to allay a feeling amongst the staffs concerned that there was, despite what the Minister said to me, no proper consultation and that there certainly was no agreement in respect of the transfer of those staffs from Dublin to Galway.  I would ask him to take a very personal interest in the welfare of these staffs and their families and to see to it that this transition, which is a very traumatic experience for the families concerned, is made as easy and comfortable and with the best accord possible, thereby relieving the anxiety we all know exists at present amongst the staffs concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be somewhat unwise and perhaps unfair to press the Minister unduly hard in regard to salary scales for the executive officers at this stage.  My primary concern is that the uneasiness of a serious kind which has set in arising from this transition from Dublin to Galway should be eased.  The Minister can remedy the situation and the early feeling of lack of consultation by coming <Col N="1704" /> to the rescue of these people in as generous a fashion as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. M. Cosgrove Mr. M. Cosgrove">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Cosgrove</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke earlier in this debate I said something along the lines of what Deputy Treacy has just mentioned.  I reckoned it would cost a person moving from Dublin to Galway, between selling his existing house and purchasing another, something in the region of £8,000 to £10,000.  He would also have to uproot his family and move away from the general environment to which he had become used for some years.  Most of these people have young children attending schools.  I should like to support Deputy Treacy in appealing to the Minister to be as generous as possible financially with them.  On Second Stage the Minister told me he was prepared to meet the Inland Fisheries Trust.  Could the Minister tell me whether or not he has since met them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was to meet them on Friday and I understand that they have cancelled it.  It is often not the Minister's fault in these matters; they have cancelled it for some reason or another. Anyway, I am available to meet them and will be meeting them.  In all decentralisation endeavours of this kind one meets these sorts of problems but people should be and will be treated fairly.  I agree with what Deputy Treacy has said, that of course compensation has to be given for this sort of disturbance.  Of course, in this case the field people in the trust are quite happy with the move to Galway and one can understand that. Naturally, it is largely the headquarters staff in Dublin who are raising the point. But there is no question whatever of any compulsion being involved.  I want to assure the House on that.  We will try to deal with this by way of negotiation.  Essentially it makes sense, in principle, to have a largely field organisation concerned with our rivers, fisheries, estuaries and coastland located outside Dublin.  I appreciate the personal and personnel problems involved but we will deal with those as sympathetically as we can.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 25, to delete lines 1 and 2 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;25.&mdash;Every instrument of appointment by the Central Board or a regional board of an officer or other person to be an authorised person for the purposes of Part XVIII of the Principal Act shall be&mdash;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is largely a technical amendment in regard to authorised persons.  As drafted, the appointment of an officer authorised by the central or regional board should be in writing and sealed with the board's seal.  The proposed amendment will have the effect of relating the procedure specifically to authorised persons for the purposes of Part XVIII of the Principal Act and by virtue of the proposed amendment of section 292 of the Principal Act means that specific officers can only be appointed as authorised officers. The reason for this is that the authorised officer does have certain quasi-police powers of enforcement and so on.  As the section stands all officers of the central and regional boards, including clerks and typists, in fact, everybody employed in any capacity could become an authorised officer.  That was a weakness in the Act and I want to give that power to field officers who are trained and equipped to carry out enforcement law provisions.</P>

      <P>I raised the matter of the transfer of central staff from Dublin to Galway and I asked the Minister to treat them as generously as possible.  I mentioned the alleged lack of consultations and agreement to this transfer and the Minister made the point that there was no compulsion involved.  However, if one <Col N="1707" /> reads through this section carefully one will come to a different conclusion.  I refer specifically to subsection (3) (a) (ii) which states:</P>
      <P>(ii)  require any such member or person to transfer, in such manner as is specified by the Central Board, to the service of a regional board so specified, and every such member or person shall be bound to transfer in accordance with the requirement.</P>
      <P>There is nothing very loose about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is governed by subsection (3) (a) which states that the central board may, subject to subsection (2) and section 30 (1), and following consultation with any recognised staff association or trade unions concerned carry out the transfers.  There is a protection in that introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The allegation is still contended. It can be seen in press reports from the unions concerned that in the instance of this transfer there was no proper consultation or agreement.</P>

Those posts will be advertised shortly after the passage of the Bill through the House.  I would not like to pre-empt what those people might regard as their essential requirement in those areas.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking in terms of 20 for a start and gradually increasing that number.  There is no question of all the staff in Dublin going to Galway.  We have procured the premises in Galway for the headquarters which will be near the weir at the Corrib.  Work will start there shortly.  It will be a gradual process of transfer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The headquarters staff will number 20 but there will also be field staff involved.  We cannot generalise in regard to those people because they will be deployed throughout all regions.  With the new regions established one could have them moving from one centre to another depending on the strength of board staffs in certain areas.  That has all to be worked out.  It will be a difficult job to merge the two organisations within one organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1709" /> Take the Shannon region, at the moment the number of trust staff there are very strong.  The board staff would be very strong in the south.  How you bring them together is another day's work.  Initially, the existing board staff would be primarily on protection and the trust staff primarily on development, but there may be cross-overs depending on whether there are weaknesses in particular areas.  This is the management area we are into now and I would not hazard how it would work out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

You have about 200 altogether, spread over the country, and they all have to be redeployed.  Many will be left where they are on their present duties and it will depend, area by area, how they will <Col N="1711" /> be deployed.  This is a management matter.

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not envisage many based in any particular centre.  I do not want to make too much of this transfer question.  Basically, the primary work of this type of organisation is field work and 90 or 80 per cent of the staff will be engaged in field activities, deployed all over the country.  Therefore at any time the staff at Galway headquarters will not be very large.  That is the basic office administration aspect of it and the staff will be small in number.  The primary work <Col N="1712" /> will be field work and most of the staff will be field staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <P>No, not really.  As I say, they are coming in to talk to me.  They were to have come in on Friday, but I will be meeting them next week.  I will be meeting their staff associations and we <Col N="1713" /> will work out a scheme whereby there will be a percentage retained in Dublin, by reason of Dublin continuing to be the headquarters of the Leinster region.  The likely headquarters will be the present trust headquarters.  That will enable some to be retained there so that there might not be as drastic a transfer of people as the Deputy fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is about it.  This is the point I was making all along.  I put it the last time we were discussing the matter that there was a great hullaballoo. The main transfer that would take place would be the personnel and field staff from area to area and between the trust and the various regional boards.  That would be the main issue.  The actual transfer of administrative staff from Dublin to Galway is a matter of comparative unimportance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 33 we are talking about the dissolution of the old board of conservators and I would like to clarify one point.  If we dissolve the old board of conservators and appoint the new regional board, will the voting be by postal vote and, if so, what is to stop somebody collecting 200 votes in a village and voting for a certain person? We must ensure that voting is done fairly and squarely.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>The postal vote is always open to abuse.  If we are using the postal vote we should require that the postal vote must be signed by a Garda sergeant or somebody of that calibre but, certainly not by people such as some of those who signed postal votes in the local elections.  I hope that this will be covered in the next Stage of the Bill. What happened in relation to postal voting for the old boards of conservators was that one guy took a week off work and collected all the votes, voted for everybody and got his man elected.  If we are genuine about this Bill we must ensure that the vote is fair and square.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with section 36.  Anybody genuinely interested in fisheries will be interested to see that as many fisheries as possible are taken over from the old landlords.  A number of people I met around the countryside intimated to me that they are quite willing to sell their present rights to this new central board.  I hope that when this board is set up anybody who wishes to sell his rights will be facilitated and will be given a fair amount of compensation. We should ensure that the fishing rights <Col N="1717" /> to all fisheries and rivers will eventually belong to the people.  Certain people who visited me in the last few months said that they were interested in selling their rights but that the Department of Fisheries were not interested in buying them.</P>

      <P>On Second Reading I expressed the view that the Bill did not go far enough towards national acquisition. There is a general feeling that the Bill is neither adequate nor effective in certain respects.  The intention not to take into care the hundreds of miles of potentially good rivers and streams throughout the country which are at present derelict and unproductive is a very serious defect.  I would like the Minister's comment on that.  There are large tracts of water which are derelict and whose ownership is in doubt.  Is the Minister not empowered under this Bill to acquire those waters and, if not, is this not the time to take such power?</P>
      <P>A point brought home to us by the Trout Anglers' Association is that the rights under the Bill to continue the care and maintenance of certain untitled waters is not made clear.  These untitled waters should become the property of the State and I am concerned that provision should be made in the Bill to ensure that these waters are vested in the Minister and that they will not be used by alleged owners in the future to charge for angling.  Time is running out and I wish to give the Minister time to reply on the important question of unclaimed waters which are becoming derelict and are largely unproductive and what power he has under this section to deal with that matter.  The feeling in certain important bodies is that the Minister has not taken power under this section to deal adequately with that important matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the first time we will have a management regime for aquaculture written into a later part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Treacy's point, undoubtedly we can consider this section as historic.  For the first time we have written into Irish legislation the right of acquisition of fisheries by way of either voluntary purchase or compulsion.  In addition to that we have a very important division under this section where we can acquire either voluntarily or compulsorily the rights of way to such fisheries, and that is even more important. There is not much point in acquiring a fishery unless one has the right of way and access to it.  Deputy Treacy's point is not real in this respect.  I appreciate that we have these waters without any title to them throughout the country, but we will have enough work and activity if we implement this section fully to purchase, either voluntarily or by way of compulsion, all the waters with title in the country.  We will have enough work within our own resources, financial, in personnel terms and otherwise to acquire such fisheries over the years ahead before we get down to what Deputy Treacy is seeking.</P>
      <P>We are taking a very big step forward in this section, and I do not want to get muddled into the legal areas of untitled waters.</P>

      <P>At this time I reiterate my support for the motion and say categorically that the Minister's increase in the <i>per capita</i> support for free schoolbooks for necessitous children is entirely inadequate in this day and age. Last night I outlined the substantial increase in the cost of school textbooks at both primary and secondary levels.  It is obvious from what is being said in this House that moneys devoted to this scheme are absolutely inadequate.  The direction of the scheme is wrong in that because of the moneys devoted to it it cannot possibly achieve what it is supposed to achieve.  A concentrated effort should be made by the Government over a period of, say, five years.  I realise that the moneys necessary for the scheme could not possibly be devoted to it in one year or two years, but over a five-year period there is a very good case to be made for the establishment within schools, especially second level schools, of a comprehensive library of books including a reference library in relation to the various subjects being taught in the schools.  I am disappointed that this <Col N="1720" /> Government have not made a concerted effort to establish a comprehensive library system within the schools.</P>
      <P>I stated also that I was worried about the number of printing companies supplying school texts.  It is my opinion that we are slowly getting into a situation where one, two or possibly three printing companies will have a monopolistic position in the supply of schoolbooks, and while the quantity of school books on the market at the moment is relatively satisfactory, I am worried about the possibility of a ring being established between these printing companies and that excess profits will be earned by them because of their monopolistic position in the market.  There is an obligation here on the Minister to monitor the situation in relation to the prices being charged for school textbooks.  This obviously is important to families, especially large families.</P>
      <P>Extra provision should be made in respect of the amount of moneys devoted to necessitous children from large families.  Every effort must be made to ensure that the assessment of a child's need in relation to school books is done on a discreet basis by the principal of the school.  I stated last night that in some schools this was not the case and in some schools&mdash;not many&mdash;the children felt that there was a stigma attached to being designated as in receipt of textbooks. That is to be avoided at all costs, and I am sure that the present Minister no more than any other Minister would like to see that type of system evolved in our society.</P>
      <P>I support the motion without reserve. The moneys allocated to the scheme are entirely inadequate.  A revision must be made on a comprehensive basis of the type of scheme in operation, and some concerted effort must be made to establish in schools a comprehensive and useful library at both first and second levels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the amendment to this motion, and at this stage I would like to <Col N="1721" /> read the motion once again.  The motion is:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann criticises the Minister for Education for failing to institute a review of the financing, publishing and distribution problems associated with the provision of school textbooks, in view of the widespread public dissatisfaction with the present system.</P>
      <P>The amendment is:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;welcomes the action of the Minister for Education in increasing the financial allocation for the Free Books Scheme and his initiative in expanding the publication of textbooks through Irish.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The motion was moved by Deputy Horgan, who asked for a review of the problems associated with the provision of school textbooks.  Deputy Horgan failed to give any idea of the type of review which he has in mind.  I do not think he mentioned any of the terms of reference of such a review body or who should conduct the review.  A thought that crossed my mind was that neither of the Deputies who has spoken to date on behalf of his party mentioned the NPC survey which was announced in November 1976.  They are an appropriate body to carry out reviews into prices and related matters.  This survey dealt not alone with the price of school books but with associated problems such as publication and distribution.  It explored alternative approaches which might help to reduce the cost and to improve distribution methods.  Last night the Minister for Education stated that it is suggested that buying patterns be spread more evenly over the year and advised teachers and students to purchase the books earlier.  There is no reason why this could not be organised and done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of longer printing runs and standardisation of texts was put forward, but there were many objections to it. <Col N="1722" /> Standardisation of texts could be educationally damaging.  It would make it difficult to experiment with new curricula and could be counter-productive in those terms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins has been worried about a monopoly situation arising.  In fact, the reverse is the complete case at the moment.  There is no danger of a monopoly situation in the printing and supply of textbooks.  I quote from the report of the NPC:</P>
    <P>At present there are many competitive publishers to choose from. This, in itself, acts to moderate price increases and to enable one to make some choice between price and quality.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Deputy Horgan, after talking about long September queues, went down to the doorsteps in Cork.  While I accept entirely his word that he did not initiate discussions on the doorsteps from the public down there but rather when he said that he was Labour Party spokesman views came forward, I wonder what has happened to those views. Did Deputy Horgan suggest to the people that they should take up the offer and the suggestions made by the NPC and have the comments passed on to the commission so that their useful comments might not be lost?  Was this advice offered to the people who complained? Has Deputy Collins or Deputy Horgan to date made any submissions to the NPC on the matter.</P>
    <P>All that has happened so far is a matter of finance and school texts, and I would like to deal with that.  After going through Cork in his speech last night, Deputy Horgan reached the grants-in-aid towards the cost of school books.  He commenced with the 1977 figure and referred to the 1978 figure and then questioned priorities.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I wish to go back a bit further, travel back the road to 1975 and come up to date.  I want to refer to the Appropriation Accounts for 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1978.  I do not blame the Deputies opposite for not having gone <Col N="1723" /> into those years because it is amazing when one looks up the Appropriation Accounts what material comes to light.  I would like to refer first to Vote 29, Primary Education on page 78 of the Appropriation Accounts for 1975.  The grant under subhead C7, Aid towards the cost of school books, amounted to £318,000 but the expenditure in that year was only £251,800.  This means that there was an under expenditure of £66,200 in that year.  There is an interesting footnote&mdash;this was during the period of the Coalition Government&mdash; which reads:</P>
    <P>The Estimate included provision for an increase in the rate of grant which was not subsequently sanctioned.</P>
    <P>When we have a motion dealing with free school books before the House and when we hear the spokeman for the two Opposition parties talking about finance it is no harm to repeat that footnote:</P>
    <P>The Estimate included provision for an increase in the rate of grant which was not subsequently sanctioned.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Deputy who summarises the debate might like to develop that point.  I will wait with interest to hear what is said.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to Vote 30, Primary Education for 1976 and subhead C6.  The grant in aid towards the cost of school books was £500,000 in that year, the expenditure was £224,989 leaving a massive underspending of £275,011.  One has only to think of the political mileage that was gained out of that £500,000 but I wonder did the public look behind it and consider that out of that sum of money only £224,989 was spent and there was an underspending of £275,011.  The footnote for that year reads:</P>
    <P>An increase in the rate of grant for which provision was made in the Estimate was not paid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan was not a member of the previous Government, but perhaps if somebody comes in from that august <Col N="1724" /> body in the next hour he might explain to the Deputy why this was not paid.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Deputies come to sum up this debate those two footnotes will be explained.  I have done a little research into 1975 and 1976 and I will come to 1977, which is Deputy Horgan's starting point.  I am looking for an explanation why that money was not spent in 1976.  These are policy matters. A lot of mileage was got out of the £500,000 in 1976.  A sum of £500,000 was put aside towards the cost of the school books scheme.  I ask the educational correspondents to look up their files and the headlines they used then and to tell me if they were misled and if the general public were misled.  I wonder about the sincerity of some people who come in here and shed crocodile tears about the under-privileged and the less fortunate in our society when one considers those figures and the footnotes to them.  Why was the increase in the grant in 1976 not paid?  The previous year it was not sanctioned.</P>
    <P>I will now come to 1977 and I will deal with Vote 30, Primary Education, under subhead C6.  The amount of money in that year was £250,000.  On 30 November, 1977 a Supplementary Estimate of £8,000 was introduced and this was passed on 8 December 1977. This Supplementary Estimate was for £8,000 which gave a total in the grant-in-aid for that year of £258,000.  The expenditure in that year was £256,000. This was up considerably on the 1976 figure.  There was only a sum of £2,000 underspent.  There is no footnote there because everybody knows it is very difficult to consider the number of applications that come in but one notes the timing for the introduction of the Supplementary Estimates.  It was in the momentous year of 1977 which brought about a change.</P>
    <P>In 1978, Vote 31, subhead C6 the grant in aid was £260,000, the expenditure £238,000 and the amount less than granted was £21,807.  That is an interesting figure when one compares it with 1975 and 1976, but having regard to the footnote which reads that applications <Col N="1725" /> for grants were less than expected, some explanation is called for.  I would suggest that this situation relates to the beginning of the upturn in the economic climate after the period of Coalition recession had ended, with the massive unemployment that that recession entailed, when there were huge numbers of children dependent on parents who were not working and when the need for the free book scheme was greater than was the case in 1978.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan and, I think, Deputy Collins also may have used certain financial arguments to back up their case and to endeavour to persuade the Minister for Education to adopt a certain position.  However, perhaps the next speaker from the Opposition will refer to the financial facts that I have put before the House.</P>
    <P>The National Prices Commission have held an inquiry into the price of school books.  Unlike Deputy Collins I am convinced that the competition between the publishers helps to moderate price increases.  Bulk buying by schools could help, too, to moderate increases. In addition if the purchasing were to be spread over a full school year the anxiety and the hardship on parents at September time&mdash;and I admit that there is considerable hardship and strain on some parents in that regard&mdash;would be lessened.  Many schools adopt their own distribution system of secondhand books, but we must remember that education is not static.  It is an evolving process.  The variety and quality of text books have improved tremendously.  I wonder whether we give due recognition to the expertise of the authors and designers concerned.  Some people ask why text books are not standardised and used for a long time.  On the surface that concept would seem to be fine, but we must consider it in terms of an evolving situation.  One must consider the professionalism of the individual teacher in the selection of text books, text books that stimulate and activate the children concerned and which would encourage them to be more creative.</P>
    <P>Has any Member of the House <Col N="1726" /> knowledge of any child being denied free books?</P>

      <P>That is amazing when one considers that according to the Appropriation Accounts for 1978 there was an underspending in this regard to the extent of £21,807.

Deputies were quick to point out that they were aware of this underspending, but were they aware also of the footnote which indicates that the applications for grants were less than expected?</P>

      <P>That footnote indicates a totally different pattern from the pattern for the four years to 1976.  It is good that the free book scheme is administered on the ground.  There is hardly anybody who is better equipped than a school principal in regard to knowing the problems associated with the children in his area.  I would take this opportunity of complimenting the various school principals on the manner in which they handled this scheme.  I would not accept, as Deputy Collins implied, that the whole scheme is too open, that there is a stigma attached to it.  It is handled very delicately and discreetly.  Is there any other way in which the scheme could be organised?  Can there be people better equipped to administer the scheme than those who are on the field of play, as it were?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not any child whose development is being hindered by reason of the lack of availability of school books.  But we must continue to make available a greater selection of text books for slow <Col N="1727" /> learners and handicapped children. Special attention must be paid to the difficulties and the needs of sightless children, for example.  Perhaps we could do more in the area of availing of the modern technology designed to help the less fortunate among our children.  I am confident that the Minister will move forward in this direction.</P>
    <P>Parents, too, must become more involved in the text book situation.  I have listened to recent debates in which parents have objected to a certain type of text book being available.  They seem to think that changes in text books would help in some way to change society.  I do not think that schools and primary schools in particular should be used as a means of changing society. Text books must mirror the value concepts of our society.  People expect changes sometimes from places which are not the proper sources of such change.</P>
    <P>I welcome the action of the Minister for Education in increasing the allocation for the free book scheme.  I hope that I have proved to the House that the financial allocation in this regard so far as this Minister is concerned is more honest and honourable than was the case in the years before Fianna Fáil were returned to office.  The figures that I have quoted from the Appropriation Accounts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the initiative of the Minister in regard to the expansion of the publication of text books in Irish.  Ar an ábhar sin is mian liom dul ar ais chuig ceist a chuir mé ar an Aire Oideachais, Mr. Richard Burke, nach bhfuil anseo faoi láthair linn, ar an 18 Feabhra 1976. Is í an cheist a chuir mé ar an Aire ná:</P>
    <P>an eol go bhfuil easpa leabhair léitheoireachta, nach téacsleabhair scoile iad, ann i gcás daoine óga; agus an dtabharfaidh sé ráiteas ina taobh.</P>
    <P>Is é an rud a spreag an cheist sin uaim ná cuairt a thug mé ar Foilseacháin an Rialtais san Arcade.  Ní fhaca mé go raibh téacsleabhair oiriúnach do pháistí go fluirseach ann.  Bhios ag iarraidh <Col N="1728" /> bronntanais a cheannach do pháistí, ach ní raibh siad ann romham.  Tá fhios agam, tar éis tamaill ghearr i ndiaidh na ceiste seo a chur síos, go raibh téacsleabhar go fluirseach ann.  B'fhéidir gur spreagadh duine éigin chun an rud a chur in ord.</P>
    <P>Is é an freagra a thug an tAire dom ná go raibh sé sásta go raibh lion nach beag de ábhair leitheoireachta i mBéarla agus i nGaeilge curtha ar fáil dos na bun scoileanna cheana féin trí mhéan scéimeanna éagsúla deontais agus socruithe eile.  Luaigh sé scéimeanna na leabharlanna bunscoile atá á reachtáil i gcomhar leis na húdarais áitiúla; comhoibriú le Club Leabhar na Sóisear; scéimeanna deontais d'foilsitheoirí agus do phríomhoidí chun leabhair bhreise léitheoireachta, leabhair leabharlainne agus athinsint Ghaeilge ar fhoilseacháin oiriúnacha Béarla a chur ar fáil; agus foilseacháin de chuid an Ghúim a bheadh oiriúnach do pháistí bunscoile. Mar fhocal scoir luaigh sé scéimeanna deontais chun irisí oideachasúla agus leaganacha Gaeilge de scéalta idirnáisiúnta a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Is iontach na sceimeanna iad agus tá me sásta go bhfuil Aire Oideachais ár linne ag gabháil leis na scéimeanna sin, go bhfuil leabhair oiriúnacha ann do pháistí.  Molaim do thuismitheoirí agus do mhuintir na hEireann uile, os rud é go bhfuil an Nollaig chugainn anois, cuairt a thabhairt ar Fhoilseacháin an Rialtais.  Feicfidh siad ann sár leabhair. Tá siad deas, ildathach, an-éagar orthu, agus molaim do dhaoine iad a cheannach.</P>
    <P>At the time when parents will think of the annuals which come from abroad&mdash;and I am not knocking them&mdash;let them also think that there is available through the Government Publications Office a fantastic assortment of tremendous books in Irish.  I hope the people of Ireland will rise to a &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; campaign in this regard. They will make excellent reading and wonderful presents.  It is my privilege cuidiú with the amendment of the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>I thought that the idea here in this House was that when a motion like this is put down to be discussed in a cool calm way, the result would be that the Minister would realise that everything is not well with the question of education, particularly the provision of school text books, and would carry out a review of the financing, publishing and distribution of such books.  I was rather surprised to find that instead of accepting that this was something which could be discussed here and the views of all parties and Members of the House obtained, he decided to say that everything was all right with education and that there was no necessity to do any of the things that were suggested. The last speaker even wanted to know who would carry out the review.  It was rather naive of a Member of this House to ask a question like that.  The Minister would almost certainly make a recommendation as to who would carry out the review.  I assume it would be carried out either by his officials or by a committee of the House.  Rather than do that an idea was thrown out by the Minister and, this evening, by Deputy Murphy that everything in the field of education in regard to school books was as it should be and in fact that things were better than they were in the time of the last Government.</P>
      <P>I do not know what joy it will bring to parents who are finding it difficult to buy books for their own children to be told that for some unexplained reason considerable sums of money which were made available in the years 1973 to 1976 were not expended.  While I do not want to go back over ancient history, it is only right to say that from 1968 until 1973 there was no change whatever in the grant.  In 1973 there was an upward alteration; in 1974 there was an upward alteration.  In view of those facts it sounds rather hollow when the Minister and his Deputies try to give the impression that when they arrived on the scene nothing was being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed Deputy Murphy reminds me of something rather amusing which occurreo over the last few weeks.  It was <Col N="1730" /> amusing looking at it from a certain angle but it is perhaps not so amusing to those affected by it.  When the punt was falling down, the Government told us that this was good for the economy because we were more competitive particularly with Great Britain and therefore the drop in the value of the punt as against the £ sterling was a good thing. When the punt again reached parity with sterling there was nearly a ceilí in Fianna Fáil headquarters celebrating the fact. The same thing happened in regard to school books, according to Deputy Murphy, who said that the amount of money which was allocated in 1975 and 1976 was not entirely spent and that this meant there was something wrong but in the years 1977 and 1978 when the same thing happened he said it was a proof that the country was recovering from the recession because the people were able to pay for their own children's school books.</P>
    <P>It is of interest to repeat something which the Minister just skidded over, and that was, when he came into office in 1977 £258,000 was provided for free school books and £256,000 was spent. That was fair enough.  But in 1978 all that the Minister could wangle out of his predecessor was a mere £260,000, only £2,000 more than the previous year.  In view of the inflation which occurred up to then and which has since been occurring it is ridiculous for anyone to suggest that the amount of money which has been made available for free school books is anything like meeting the demand.</P>
    <P>The question was posed to all of us, and I answered it by way of interruption during Deputy Murphy's speech, if we knew of teachers who had not given school books to children.  I and other Deputies know of teachers who were unable to provide school books for children free of charge or at a reduced price.  According to what they told me, the reason was that the Government would not give them the money.  The whole system is wrong.  Apart from the fact that there is not enough money, the usual method adopted is to find out if the family have a <Col N="1731" /> medical card.  I do not know if those who thought out this system are aware of the fact that families have medical cards for many reasons but they do not want the world to know about it.  They are entitled to keep their dignity if they feel it necessary not to disclose the fact that they have medical cards.  However, if their children want free school books or books at a reduced rate, they must disclose that fact.  I am speaking as somebody who has no teaching experience or experience of the administrative side of education.  I am talking as somebody who meets many people who are unable to pay for their children's books and who want to know what can be done for them.</P>
    <P>It is not unusual for the youngest member of a family in the month of September to ask for £9 or £10 for books. The price goes up according to the age of the children and in many cases there are five or six school-going children who must have books.  Until a week ago farm workers and their families were existing on slightly more than £50 per week&mdash;they now have somewhat less than £60&mdash;and this is not an uncommon wage in rural Ireland.  How can such families be expected to find amounts of up to £50 or £60 to pay for school books?  The situation is all the more ridiculous when it transpires that the books used in the previous year are of no use.  I heard Deputy Murphy trying to explain the thinking behind the changing of the books.  He said it broadens the mind, gives the children more interesting reading matter and so on.  That is of little use to children who cannot afford books at all, who are left for half the term without any books other than those on loan from other children.  This situation exists and I do not want anybody to say otherwise.  This is modern primary education in the Ireland of 1979.  The sooner we stop making a political football of education and of trying to score political points the better.  People sent to this House are responsible to ensure that those whom they represent get the best value possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> We know that people in third-level education suffer because of lack of funds.  Secondary education is also badly financed, although not to the same extent. Only a relatively small proportion of people reach third level education and the proportion at second level is not as high as it should be, but every child in the State should be able to go to school and receive primary education.  If the necessary facilities were provided for children they could absorb much more from their primary education.  I realise that I cannot deal with matters such as the type of schools and the classes those children attend.  We have now something that I did not think I would see in my lifetime&mdash;there are many children leaving school who are semi-literate.  That is wrong.  It is a shame on all of us and we should do something about it.</P>
    <P>I am sure somebody will say that I was a member of the previous Government and will ask why I did not do something about the matter.  First, it was not my function to deal with education and, secondly, at that time we were doing many things that needed urgently to be done.  However, when I was in Opposition before and when I was in government I felt as strongly as I feel now that primary education is not getting a fair deal.  There is no point in the Minister or backbenchers in the Government party saying that they are doing better than was the case some years ago.  That is not good enough. Now is the time to do something for those children.</P>
    <P>A few days ago I had a visit from a lady who had three children and whose husband was on social welfare benefit for quite a long time.  The children came to her with bills of £9, £12 and £15 for school books and she had not the money to pay for them.  She explained the position to the teacher, a decent person who was very anxious to help.  However, the most he could provide from the State fund was £3.50.  What is to happen in such a case?  Are the children to be left without books or has the teacher to buy the books and pay for them out of his own pocket?  This is happening.  Many <Col N="1733" /> teachers do not do this but many others pay for school books and they are unable to get the money.  This is wrong.  It is the responsibility of the Government and the Minister in charge of education to ensure that this does not continue.  If a specific case is made in this House for money for books that provision would be supported by every right thinking Deputy.  Despite the criticism of the Minister, Deputy Horgan made an excellent contribution in opening this debate.  He was quite right when he referred to secondary school children standing around in the rain every year outside bookshops looking for books. They should not have to do this.</P>
    <P>There is no reason in the world why the Department of Education should not be able to organise the provision of those books in the classrooms because every school knows the number of children likely to attend.  If the provision is made that the books will be supplied, will be sold, or whatever arrangement has to be made within the confines of the school, then those books will be bought and there will be no loss involved.  But to have people taking time off for the purpose of standing around queueing for books which may or may not be available is ridiculous.  I do not think it happens now anywhere else except in this country.  It was happening elsewhere but provision was made for the swapping of books between pupils and schools in order to prevent it.</P>
    <P>If the Department of Education are really sincere about ensuring that primary school children get the proper education to which they are entitled they should ensure that the books are retained for a period of two to three years at the very least.  This will ensure that the children themselves and their parents will take greater care of the books being used when they are bought new.  I know reference was made by the Minister to the fact that it would not work because leaves would fall out of books.  Of course they do; leaves will fall out of new books, as we all know also; people may pull out leaves accidentally or otherwise. But if a child who gets a new book is <Col N="1734" /> aware that when he or she is finished with it their younger sister or brother will be using it next year and perhaps another sister or brother the following year I am quite sure additional care will be taken of it and it will be retained in proper condition.  Books are very expensive at present.  But what happens?  Particularly coming towards the end of the school term children just do not bother about taking care of them.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which has been only very slightly touched on and one which is of very great concern, that is, the cost of other items, particularly copies, pencils, pens and all that goes with them.  I do not know whether the Minister has recently had a check made on the amount of this sort of material and the cost to the pupil.  I know it is not uncommon at present for some schools to have an all-purpose copybook, one used for everything.  The result is that over a period it is very difficult to know what exactly is going on.  The Minister, if he is really serious about it&mdash;even if he wants to do it by deciding that his officials are the people who should carry out this inquiry&mdash;will have an investigation carried out and that not merely in a few schools around this city.  I know conditions in some of them are bad.  I know also that what happens in country areas could be multiplied many times in the larger schools here in the city.  But in country areas where there are in many cases no modern schools, no heating, indeed very little bus transport to take the children to school, the people tend to become the forgotten people of education. It is the responsibility of the Minister and his Department to see that they are brought up-to-date and that the pupils are treated in the same way as those attending one of the more modern schools.</P>
    <P>Where I live there is a very modern school where every effort is made to have everything done correctly.  Not so far away from me there was an oldish school, quite a good school and in the next part of the parish to it there was a school which appeared to be quite good but, because the school-attending numbers <Col N="1735" /> were dropping there a few years ago, the Department of Education decided to close it, to transfer the children into the bigger parish school with a guarantee that there would be transport provided for them.  For some reason or another a dispute arose between the person who was running the children in there and the Department of Education.  The result has been that for several months, there has been no transport and there is no education.  Here are 47 children with no way of getting any education at all.</P>
    <P>That is just another facet of the neglect I claim is being applied to primary education in Ireland.  We must do something more than we are doing about it.  The reply which the Minister for Education gave to the proposal here yesterday evening shows that he was more interested in scoring points, more interested in proving that he was, like Caeser's wife, above suspicion in regard to the treatment of education in the country than he was in saying to the House: &ldquo;Look, everything is not perfect. I can help.  It is my job to do it and I will do it.&rdquo;  It is very easy for people to get wrapped up in the particular job they are doing and to feel that any criticism of that job is indeed a criticism of the person himself.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it very clear here that I am not criticising the Minister nor indeed the Minister of State present here this evening.  But I am criticising the system, indeed, a system which was condemned as far back as the time of Pádraig Pearse.  It has improved, but not anything like the way it should.  Here we are, after so many years of self-government, arguing in this House as to whether or not we should be able to provide the necessary money to ensure that all children in our primary schools have school books.  It is very wrong that this should be so, that the occasion should arise when we are forced into that position.  As Deputy Horgan pointed out last evening, the question of the provision of school books for everybody was considered here a few years ago.  It was estimated then that it would cost £4 <Col N="1736" /> million to provide all primary school children with free books.  We say now it cannot be done.  In a budget which is so high that £4 million is a mere grain of sand we cannot find, not alone the £4 million but a fraction of it, in order to ensure that the teachers can provide those children with books.</P>
    <P>The question of who is or should be responsible for the issue of the school books is something else which comes up for comment.  I often hear teachers who very much resent the fact that the onus is placed on them to decide who is sufficiently poor to be supplied with some assistance and who is not.  I might point out to them that particularly in country areas they are in a unique position because they know, better than anybody else, who would be entitled to them. However, they seem to think there should be some other system.  I could not suggest what system would work better than the existing one.  There may be one, but I should like to hear of it.  I know it may be extremely embarrassing, particularly to the younger teachers now becoming principal teachers in schools&mdash;something which would have been unheard of a few years ago but now we are very glad to see quite a number of very young men and women becoming principal teachers in our schools&mdash;who feel it is asking a bit much of them to decide on who should and should not get books.  They also resent very much when they have a class and they know that a considerable number&mdash;more than the 25 per cent referred to in the Minister's opening speech&mdash;require at least some assistance towards the cost of school books and then discover that they just have not got the money to give them. Very often there are unreasonable people who seem to think that the teachers who are getting money should give free books even to people who would be doubtfully entitled to them.  This makes the teachers' job very much more difficult.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the circumstances of the teacher who is asked to decide on the distribution of books to parents who have three or four children.  I know several families with eight or nine <Col N="1737" /> children still going to school and it is not hard to imagine the awful task facing the parents of those children when notes are presented to them seeking an amount of money for certain books.  In most cases it is beyond the ability of those parents to provide that money.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the future of the country depends on how our children are educated.  In the case of school books we are being very niggardly and not making much of an attempt to improve the position.  The small percentage increase announced this year was ridiculous in view of the fact that the cost of books has increased so enormously. The Minister, commenting on Deputy Horgan's statement, maintained that the cost of living had nothing to do with the price of school books.  That was a peculiar statement from a person who must know that the cost of living affecting an average worker's wage has a lot to do with what he can afford to spend on school books.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to appeal to the Minister for Education to reconsider his blank refusal to set up an investigation into this problem.  The Minister felt such an investigation was not necessary, but if it is not then nothing is necessary.  I know some school children who are picked up at 7.15 a.m. for school and do not return home until about 6 p.m. and while that situation exists surely the least the State can do for them is to ensure that if their parents are too poor to supply them with money to purchase school books those books are given to them. Many of those children must travel a long dark country road to school.  If the State does not assist the parents of those children in the purchasing of school books, in the years ahead those children will carry a grudge.  If the State does not assist them many children will leave school, as happens at present, without being able to read or write.  Those children will blame the State.  It will not be possible to dodge that statement, because we are responsible if we do not make the necessary effort to ensure that those children get all the assistance required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1738" /> Mention was made during the debate of the slightly retarded children or those who are slow learners.  What hope is there for any of those children if a teacher, instead of being able to give them extra assistance, must spend his or her time trying to allocate the school books in a class?  That such children may not be a big problem at present but it may get greater as time goes on.  The Minister mentioned that things were not as bad now as they were 40 years ago, but that is a poor argument.  Bad as schools were 40 years ago, at least all the children attending school had school books.  In 1979 we have reached the stage where the Government claim that they do not think it is necessary to have an inquiry into a better system of distributing whatever books are available to the children who need them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody will attempt to make little of the importance of school books in the lives of our children or as an aid to education.  In so far as we speak of education as being ideally afforded to all our students we must of necessity accept that text books should be available to all without any undue hardship or embarrassment. The debate on this motion has been an educated one and I do not wish to upset the tranquillity of it.  I agree with Deputy Tully as to what the correct spirit of the debate should be, that we should pool our thoughts and emerge better people than we were when we came to listen.  The Minister can speak for himself, but in his absence I want to defend him against what Deputy Tully accused him of saying about everything <Col N="1739" /> being perfection.  The Minister would be as ready as I am to agree that in respect of any human institution nobody, except a fool, would claim that everything was perfection.  I am sure the Minister did not make any such claim.</P>
    <P>Whatever imperfections there are they are not the creation of the Department of Education and they cannot be solved in their entirety by the Department.  I am at a loss to understand the approach of the Opposition, who seem to suggest that the Department should take on to itself what I regard as an authoritarian role and indicate to all what should happen.  I do not think those who contributed to the debate would suggest that the Department should supplant the managerial system we have.  They would not suggest that the Department should impose its will on the teachers who are the educationalists and indicate to them precisely what books they should buy, or that Deputy Horgan, or, indeed, Deputy Tully, would require of the Department of Education to indicate to trade unions what they should require printers to work for so that books could be made available at a cheaper price to people disposed to buy them.  They have referred to an area that provides the gap between what exists and what is perfection, and might be correct, but have given no clear indication of how the existing problems, as they see them, might be remedied.  There, I would see the spirit of the debate, as indicated by Deputy Tully, falling short of what he himself would require.  I appreciate that a speaker from the Opposition has still to make his contribution.  I would ask if perhaps he would indicate&mdash;and I confine myself to the areas to which I refer&mdash;whether the Department of State should take over entirely the question of the selection and provision of books and that neither teachers, nor boards of management, nor anybody else, would have a say in it, and whether the Department should say to the teachers &ldquo;Even though you feel, and know, that a certain book would be of great advantage to your students, you must not buy that, without consulting with the Department <Col N="1740" /> and getting their permission&rdquo;, and that they could wilfully deny a student the right to benefit from that particular book.</P>
    <P>I have the honour of administering the scheme which looks after what is described as a necessitous student, and can say, in respect of the last two years, that where it was indicated to me that there was a child who really could not buy books, we made moneys available for all those cases.  I am at a loss to understand why&mdash;because I know that he is a vigilant Deputy&mdash;if he came across such a very deserving case, he did not ask the Department and we might have been in a position to help him.  Exhortations as to the perfect state are always easy to make&mdash;I made them in opposition; I continue to make them in my daily life&mdash;but to be sincere about this, we must be more precise in indicating the specific area where improvements can be made.  Improvements are being made.  I do not want to give any litany of figures but can say, in respect of the current financial year, the rate of grants for necessitous pupils in national schools has been increased by 50 per cent.  I am not going back to what would be described as Coalition times, but as against last year.  There has been an increase of 30 per cent over the 1978 allocation for second level education. That is not, in my opinion, perfection but, having regard to the availability of resources, it is a step in the right direction; it is progress towards what we all would want.  This problem is not confined to what is described as the necessitous child.  In houses without the benefit of medical cards, or not in receipt of social welfare benefits&mdash;the middle income person&mdash;in respect of the purchase of books, the cost of books represents a considerable demand on the resources of the household.  I have applied myself to examining this problem&mdash;and did this as headmaster in my school, making submissions to the Department as to how I thought the system might be improved, even fractionally, and would hope that when Deputy Belton is making his final contribution and summing up this debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Horgan for giving me this opportunity.  I have only three minutes and do not intend to speak at any length, but there are one or two points I would like to dwell on, the method of distribution of school books in particular.  As a parent, I have a wide knowledge, having sent three or four children through school, both primary and secondary level, and think the method is entirely outdated and outmoded. The children come home with a list of books, having been told to go to some bookshop.  At that bookshop, they are lucky to obtain half of the books needed, and they go to another bookshop.  In many cases, they find some books on the list are out of print and unobtainable.  Why should any book which is out of print be included on their list?  Care should be taken beforehand that this does not happen.  The Minister for State, who is in the same constituency as myself, will have seen long queues at bookshops in Dublin all during the summer.  I have known of parents who have waited and have had to leave before they could get to the top of the queue, because the husband or some of the family would be coming in, looking for lunch.  They could spend several days in this manner.  Why could we not return to a system which was in existence 40 years ago or more, where the school got the books?  I think it was Deputy Tunney, who said earlier that they would have a fair knowledge of the books required, and all the children would have to do is hand in the list in the school and <Col N="1742" /> the money, and they would get the books.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of free books in necessitous cases, Deputy Murphy said earlier on that he thought that nobody was ever left without, but I noticed from the circular that it should be appreciated that there is necessarily a limit to the overall amount of money available to the Department for the purpose of the scheme each year.  There is a limit, and if more people apply than there is money for, naturally all will not succeed in getting the books.  I was interested to hear Deputy Tunney say that if there was a strong case made to him he would by all means do his best.  I was not aware that such discretion was given, because when the children were told that there were no more free books, that the money had been exhausted, they took it that that was it.  They did not know that if they made a special appeal there was a possibility of their getting free books even though the money had been used up.</P>
      <P>There are other things I could dwell on, but I will not delay the House, seeing that I am on borrowed time, and I thank Deputy Horgan for the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's post bag will be heavy in the coming months.  This has been a good debate and it has smoked out a few woodworms.  A number of speakers on the Government side, the Minister of State and Deputy Murphy in particular, made some play about what kind of system we would like and about what kind of review there ought to be.  The purpose of setting up a review body is to discover what needs to be done and what changes need to be made.  I have a secretary who helps me for nine hours of the week and on the basis of that kind of resource I am not in a position to tell the Minister all that is wrong with the school books distribution system.  The Minister has a fair number of civil servants in his Department and some of them would be well employed in working in co-operation with the National Prices Commission in setting up the kind of review body we have talked about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1743" /> Deputy Murphy said that text books should mirror the value concepts of our society.  That assumes that the value concepts he is talking about are shared equally throughout society.  Some values are shared but many people differ about other values.  There are strong differences between the value system of the Fianna Fáil party and of the Labour party.  The value system of the Fianna Fáil party&mdash;give to the rich, take from the poor and encourage everyone else in the belief that what comes to them by right is theirs by virtue of a system of political patronage&mdash;I would hate to see that kind of value system written into any text book.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy dwelt on the 1976 and 1978 figures and it was instructive and amusing to listen to him play with them.  In the 1976 figure the Deputy made considerable capital of the fact that a larger sum was originally voted than eventually authorised and in a falsely naive way he inquired as to the reason for this.  The Deputy did his best to exonerate me from any responsibility. However in 1976 I was a member of the Labour party, a member of the Labour group in the Seanad.  Enough sins have been hung around my shoulders in my capacity as a member of the Labour party that I do not mind another being added.  Everybody knows that in 1976 people went around looking for places where they could save money and this was one of the places.  I do not have first hand knowledge of this, but it is important in view of the need for honesty in political debate that we should admit that this kind of thing happens from time to time.  The trouble about cuts is that they produce blood, and the trouble about blood is that one cannot put it on file&mdash;unless one is a latter day St. Januarius.  I shudder to think of the amount of blood flowing in the Cabinet room at the moment that will not find its way to a file left for inspection by the next non-Fianna Fáil administration. The Deputy's approach to 1978 was hilarious, when he argued that the reason for the underspending in 1978 was <Col N="1744" /> because the economy was doing so well and that people were better off.  If we were to follow that line of argument to its logical conclusion there would be no need for any free school books scheme because everybody would be able to pay for anything they wanted.  The Deputy and the Government cannot have it both ways.  They cannot maintain that the economy is booming and at the same time sharply increase, as they did over 1978, the rate at which the free book scheme is administered.  The reason that the scheme has been increased is because it was under-financed, and it is still under-financed even after the increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a very good impression, one which is commonly given by Fianna Fáil Ministers, especially those who are members of an administration which has overtaken a previous non-Fianna Fáil administraton, of the US cavalry arriving to save the beleagured settlers.  When the dust clears we can see that it is not so much the US cavalry but a crowd of cowboys whose horses have run away with them. The Minister made some statements which put me to further examining the figures on which both he and I are basing our arguments, and I have come up with some conclusions which do the Minister even less credit than I was prepared to give him last night.  The Minister referred to the Consumer Price Index and argued that the Consumer Price Index increase did not necessarily mirror an increase in the price of school books.  In relation to poorer pupils and families, the movement of the CPI as a whole has a very direct relationship on the amount of disposable income that they have for things like school books.  It has already been satisfactorily shown by the National Economic and Social Council that at least 44 per cent of the income of poorer families is spent on food, and the three staple foods which are consumed in vast quantities by the poorer sections have gone up enormously since June 1977.  Butter went up by 23 per cent, milk by 56 per cent and bread by 47.6 per cent.  This is where the rise in the CPI cuts into the disposable <Col N="1745" /> income and makes an already inadequate grant system positively ludicrous.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a National Prices report which showed that during a certain period the price of school books relative to the average rise in consumer prices was going down in certain areas. It is extraordinary that that survey was carried out over two years ago and referred to a period between 1972-1973 and 1976-1977.  The logic of the Minister's case is that relatively speaking school books were becoming cheaper during the Coalition period.  I am surprised that the Minister did not ask one of his industrious civil servants to ring up the National Prices Commission to ask if anything had happened since the survey.  I rang the National Prices Commission; they only have one company, the Educational Company, under their general oversight, and within the last year the prices for school books published by that company have been allowed to rise by 11 per cent.  At the very least that figure is equivalent to the rise in inflation over the same period. The price of school books, relatively speaking, was going down during the Coalition period and going up during the Minister's period.</P>
    <P>Other speakers pointed out that the free school books scheme goes back to 1968.  If we look at the period between 1968 and 1979 we find that Fianna Fáil had been in office for seven of those 11 years and that if blame is to be distributed for the under-financing of this system, seven elevenths of it should be apportioned to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Much play was made of the increases of 50 per cent in the rate for primary school books over last year, and 35 per cent for second level books.  Every increase is welcome, but the real question is, what is the increase worth, not over <Col N="1746" /> last year, but since the last time that an increase was made in the rate and the amount of the grant.  That gives a very different answer indeed.</P>
    <P>In the national understanding the Government are committed to paying more for education, particularly primary education.  If we are to take the sums that have been given to us by the speakers on the far side it is obvious that the amount of extra money this year that will be given to primary education, for example in the free school books scheme, will amount to not much more than one million pounds.  That is money that would not have been given but for the commitment of the national understanding. That is less than half of one per cent of the total education budget. This does not represent an adequate response in terms of the undertaking given in the national understanding, and I would be surprised if the trade union movement thought so.  It is time for us to stop bandying figures.  We should admit that the truth is&mdash;and the only speaker on the far side who even hinted at it was Deputy Tunney&mdash;that they cannot afford any more.  There was a time in the hungry thirties when the Fianna Fáil party might have found it in their hearts to afford more, but in the sleek and comfortable seventies they find it impossible.</P>
    <P>Now we have to look realistically at the situation and ask whether the education that we must believe is every child's birthright also includes the right to an adequate supply of school books, and, if school books have to be given out to some on a free basis and not to others, then at the very least the right to a system that does not have within it the seeds of discrimination and shame for the unfortunate children who have to undergo it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the special provisions, if any, in existence to ensure that individuals who have bought out their ground rent and who are pursuing the registration of such property can do so without undue <Col N="1628" /> expense and without essential recourse to solicitors or the legal profession, and, if not, the proposals, if any, to introduce such provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to be suggested in the question that special provision in regard to registration of property ought to be made for the benefit of one category of persons, namely, those who have bought out their ground rents.  If that is intended, I do not think I could agree with it as I believe that, in principle, similar facilities should be available to all.  That point apart, the answer to the question is that persons who have bought out their ground rents under the 1978 No. 2 Ground Rents Act can register the vesting certificate, either in the Registry of Deeds or in the Land Registry, without undue expense.  The registration fee in the Registry of Deeds is £4.  The fees in the Land Registry may vary somewhat depending on the value of the property and depending also on whether the leasehold interest was previously registered&mdash;the average registration fee to date has been £3.50.  The administrative arrangements for registration have been kept as simple as possible. The question of retaining a solicitor in such a transaction is, of course, one for the applicant himself but it is not mandatory nor in normal circumstances would it be essential in practical terms.</P>
      <P>As far as registration in the Registry of Deeds is concerned, a duplicate of the vesting certificate is accepted in lieu of a memorial and in order to facilitate the ground rent purchaser the duplicate is supplied to him with the original vesting certificate by the Ground Rents Section of the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>The general requirements for registration in the Land Registry are set out in the Land Registration Rules, 1972.</P>

      <P>I have seen some recent press reports which, in fairness, were not very clear but which appear to have been dealing with the matter to which the Deputy refers.  Apart from these reports I have no knowledge of these matters.  In any event I have no proposals for legislation which would prohibit mortgagees from assuming responsibility for payment of ground rent to landlords where the mortgagor-tenant withholds payment.  Indeed, I should like to make it quite clear that I reject the implication of the question that the State should take measures, whether by legislation or otherwise, in support of lessees who are withholding payment of ground rent.  The Government's considered response to the ground rents problem is reflected in two Acts that were passed during 1978, that is, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978, and the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, and the Government have no further proposals for legislation in this area.</P>

      <P>While it is not normal practice to give information about the affairs of individual prisoners, in view of the inaccurate and misleading publicity that this incident has received, publicity for which the prisoner must himself have been in part responsible, I consider that I ought to say something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1630" /> On the 24 October 1979 the prisoner, who was on remand on serious charges, was put in a cell in the base which, <i>inter alia,</i> is used as a separation area for prisoners who are being disruptive.  This followed a series of incidents involving misconduct on his part, the last of them being one in which he had been responsible for milk being spilled over an officer's uniform.  Later that day he inflicted serious lacerations to both hands and both arms by pushing his hands through panes of glass in his cell window.  He was immediately transferred to the Mater Hospital where he received treatment and was detained as an in-patient.</P>
    <P>He attempted to escape from the Mater Hospital on the evening of 26 October 1979 but was recaptured in the hospital grounds and was returned to Mountjoy Prison.  There is evidence that he was in collusion with persons outside the prison in planning his escape.</P>
    <P>On his return to Mountjoy Prison he was placed in a safe or padded cell in the hospital wing.  He was hysterical and aggressive and the fear was that he would harm himself further.  On the morning of 27 October he was examined by the doctor.  The prisoner was still very aggressive and the doctor directed that he be removed to a safe or padded cell in the base where he remained until 30 October. He has since settled down and apologised for his conduct.</P>
    <P>He was sentenced to seven years penal servitude on 1 November.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's attention is drawn to the reply given on 9 May last to a similar question from Deputy Deasy.  While the matter remains a cause for concern, I understand that the situation in regard to human rights generally has been improving of late and that a call for a halt to all executions has recently <Col N="1631" /> been made by Ayatollah Khomeini.  It would appear that the Government in Iran have not yet succeeded in exercising their full authority over all areas of national life and certain activities and functions continue to be carried out by local committees not subject to central government control.  The Deputy will appreciate that, pending the full centralisation of governmental jurisdiction, approaches to the authorities in regard to infringements of human rights would be of limited effectiveness and could in some cases be counter-productive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of the Acts referred to in the Deputy's question reflect the generally accepted concept in public international law of limited immunity so that a State would be entitled to claim immunity only in relation to those actions pertaining to its sovereignty; the domestic courts would, therefore, be able to exercise their jurisdiction in relation to the commercial activities of a state.  However, enforcement of judgments in relation to the commercial activities of a State has not as yet been generally accepted by the international community of states.  British and American legislation confirm the concept of restricting immunity to acts done in the exercise of sovereign powers. They specifically define the activities to be considered as commercial.  Here it would ultimately be for the courts to decide this issue.  The British and American legislation provide not only that there shall be no immunity from suit in respect of commercial activities but also allow enforcement of judgment in all but a limited number of these cases. In the latter aspect they are therefore in advance of current international law. Given the current state of public international law, any legislation introduced here could only confirm the general principles as they exist at present.  The Government are of course keeping the situation under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The range of services provided specifically for the blind consists of special education, vocational training and placement, home visiting and home craft training, blind pensions and supplementary blind welfare allowances and accommodation in special homes.  Not all of these services are my responsibility. The services are kept under review to ensure that they are adequate. For example, a special advisory committee on training and employment opportunities for the blind has been established under the auspices of the National Rehabilitation Board and an inter-departmental committee recently reported to the Minister for Education on future educational arrangements for visually handicapped children.</P>
      <P>I might add that subject to the normal eligibility provisions blind persons are of course also eligible for the full range of health services available to the general public.</P>

      <P>The main conditions of eligibility for a grant by a health board to a disabled person towards the cost of motor vehicles are as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the car is essential for the person to earn a living;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the disability impedes him in the use of public transport;</P>
      <P>&mdash;he holds a full driving licence;</P>

      <P>The total number of field officers newly assigned to the Farm Development Service during the past year was 78.

The net increase in staff numbers was 63 making a total of 457.</P>

    <P>The names of candidates who were successful at the recent Civil Service <Col N="1638" /> Commission competition for appointment as agricultural officer are now coming to hand.

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already explained (Dáil Debates for 27 April 1978, Volume 305 No. 11, col. 1709), it would be impossible for me, having regard to the range of possible questions, to undertake to indicate at <Col N="1639" /> Question Time what legislation I may or may not be introducing.  In this particular case, because of the nature of the suggestion made, I think it right to say that it is clear that there are very important considerations to be taken into account other than those mentioned in the question.</P>
