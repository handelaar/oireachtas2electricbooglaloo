    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in relation to section 16 of the Bill.  This resolution modifies the existing provisions relating to relief for losses incurred in a trade or profession. The restrictive aspect of section 16 is to deny relief in respect of losses incurred (a) in the occupation of woodlands and (b) in relation to stud fees.  Profits arising from these activities are exempt from tax and, therefore, it is anomalous to allow losses incurred in the activities to be set against other income.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That section 308 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, be amended by the insertion of the following proviso:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that no deduction or set off shall be allowed in respect of a loss sustained in the year 1979-80 or in any subsequent year of assessment.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to relief for losses in respect of a person carrying on two or more trades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 308 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 to which this financial resolution refers states:</P>
      <P>A person who carries on, either solely or in partnership, two or more distinct trades the profits of which are chargeable under Schedule D may deduct from or set off against the profits as computed under this Act in respect of one or more such trades, the loss so computed sustained in any other such trade, and may make separate statements as to each such trade.</P>
      <P>This financial resolution seems to amend section 308 because it states:</P>
      <P>Provided that no deduction or set off shall be allowed in respect of a loss sustained in the year 1979-80 or in any subsequent year of assessment.</P>
      <P>That has the effect of negativing section 308 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that this would bring an end to the relief under section 308 but the relief would be available then under section 307.  Section 308 permitted a person carrying on two or more trades to set off a loss incurred in one trade against the profits of another trade.  The application <Col N="718" /> of the commencing provisions enabled a loss to be set off for more than one year of assessment so that excessive relief was obtained, that is, relief greater than the amount of the loss.  This will no longer be the position.  Full relief, and in some circumstances at an earlier stage, will be available under section 307 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 which is amended by section 16 of this Bill.</P>

The House will recall that the income limit was set at £944 by section 1 of the Finance Act, 1978.  In the course of the debate on that Act I stated that I was considering bringing in a general rule which would not need to be revised by new legislation every year. Section 1 sets out this general rule so that automatically the relief provided for will apply to whatever is the appropriate rate without the necessity for amendment each year.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with that.  I see the thinking behind it.  It makes the Finance Bill somewhat neater. At the same time, I wonder if we should not be a little cautious about this.  I tried to find out why this was not done years ago but nobody could tell me.  A guess was made that there was a fear at the time that some future Minister for Finance might decide to lower income tax&mdash;this happened once before&mdash;and to lower old age pensions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be slightly misinformed in this regard. There was an automatic provision of this kind operating up to last year but at that time the limit related to the non-contributory pension.  Last year I provided for an increase in the limit to the contributory pension, but it was not possible at that time to have this automatic rule incorporated.  All the section did last year was to relate to the specific figure, but I indicated that I would examine the possibility of having <Col N="723" /> it applied automatically.  That is what we are doing in this section.  The difference is that the allowance is now automatically at the contributory pension level, rather than the non-contributory pension level.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment will be quite obvious.  It is to give effect to indexation in the tax bands.  There has been much resentment since the budget about the payment of tax and despite the fact that allowances were given in the budget many people still feel they are not being fairly treated under the PAYE system.  When the budget was first announced this point did not quite sink in. In speaking during the budget debate on 7 February I said that when the small print came to be read people would resent moving into a higher tax band £400 earlier because of the abolition of the 20 per cent band.</P>
    <P>Last year there was a similar section in the Finance Bill and I moved an amendment seeking to have the bands indexed.  The Minister turned down this amendment, despite the fact that in 1974 while in Opposition he moved an amendment during Private Members' Time <Col N="724" /> seeking indexation of the tax bands and tax allowance.  He has not put into effect the proposition he then put forward. The amendment I tabled last year was defeated because of the division of seats in this House, yet within a few months the Minister introduced the capital gains tax and the concept of indexation.  Those who receive forms of payment through capital gains now have the benefit of indexation, but the ordinary person earning a weekly or monthly wage or salary does not have this benefit.  Resentment of this fact is still seething under the surface and, unless we want politics conducted on the streets, this House must recognise the sense of grievance felt by people.  We will build up trouble for ourselves in the future unless we take the opportunity to show PAYE taxpayers, who rightly consider themselves the major pillar on which the structure of the State is held, that they are fairly treated under the tax system.  It is in an effort to show that they are fairly treated that I have introduced this amendment.  Indexation is available to those who receive money through capital gains and there must be some recognition that inflation has the effect of moving people into higher tax bands earlier than might normally be the case.</P>
    <P>The lack of indexation and the foolish abolition of 20 per cent band make it extremely difficult to get the cooperation which the Minister is seeking in regard to the national understanding. I agree that some form of wage restraint is necessary during the next 18 months so that we will be able to see the way ahead and plan the economy.  I hope the understanding will not be turned down, but if it is rejected the people voting against it will be ordinary taxpayers impelled by their resentment regarding tax. I know there is a section in the national understanding which promises to refund to the taxpayer the amount of £175 at the end of the year under certain conditions and the Minister has circulated an amendment dealing with this.  In many cases when taxpayers receive an increase in wages they move into a higher tax band and when they move above a relatively low income they pay in tax 60 per cent of the increase in wages.  This causes real bitterness.  The bands have <Col N="725" /> not kept pace with inflation and in my amendment I am suggesting that the first band should be £1,800.  I have amalgamated the first two bands, the old £500 and the next £1,000, and increased them by 20 per cent which is the increase in inflation since this band was introduced in the 1977 budget.  I have also increased the other bands by 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be unwise to refuse this amendment.  I concede that it would have an effect on the country's finance, but if we pretend that taxpayers are not resentful and do not cater for that, then many more of the decisions affecting the economy will be forced on Government by people outside this House.  An indication of this is the march which took place during the month of March.  When it was announced I guessed it would be successful, but in my wildest dreams I did not anticipate that 250,000 people would march on that day.  For the sake of orderly Government in the future, the Minister and the House would be very wise to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be an amendment on similar lines from the Labour Party, apart from the figures set out here.  In general, we favour a more graduated band system.  There appears to be too sharp an ascent into the highest tax-paying bracket for people in the middle income range.  This is having a bad effect on industrial relations generally.  I think the Minister was mistaken in abolishing, as he did, the 20 per cent rate in his original proposals.  If there was a more gradual rise in ascent with the taxation level not biting into the middle income range especially, it would be an improvement.  I am thinking of the industrial worker earning an average at present of about £80 per week.  With overtime he finds himself paying the highest rate of income tax.  All through industry at present there is a clear realisation of the interaction between taxation levels and income levels.  Industrial bargaining now is no longer what it used be.  In the traditional situation we knew that employees bargained with employers for a set figure but now <Col N="726" /> representatives of employees are as acutely aware as the Revenue Commissioners of the likely effect on net take-home pay of taxation provisions.  The sums are done on what level of insurance contribution has to be paid, what rate of income tax is levied and so on.  All these come into the final reckoning now before employees are satisfied that their income will permit their standard of living to be either maintained or improved.</P>
      <P>I am not going beyond the confines of the section in saying that there is no doubt that the prospect of success for the national understanding depends on a responsible and more constructive attitude on the part of the Government to the question of taxation and the disproportionate burden borne by PAYE workers.  The possibility of support for the national understanding hinges on this.  I am anxious to hear the Minister on this point.  We shall certainly try to see what improvements can be brought about in the present situation.  I should like some acknowledgement from the Minister and, as proof of his acknowledgement that this is a very serious problem at present, some response to the requirement that exists undoubtedly for a less steep ascent into the higher tax brackets for the average industrial worker.</P>
      <P>In talking to industrial workers one very frequently hears the comment when they are forced into overtime as many of them are with weekend working: &ldquo;Two-thirds of this goes to the State.&rdquo;  While they realise that so much of their over-time earnings goes into the Exchequer they are forced to undertake overtime because of various pressures on their living standards that compel them to seek extra overtime when their family living and social life suffers as a result of this dependence on excessive overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many factors involved in the solution of this whole problem which are perhaps outside the scope of this section but there is no doubt that it is relevant for the Minister to inform the House what steps he proposes to take to prevent this rather precipitate rise into the higher tax ranges in respect of workers' incomes.  When PAYE was <Col N="727" /> originally contemplated I am sure it was never visualised that such workers' average earnings would attract the higher taxation rates.  This is undoubtedly a very adverse factor in industrial relations at present and quite outside the scope of employers and employees and union representatives to settle among themselves.  It needs a very constructive contribution and reaction from the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite unreal and a little mystifying that Deputies should refer to the changes in the bands without referring to the changes in personal allowances.  For instance, under the proposals in the Bill the married allowance is increased by £500, in other words £500 of additional taxable income is completely free of tax before the bands operate at all.  Of course one cannot look at the operation of the bands without having regard to the level of the personal allowance and it is quite misleading to try to do otherwise.  Clearly, on the combination of the two changes, one finds that all taxpayers other than single people earning in the region of £7,000 per year or more are benefiting.  Such people at the maximum pay an extra £15 a year in tax.  Apart from those, all other taxpayers benefit and we should have that clear in our minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry referred to the indexation of capital gains as he has already done on a number of occasions.  I responded to it but since he has raised it again I must once more point out that the tax on capital gains is what it says, a tax on a gain.  Without indexation you could have a tax on a loss.  Whatever one may say about income tax, nobody is taxed on an income he does not have. That is the basic difference between the two systems.  Deputy Barry also referred to a proposal I made in 1974 in regard to increasing the allowances in line with inflation.  If the Deputy cares to refer to the records of the House for 24 July 1974 he will find what I said.  I was quite specific in limiting my proposal and also in referring to the fact that we were at that time suffering an annual rate of inflation of 24 per cent.  It was specifically <Col N="728" /> in that context, a totally new context for us, that I made my proposal.  I do not think Deputy Barry can saddle me with making a proposal in Opposition which I was not prepared to implement in Government if only because the enormously different circumstances then prevailing which I spelled out at the time did create a new situation. However, suppose that when I came into office I had applied indexation, what would the consequences be?  It is important to realise that this now seems to be a firm proposal from the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>It would appear from what Deputy O'Leary has said that the Labour Party favour this proposal also.  Let us look at what would have happened if I had applied indexation since I took office after the last general election.</P>
    <P>The first thing would have been that, instead of the married allowance sum of £2,230 which is being provided for in this Bill, the figure would have been £1,315.  Is that what the Fine Gael and Labour Parties are asking for: that we should reduce the married allowance from what we are proposing here by almost £1,000, with similar reductions in the personal allowances for other categories of taxpayers, single, widowed, and so on?  People should understand &mdash;and it is one of the difficulties in dealing with tax that enough people do not understand&mdash;the extent to which the burden particularly on PAYE taxpayers has been relieved in the last two budgets. This illustrates very clearly the degree to which progress has been made in relieving that burden.  The fact is that if we had applied indexation, instead of being £2,230 the married allowance would have been £1,315.</P>
    <P>That is not the end of the story. Deputy FitzGerald, who put forward this proposition at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis, was interviewed on the radio the following day and said, correctly in my opinion, that if we were applying indexation to income tax we would also have to apply it to indirect taxes.  What would be the position if we adopted that course? Apart from reducing the personal allowance so substantially, the consequence would have been that, to adjust <Col N="729" /> the duty on the pint of stout and other beers in line with the increase in the consumer price index since it was last increased in 1976, an additional tax increase of 5p over and above what was provided for in this year's budget would have been necessary.  Instead of an increase of 2p on the pint, the increase would have been 7p.  On the glass of spirits the tax would have been increased by more than 6p over and above the budget increase.  The corresponding increase for cigarettes would be over 4p per packet of 20 for the popular tipped brands, over and above the increases provided for in this year's budget.  In addition, the duty on petrol would have been increased by 19p per gallon.</P>
    <P>We ought to get an air of reality into the situation.  If Deputies opposite are proposing indexation, the onus should not be on me to spell out the consequences of what they are saying.  Since they are carefully avoiding the consequences, I have to do it.  The consequences are, as I have already indicated, that if we applied indexation the tax allowances we are proposing would have been vastly reduced, and the indirect taxes on beer, spirits, tobacco and petrol would have been vastly increased.  If that is what Deputies opposite are advocating, the people should understand that.</P>
    <P>The real secret in all this is that Deputies opposite do not want to acknowledge, and are doing their best to conceal, the degree to which this Government have relieved the burden on taxpayers as compared with the situation when they were in office.  I sympathise with Deputy Barry and Deputy O'Leary.  They were both members of the former Government.  They have a job to do as spokesmen on finance for their respective parties.  I cannot think of a more embarrassing question to put to Deputy Barry and Deputy O'Leary as members of the former Government than the question: &ldquo;What did you do for the PAYE taxpayer when you were in office?&rdquo;  Is there a more embarrassing question they could be asked?</P>
    <P>It ought to be particularly embarrassing for Deputy O'Leary.  I am not exonerating Deputy Barry, but at least he <Col N="730" /> has not posed in recent times as the champion of the PAYE taxpayer which Deputy O'Leary has tried to do.  The record of these Deputies in Government in relation to PAYE is appalling.  Any comparison between what they did in office and what has been done by this Government shows that they were totally unaware of the burden on the PAYE taxpayer or, if they were aware of it, they did not bother to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I do not want anyone to suggest, because it would be quite untrue, that I believe the situation in regard to the PAYE taxpayer at the moment is satisfactory.  It is realistic to say we will never reach the situation in which all PAYE taxpayers will be satisfied unless, of course, income tax is abolished altogether.  Even then, I suppose some people would have justifiable complaints on certain grounds.  However, it is unlikely to happen in our time so we need not consider that possibility.</P>
    <P>We need to consider what has been done by this Government to ease the burden on the PAYE taxpayer and ask are we moving in the direction of easing that burden further.  All the evidence shows that is so.  I do not think it is unreasonable of me, when I hear from Deputy Barry, and from Deputy O'Leary in particular, about what should be done for the PAYE taxpayer, to point out to them that when they had an opportunity to do something about it, their record cannot be described as anything but appalling.  The amount of posturing involved in this area does not help anybody.  If Deputies want to put forward the proposition of indexation, as has been done here, they will have to accept the consequences.  The consequences are that indexation which they are advocating would do far less for the taxpayer than this Government have done, and would have increased the burden of income tax and indirect tax to an intolerable degree as compared with what has happened under this Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That was ten minutes of posturing in the grand manner.  Let me start by saying that I thank the Minister <Col N="731" /> for his sympathy, and no doubt Deputy O'Leary will speak for himself.  I sympathise with the Minister, Deputy Colley, because I think he is a decent man, but I do not sympathise with him as Minister for Finance, or with any member of this Government.  I do not have to underline here&mdash;and it has been said outside the country which is far more serious&mdash;that since this Government started off by unleashing unreliable expectations in their manifesto they have not deserved the slightest sympathy from anybody.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the budgets this year and last year had relieved PAYE taxpayers.  If that is so, can the Minister tell us why so many people went on the streets in protest earlier this year?  Is it because they do not believe what the Minister has been saying?</P>
      <P>There is a case to be made for indexation of direct as well as indirect taxation, but if indexation were introduced in respect of PAYE the Minister would have to introduce it for ordinary taxation as well, but then at least the Government would be seen to be raising extra taxation.  But when the tax bands are changed and when people get wage increases which put them into upper bands, the Government get increased revenue which is not immediately obvious.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us about the increased personal allowances he has given, but he did not do anything to change the bands.  This year he did away with the lowest band which was of peculiar benefit to the lowest taxpayers. Automatically every taxpayer went into the higher band at 25p in the £.  Now, when most people get wage increases they will be moved into the higher tax bracket because of the telescoping of the tax bands.  The Minister has told us that it is only people who earn several thousand pounds a year who will be affected.</P>

      <P>I have got figures in front of me in relation to tax liabilities of married and single men earning £6,000 a year.  Everybody listening to me here <Col N="732" /> earns that amount, and there is not an army of us here at the moment.  All tradesmen probably earn £6,000 a year. Middle rank gardaí, junior Army officers, industrial workers with some overtime, commercial travellers, shop managers, junior doctors just starting off, local authorities and TDs earn that amount, some of them a bit more.  In the financial year 1978-79, a single man earning that amount would have a personal allowance of £865.  He would have been given a social welfare allowance of £64.  On the first £500 of taxable income he would have paid 20 per cent, £100. On the next £1,000 at 25 per cent he would have paid £250, on the next £3,000 at 35 per cent he would have paid £1,050 and at 45 per cent on the balance, his total income tax would have been £1,701.95.  He would have paid £171 in social welfare payments, and on those figures his payment to the State last year would have been £1,879.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I had guessed the Minister would say that, and I will deal with it later.  This year that man will have to pay pay-related contributions, he will be caught by the telescoping of the tax bands and the abolition of the social welfare allowance for tax purposes, and taking into account the increased personal allowance he will be paying £1,920, meaning he will be about £41 worse off, or 80p per week.  The Minister has said that social welfare contributions are not income tax, but a person drawing a weekly wage is not concerned on a Friday night about the brand of tax: he is concerned about what is in his pocket at the end of the day. That man was concerned in the first week of April this year that he took home 80p less than on the last week of March.  He was incensed and he did not distinguish between the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister for Health or the Minister for Finance&mdash;he had less in his pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the man with £6,000 a year income is married with three children, after his personal allowance and child allowance and the social welfare allowance, in <Col N="733" /> 1978-79 he would have paid a total of £1,045.10.  He would have paid social welfare contributions of £77 bringing his total contribution to the State to £1,122.10.  This year, his aggregate tax means that he is about 50p a week better off.  That man will not shout from the rooftops about it.  It will buy him a pint and I am not sure whether it would be enough to buy a packet of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>The food subsidies were taken off in January and because of that I reckon that that married man who is 50p per week better off from the taxation point of view, will be paying between £3 and £5 a week more for food this year.  There is no point in the Minister for Finance telling me that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is responsible for that. this or the Minister for Health and Social Welfare is responsible for that. The point is that at the end of the week that man is worse off.  An annual income of £6,000 is not a lot of money for a man with a family who perhaps has to pay a mortgage, and mortgages have gone up since last year.  He will not be going to South America for a holiday, he will not own two cars and he will not be dining out in one of the places one reads about in the glossy magazines.  He is finding it damn hard to live.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong but I think that the Government encouraged RTE to produce a programme on Friday mornings which compares food prices from week to week.  I heard the programme on Good Friday morning when the presenter compared last year's prices with this year's prices.  I am sure it was not a scientific survey but she compared her lists for both years.  She showed that the price of vegetables had increased by 100 per cent and that the price of meat had increased by 35 per cent.</P>

      <P>That is the point I should be making.  When people refer to their incomes they are really referring to their take-home pay.  The majority of people consider themselves to be either marginally better off or worse off.  A <Col N="734" /> married man with three children earning £6,000 a year is better off by only 50p a week.  Both he and his wife know that his take-home pay will do less from now on. This situation has prompted the PAYE marches.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to accept my amendment.  I accept the point he made about indexation of other forms of taxes. If the Minister accepts the amendment the people will see that the increased taxes are not being taken by stealth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few points in relation to the tax bands and the rates of taxation.  It is amazing that Deputy Barry, who was a Minister in the previous Government, is now putting down an amendment which proposes increasing the tax bands and indexing allowances.  The lowest tax band during the term of the Coalition Government was 26 per cent on the first £1,550 of taxable income.  The next £2,500 of taxable income was taxed at 35 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not right.  The figure was £500 at 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In this year's budget the Minister has taxed the first £500 at 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We introduced that rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>A 10 per cent surcharge was introduced on all rates over 35 per cent.  This meant that the 35 per cent was 38½ per cent and that the 45 per cent rate increased to 49½ per cent. It amazes me that Deputies who were Ministers in the previous Government are championing the PAYE cause.  In the tax year 1974-75 the married tax allowance was £800.  In the tax year 1977-78 the married tax allowance was increased to £1,100, an increase over the period of 37½ per cent.  In the same period inflation rose by 100 per cent. Surely that was the time to make the case for the indexation of allowances.  In the 1978 budget the Minister increased the tax-free allowance from £1,100 to £1,730.  He has now increased it by £500, which leaves it at £2,230.  This <Col N="735" /> shows that the Minister has doubled the allowance in 18 months whereas the Coalition Government increased the allowance by only 37½ per cent.  When the Coalition were in power the inflation figure was 102 per cent.</P>
      <P>The increases given in this year's budget are very good.  I believe that the Minister has relieved the burden of the PAYE sector.  The PAYE marches are a separate question.  When people discuss the PAYE burden they should compare like with like.  In the tax year 1976-77 the average industrial worker paid about 16.6 per cent of his earnings in tax. From April 1979 he is paying 12.6 per cent, which is an improvement of 25 per cent.  The Opposition cannot have it both ways.  The shedding of crocodile tears for the PAYE sector by Deputies O'Leary and Barry is nauseating.  There is a good case to be made for the indexation of allowances but they did not do anything about the matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is an increase in the taxable band.  On a previous occasion the Deputy said that the allowances should also be indexed.  We have greatly increased the allowances.  I think the bands are reasonable.  I do not know why the PAYE sector is marching when the Minister has reduced their tax liability.  Some people wish to pay less taxation and do not want money taken out of their pockets on Friday nights in taxation.  Part of the reason why they are up in arms is that they feel that everyone is not paying their correct amount of tax.  Whether they are or not is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners but we must show that such people are being pursued.  The Minister has increased the staff of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy McCreevy is suffering from a misapprehension.  He says we had a chance to do something about it when we were in power and did nothing about it.  The Deputy is an accountant and is more familiar with figures than I am.  I presume the figures he uses are correct.  He is wrong about the tax bands when we were in office. Perhaps the Deputy has forgotten but when we came into office the tax bands ranged from 26 to 80 per cent.  When we left office they ranged from 20 to 60 per cent.  We did do something about them: we reduced them.  In this year's Finance Bill under Fianna Fáil they will move up again because the 20 per cent has been abandoned and they are now 25 to 60 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The point about the bands is crucial to the whole question of taxation reform.  It is not a sufficient response to the discontent there is with the burden of taxation borne by the PAYE wage and salary earners to say that the Government have increased the allowances.  Without the incorporation of the principle of indexation, inflation will eat into the allowances and any superficial concession given on budget day will be eroded in the course of the year.  If a Government wish to be honest with the electorate in matters of tax reform, central to this honesty is the incorporation of indexation.  Otherwise we will have what we had this year and what, to some extent, is accountable for the degree of discontent we have witnessed and that is, a cosmetic exercise in tax reform.  That is what the Minister indulged in in the recent budget.  The make-up has been removed from his exercise and people have seen through it. One could give many, many illustrations <Col N="737" /> where people can prove that they are at a net loss when all the deductions for State purposes are taken into account&mdash;for example, welfare deductions, the elimination of the tax allowance for children's allowances or the fact that the lower tax band was removed.  People must move into the higher range more rapidly.  All these can be instanced to show that, under the so-called tax reform programme of the Government, at a time when the economy has been improving little has been done to shift the burden of taxation borne by PAYE earners.</P>
      <P>More money will be taken from this section of our population this year than last year.  This year a married man with no children and a gross income of £70 will have £13.42 deducted between tax and welfare contributions.  The PAYE section of the population feel they have been conned by the budget, which claimed to be a direct response to their plight.  They believe that the budget has not delivered the goods as far as they are concerned.  Instead they can cite such matters as increased contributions in welfare and the removal of the subsidy on food.  What they are concerned about is the net effect of these measures on their take-home pay.</P>
      <P>Anyone conversant with the situation knows that the bad industrial relations we have is the tip of the iceberg of the discontent felt with the taxation system, which is creating a great strain on industrial relations at present.  A good deal of difficulty has been caused by such factors as the burden of taxation being borne by the PAYE taxpayers.  No Opposition would be doing duty if they did not draw the attention of the Government to these facts of life, which took the form of recent demonstrations and mean that the discontent will not be dissipated in the near future.  They are facts of life that suggest that the Minister is not on the wavelength of reality when he talks about the allowances being sufficient to meet the tax reform demand. The question of agreement and sanity in industrial relations depends upon employees being convinced that the Government are serious about reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Labour <Col N="738" /> Party will be putting down a similar amendment.  Unless the Minister accepts the amendment he is not facing up to the widespread demand that exists for tax reform.  PAYE receipts have been increased in 1978 by £80 million.  There will be a further increase this year of almost 30 per cent in the overall take from PAYE earners.  While bad handling by the Government of the farmer tax issue may have precipitated recent discontent, basically it owes its origin to the recent budget and to the claim made by the Minister that the budget was designed to meet the problems and demand for reform of PAYE earners.</P>
    <P>When people take into account the various allowances withdrawn for tax purposes&mdash;the children's allowance, the increased contribution in welfare and the abolition of food subsidies&mdash;families are at a net loss arising out of the past measures of the Government this year. Last year, when the Government introduced the principle of deductions offsetting the tax on capital gains, they proposed that in all cases adjustments would be made to allow for inflation as measured by the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>That was done for capital gains tax purposes.  We demand that a similar principle be incorporated as it applies to the PAYE wage and salary earner to apply from next year.  That would mean that at next year's budget when the Minister stands up and announces any improvements he has to announce they would retain their real value.  Also it is not a comprehensive response and the Minister is not setting himself on secure foundations in talking about reform of our tax system by simply concentrating on allowances alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Minister taunts the previous administration with how little they did is a bit unsatisfactory coming from a Minister who presided over an economy with record levels of growth for two years.  It is not <Col N="739" /> sufficient for him to taunt the previous administration with the fact that they, in a period of unexampled economic difficulty, were not able to do a great deal. He, in this more fortunate circumstance, has done very little indeed and he has no excuse economically to plead inability. Over our period there certainly was structural reform in the tax bands system which were abolished by this Government; there was this allowance for the lower paid worker&mdash;we had the 20 per cent band and that has now been abolished.</P>
      <P>Quite outside the levels of tax being paid on the tax base itself the actual structure of our tax system as it applies to PAYE people is wrong.  It suffers from the glaring weakness that it penalises the middle income earner at too high a tax rate.  It catches his earnings at too high a point in the year.  Of course the discontented taxpayer, if he cannot get a remedy from the Minister on budget day will seek his remedy in claims for increased wages; that is his only remedy.  That explains to a great extent the kind of large claims we have seen launched up and down the country over the last year and the special cases that have been made.  If we do not meet the demand for tax reform it is not only marches we need be apprehensive about but we must be realistically apprehensive of the effect on industrial relations in conditions in which this country is a member of the European Monetary System.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment put to the Minister incorporates the idea of a more graduated level or band system. The Minister has not so far responded in any constructive fashion to that demand. It would be helpful in the present circumstances because one of the main weakness of the present tax system is the manner in which the worker in the <Col N="740" /> middle income range is taxed at too high a level.  I have not had time to do the work on this but I believe that compared to similar tax structures elsewhere ours has a very sharp ascent indeed in terms of the way the average wage earner has to pay top rates very quickly on overtime he has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse the remarks of previous speakers.  It is not enough in tax reform to change the basic allowances.  One must enlarge the bands in line with inflation as one increases the allowances.  Otherwise people will, because of higher allowances, take longer to get into the tax net but once they get into it they move to a higher rate relatively more quickly than they would previously have because of inflation and that is not really equitable. We should try to adjust the entire tax system to take account of inflation including the bands as well as the allowances. Otherwise we would have a situation where taxation increases will take place not by legislation but by inflation. In fact most of the increases in taxation that have taken place here over the last ten years have arisen from inflation rather than legislation.  That is a bad thing and it arises from the fact that we are wedded to specific figures in our tax code rather than to percentages of income. We must radically alter the way in which tax-free allowances and tax bands are adjusted to take account of the fact that whereas when we were living in the twenties and thirties in an era of more inflation and in some cases deflation allowances and tax bands were at the same figure and were therefore relevant, now we have moved into a different era in the sixties and seventies, an era of inflation, and we must change our whole approach to taxation to take account of this.  The accountancy profession has recognised this change in the whole approach that is necessary to make this sort of calculation in that they have proposed a completely new accountancy system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar type of approach to take account of what they call inflation accounting must be introduced into our tax system and that implies the indexation of tax-free allowances and the indexation of <Col N="741" /> the tax bands.  I will say more about that on the section but I believe that the amendment is something that should be endorsed and I hope the Minister will see his way to accepting it.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note the reaction of the Deputies opposite to what I said in regard to indexation. Deputy Barry rather adroitly tried to move his feet and I do not blame him for doing it.  He now says that he is talking about indexation of bands.  Of course the whole principle of indexation cannot be confined to bands; it has to be applied across the board as I outlined and indeed as the leader of his party acknowledged.  It would have to apply to allowances, to bands and to indirect tax. I spelled out what was happening. Deputy Barry saw the implications of it and did his best to redeem the situation by talking only about the bands but Deputy O'Leary does not seem to have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>But the Deputy said that he was advocating indexation only in relation to bands.  If he wants to correct it that is all right with me, but if he wants to go along with what Deputies O'Leary and Bruton said, then he will simply have to take the consequences.  I have already explained it to him but I am going to have to explain it to him again.  I am also going to have to explain to the public what the Fine Gael and Labour Parties are urging.  The problem of Deputies opposite is that having been members of a Government which did so much worse than indexation they have not grasped the fact that they now have a Government which has done so much better than indexation and so they have not really taken in the consequences of what they are saying.  But the consequences of indexation are, as I have indicated, that the marriage allowance of £2,230 provided for in this Bill there <Col N="742" /> would be reduced to £1,315.  We can only assume from the repeated assertions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies can have it one way or they can have it the other; either they are for indexation or they are not.  Before Deputy Bruton came in I pointed out all these consequences and yet Deputy O'Leary got up and repeated that there should be indexation.  Deputy Barry whom I tried to let off the hook to some extent insisted on going on with it&mdash;he was not only talking about the bands but about all aspects.  Deputy FitzGerald spelled it out at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis and subsequently.  So really I do not think there is any point in trying to let Deputy Barry off the hook any further.  The fact is that the Fine Gael and Labour parties are urging indexation, one of the consequences of which would be to reduce the size of the marriage allowance under the income tax code from £2,230 to £1,315.  Another consequence would be to increase the tax on the pint by 5p on top of the increase allowed in this budget&mdash;in other words make it 7p; an additional 6p on the glass of spirits; an additional 5p on cigarettes and an additional 19p on the gallon of petrol.  That is what the Fine Gael and Labour parties are advocating. I pointed it out and they are still advocating this and they are stuck with it now.  I do not think that is what the people want.  If the Deputies think it is let them go out and sell it to the people.  The basic problem is that the Deputies opposite have not adjusted to the fact that while they were in Government they did so much worse than indexation that they <Col N="743" /> think it would be an improvement to apply indexation.  They have not grasped the fact that they are now operating under a Government who are doing so much better than indexation that those are the consequences which would apply if we had been applying indexation.</P>
      <P>That is not the end of the matter although one would have thought that it ought to be the end of this nonsensical policy being advocated by Deputies opposite in the light of the current situation under the present Government.  It would not have been nonsensical under their Government but that is another story.  We now find that, in order to make the case they are trying to make, Deputies opposite are skilfully jumping in and out from tax to social welfare. When it suits them they pick part of it and when it suits them they leave out part of it.  The truth is that income tax represents a payment by the taxpayer to the cost of meeting the running of the State, all the services provided, including such things as education, health and aid by way of pensions and otherwise to the aged, the needy and the sick.  Social welfare contributions are payments by employees to secure benefits for themselves for the future.</P>
      <P>The changes which were made, and which were referred to by Deputy Barry and Deputy O'Leary, to introduce a pay-related scheme were changes which were primarily in aid of the lower paid and that is how they have worked out. The majority of contributors are doing better because of this change to pay-related because they are lower paid and there is an overall limit now of £5,500.  It is not realistic, apart from the distinctions between income tax and social welfare contributions, to lump them together without having regard to the benefits that accrue from the changed system.  Neither is it realistic to bring in social welfare and to ignore, as Deputy Barry did, the social welfare children's allowances and the cash received by people on that basis.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy did not, his <Col N="744" /> figures were wrong.  The first thing wrong with his figures was that he talked about £6,000 as being around about the kind of level that would be received by many industrial workers and other categories.  The latest figures from the Central Statistics Office in June 1978 indicate that the average income in transportable goods industries was £4,490, that is £86 a week.</P>

I am trying to show that for the person on an average income in the transportable goods industries, which, as the Deputy knows, is a wider category than industrial earnings, who is on £4,490&mdash;I am taking a figure of £4,500&mdash;the combined tax savings under this Bill for that person with the increased social welfare children's allowances would give him a saving of £125.80 in the year, a rather different figure from the one Deputy Barry was talking about.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give way for a minute until I explain what I said?  I was talking about a person on £6,000 a year and I guessed what kind of a person that would be.  I may be wrong but I was not talking about the average industrial worker, to whom the Minister is now referring.  I am sure he will get a different answer if he does that. I am only guessing at the type of people earning £6,000 a year.  I include TDs, junior Army officers, many ranks of the Garda and a lot of other people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear what I <Col N="746" /> said.  The Minister should not be putting words into my mouth.  I did not say anything about the average industrial earnings at any stage.  I was talking about people earning £6,000 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a largely irrelevant point but since the Deputy is making so much about it could we get it right?  Did the Deputy or did he not talk about industrial workers and tradesmen?  Did he not talk about a great many of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister is on his feet he might as well get a second point correct.  I started out to say about one-and-a-half hours ago that the Minister had abolished the £500 tax band at 20 per cent.  Would he justify that?  In all his talking here this morning he has not mentioned it once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy wants to change the subject.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be allowed speak without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wants to run away from the point.  That is all right and I will not pursue it.  Would the Deputy allow me to say what I want to say?  I did not interrupt him.  I understand his concern in relation to what has emerged.  Let us leave that point and go on to some other points I want to make, one of which is the one to which Deputy Barry has just referred.  He talks about the change in the tax band, the abolition of the £500 at 20 per cent.  How can anybody talk about this without reference to the allowance?  How can anybody ignore the fact that if the married allowance is increased, as we are doing in this Bill, by £500 that means that another £500 of taxable income is free of tax before any question of a band comes into operation?  That is a fact.  It is quite misleading to talk about tax <Col N="747" /> bands without regard to that.  It is only after that that the band comes into operation.  It is not unreasonable to suggest that in some cases one must have regard to the combined effect of the increased allowance and the tax band.  If one has regard to the increase in the social welfare children's allowance, which ties in with another section we will be coming to, one gets the kind of result I indicated for the person on an average income in the transportable goods industries.</P>
      <P>It is quite unreal and misleading to talk about social welfare in conjunction with tax and to ignore, first, the basic purpose of the social welfare contribution, second, the benefits that accrue from the changed pay-related system and, third, the social welfare children's allowances which mean cash in the pocket for the person concerned.</P>
      <P>I was surprised&mdash;but I suppose I should not have been&mdash;that the Deputies opposite have continued to talk about indexation. Deputy M. O'Leary tried to imply that he and his colleagues in the Coalition Government should be exempt in this area because when they were in office things were difficult but we are lucky because we are in at a time when there is growth.  It is no accident that we are in when there is a time of growth. That did not happen by accident and it would not have happened if there had not been a change of Government.</P>

      <P>The Deputy hopes so but he has been so wrong every time.  I want to tell him something.  With all his excuses for his failure in office on all fronts, and he blames the world situation for virtually everything, it still does not add up to a justification for coming in here and trying to urge on us indexation which would totally disimprove the position of the taxpayer, whether on PAYE or otherwise, but when he tries to pretend that he is concerned with the burden on the PAYE taxpayer that is a bit hard to stomach.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy pointed out some of the consequences of what happened under the Government of which Deputy O'Leary, Deputy Barry and Deputy Bruton were partakers.  Let me give some further examples.  Deputy McCreevy gave them in percentage terms but I would like to give them in cash terms so that the people will know how realistic are the proposals from the other side as compared with what happened when they had some control of the situation.</P>
      <P>Under the Coalition Government in 1976-77, a married person with two children earning £30 a week was paying £18 tax.  Under this Government this year, not taking account of the special allowance in December&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Excuse me.  On £30 a week he was paying £18 tax per annum. Under Fianna Fáil he is paying nothing. On £40 a week he paid £153 tax a year, nothing under this Government.  On £50 a week, he paid £289 tax a year, nothing under this Government&mdash;that was in 1976-77 when the value of money was greater than it is now, allowing for inflation. On £70 a week he was paying £634 per annum, this year he is paying £244. On £90 a week he was paying £1,034 a year, this year he is paying £595.</P>
      <P>Whether you take it in absolute cash terms or in percentage terms, you can juggle it any way you like, but the message is loud and clear.  Whatever people may think about the tax system, and in particular the PAYE system, no Deputy on the other side of the House, and in particular no man who was a member of that Government, if he has an ounce of shame in him should dare to open his mouth on the subject of PAYE because, as I said earlier and as I have demonstrated, the record of that Government in regard to the burden on PAYE taxpayers was appalling.  In the light of that performance, it is a little difficult to accept any degree of sincerity in the proposals being put forward here this morning.</P>

      <P>The Minister is probably the best man in the House to muddy the water.  If I put up an argument about A he says that &ldquo;Deputy Barry never said B comes after A&rdquo;; if I said I never mentioned B, he says &ldquo;do you deny that B comes after A?&rdquo;  He totally twisted all the arguments today and, until I forced him to say something about it, he never mentioned the fact that in this year's budget Fianna Fáil are taking away the 20 per cent band which has applied for the past two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps at future budget meetings the Minister would look at the top rates.  Deputy Barry's amendment takes the rates of taxation, as the Department of Finance do, as Godgiven. They think there must be 40 per cent, 45 per cent, 50 per cent and 60 per cent rates.  In future the top rate of taxation should not be greater than 50 per cent.  If the Minister and his Department did that they could then work down. Sometime there might not be a reason to have a rate of 45 per cent.  After the 35 per cent rate the next £2,500 of taxable income might be at a rate of 40 per cent. When the 60 per cent rate is applied more of a person's money is going to the Exchequer and this becomes a disincentive to work.  I am conscious that rates were higher in previous budgets.  They were up to 77 per cent at one time.  In future budgets perhaps the Minister would consider that not having a rate of taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will consider a public works programme, utilising direct labour, to make all public buildings accessible to handicapped citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not in mind undertaking a direct labour programme on the lines suggested by this question.  Responsibility for public buildings rests with various authorities, central, regional and local.  In so far as the central authorities are concerned the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works <Col N="754" /> are the principal responsible bodies.  It would be for the latter body to consider the Deputy's suggestions in the context of their existing procedures and programmes.  I am informed that the Office of Public Works has a code of practice relating to access for the disabled in relation to buildings under their control. The code lays down that in designing new buildings or adapting existing buildings, suitable access for the disabled shall be provided wherever possible. The code covers the special problems that may arise, including standards of approaches to buildings, toilet facilities, and so on.</P>
      <P>The provision of access for handicapped persons to public buildings under the control of regional and local authorities would be a matter for each authority concerned.  In so far as local authorities are concerned, the Minister of State at my Department as a result of a motion discussed and passed unanimously in the Seanad on 8 November last, brought the general matter of the circulation and access of the handicapped to the attention of all city and county managers.  He asked them to give a lead in so far as their own buildings, new or existing, were concerned and to have the matter also brought to the notice of all officials concerned with planning proposals affecting buildings to which the public had access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the most effective instrument for which he had direct responsibility is the procedure of development plans and if the Department were serious about implementing the code to which he refers they could request and direct, as has been done in other areas, every local authority to make it a condition of planning permission as set out in a division of the development plan that all public buildings would have adequate provision for access for the disabled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>After the motion in the Seanad the Departments concerned, including the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works, and all local authorities, were informed of the motion and asked to take this matter into consideration. Where planning was concerned <Col N="755" /> their planning officers were also informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a variety of information documents, requests, and so on. Would the Minister not agree that, if he is serious about this matter, he has power to direct the local authorities to implement such provisions and such codes within the development plans and the revision of the development plans?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will take a personal initiative with regard to ensuring that a site is acquired and building is expedited for the proposed new library in the Marino-Clontarf area of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The acquisition of a site for library purposes is a matter for the relevant local authority.  I have had no proposals from Dublin Corporation in relation to a new library in the area in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister take into account the fact that there appears to be a special difficulty about acquiring a site in the area?  That is why I wondered whether he might be interested in taking an initiative.  Will he cooperate with the local authority because he would carry weight in the context of getting the library facility more rapidly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that there has been difficulty in getting a site.  The Department of Education have not come under any pressure from the VEC to provide further facilities because they already have made arrangements about library facilities in the area.  It is the function of the local authority to find a suitable site.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the action it is proposed to take in view of the implications contained in a newspaper article concerning an open ballot (details supplied) and its potential effect on electors and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject completely the insinuation contained in the article that serial numbering constitutes a threat to the secrecy of the ballot.  The House will recall that this whole matter was dealt with by the Supreme Court in the case of McMahon versus the Attorney-General in 1971.  I would refer the Deputy to the judgment in this case and also to the debates on the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1972, which brought the electoral law into conformity with the Supreme Court judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside the judgment, of which I have not got a copy nor will the readers of this paper have a copy, could the Minister tell me in clear and plain language whether the implications contained in the article, which I consider rather dangerous if not mischievous, are true?  Can the Minister in any way allay the fears which have been deliberately aroused by the article?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the article.  I am assured that the judgement in the McMahon case made it quite clear that the system adopted with regard to the numbering of the ballot papers at present is not unconstitutional.  With regard to the danger that exists, I would say it is not impossible but it is most improbable. The odds would probably be millions to one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Disregarding the constitutionality of the matter, I take it the Constitution would not preclude us as a Parliament or the Minister by regulation from ensuring that there is no danger by omitting the voter's number from the <Col N="758" /> counterfoils of the ballot papers?  This would counteract the possible implications which are directed at voters in a manner which could be intimidatory.  It is this aspect and not the Constitution that I am worried about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It may also be interpreted in a different way.  For example if some voter found himself or herself accused of voting improperly in some form or other before the courts, the courts could utilise this business to find if there was real proof that there was improper voting.  We are satisfied with the judgment given in the McMahon case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is getting me all wrong.  I am not disputing any judgment.  I am asking the Minister, having read the copy of the article I submitted with my question, if he is satisfied that there is nothing he could usefully do to allay the fears which undoubtedly have been aroused by the article in the minds of rather innocent voters who may be pressurised.  The weapon held over their heads would be: &ldquo;We will know what you did, or what you did not do&rdquo;.  That is the background which has to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>I have made it clear to the Dáil that there is no toll road plan proposed for implementation.  The Local Government (Toll Roads) Bill, 1979, currently before this House, would enable road authorities to make schemes in respect of the charging of tolls on public roads and bridges, subject to compliance with certain procedures and to my approval.  The initiative in the making of any such scheme would, when the Bill has been enacted, rest entirely with the road authorities.  The amount of revenue which might accrue over any particular period in respect of any particular scheme or schemes cannot at this stage be calculated.  The second part of the Deputy's question is accordingly not relevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the question relates to licences for driving cars. The present system, whereby the holder of a driving licence on its expiration may apply for a further licence valid for a one-year or three-year period, has been in operation since 1964, prior to which yearly licences only were available, and this system continues to operate satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>I am aware that other countries issue licences valid for longer periods.

I do not know of any country where that can be done.  In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, a £5 licence has been available since January 1976 to persons under the age of 65 years.  In all the countries referred to in the question there are certain limitations, far more so than in Britain. There is no such thing as a lifelong licence.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>) asked the Minister for the Environment the arrangements made or proposed for postal voting, polling cards and candidates' free postage rights in the forthcoming European Assembly Elections and local elections in view of the postal strike and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Am I right in thinking that the order referred to deals with postal voting and simply states that in addition to facilitating voting by post the returning officer may adopt such other method as he thinks fit; that in regard to polling cards the order simply states that in addition to the polling cards the returning officer may draw the notice of the public to the elections in such a way as he thinks fit; and does the Minister agree that it is good enough to amend an Act and the regulations and throw the procedure to the returning officer to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the modification of the order, forms of receipt being issued to postal voters may be sent by post or in such other manner as the returning officer considers appropriate. A postal voter may deliver or send his ballot paper by post or in any other manner to the relevant returning officer, and a notice to this effect will be included with the other voting papers by the returning officer.  Instead of sending a polling card to each elector, the returning officer may take such steps as he considers necessary to inform electors of the polling day and of the place at which each elector is entitled to vote.  This could take the form of a newspaper advertisement or of a poster.  As the Deputy knows, polling cards are not necessary and to inform people that they are not necessary is most important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is satisfied that mortgage facilities are available to cope with numbers of applicants to building societies at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The availability of mortgage finance from building societies depends mainly on the net inflow of new funds to societies.  In the last six months, the inflow of new funds to societies has been extremely high&mdash;more than double that in the previous six months.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding these high inflows, the demand for mortgages has, I understand, continued to exceed the amount available for lending.  In consequence, most societies have had to reintroduce restrictions to varying degrees.  For this reason, amongst others, the Government have requested the societies to continue for the present to apply the constraints on loan approvals introduced in August last.  I might add that the current overall position will be reviewed at a meeting arranged for the 17 of this month between representatives of the Irish Building Societies' Association and officials of the Departments of Finance, Environment and Economic Planning and Development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the available facilities for people seeking <Col N="774" /> mortgages is the Minister aware that, despite the fact that more funds are available to building societies, the Economic and Social Research Institute's recent study on housing indicates that there are less mortgages available, in number, for people on lower incomes than there have been?  In other words, the trend has changed and there are fewer mortgages but larger ones at the upper end of the social spectrum. Does the Minister consider that a healthy development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know at what time they came to that conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the study the Minister purported to have read yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain when they actually compiled that, whether it was last year or the year before.  A lot of what is contained in the report is very vague and their recommendations are equally vague.  With regard to making more moneys available, the Deputy is fully aware that 60 per cent of the loans are now under £13,000 and a further 20 per cent are under £16,000.  That must mean more loans are available since last September and that is continuing at present throughout the big societies.  The only variation is that one of the big societies is not observing the CRV requirement as the others are at present.  In order to overcome that difficulty and to strengthen the laws which I would have to use to insist on that being done, I have included a provision in section 20 of the new housing Bill to give me the necessary power to ensure that all building societies do so.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in assuming that what the Minister is saying is that he considers a clear statement in the ESRI study is not in accordance with the facts as known to the Minister?  The Minister used the word &ldquo;vague&rdquo; in relation to the study.  I do not understand that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendations were quite vague.  There are other studies that might be more relevant because <Col N="775" /> there seems to be a lot in common between that study and certain other studies that came out before it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report mentioned by the Deputy referred to estimates of emigration in the 15-19 age group in the period between April 1975 and April 1977 which, the Deputy will appreciate, was covered by the last Government's term of office.  These estimates were based on a comparison between the estimated population in the relevant age group at those two dates published in the reports of successive EEC labour force sample surveys.</P>
      <P>These population estimates are derived from sample surveys and are subject to margins of statistical error. The figures indicate that there was an outflow in the 15-19 and in the 20-24 years age groups but that these were largely offset by net inflows in the under 15 and over 25 year age group.  This age distribution of migration is, of course, in accordance with former patterns, including those experienced in the seventies, where even with net immigration, the 15-24 age groups experienced net emigration.</P>
      <P>Information for recent years, based on changes in population, will be available when the results of this year's census of population have been processed.</P>

If he had been listening to the reply he would have seen that information for recent years based on changes in population will be available when the results of this year's census have been processed.  It is true to say that the census will provide far more detailed information and the reason that detailed accurate information is not available is because no census was taken a few years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The White Paper, <i>Programme for National Development, 1978-1981</i>, indicates the Government's intention to reduce the present statutory limits on working hours and to consult with employers and trade unions on appropriate changes to which legislative effect will be given in 1979.  This intention is also included in the proposals for a national understanding for economic and social development.  Subject, therefore, to further developments on the proposed national understanding, I intend, after consultation with employers and trade unions, to introduce legislation this year to reduce the statutory limits on adult working hours and overtime which have remained unchanged since the 1930s.</P>
      <P>The European Council on 12 and 13 March 1979 did not adopt any formal resolution in this matter.  In its conclusions it instructed the Council to study certain measures to improve the employment situation, including the limitation of the systematic use of overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the proposed reduction in the statutory working hours?  When can we expect the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the reply, I would hope to introduce legislation later this year.  The Deputy will appreciate that at this stage the details of the legislation cannot be supplied to him. I will be discussing the measures to be taken and the possibilities in dealing with that legislation with both sides of industry and I will inform the House in good time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the Minister's reply that, when he says he will reduce by law the amount of overtime worked, it is the maximum amount he means and that he has no intention of legislating totally against overtime?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as if any workers are in love with overtime but that they are forced, because of the rise in the cost of living, to depend on overtime even though a great deal of the money earned through overtime goes to the tax man.  This must be borne in mind in any legislation in relation to this matter. The Minister is dealing with people who are forced to work overtime.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the relevant Council Decision came into force on 1 January 1978, five applications for a total amount of £117,425 have been submitted by Ireland in respect of training programmes to assist the entry or re-entry of women of 25 years of age or over into working life.  The five applications concerned have all been submitted by AnCO.  One relates to operations in 1978, while the remaining four are in <Col N="783" /> respect of 1979 operations.  The European Commission has formally approved Social Fund assistance in respect of the 1978 application.  Three of the 1979 applications were recommended for approval by the advisory European Social Fund Committee at its meeting on 23 March 1979 and formal approval of those applications is expected from the Commission shortly.  The fourth 1979 application will be considered by the advisory European Social Fund Committee on 6 July 1979.  Particulars of the schemes are set out in a tabular statement which, with the permission of the <Col N="784" /> Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>To date no aid has been received from the European Social Fund in respect of the five applications concerned.  Formal Commission approval of the Social Fund grant in respect of 1978 operations was announced only on 12 March 1979 and a claim for payment of the grant is at present being prepared.  It will not be possible to submit any claims for payments in respect of the 1979 operations until appropriate grants have been approved by the Commission.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Details of schemes for which Ireland has submitted application for assistance from the European Social Fund under Decision 77/804/EEC relating to operations designed to facilitate the entry or re-entry of women of 25 years of age or over into working life.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2.</P>
      <P>In page 7, after line 3, to add a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  A PAYE Taxpayer shall, for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of the income on which he is to be charged to income tax for the year 1979-1980, be entitled to a special deduction of £175.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is quite clear. Under the agreement published last week entitled <i>National Understanding for Economic and Social Development</i> there is a paragraph on page 8 which says:</P>
      <P>As a contribution to promoting the present National Understanding, the Government will provide a special allowance for PAYE taxpayers at a cost of approximately £39 million in 1979.  This allowance will operate in December, provided (1) that the budgetary position is reasonably in line with expectations, and (2) that any funds needed for employment creation, which is a first priority, have been made available.</P>
      <P>The purpose of my amendment is to write into the Finance Bill, 1979, a provision for the payment of this £39 million which I understand works out at £175 per PAYE taxpayer without the two provisos which I have just read.</P>
      <P>I would like to see this national understanding signed.  I believe it would be a great help towards having it voted on favourably by both the employers and the unions if the refund of tax was made unconditional.  If this was written into this Bill it would be a help towards having the national understanding accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth saying that the national understanding will bring in a large amount of revenue to the Government <Col N="797" /> because it will mean that a large number of people will be getting additional earnings which will push them into higher tax brackets.  I have estimated that the national understanding will bring in an increase of approximately £187 million in PAYE receipts because of the extra money which will be received if it is signed.  The Government are &ldquo;generously&rdquo; giving £39 million out of this £187 million at the end of the year in tax relief.  I realise that that is not presenting the full picture because if the national understanding is accepted the Government will have to pay out a lot more in increased salaries.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry's amendment is a very sensible one.  I would like the Minister to elaborate on how the figure of £39 million was arrived at in the course of discussions on the national understanding? What was subtracted from what to reach this figure?  Was it purely plucked from the air as a figure which would be attractive?  It is hard to understand how the figure of £39 million could be linked to two very imponderable things, employment creation and budgetary considerations, which are so broadly drawn as to be open to a very wide variety of subjective judgments.  In almost any situation the Minister could decide that not enough money was being given for job creation or he could not decide to give it.  Either could happen because the terms are so broadly drawn. That contrasts rather oddly with the very precise figure of £39 million which it is alleged could be given.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain this point more fully.  I am not raising this matter in a partisan fashion but we are being asked to give the Minister authority to do something by order without coming back here and we should have full information for the basis on which this figure is being worked out and why it will be done in a particular way.</P>

      <P>My questions are of a technical nature dealing with amendment No. 8.  We can discuss the pros and cons of the matter and the fact that it is part of the national understanding to give the PAYE taxpayer a reduction in the tax he will have to pay, but I am interested in how the Revenue Commissioners will administer this.  Will the taxpayer get the full £175 allowance?  Will a new tax-free allowance be issued in, say, November incorporating this special additional allowance or will it be incorporated in the amended tax-free allowance certificates which will issue shortly?  Since the allowances are on a cumulative basis, how would a person get the full benefit of £175 in December when the allowance will run until 5 April 1980?  In my opinion he should only be getting three-quarters of the allowance which will accumulate up to 31 December.  How will this be administered?</P>
      <P>I take it from reading paragraph (1) (a) of amendment No. 8 that the Minister does not intend to make any change in the allowance.  He says that &ldquo;a deduction of £175 shall be made from so much, if any, of the emoluments... as arise to the individual&rdquo;.  May I take it, from paragraph (1) (b) of amendment No. 8 that £175 will be given to the working wife as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the queries raised by Deputy McCreevy and, if I omit dealing with some of them, he can come back again.  The Deputy is correct in assuming that the allowance would be made available separately to the working wife.  Secondly, a special tax deduction card would be issued in connection with this allowance.  Subsection (2) of amendment No. 8 says:</P>
      <P>In determining cumulative tax-free allowances in relation to the year 1979-80 for the purposes of the Income Tax (Employments) Regulations, 1960 ... deductions under this section shall be deemed to have accumulated in full on such date in the year 1979-80 as the Minister for Finance shall by order direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special allowance will be operated in such a way as to concentrate the full <Col N="799" /> benefits for most taxpayers in the month of December.  The tax-free allowances of each PAYE taxpayer will be increased by £175 at a particular date to be specified by order.  This will result in a reduction in tax liability at that time. Taxpayers will get either a refund of tax or a reduction in the tax deducted from their salary at that time.  Where taxpayers now had £175 in taxable income up to the date on which the special allowance will operate, the balance of the allowance will be available for deduction from further income earned up to 5 April 1980.</P>
    <P>PAYE earners who are not employed at the time of operation of the special allowances will still benefit from the allowance if they have any tax liability over the full income tax year, either by a refund of tax already paid or by a reduction of the tax payable on any further incomes earned during the income tax year.  It is expected that for the great bulk of PAYE taxpayers the allowance will become available in the month of December either by way of tax refund or reduction in the deduction for tax.</P>

      <P>They can only get the allowance in respect of tax to which they are liable.  In other words, if they are not liable for tax they do not get the allowance. If they are liable for tax which is less than the allowance they get the amount of tax refunded for which they are liable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised the question as to the manner in which this sum was arrived at.  I want to make it clear that this figure was not the subject of negotiation in connection with the national understanding because this is a function of the Government.  The Government decided on the figure and communicated it to the parties to the negotiations but it was not negotiated on.  The amount involved was arrived at by reference to (a) what could be afforded without affecting the overall budgetary figures and (b) having regard to other committments that were being entered into by the Government under the national understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the substance of Deputy Barry's amendment No. 2 where he is seeking to remove all conditionality from the granting of this special tax allowance. The conditions are two-fold: first, that the budgetary position is reasonably in line with expectations, and secondly, that any funds needed for employment creation, which is a first priority, have been made available.  Taking the first one, it must be accepted that there is no point in providing for allowances if we are not providing for the money to meet the cost to the Exchequer. In this connection, whatever the figures are, Deputy Bruton can rest assured that the Exchequer is not gaining under the arrangements for the national understanding which in fact is costing considerable sums of money.  I am speaking, of course, in relation to the matter to which he referred which is the cost that the public sector pay but also in relation to other aspects of the national understanding where the <Col N="801" /> Government are undertaking various financial commitments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the change in the health contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that can involve expenditure for the Government.  There are some others but I am thinking particularly of one which comes up under condition No. (2) and that is in relation to employment creation.  This is not merely a question of a broad figure as Deputy Bruton thought would be the position.  I refer the House to the provision in the draft national understanding in regard to a guarantee relating to a shortfall in the Government's target in employment.  The House will recall the provisions in regard to that under which the employers would contribute a sum of up to £10 million and the Government would contribute at least the same in order to implement the guarantee against the shortfall.  That is quite specific.  It is primarily what was in mind in that phrase &ldquo;any funds needed for employment creation&rdquo;.  I have not gone through the draft of the national understanding just now in this connection, but speaking from recollection, there are other commitments in relation to the Exchequer, for example, the National Prices Commission.  Having regard to these various commitments and availability of money without changing the overall budgetary figures, the sum of £39 million was arrived at but it was arrived at by the Government and not by the parties to the negotiations on the national understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the overall requirement that one shall make provision for the increased income tax allowance, one has the obligation to ensure that it is provided for in our budgetary exercise. Having regard to the specific commitment I have referred to in regard to employment creation&mdash;which, as is stated in the national understanding and has been stated repeatedly by the Government, is the first priority&mdash;it is necessary to have these conditions in. Provided that the national understanding is accepted, and provided it is reasonably implemented in the letter and in the spirit, there is no reason to believe <Col N="802" /> that the budgetary expectations would not be in line with expectations nor, since provision has been made in our calculations for the employment creation aspect, is there any reason to believe that that would cause any difficulty?</P>
    <P>The basic requirement in order to ensure that this special allowance becomes available is that the national understanding be accepted and that it be operated reasonably in accordance with its spirit and letter.  If that is done there is no reason whatsoever to anticipate that these conditions will not be met and there is every reason in these circumstances then to expect the implementation of this special tax allowance provided for and referred to in both of these amendments before the House.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I have outlined, circumstances in which this provision arose, I could not accept the proposition that it would or should be done unconditionally, but the conditions which are laid down are such that acceptance of the understanding and implementing it in accordance with its provisions will ensure that the conditions will be met and the allowance will be given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask a few questions in relation to the undertaking that the budgetary position is reasonably in line with expectations.  Do I take it that &ldquo;expectations&rdquo; means the expectations as expressed in the current budget for 1979, in other words that the deficit would be somewhere in the region of £288 million?  I take it that that would be the figure that the Minister has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that the national understanding is going to cost the Exchequer a net amount of money.  It would be useful if he could let us know, taking all things into account, what the net cost to the Exchequer of the national understanding would be.  We are told that the budget deficit of £288 millions not being exceeded to any appreciable extent is to be the condition upon which these allowances will be made available.  Yet the budget when it was drawn up for 1979 was drawn up in the absence of the national understanding <Col N="803" /> and before this additional burden of expense was placed on the State as a result of the national understanding. Therefore, the national understanding obviously changes the calculations. On the face of it, unless there is some compensating factor to bring in money if the national understanding is going to cost the Exchequer say a net £100 million, that should mean that the budget deficit of £288 million provided in 1979 should be £388 at the end of 1979.  If that happens the contingency mentioned by the Minister, the budgetary position being reasonably in line with expectations, would not be fulfilled and the tax-free allowance which he has mentioned would not be given.</P>
      <P>Therefore, inherent in what the Minister is now saying is that something has happened since the budget was drawn up to increase revenue by the same amount as expenditure is to be increased by the national understanding. Otherwise it would not be possible to fulfil the condition that the budgetary position would be in line with expectations in order that this allowance should be given.  The Minister should give us some idea of his calculations.  He should tell us where he gets these figures. Otherwise we are carrying on a debate very much in the dark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This agreement has points that will be of benefit to the three parties involved and it will also cost the three parties something.  The first condition attached to the £39 million is that the budgetary position is reasonably in line with expectations. If the agreement is signed, the trade unions will be giving something from the point of view of industrial disputes, limitation of wages and so on.  They will be bound to that.  While I accept that the Minister would feel obliged to pay it, the Government are not bound to pay the £39 million unless the budgetary position is reasonably in line with expectations.  However, the budget was not drawn up by either of the social partners.  They had no say in it other than making representations.  As far as I remember £75 million was written into the budget.  It was drawn up by <Col N="804" /> this Government and if there is something wrong in it, if there is a mistake in the figures or if the expectations in respect of revenue and expenditure are incorrect, that is the fault of the Government. Yet it could be used in December as a reason for the Government not paying £175 in respect of the taxpayer, the £39 million.</P>
      <P>A second condition is that any funds needed for employment creation, which is the first priority, be made available.  In the edition of the national understanding that I have with me, on page 5 it is stated:</P>
      <P>The employer and industry organisations will contribute 50 per cent of the necessary finance for this programme, to yield up to £10 million, collected by means of a ½ per cent charge on the employer social security contribution.</P>
      <P>The trade unions will have no control over this and if there is a shortfall in the number of jobs&mdash;for reasons outside the control of the Government or industry&mdash;it may not be possible to obtain this amount, even with the collection of a ½ per cent surcharge on the employers social security contributions.  That ½ per cent charge will weigh even more heavily on those employers who have increased their employment and to that extent it is unfair.  The benefit to the taxpayer is conditional on two bodies over whom he has no influence.</P>
      <P>We should be careful in this House not to interfere with the bargaining position or assessment by the parties involved in the national understanding that might undermine it or encourage people not to vote for it.  We should be careful not to damage the national interest in this way.  I have made these points on a few occasions before.  They are important and I think they could assist in getting a favourable reception for the national understanding.</P>

      <P>With regard to the £175 extra allowance, it will mean that the personal allowance, for the married taxpayer will be £2,405.  The tax allowance for a single person will be £1,115 plus £175, making a total of £1,290.  I was pleased last year that the Minister ensured that the tax-free allowance <Col N="805" /> for a married couple was double the single allowance.  That never happened before.  If the £175 is paid, as I assume it will be, it will mean that the allowance for a married couple will not now be twice the allowance for two single people.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start with the point made by Deputy McCreevy. Earlier I may have referred to this as a special allowance.  If I did so I was not accurate because the House will see that it is referred to as a special deduction.  It is not really part of the allowances but is a special deduction in arriving at the amount of tax for which a PAYE taxpayer would be liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is referred to as an allowance in the national understanding where it is stated that a special allowance will be provided for PAYE taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will see, it is referred to as a special deduction in amendment No. 8.  The section sets out the legal provisions.  The national understanding draft is not a legal document in that sense.  As will be seen, it is provided for only in respect of this tax year.  The <Col N="806" /> question of what allowances or deductions might apply in the following or in any other tax year is another matter that we are not dealing with now.</P>
      <P>I submit that the question of the cost to the Exchequer in implementing the national understanding is a separate question.  All that is relevant here is the effect that might be had on the conditions laid down in implementing this special deduction.  So far as that is concerned, as the House is aware in any budget the basis of calculation of revenue and expenditure is spelled out.  I do not think there ever was a budget that turned out to be precisely correct.  It is of course an estimate 12 months in advance. Sometimes it can turn out to be extremely accurate, but if one analyses how that happens one finds that on both sides of the account, whether expenditure or revenue, some items are up and some are down and it is the final figure that works out and indicates how close estimation overall was.  It is a well-known fact that it never works out exactly.</P>
      <P>Further, the basis for calculation is set out in the budget this year as in every other year.  It should be clear therefore that when we are talking about the budgetary position being reasonably in line with expectations we are talking about the basis of calculation.  In so far as this might be out of line for reasons that would have occurred whether there was or was not a national understanding, I would certainly accept that is a matter that cannot be affected by the parties to the national understanding other than the Government.  I tried to indicate that what was envisaged in this regard is that if the national understanding is accepted and implemented reasonably in line with its letter and its spirit then there is no reason to believe that the budget figures would not be in line with expectations.  The implication in that statement is fairly clear.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is a very important aspect of this; and I also want to say that those who were parties to the negotiation of this draft understanding, both employers and union representatives, accepted this wording and accepted, if you like, a degree of good faith on the part of the Government.  Certainly, they did not expect, and were right in my opinion in not expecting, that the Government would try to engage in some kind of trick to evade their responsibilities in this regard.  That would be the furthest thing from our intentions.  If the understanding is accepted and implemented reasonably in line with letter and spirit, that will ensure compliance with condition No. 1.</P>
      <P>In regard to condition No. 2, I think it was Deputy Barry who said that there could be a very considerable shortfall for one reason or another in job creation and how could one determine the cost of meeting that.  The Deputy will recall that in fact the national understanding provides for an upper limit on the short-fall&mdash;5,000. That was the basis of calculations made by the Government in regard to the obligation they were taking on in relation to the guarantee on the shortfall in job creation if such occurred. So, the bases for these conditions are as precise as they could be, given all the circumstances, and for the reasons which I have outlined earlier I could not contemplate having no conditions attached to it.  The conditions here are reasonable and can be complied with by accepting and implementing the national understanding. Beyond that I do not think I can go or should be asked to go.</P>

      <P>He referred to the figures <Col N="808" /> for the budget and the fact that there would be some expenses anyway for the Exchequer arising out of this and he asked how would that not affect the deficit in the budget.  The Deputy will be aware that in the Budget Statement I referred to the fact that we anticipated on the revenue side receipts from subsidies on EMS loans for which I had made no provision in the budget as regards expenditure.  In my view implementation of the national understanding would be a very important step on the road to gearing the economy to life within the EMS.  Obviously, we cannot do this overnight; but there is an adjustment process which is necessary and this is one of the purposes for which the subsidies are being made available. From a budgetary point of view, these were not allocated in the Budget Statement and so there is a source of revenue unallocated which can operate to prevent the budgetary outline being upset.</P>

This is a very interesting discovery.  It certainly was not the impression one got during the EMS negotiations when one gathered that the subsidies were being given in respect of loans for very specific projects of an infrastructural nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have presumed that, if the EEC were giving a subsidy for a particular project in the form of an interest subsidy, it would be a project that would not otherwise be undertaken and that in order to get the subsidy the Government would have to borrow extra money in order to undertake an extra project to get this extra interest subsidy. But if the interest subsidy is, as it now appears, to be available for use to finance the national understanding, it would seem that what the Government intended to do with the EMS subsidy is merely to use it to pay some of the interest on this existing national debt.  In other words, the EMS interest subsidies will not be used for new infrastructural improvements in our economy but will be used to subsidise the interest on existing debts for existing projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The allowances will only be given if the budgetary situation is as anticipated.  The budgetary situation has been changed by the cost of the national understanding.  Therefore, it would appear to be unbalanced and not as anticipated. The Minister says that something else has happened since to put it back in balance, namely, the extra subsidies from the EMS.  If all those things do not happen the allowances cannot be given.  Therefore, we must know each of the contingencies which have to occur before this happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> In the budget the Minister provided £75 million for additional costs in public service pay on the basis of what the Government then hoped for in relation to income increases.  I quote from the Minister's statement on that subject.  He was talking about 1978 and he said: &ldquo;In the event, the increase in average earnings per worker in 1978 worked out at over 16 per cent.&rdquo; Later on he said: &ldquo;Incomes clearly should not continue to grow in 1979 at the rate set in 1978.&rdquo; In fact, the national understanding provides for an increase of 15 per cent, which is only 1 per cent under the figure of 16 per cent.</P>

It is merely the substitution of EMS money for money already negotiated from another source.  If that is correct, how is there money also available to finance the £39 million that is part of the national understanding?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to get into the area of the loans which qualify for EMS subsidies I should be widening the scope of the debate.  The question of the subsidies may be relevant to this matter.  As Deputies Barry and Bruton are not clear on this matter, I should like to point out that there is an enormous difference between an EMS loan and a subsidy in cash which is related to the amount of interest payable on the loan.  To revert to a point raised earlier by Deputy Barry, on page 36 of the printed version of my Budget speech I said: &ldquo;I have made no allowance in my budget estimate of resources for the capitalised interest subsidies payable in accordance with the resource transfer arrangements.  The Government have decided that these resources should not be allocated until the European Monetary System gets under way and the flow of funds commences. There will then be a clearer view of suitable areas for their application in the light of actual participation in the system.&rdquo;  There is a clear distinction between the subsidies and the loans.  It was <Col N="813" /> made clear that the loans would be used, not exclusively, but to a large extent, for infrastructural purposes.  Some industrial purposes could be envisaged and perhaps some other purposes.</P>
      <P>The interest subsidies are another matter.  They are cash grants.  There is no condition, nor did we accept any condition, on the use to which those grants or subsidies might be put.  We would certainly favour the idea of using them in a way which would help to adjust the economy to the EMS regime.  As I have already indicated the implementation of the national understanding would be an important step on the road to that adjustment.</P>
      <P>The point at issue is that there were resources available to which I referred in the budget statement which had not been allocated.  Therefore, it is possible to visualise the expenditure of further moneys than were provided for in the budget without upsetting budgetary balance.  That is the whole point of this discussion in so far as it relates to the conditions attaching to this special deduction provided for in amendment No. 8.</P>

Is it under this Bill?  I notice there is no section in the Bill concerning the procedures for the making of orders. Usually in sections where orders are being made there is provision which says that the order shall be laid before the House and that it may be annulled or, alternatively, that the order shall not be made unless it is confirmed by the House.  There is no power in this Bill for the making of orders.  How can the Minister make an order in the absence of an order-making power related to it?</P>

      <P>In the case of a person who had an income consisting partly of income subject to ordinary PAYE and partly emoluments as a proprietary director or within the terms of subsection (3), what would happen is that the special deductions would be applied to the proportion of his income which was subject to ordinary PAYE but that portion of his income which came within the definition of emoluments would be excluded from this and would not benefit by the special deduction.  But I would like to point out to the Deputy that we are talking here about emoluments paid to a proprietary director and not just any director, or to the spouse of such a director and emoluments paid by an individual to his spouse by whatever means.</P>
      <P>Section 226 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, defines a proprietary director as&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>a director of a company who is either the beneficial owner of, or able, either directly or through the medium of other companies or by any other indirect means, to control, more than 15 per cent. of the ordinary share capital of the company;</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry on amendment No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 141 the Minister reduces the child allowance from £240 to £218.  The purpose of my amendment is to lift it from £218 in the Bill to £290.  The old allowance is £240 <Col N="818" /> and I am adopting the same practice as I did earlier on today of lifting this by 20 per cent.  The Minister in his budget speech said that in regard to the reduction of £22 the direction of benefits in this manner will be effected by reducing the child allowance in the income tax code by £22 per child.  The children's allowance is a sum of money given to people with children.  It is as simple as that and to try to claw it back by means of the income tax code from people with families is quite wrong because many people in the income tax net are not well off and sometimes not much better off than those who are outside the code.  To attempt to claw back money by means of a reduction in the child allowance in the income tax code is petty and mean and it should not be done particularly in this year, 1979, which has been hollowly referred to as the Year of the Child.  We can do a lot of talking about the Year of the Child but we seem to do nothing concrete to make this in fact the Year of the Child.  The Minister in this year has gone in the reverse direction by reducing the child allowance from £240 to £218. This is a retrograde step and my amendment seeks to redress it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Minister is in this year reducing the child allowance for income tax purposes is merely confirming a trend which has been taking place over a considerable period.  I will just give a figure to illustrate this.  Since 1974-1975 the tax free allowance of a married couple with no children has increased by 178 per cent whereas the tax free allowance of a married couple with six children has only increased by 76 per cent, a good deal less than half as much as the increase in the tax free allowance of the married couple with no children.  The social justification for discrimination of that sort against large families in favour of those with small or no families is very hard to find and yet it is something that is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument that is put forward by this Minister and also by his predecessor on another occasion was that this was justified because children's allowances were being paid to all children including those from well-off families, that it is <Col N="819" /> wrong that the cost of this should be so great and that one way the cost could be reduced would be by clawing it back from the taxpayers with large families.  If however, that argument is valid and there is too much money being spent on children's allowances, it is not right that the cost saving should only be made amongst middle income people with large families.  Surely if there is any money to be got back it should be got back from all taxpayers and not just middle income people with families and income tax liabilities.</P>
    <P>I just do not see the logic of it at all.  If the Minister wants to make a change in children's allowances by introducing a means test, that is fair enough.  But the fact that too much money is being spent on child allowances is no justification for reducing allowances on the income tax code because that is a different thing altogether.  The backdoor way of doing things should not be used.  It is quite wrong that a married couple with no children should have an increase of more than twice as much proportionately in their tax free allowance as the married couple with six children have had in 1974-1975 and this year.  That is socially wrong and I do not understand why it has happened.  The Minister should take another look at it.  If he wants to save money he should find some other way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the reduction being introduced this year in the child tax allowance, taken together with the new social welfare children's allowance, is to grant increases in net incomes ranging from £100 to £140 for the year to most families.  Deputies opposite must not have thought this out very well but perhaps they have because I concede to them that it is much easier to make the arguments they are making than to make the argument I am about to make.  Therefore I suppose it is more attractive politically.  But I want to make it clear that in my view, whatever about the political advantages, there is no doubt at all but that the approach adopted here is a far more just one than if we did not have this approach of reducing the child tax allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing to bear in mind is that <Col N="820" /> the poorest sections of the community who are not liable to income tax get the full benefit of the increase in the social welfare child allowances.  We were able to make that increase in the social welfare child allowance substantially bigger because of this clawback. Therefore we are able to provide more for those most in need.  Then when we come to the people who are liable to tax we find that the effect of this clawback is that we have reduced substantially the benefit which would otherwise apply to better-off people.</P>
    <P>For example, with the clawback provisions that apply here a married man on £80 a week with two children and a wife who is not working has a net saving of £125.80, and a married man with two children, wife not working, on £200 a week has a net gain of £139.80. The difference between those respective gains is £14, that is between the man on £80 a week and the man on £200 a week.  If we had no clawback the gain for the first man would be £141.20 and for the second man £166.20 and the difference then would be £25.  One of the consequences of approaching it this way is to reduce the margin of gain for the better off as against those who are less well off.  Of course, in the case of the person who is not liable to tax he gets the full benefit of what we can make a bigger increase in the social welfare child allowance by doing this.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time this approach was adopted.  It was adopted on a number of occasions in the past.  Deputy Barry and Deputy Bruton might be particularly interested in one occasion on which it was done, the 1969 budget, because of a comment made on this point by Deputy FitzGerald, now the leader of their party speaking in this House as reported in the Official Report, volume 241, column 587:</P>
    <P>Therefore, I should like to congratulate the Minister on this move. What he has done is, in fact, to recover only a proportion, a fraction, of the amount involved.  Perhaps he might go further, not because anyone wants more taxation&mdash;none of us wants it; none of us paying it want it; I am one of those who suffer from <Col N="821" /> it&mdash;but because every £ we get back from people who do not need children's allowance is an extra £ which we can give to people who are in very real need.</P>
    <P>The Deputies opposite will have to concede at the very least that there is an arguable case for what is being done in this Bill.  I will concede to them that it is easy to argue the other side of the coin, but I suggest that if you are concerned, given that there are limited resources and that you want to get the maximum amount of those resources that can be made available directed to those in greatest need, this is the approach you must adopt.  I am afraid for that reason, that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am sure Mr. de Valera had something to say about it in the twenties and Mr. Lemass also had something to say about it.  I am sure I would get a good defence for what Deputy FitzGerald said.  I must send it to Deputy McCreevy because he will be very interested in what this Minister said when he raised taxes up to 80 per cent, the highest on record in this country and probably anywhere in the world.  I am sure the then Minister for Finance put up a good argument for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not answered the point made by Deputy Bruton about the lack of concern for large families.  He defends the fact that he is reducing the child allowance under the income tax code because he is increasing the children's allowance.  In fact, for the third and every subsequently qualified child it goes up from £485 to £550, <Col N="822" /> which is an increase of 15p a week for the third child.  Nobody will pretend that those are the people most affected by the increase in the cost of food subsidies.  I quoted what was said in a programme for the Minister this morning where meat has gone up by 35 per cent in 12 months and vegetables by 100 per cent.  Part of that increase has been caused by the Government removing food subsidies on 1 January last.  Does the Minister seriously consider that the people affected by those increases are compensated, when they have large families, by 15p a week?  There are two separate things here, the reduction in the child's allowance for the income tax code and the increase in the children's allowance. One should not be made compensate for the other.  The reduction of this is a bad thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The question arises in relation to what those tax allowances are being given for.  They are being given to bring about equity between taxpayers as regards their expenses.  We are telling a taxpayer this year that if he has a wife he is entitled to a very substantial increase in tax-free allowances to enable him to meet the expenses involved in supporting a wife.  Nobody is suggesting that the cost of keeping a wife as against keeping a child has changed in the last year to the extent that it has become less expensive to keep a child and far more expensive to keep a wife.  Both of them <Col N="823" /> presumably have to be fed.  I know nothing about either but looking at it from an outsider's point of view it appears to me that if tax-free allowances are justified they should be related to expenses. There is no way that one can argue that over the last few years the expenses involved in supporting a child have not increased whereas the expenses involved in supporting a wife have increased by 178 per cent and that one must give a large increase to a person supporting a wife only and very little increase to somebody supporting a number of children.</P>
      <P>There is no change in the dietary patterns or accommodation patterns of children as against adults which would justify this discrimination in favour of a person supporting another adult but against a person supporting a number of people who are not yet adults.  We are not talking about equity between people inside the tax net and outside it, between people getting children's allowances in their tax and people who are not but are only getting it in the form of social welfare allowances.  We are talking about equity between taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a grave inequity being perpetrated here between a taxpayer with six children to support and a taxpayer with a wife and no children to support. There is an inequity between two taxpayers both earning £6,000, £8,000, £10,000, £20,000 or even a higher figure.  If you have two people with £20,000 a year one with six children whose tax allowances have only been increased by 76 per cent and another man earning £20,000 with no children and only a wife to support whose tax-free allowance has been increased by 178 per cent that is clearly wrong.  There is inequity between those two taxpayers.  The Minister has a responsibility to achieve equity not just between those who are not paying and those who are paying tax but as between taxpayers in the same position.  He is not achieving that by discriminating against people who have large families.  The Minister made the case that this money has been used, and in order to be politically neutral, I have been taking as my base year 1974-75 <Col N="824" /> and compared what has happened since then in the tax code.</P>
    <P>I have already pointed out that since then a married person with six children has had his tax-free allowance increased by only 76 per cent and a married person without any children had his tax-free allowance increased by 178 per cent.  The Minister told us that the effect of this has been to improve children's allowances. One would have expected an increase in children's allowances since then of about 178 per cent, roughly equivalent to the increase that has taken place in the tax-free allowance of the married couple.  But what has happened since 1974-75?</P>
    <P>The increase for the first qualified child has been a mere 52 per cent as against 178 per cent for the married couple; for the second qualified child it has been 66.7 per cent and for the third and subsequent children there has been a meagre 35.8 per cent since 1974-75, a period of very high inflation which occurred in the tenure of office of a Government in which I was a Junior member.  That does not matter.  What matters is that the Minister is now using the level of children's allowance as an argument for discriminating against taxpayers with very large families.  A person with six or eight children got an increase in the region of 40 per cent in children's allowances.  In my opinion, that is not making up the difference to justify such gross discrimination in the tax code against large families, and I use those words advisedly.  This is discrimination and I do not care what Government are responsible.  The Government of which I was a member did something along those lines in one of their budgets.  It was wrong then and it is wrong now.  There is no justification for it.  We must have equity between taxpayers and that is not occurring in this situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's argument is convincing.  Presumably his intention is that the well off taxpayer will be receiving increased children's allowances and the Minister will get most of that money back from him through taxation.  I agree with Deputy Bruton's viewpoint that there should be a means <Col N="825" /> test for children's allowances, because there are people receiving these allowances who should not.  I understand that it may not be possible to do this because it was tried in 1969 and the last Minister for Finance also had a clawback to recover money.  I would like to see this possibility investigated.  We get tax-free allowances for our children and we also get social welfare children's allowances. Could we not increase social welfare allowances and do away with tax allowances for children?  This would make more money available for social welfare allowances for people with large families.  Perhaps we could increase the tax-free allowance for a married person.</P>

      <P>A tax-free allowance of £240 to the standard rate taxpayer works out at £80 to £90 per year in real money terms.  That amount will not keep a child.  The Department might look at the idea of increasing social welfare tax-free allowances and abolishing tax allowances for children.  The Minister's argument of the clawback from the wealthy people in our society can be sustained as can Deputy Bruton's argument.</P>

Why should one only consider a clawback in the case of children's allowances?  Should the dependent relative's allowances be done away with, too, and a social welfare allowance given instead?  Should the blind allowance be done away with?</P>

    <P Just="Right">&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is concerned with increasing the blind allowance and the dependent relative allowance.  The blind allowance has not kept pace with increases in other allowances.  Since 1974-75 the married allowance has increased ten times as much as the blind allowance.  The allowance for a married person has increased by 178 per cent since 1974-75 while the allowance for a blind person has increased by only 17 per cent&mdash;one-tenth as much as the increase in the married allowance.  The dependent relative allowance has increased by 18 per cent&mdash;again, by one-tenth as much as the increase in the allowance for a married person with no children.  That is not right.</P>
    <P>A dependent relative can cost as much to keep, if not more, than a wife.  It does not seem right that a person supporting a dependent relative should have received an increase of only 18 per cent while a person supporting a wife has received an increase in his tax-free allowance of 178 per cent.  It may cost much more to keep a dependent relative <Col N="829" /> because of incidental expenses that may have to be met if the person is not in good health than to keep a spouse who is in good health; I realise I should not always use the word &ldquo;wife&rdquo; in this context because it may be the other way around, that the wife is supporting her husband.</P>
    <P>The dependent relative allowance was introduced in the budget of 1956 at a rate of £60 and now in 1979 it is a mere £95.  There has been an increase of only £35 in this allowance even though there has been a tremendous change in the cost of living since 1956.  This is a meagre amount in a period of 23 years. It does not seem to be a very generous encouragement to people to look after a dependent relative in their own home. We hear from all sides of the House exhortations to families to look after relatives when they are unable to look after themselves.  A lot of lip-service is paid to the great contribution of those who keep aged relatives at home, thus saving the Exchequer the immense amount that would have to be paid if they were committed to a county home or some other institution supported by the Exchequer.  Yet when it comes to the tax code all we have been able to give to such a taxpayer is a meagre £35 increase in the tax-free allowance since 1956. That is not generous.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is prepared to listen to the kind of case I am making in respect of individual allowances in the tax code.  He demonstrated this very clearly in the improved allowance that he is giving in section 4 to one-parent families.  That arises in substantial measure from a case made by this side of the House and which was accepted in general terms by the Minister in last year's Finance Bill about the problems of one-parent families.  It was a credit to him that he was able to respond in great measure to the case made last year in this connection by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Barry, Deputy Eileen Desmond and myself.  In section 4 the Minister has gone much of the way to meet the case we made and he deserves credit for that.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is not without a certain amount of optimism that I am making the case this year in respect of the dependent <Col N="830" /> relative allowance and the blind allowance. The Minister has shown that he is able to meet a case.  I can understand that he may not be able to meet this case this year because the Finance Bill has already been drawn and the sums on which it is based have been set out, but I hope that when he looks at next year's budget he will be able to do something radical about the dependent relative allowance. It certainly needs to be done when such a meagre increase has been given over the years by comparison with the increase given taxpayers in respect of supporting a spouse, as against another form of dependent relative.</P>
    <P>The blind person's allowance was introduced in the 1971 budget at £100.  It has been increased to £165&mdash;in eight years an increase of £65.  It is not quite as bad as the record in relation to the dependent relative allowance but it is not very good, particularly when one realises that the number of blind people is so small that one can afford to be generous. We are talking of a tax free allowance to blind people who are working.  We should make every effort to encourage people disabled in any way, in this case blind, to go out and work to support themselves, to become taxpayers, not only because of the contribution they can make to the community but also because if they are working the sense of value they get from it contributes greatly towards reducing the demoralising defects of their disability.</P>
    <P>A tax free allowance is one of the very best ways in which one can help a disabled or blind person to achieve the most possible from their talents.  Instead of giving them a dole, something for nothing, some social welfare allowance or a form of sheltered employment or something like that, you are giving them something which encourages them to go out and work on a normal basis like everybody else.  You are saying: &ldquo;It does not matter how much you earn; do as much as you can and you will get an extra allowance on your tax over and above what is available to anybody else.&rdquo;  The blind person's allowance does precisely that; it encourages people to seek work.  The allowance has been increased by a mere £65 since 1971 while the single person's allowance has increased <Col N="831" /> from £249 to £1,115, by about £900 in the same period.  That is not equitable.  There should have been a proportionate increase.  A proportion should have been kept between the single person's allowance and the blind person's allowance as regards increases. If the blind person's allowance had been increased by the same proportion as the single person's allowance it would now be in the region of £700 instead of £165.</P>
    <P>The amendment I am putting forward, which is merely to increase the blind person's allowance from £165 to £302, goes only half way along the road one would be justified in going on the basis of the figures.  It is not an over-generous amendment in regard to the blind.  I arrived at the figure by taking 1974-75 as the base year and seeking to give the same percentage increase to the blind and the dependent relative allowance as has been given in the married couples' allowances since 1974-75.  I could have got a much more generous figure if I had taken 1971 as the base year but I took 1974-75 because it was mid-term in the period of office of the previous Government and covers part of the term of office of this Government and the previous one.  The record, when one is comparing it with what should be the case, is one for which both sides of the House bear responsibility and cannot be the subject of partisan discussion.  There is a very strong case for giving substantial increases in the dependent relative and the blind person's allowances.  These allowances tend to be forgotten in the Finance Bill because the numbers involved are not large.  They do not form part of a big political constituency.  None of them have influential organisations speaking for them.  They are not one of the social partners and are not represented in the pay talks.  If they do not agree with the Government policy&mdash;the blind and the dependent relatives&mdash;it will not mean there will be no national agreement.  It will not mean people marching in the streets and that the Minister will be forced to climb down on his taxation proposals if these groups are not satisfied.  It is perhaps because of their small size that successive Ministers for Finance have neglected to do <Col N="832" /> anything meaningful about the blind persons and dependent relatives.</P>
    <P>If this House has any purpose it is to represent those who are unrepresented in the type of discussions in which any Minister must take part, what is now described as a national understanding. Between now and the next Finance Bill I hope the Minister&mdash;if not on this occasion&mdash;will take a very close look at the record of his predecessors and himself in regard to blind allowances and dependent relative allowances and give a truly dramatic increase in both allowances in next year's budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Bruton, who has made a very fair case in a non-contentious way.  If the Minister intends to reply perhaps he would tell us how many people would be involved in this and what it would cost. We are only talking about blind people who are working and I would guess that the number of dependent relatives being supported by taxpayers is quite small so that to accept the amendment might not cost much and would only affect a small number of people, but it would be a real benefit to those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to support an amendment of this kind.  The case has been presented in a way that could not excite the Minister to say that it was politically motivated or that it sought to take advantage over him in his position as Minister for Finance, because under all Governments this matter has been relatively neglected.  These are groups whose allowances have not kept pace with others for various reasons that have been put forward. Perhaps Deputy Bruton is right when he says that they do not gain representation in the larger national economic talks. One way or the other, the dependent relative allowance and the blind person's allowance should be reviewed as a matter of urgency and a planned programme to bring these allowances up to more realistic levels should be embarked upon. The point has been made that the number involved is relatively small and it would do the Minister for Finance credit to be able to claim that he has rectified an anomaly that has grown over the <Col N="833" /> years.  Presumably hardship is being caused to a relatively small number of people.  The cost to the Exchequer to rectify the anomaly would not be large and it would only be doing what we have done with more influential sectors.  I support the case that has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The case made for an increase in the blind person's allowance and the dependent relative allowance is one that can be made with considerable persuasion.  However, there is one fallacy inherent in Deputy Bruton's approach in comparing the increases in these allowances over the years with the increases in such things as the single person's allowance and, by implication, suggesting that the rate of increase ought to be the same if we are to achieve justice.</P>
      <P>Any person in receipt of either of these allowances must come into one of the categories of single, married, widowed or single parent.  Therefore, they have been given the benefit of the increase in such allowances provided for in the budget.  The Bill provides for an increase in the single person's allowance of £250, an increase of £500 in the married allowance and an increase of £250 in the single parent's allowance.  All of these people who are in receipt of either the dependent relative's allowance or the blind person's allowance have received these increases.  We are talking about increases over and above those increases.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I am not suggesting that the existing allowances are generous.  I am saying that one must have regard for the overall position and try to achieve some kind of balance between the different kinds of allowances.  If one increases the main allowances substantially, then one is covering every taxpayer.  There are, as Deputies know, a number of allowances of this kind which only apply in a limited number of cases.  One has to try to achieve some kind of balance.  One cannot pick out one or two categories and ignore the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must also have regard to the overall cost of all the changes.  It is true that the relative cost of the proposed increases, particularly in the case of the blind person's allowance, is not very <Col N="834" /> great.  At the moment I do not have the exact number involved but the cost of the implementation of these two proposals would be £4 million, of which about £20,000 would relate to the proposal in respect of the blind person's allowance and the balance to the dependent relative allowance.  One might well say that since the cost is so small, particularly in relation to the blind person's allowance, we should make a worthwhile increase in it.  As I said, items of that kind cannot be picked out because they do not cost too much.  It would be invidious to those in receipt of similar kinds of allowances that are not of general application to approach the matter in that way.  Furthermore, one must have regard to the overall position.</P>
    <P>In this connection perhaps the Deputies opposite might be interested to know that, taking the various amendments that they have put down to increase various allowances of one kind or another, including the amendment being discussed, the total cost involved in their proposals would be an additional £173 million.  I hope that that will put into perspective the problem that we face in dealing with these matters.  It is not simply a question of picking out one or two categories and dealing with them. While I am not unsympathetic to the case made nor suggesting that the existing allowances are over-generous, in the context of the overall increases being given, which apply to all these people, and in the context of the budgetary position I could not undertake to accept these amendments at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the dependent relative allowance, I should like the Minister to draw the attention of the Department to the bureaucratic rigmarole which anyone claiming the extra allowance of £95 must endure. There are 11 questions to be answered on the form such as &ldquo;Please give evidence of how you support this relative.&rdquo;, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will convey the Deputy's remarks to the Department and will look at the situation.  I am not aware of the position being as he says. Without having looked into the matter, <Col N="835" /> my immediate reaction is to point out that it is not open to the Revenue Commissioners or Inspectors of Taxes to grant allowances of this kind to people for whom the Oireachtas does not lay down an entitlement.  The Revenue Commissioners must ensure, as reasonably as they can, that if such an allowance is specified as being subject to certain conditions, those conditions are complied with.  Subject to that, however, it may be that the questions are unnecessary. I will have the matter examined on that basis, but I must remind the Deputy of what I said about the overall responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that such an allowance is given only to those entitled to it by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That only arises because of a law made by us.  The Revenue Commissioners are asking unreasonable questions because we are making unreasonable laws.  We have to have a look at that.  Deputy McCreevy was raising a legitimate matter that perhaps the Minister should have a look at.  The Minister used the phrase we must try to keep some kind of balance in this discussion. That is precisely what I am trying to do.  I am trying to restore the kind of balance that existed as between the blind and dependent relative allowances and the single or married allowance in 1974-75. What has happened since is that there has been an imbalance.  Very big increases have been given in the married and single allowances but equivalent increases have not been given in the blind and dependent relative allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's response to the case that is being made and would ask him to do two things between now and Report Stage.  I would ask him to ask his officials to have discussions with the National Council for the Blind to ascertain the manner in which this allowance is used and how valuable it is in promoting employment. If the Minister got information from the council on that issue it might be of help to him in assessing next year whether or not an increase would be justified.  In the case of the dependent relative allowance, it would be a good idea for the Minister to have a look at the kind of person getting <Col N="836" /> this allowance and the kind of relative in respect of whom they are getting it, to see if a significant increase in the allowance would not result in an overall net saving to the Exchequer.  A number of people would be able to be kept at home instead of going into county homes if the allowances were increased.</P>
    <P>The £4 million referred to by the Minister in terms of cost of an increase in the dependent relative allowance would be more than outweighed by a reduction in costs to the health boards in respect of maintaining such people in institutions. The health boards spend somewhere in the region of £400 million on various services, not all directed to the alleviation of the position of dependent relatives.  A lot of the health board expenses could be saved if what I am proposing were done.  That is only a bland assertion on my part as I have no evidence to substantiate it beyond the evidence of reason.  The Minister should have consultations with the health boards to see if the case I am making is justified and if an increase in the allowance would mean an overall net saving to the Exchequer.  If he finds that it does, he would be justified in making the increase we are looking for, if not this year, then next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was talking about balance between these allowances I thought I was making it clear I was talking about allowances other than the main personal allowances.  They apply to all of these people, single, married, widowed or whatever.  I was talking about balance in the non-main personal allowances.  There are other categories affected in this way and I was saying one cannot pick out one of these categories and accelerate it beyond the other categories.  That is what I was trying to convey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what happened. The Minister decelerated them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as there have been substantial increases in the personal allowance all these people have benefited.  As far as the use being made of these allowances in the case of blind <Col N="837" /> persons is concerned, I can claim to be appreciative of their value, since I introduced them.  Any representations that are made from time to time by the National Council for the Blind and other similar bodies are always listened to carefully and that will continue to be the case.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Bruton what I am about to say is an assertion and not based on facts as I do not have them at my disposal at present.  In relation to the dependent relative allowance an increase sufficient to make any impact on the cost of the health boards would be an enormous increase.  The kind of increase one could keep the other similar allowances in line with would not be sufficient to make any impact on the cost of the health boards. That is an assertion and not based on an examination of facts.  I am not ruling out the possibility of improvements in these allowances at any time in the future.  I am speaking merely of the position as of now in relation to this Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case the Minister might consider introducing a somewhat more narrowly drawn form of dependent relative allowance which would be increased and have the type of effect on health board costs I have been talking about.  If certain facts could be proved which would suggest that a saving would be made, the Minister could give an increase then without any overall net cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in a married man's allowance is 29 per cent, in the single person's allowance it is 29 per cent and the increase in the widowed person's allowance is only 26 per cent. There is a difference of 3 per cent there which is not justified.  The Minister should bring the widowed person's allowance up to about £2,000 to get the same percentage increase as is being given to the married and single allowances. There is no real justification in fiscal policy for giving 26 per cent to widowed people and 29 per cent each to married and single people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an old argument and arises not only in this area but in the settlement of pay claims and so on if there are different categories.  Does one go for a flat percentage increase or a flat cash increase?  Whichever one goes for, one will get different results.  One could argue either way depending on which category one is in.  There is no right or wrong in it.  In cash terms, the increase is the same for both categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that people are starting from a high base and therefore the same cash increase yields a smaller percentage increase indicates that at some time in the past somebody thought that their needs were relatively greater than people in other categories. Otherwise they would not have had the high base in the first place.  Previous Ministers for Finance felt that the relative position of the widowed person against the single person&mdash;and the widowed person against the single person is getting approximately £70 more&mdash;and the relativity as between the two which existed in 1978 to 1979 should be maintained this year.  It was presumably based on an understanding of the relative needs of single people as against widowed people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say a brief word in response?  On a previous occasion on the previous Finance Bill I went in considerable detail into the argument in relation to the allowance as between single, widowed and married people.  The case is made frequently by single persons that there ought not be a bigger allowance to widows without dependants than to single persons.  Nevertheless I have gone into this in detail before and have explained the reasoning behind it and I do not propose to go over that again.  But I must direct the Deputies' attention to the fact that if we are talking about widowed persons with dependants I have introduced a special allowance in respect of these.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary effect of these amendments is to grant the single parent allowance to each parent in the case where parents are separated and where children reside with each parent for part of the year.  In these circumstances it is considered that both parents should get the allowance rather than have one allowance shared between them.  The deletion of subsection (3) achieves this.  Subsection (4) deals with the case of a separated father making maintenance payments in respect of a child and is unnecessary as the matter is already covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the three amendments on the section.  I welcome this and I thank the Minister for bringing it in.  Both myself and Deputy Eileen Desmond made a strong plea for this last year when the Finance <Col N="840" /> Bill was going through and I am very glad the Minister has agreed to bring in the amendments in this case.  It is something that was overdue but it is something that was needed because there is no doubt that the costs of a household for the single parent is very much greater than half the cost for a married couple.  That is a roundabout way of putting it but the Minister knows what I mean.  I wanted to increase the amount from £250 to £500.  I appreciate what the Minister has done but I want to put him on notice that if he and I are here next year I will be looking for an increase.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy says is correct but subject to the fact that they would have to qualify for the child allowance. In other words, they will have to have care of the child.  I do not know if the Deputy has in mind that people might try to work a quick one on this by simply having the child for one day. They would in fact have to have care of the child for part of the year.  I do not know if I can define what part of the year but it would have to be sufficient to enable them to qualify for the child allowance.</P>

This is a point I want to make clear.  This allowance will not be split.  Each of the parents would get the allowance separately.  The child allowance might be split but the allowance we are dealing with here will not be split.  If each of them qualifies each of them gets a separate allowance.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 5, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;As respects the year 1979-80 and any subsequent year of assessment so much of any contribution paid by a person under the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1979 and any subsequent enactment with which those Acts may be cited, shall be deducted from or set-off against the income of that person for the year of assessment in which the contribution is paid.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is quite clear.  It is to restore the position that was there up to last year when some proportion of the social welfare contributions made were allowable as tax deductions.  There is a section further on in the Finance Bill which will for the first time allow people who have taken out private insurance to recover, in the event of illness, their contributions as an allowance against tax.  But in the same Finance Bill we find that people who are making their insurance contributions to the State other than to an ordinary insurance company are being denied this benefit and this is a regressive step.  We are one of the few countries in Europe who do not allow social security contributions to be deducted for tax purposes. I know that in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands this is allowed and it is allowed in a peculiar way in France in so far as there is a 30 per cent blanket reduction on tax there which covers the ordinary welfare contributions.  I believe they are allowed in Denmark in a different way but the situation there is very much more complicated. <Col N="844" /> The social welfare code and the tax code are a lot more integrated than they are here and it is difficult to decide it.  Up to now they were not deductible. This year Ireland joined the UK in this matter.  We are not allowing social welfare contributions to be tax deductible. The Minister has said previously in relation to the 4 per cent which is being deducted that the allowance being made would be higher except for the tax deductible element of it.  People who are not taxpayers get the benefit of that as well as taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The level of contribution by the State to the social insurance fund has been steadily falling.  It has gone down from 35.6 per cent in 1972 to as low as 15.6 per cent in 1979.  It is difficult to see how the benefits of tax deductibility in the pay-related scheme will be evident to the people who are contributing this money. This is another point which will annoy taxpayers.  Those who pay social welfare contributions who are not taxpayers are still contributing this percentage point but they are not being allowed deduct their social welfare contributions against their taxable income.  Those who take out insurance with a private insurance company to cover them against illness are being allowed deduct their contributions against their taxable income.  In a year when the Finance Bill includes a provision which allows somebody who pays a premium to a private insurance company to deduct that for tax purposes the ordinary PAYE taxpayer, the ordinary social welfare contributor, who makes that insurance contribution to the State, is not being allowed deduct it for tax purposes.  The Minister should accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I made a point about the social welfare allowance which used to be part of the tax-free allowance certificate.  The Minister has already pointed out that the new rate of pay-related contribution takes account of the deduction and that most taxpayers are better off.  In section 10 short-term social welfare benefits will be regarded as part of the taxable income of people and we will tax them on that.  In all other aspects of the income tax code what is taxed as income from <Col N="845" /> one person is used in the expense of another person.  Perhaps a case could not be made previously that a person should be allowed his full social welfare stamp against his taxable income and that that person was not taxed when he got those benefits, unemployment benefit and so forth but in section 10 we have extended the principle of taxing short-term social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>I do not want to help Deputy Barry but there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for allowing the total social welfare contribution of an employee against his gross taxable income.  There would be no need to include that on his tax-free allowance certificate because his gross income would be less his social insurance, as superannuation is treated, and he would be taxed on that.  This would be allowed as a full deductible expense against his taxable income.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry asked why we could not revert to the previous position whereby a small part of the social welfare stamp&mdash;last year it was £64 and two years previous to that it was £48&mdash;would be deducted.  Even though the allowance was small then we did not have a section like section 10 in this year's Finance Bill.  We did not tax the person when he got unemployment benefit.  I would like to make the case that since we are extending the principle of taxing social welfare benefits the person paying social welfare contributions should be allowed deduct from his taxable income the total amount he pays.  This might help the Opposition and make things more difficult for the Minister.  It is a very important principle of the tax code that when people are allowed expenses against their profits in business those expenses must be the income of some other person.  When we are taxing a person on short-term social welfare benefits it is only logical to give him the full benefit of his social welfare contributions.  I know that section 10 will only have effect for the tax year 1980-81.  Perhaps the Minister will have time between now and next year to ensure that from 6 April 1980 the total social welfare contribution of an employee is allowed in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a reason for <Col N="846" /> bringing this country into line with other countries to allow for tax deductible purposes the welfare contributions which are made by PAYE people.  Deputy McCreevy has made my case for me.  I know he put it forward as an observation on what he saw as something illogical in the present system, that there are categories under the taxation code such as self-employed who quite legitimately can offset expenditure against tax and this is quite legal and approved of.  In the case of PAYE taxpayers it would lessen the sense of grievance which exists at the moment if they were allowed offset their social welfare contributions against income tax.</P>
      <P>This case is much stronger when we come to section 10 where almost 100,000 people who depend on benefits, unemployment, maternity allowances, deserted wives' benefits will become liable for tax.  This surely strengthens the case being made in relation to this section when we are looking for offsetting the contributions made under the welfare code for tax purposes.  I hope the Minister will look at this favourably.  I know we are talking about next year but he should consider that this is another area where his intervention might assist in removing some of the grievances which are felt at the moment by the PAYE categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to allow the fully pay-related social insurance contribution as a deduction for income tax purposes.  The cost of such a proposal would be of the order of £20 million this year and £31 million in a full year.  It will be clear that apart from any other consideration the cost would rule it out, but there are other considerations.</P>
      <P>It is quite misleading to present the case as it has been presented by some Deputies.  The fact is that under the new pay-related scheme the pay-related contribution has been calculated on a net basis, the contribution being 3.4 per cent rather than 3.9 per cent as it would have been if calculated on a gross basis.  The reason for this reduction is to compensate for the withdrawal of the income tax relief granted in respect of part of the former flat rate contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> If we are told, as Deputy O'Leary told us, that there ought to be allowed for tax purposes the amount of the social welfare contribution, then I have to put the question: does Deputy O'Leary wish that we should increase the social welfare contribution to 3.9 instead of the present 3.4 element, or is he saying that it should be allowed as an expense for tax purposes and in addition should be held at its present level and not be increased? If that is what he is saying, I am afraid it is dishonest.  It is trying to avoid the issue concerned.</P>
    <P>The fact is that up to now that part of the contribution to social welfare which was referable to the provision of widow's contributory pensions, orphans' contributory allowances, retirement pensions, old age contributory pensions and death grant was allowable for tax purposes and the income tax deduction in the ordinary case was £64.  The simplest thing would have been to continue with that arrangement.  However, for reasons which I do not think I need go into now, but which were spelt out by the Minister for Social Welfare in both Houses when introducing the Social Welfare Act, 1978, it was not possible administratively to provide a pay-related scheme. Heretofore it was not pay-related, it was a flat contribution.  Once it became pay-related, considerable difficulties arose relating to the anticipation of what the person's contribution should be during the year.  It was not possible to calculate it entirely in advance and the only practical way of dealing with this was to take away the income tax allowance, but the contributor was compensated by reducing the amount he would have to pay under the pay-related contribution and the effect on the Exchequer was the same.  In other words, the amount gained by the Exchequer by disallowing this as a tax allowance was lost by the Exchequer by way of additional contribution to the social welfare fund.</P>
    <P>It is a purely mechanical arrangement. The person concerned is no worse off.  He ends up with the same net position as before.  One Deputy referred to the fact that this benefits people who are not liable for income tax.  That is true, but I do not think administratively <Col N="848" /> anything else is possible.  Furthermore, a person who is not liable for income tax can, by definition, be taken to be very much among the lower paid.  I do not think that presents any major problem in dealing with this.  The bulk of the people concerned are liable for income tax and their position is precisely the same as it was before.  It is for purely mechanical, administrative, reasons that the change was made.</P>
    <P>That should not be misrepresented, and it is misrepresenting it to say that we provide in a later section of this Finance Bill for the allowance for health insurance contributions for the self-employed and we are taking away that allowance from those who are employed. That could be factually true, but in its implications it is misrepresenting the position.  It takes no cognisance of the fact that the person concerned is in precisely the same position in cash terms as he was before.  This is purely an administrative arrangement entered into for good reasons which have been explained in this House before.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, if one were to accept this amendment at the cost I mentioned, the only way it could be done would be by increasing correspondingly the amount of contribution to pay-related social welfare, assuming that could be done administratively.  What benefit would that be to anybody?  I do not think it would be worth the effort even if it could be done administratively, which it cannot.  If that is not what is sought, then what is being sought is, on the one hand, to reduce the pay-related contribution and, on the other hand, to allow the income tax allowance for which the person has already been compensated in pay-related contributions &mdash;in other words, to give it on the double. Deputy Barry has not made that case and I do not know whether he would try to justify it, but if that is not his case I see no real purpose in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not questioning it; I am curious.  The case had been made on numerous occasions during Question Time and in debates on Finance Bills, that people should not be taxed on their old age contributory pensions.  The reply always was that their contributions were tax deductible and that these people could not have it both ways.  The Minister says the pay-related element has been reduced to take account of the £64 they paid last year.  I do not know if that is right or wrong, but obviously there is something in the figures which does not add up&mdash;at least it is not obvious to me.  During the budget debate in this House on 7 February last, at column 705 of the Official Report, I said:</P>
      <P>But, in fairness, it is one of the points that the trade unions will want to know about before they negotiate a new wage agreement&mdash;what is the level of the stamp going to be in April after the pay-related scheme comes in?</P>
      <P>Mr. Haughey: Eleven point two per cent.</P>
      <P>He said all that was discussed long ago in the House and was fixed.  If that was so in February why was it 13.6 per cent on 6 April, 4.4 per cent from the employee and about 9 per cent from the employer?  It is not 11.2 per cent.  If the Minister is making the case that there is a 3.9 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this is not my area and therefore I do not have the whole of this at my fingertips, but I think that the 11.2 per cent which the Minister for Social Welfare prepared was the total of the various items including the health contributions and that the figure which the Deputy has mentioned of 14 per cent or thereabouts is the total contribution including the employer's</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would yield to me for the moment I will quote what the Minister for Social Welfare said on the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1978, as reported in the Official Report of 9 November, 1978, column 598, volume 309:</P>
      <P>There was some confusion about the rates of contribution that will come into operation under the new legislation.  Section 5 provides for a standard rate of social insurance contribution of 11.2 per cent.  That will be made up of 3.4 per cent from the employee and 7.8 per cent from the employer.  That contribution will cover benefits other than occupational injury.  That is paid exclusively by the employer and, from now on, it will be at the rate of .45 per cent.  Now the 3.4 per cent employee contribution is, in fact, 3.9 per cent.  That 3.9 per cent is reduced by .5 of 1 per cent to compensate for the fact that the pension element of the contribution will no longer be deductible for income tax purposes.  That .5 of 1 per cent concession in the employee's rate is related directly to what will be lost to employees and gained by the Exchequer because of the fact that we will no longer be able, for administrative reasons, to make the deduction in income tax to allow for the pension element in the contribution rate.</P>

      <P>Maybe not; I am not sure.  But the Minister says it would have to be contributed by somebody else.  I made the point, which the Minister did not answer, that the Government contribution to the social insurance fund has decreased this year.  It has gone down from 20.8 per cent to 15.1 per cent.  If that had been kept at the 1978 level it would go some of the way towards meeting the shortfall this year.  As Deputy McCreevy said&mdash;I do not wish to put him in a spot&mdash;when people pay insurance it should be deductible.  That is the net point I am making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Offhand I cannot comment on the Deputy's figures for the overall Government contribution to the social welfare fund.  I do not have that information here at the moment. However, I can tell him that the calculation of the different shares of contribution to that on the introduction of pay related social welfare was gone into in considerable detail and was the subject of detailed discussions and negotiations with the trade union and employer representatives.  The Deputy can rest assured that every step of the calculations was examined with a magnifying glass. As I have indicated in the quotation of the Minister for Social Welfare at that time, the result of the calculations was to show that what should have been a 3.9 per cent contribution was reduced specifically to 3.4 per cent precisely to compensate for the abolition of the tax allowance.  The question of whether this should be tax-allowable may be a nice point of theory but in practice it is not possible to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, the point that I am making is that if this amendment were to be accepted if it were administratively possible, it would mean simply that the social welfare contribution would be increased in order to allow the tax allowance to be made.  Otherwise, what <Col N="852" /> the Deputy is seeking is to have it allowed both ways, in a reduced contribution and in a tax allowance.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), line 38, before &ldquo;labour&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;insulation materials and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister is giving a tax-free allowance in respect of labour costs of certain building works, and this is very welcome even though it is to be for only one year.  If it is right in principle I do not see why it is given only for one year but that is a matter we can discuss on the section.  The purpose of my amendment is that in so far as insulation is concerned we should not only give the tax allowance in respect of labour costs but also in respect of materials.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about the materials involved but that is not what the amendment says.  I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but I want to be clear about what we are dealing with. The Deputy referred to materials which seem to me to relate to amendment No. 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about insulation costs.  I am not trying to extend it to materials other than insulation materials.  In fact, it was never my intention to do so.  Amendment No. 10 was not designed to extend it; it was merely to make the Schedule consistent with the section if the amendments in my name were accepted.  That is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must take urgent action to increase the level of insulation in our houses in order to take account of the energy situation.  This is getting worse all the time because we are relying to a <Col N="854" /> great extent on imported energy to keep our economy going and to heat our houses.  Various people made optimistic forecasts about native sources of energy being developed, about offshore gas and so on.  These forecasts may have given grounds for optimism three or four years ago but they have not been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>At the moment we import very substantial amounts of energy.  In 1977 some 80 per cent of our energy needs were supplied from outside the country and only 20 per cent from within the country.  The Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy estimated in their White Paper on energy needs that by 1990 only 11 per cent, as against 20 per cent, of our then energy needs will be met from within the country and 89 per cent will be met from outside the country.  The Department might be expected to be optimistic but their projection shows an increasing dependence on externally supplied energy and a doubling of the over-all energy consumption by our economy between now and 1990. That doubling of energy consumption is deemed by the Department and perhaps by others as absolutely necessary to achieve the increased employment needed to provide jobs for our young people.  Every new job increases considerably the demand for energy.</P>
    <P>The consumption of energy for essential purposes, namely, the maintenance and creation of employment, will be doubled while the proportion of energy supplied from domestic sources will be halved.  Therefore, there is a very strong case for eliminating every form of waste. One prime way in which energy is wasted is as a result of bad insulation of houses.  The insulation of practically every house in the country could be improved. We could make a dramatic reduction in our overall energy consumption if this were done, thus releasing substantial amounts of energy for use in essential purposes such as the preservation and creation of jobs rather than heating the air around houses because those houses are not sufficiently insulated.  What we are doing is sending valuable energy, purchased at extremely high cost to the State and to our balance of payments, up into the air to heat the <Col N="855" /> stratosphere over Ireland where it is of no benefit to anyone.</P>
    <P>We are one of the countries who have not given sufficient attention to insulation. There are wide differences from one country to another in the level of insulation of houses.  Even though the climate in Sweden is far colder than in Holland or the UK, it has been shown that it takes less energy to heat houses there than in the two other countries.  This is because houses in Sweden are properly insulated while houses in Holland and the UK are not.  Although I do not have information about Ireland, I imagine the same is probably true about us and probably we are in the same category as the UK.</P>
    <P>This amendment is a modest move in the direction of encouraging people to insulate their houses.  It is particularly necessary to insulate roofs.  Much money is spent on insulating windows but the heat loss through windows is quite small.  The big loss of heat is through roofs.  Tremendous savings could be achieved if roofs were properly insulated.  In any tax allowances the materials used for insulation should be included with labour costs as an item deductible against tax liability.  If the Minister would consider doing this it would be in line with the over-all policies of his Government in trying to reduce our dependence on unnecessary imported energy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  There is a reference in the Second Schedule which I cannot find now but I think it refers to improvements to houses, including insulation&mdash;the last two words were in brackets.  I shall have a lot to say about the Schedule later because it appears to me that it is designed to ensure that nobody can claim relief under it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for the Environment was asked at Question Time about a special grant for house insulation. He said the cost of insulation, of cylinder lagging and draught stripping which he had already mentioned were taken into consideration and may be reckoned in calculating the appropriate <Col N="856" /> amount of the improvement grant.  The Minister was questioned about this. Evidently one cannot get a separate grant for insulation from the Department of the Environment.  If one does a general scheme of improvements which includes insulation, then insulation is grant-aided.</P>
    <P>Because of the energy situation it is essential that we take measures to reduce our consumption of energy.  Section 6 of the Finance Bill should encourage people to insulate their houses, not inhibit them.  The grant scheme is a good idea but I have grave doubts whether it is workable having regard to the conditions in the Second Schedule.  I should like an assurance from the Minister.  The surest way of achieving saving in energy would be to accept the amendment put down by Deputy Bruton and by me to include not only labour costs but also the cost of materials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What assurance is the Deputy seeking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 allows a person to claim for the labour content in improvements to his house and garden. Deputy Bruton and I are seeking to ensure that not alone the labour cost where insulation is involved but the cost of materials also could be claimed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the amendment says.  Is the Deputy asking for an assurance about that, in other words asking me to accept the amendment? Or, is he asking something else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am asking the Minister to accept the amendment.  If the Minister has any other assurances to suggest that would encourage people to insulate their houses and save energy the House would certainly welcome them. Many amendments could be worked in under this section that would help the drive for conservation of energy in the context of insulation.  Perhaps we could even extend the section to the use of cars, so that people who get their cars regularly serviced, use high grade fuel, keep cars balanced with correct tyre pressures and so on would benefit.  All these are savings.  Much of the energy in <Col N="857" /> the motoring field goes out through the exhaust pipe and is wasted because people do not keep their cars in good condition and over-drive them.  By using the tax mechanism and perhaps through this section of the Finance Act, if people could be encouraged in that direction it would be very welcome, in addition to doing what Deputy Bruton and I suggest, giving relief for the material used in the insulation of a house as well as for the labour content of the improvement in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been pointed out, the section to which this amendment relates is specified to operate for one year only.  The reason for that is that it is introduced on a pilot basis.  It is a new concept for the income tax code and we must see how it works.  It is not an unreasonable assumption that if it works well it is likely to continue beyond the end of the present year although I cannot give an assurance to that effect in advance.  I mention this because Deputies should see it in the context of being a pilot scheme or experiment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister define &ldquo;working well&rdquo;&mdash;no claims or a lot of claims?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of genuine claims, I would say, would mean it was working well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Revenue Commissioners agree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they would but they would be concerned about a lot of claims which were either spurious or in respect of which there were reasonable grounds for suspicion.  Deputies will be aware that one of the primary purposes of this arrangement is to encourage employment and for that purpose the relief is confined to expenditure on labour rather than on materials.  We do not want to see a situation in which relief is being given in respect of work where the great bulk of expenditure is on materials and there is little or no assistance to employment.  That is why the provision is there confining the relief to <Col N="858" /> the expenditure on labour.  We want to see how this works.</P>
      <P>In regard to energy conservation it is clearly a matter of very great importance and concern to all of us.  Many people might argue that the conservation of houses so that they do not fall in decay and have to be replaced with all the economic consequences is equally, or some people might say more, important and would argue that expenditure of that kind should be treated at least as favourably as we propose to treat energy.  I fully accept that it is necessary to encourage conservation of energy and in particular an important way of doing that would be by adequate insulation particularly in houses and in other buildings also.  There are grants available&mdash;it may be that technically grants are not available specifically for insulation&mdash;which cover insulation work; I have heard of cases where they have been received.  That aspect of it is not my direct responsibility but so far as the tax code can be used effectively to encourage conservation of energy of course as a member of the Government I am fully willing to facilitate a development of that kind.  But first I would need to be convinced by my colleagues and particularly by the Minister for Industry Commerce and Energy that such an arrangement would be effective in helping to conserve energy.</P>
      <P>Secondly, even if that were so I think it would be necessary for me to examine it very closely to see if, for instance there would have to be a differentiation between the allowance in respect of labour and the allowance in respect of materials, assuming it was for insulation purposes.  I would be apprehensive about a situation in which the bulk of the allowance was going, even in the case of insulation, for materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to convey to the House that the section in respect of which this amendment is put down is an experiment. I am not ruling out the possibility of it being used for the purpose of encouraging energy conservation by encouraging insulation but I cannot accept that in the experimental stage it should incorporate that.  If it were to do so in due course the Minister for Industry, <Col N="859" /> Commerce and Energy would require to be convinced that it was a worthwhile project and in those circumstances I would have to consider whether it would be wise to contemplate granting the allowance in respect of the materials used, either wholly or to a very large extent. Offhand, I think it would not be right and that we would have to ensure that the bulk of the allowance would go in respect of labour in order to encourage employment.  But I am not closing the door on the idea.  I cannot accept it in relation to the operation of this section on an experimental basis as it will now be operating.  Changes may be possible later but I cannot accept it as part of the experimentation in the circumstances I have described.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Dáil yesterday I asked if it was correct that where insulation work was done as part of a general scheme of improvement it was grant-aided. The Minister replied that it was under the ordinary improvement grant.  I asked why it could not be done separately and the Minister replied that the cost of insulation, cylinder lagging and draught stripping could be taken into consideration and reckoned in calculating the amount of the improvement grant.  I asked: &ldquo;Only if they are part of a general improvement?&rdquo;  The Minister replied: &ldquo;They may be reckoned in calculating the appropriate amount of the grant under the existing house improvements grants scheme.&rdquo;  He continually batted it back and it is quite obvious that the only way you can get an aid towards insulating your house from the Department of the Environment is by carrying out an improvement to your house, in other words, adding a wing, putting on a new roof or something else that qualifies for an improvement grant.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy Mrs. Desmond on Tuesday, 15 May 1979:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, aware that 1979 has been designated International Year of the Child and that in the Republic of Ireland four Ministers are currently responsible for the position of children in Irish Society, calls on:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> Debate resumed on the following amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;approves of the continuing action being taken by the Government to improve the quality of life for Irish children.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Health.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The memorandum contained in the motion is full of excellent items, none of which we could fail to agree with.  I should like to draw attention to a particular group of children who are neglected, not by a deliberate act of omission on the part of an agency or Department but because they slip through a chink in the social care network.  I am talking about the offspring of itinerant parents and children who sleep rough.  The position in regard to these children is not satisfactory.  I have tried to ascertain what can be done to improve the lot of these children, how many there are and so on.  As I suspected, the extent of the problem is not clear.  A reply to one of my questions to the Minister for Health on 1 May, which asked about the number of children taken into care last year, indicated that there were about 60 such children.  The number of other children who may be sleeping rough at any given time does not come within the statutory jurisdiction of any agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been specific instances of children being left alone for extremely long periods.  This can happen to itinerant children whose parents get into trouble with the law.  In one case I understand that a number of children, one as young as six months, were discovered by accident after a week.  It may be that these incidents are inevitable.  A number of instances have been quoted to me.  In one case it was alleged that a child had been either deliberately maimed by scalding or had been accidentally maimed and deliberately refused treatment by its parents.  The maiming was seen as augmenting the child's begging value and the child was left on O'Connell Bridge.  When social care people were about to prevent the unfortunate child from further suffering the child was <Col N="863" /> taken away by its parents.  I do not know whether that allegation is accurate but I am convinced from my own inquiries that the incident may have occurred.</P>
    <P>A number of agencies are responsible in general terms for children in those circumstances. The tragedy may be that there is no one specifically charged with the job.  In this context a tribute should be paid to the Garda, who on apprehending itinerants or others&mdash;I am not suggesting that all itinerants are unworthy parents&mdash;try to ensure that children are not left to fend for themselves.  However, these children should not be the exclusive responsibility of the Garda.  These circumstances can also arise when parents are taken to hospital.  The health boards have a function in these matters but I am not satisfied that they are carrying out their function in accordance with the spirit intended. It is not adequate simply to remove parents without statutorily laying down some mechanism whereby the suffering of the children is gauged.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that children have suffered unnecessarily because of a policy which does not necessitate safe person orders being obtained from the courts.  These are orders which would allow responsible authorities to remove children to safety and they are not sought as a matter of form.  On 20 April I asked the Minister for Justice how many of these orders had been made and the Minister replied that the information sought was not available.  My conclusion is that there is a weakness in this area.  It is not a matter for political jollification.  I am sure that all parties would wish to close the loophole as soon as possible.  If anyone is interested I can bring them this evening to a basement in Abbey Street in which 20 to 30 children sleep in the middle of garbage.  These children, some of them very young, are wandering and have left home.</P>
    <P>In a report to the Dublin City Council some time ago, the City Manager indicated:</P>
    <P>From the discussions with the representatives of the Health Board it appears that there may be defects in the legislation&mdash;i.e. the Children's Act <Col N="864" /> 1908&mdash;which might inhibit effective steps being taken in some instances to help these children.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>However, it is felt that action to try and help these children cannot be deferred until a reception centre is provided.</P>
    <P>The City Manager, who is an excellent person, is committed to that statement, which is positive affirmation that something needs to be done urgently.  I have no doubt that the Minister will do what is possible in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>A number of voluntary and full-time social workers have been concerned with this problem for a long time.  Their efforts may bear fruit if we improve the situation.  The children I speak of have lost the interest of their parents.  A number of other suggestions would be helpful.  An all-party committee on children's rights should be established under the aegis of a Minister of State specifically charged with the task of implementing a charter of children's rights. I should be pleased to see the initiation of a national child development study which would allow us to monitor the progress of children.  The benefits to be gained from such an approach would be substantial.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from an article by Julia Henderson which was published in <i>People</i> in the context of a special report on the Year of the Child.  She says:</P>
    <P>What then are the prospects for children in the short-term and in the medium-term in the year 2000?  With massive numbers of children living in countries where poverty, disease and illiteracy are still the lot of the majority of the population it is hardly realistic to expect that great improvements in meeting the basic needs of children will take place in the short run.  More than half of these children will be undernourished.  More than half will not find a place in school and will go for only a few years if they do. While their parents will continue to be swept up in great migrations, in natural disasters and in wars the benefits of development schemes will <Col N="865" /> be slow to reach the subsistence farmer or the shanty-town dweller. Governments are likely to make many resounding policy statements but the fulfilment of these plans will constantly be curtailed because of an economic or political crisis, a flood, a plague of locusts or a civil war.  The year 1977 was such a sombre year that the executive director of UNICEF reported to his board.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if the Minister can, he will ensure that 1979 will not be such a sombre year.  The prospects for children internationally in many cases give grounds for pessimism.  If we can have some concrete monitoring of the proposals over the next year to achieve concrete realistic results a good job will be done.  If it needs co-operation from the Members of the House that will be forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that part of the motion that is specifically related to the Department of Justice.  For the purpose of the Year of the Child the word &ldquo;child&rdquo; is taken as including people up to 12 years of age.  As far as persons up to 12 years are concerned, I have a direct interest in such matters as adoption, the age of criminal responsibility and the suggestion that children should have a separate representation as far as that relates to legal proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with adoption in a moment. The other topics I have mentioned will be dealt with in the report of the Task Force on Child Care to which the Minister for Health referred last night. They are complex matters that cannot be dealt with by a few strokes of a pen. It must be obvious from the length of time the experts on the Task Force have taken to produce their recommendations that the difficulties in doing so are far greater than some interested parties have been telling us.  If the age of criminal responsibility was to be raised, the problem of what to do about young people who commit serious offences against the person and against property would remain.  This brings me to Loughan House.  Although referred to in the motion, it caters only for boys who are <Col N="866" /> above the age of 12 and therefore outside of the definition of child for the purpose of the Year of the Child.</P>
    <P>The project by which Loughan House was adapted to be a recognised special school for the type of boy who could not be detained in any of the existing schools has been the target of a fierce and largely dishonest attack.  I feel about it now as I did when it was initiated.  I make no apology whatever for the project.  When this Government came to office we were acutely aware from our contacts and from Garda reports that a serious and growing problem of lawlessness by a small number of youths in the 12 to 16 years age bracket demanded urgent attention. The nettle was grasped.  The Department of Education were instructed to provide, as soon as possible, a new school which would be sufficiently secure so that those sent there by the courts could not simply walk out again. The planning of that school is in hand and progress has been made on it.</P>
    <P>As an interim measure, Loughan House was made secure by the enclosure of ten acres of buildings and land and simultaneously major renovations and improvements were carried out.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to thank the Office of Public Works for the magnificent effort they made.  The work was done at great speed and to the highest of standards.  I should also pay the highest possible compliments to the staff who work in Loughan House and who are doing tremendous job there on behalf of the community.  I thank them for their patience and forbearance in not reacting to the many criticisms made of them in the earlier stages of this programme.  Subject to necessary restrictions regarding the type of boy accommodated in Loughan House a great deal is being done to make the boys' stay there as happy and fruitful as possible. The range of educational and other facilities provided there compare very favourably with those in other special schools.  The boys are given every opportunity to derive benefit from the educational and many indoor and outdoor recreational facilities available.  One or two of them are engaged in employment on a part-time basis in the district <Col N="867" /> and one or two have been allowed home for family celebrations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the call for considerable improvements in the training of gardai to help them in dealing with children and young people, provision has been made for a high standard of training of this type.  Apart from formal instructions under the various children Acts, training sessions are devoted to instruction on social and youth work. Recruits are exhorted to become involved in the organisation of youth clubs and activities of this kind.  They are also instructed on behaviour patterns which can arise as a consequence of mental illness and are given a basic understanding of delinquent behaviour and how attitudes of young children can be influenced by environmental conditions.</P>
    <P>There is a special scheme called the juvenile liaison officer scheme in the force for dealing specifically with children.  Under this scheme, selected members of the force maintain contact with and provide guidance to juveniles who may have got into trouble with the law or may be in danger of doing so. This scheme is being extended to give a service in all the larger centres of population. It is at present in operation in 21 centres and the number of juvenile liaison officers is 44.  It is my intention to continue the development of this scheme.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, I recently introduced legislation to provide for a referendum to amend the Constitution to protect existing and future adoptions from being declared invalid on the grounds that they were not made by a court.  While the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, that is the Adoption Bill, was fully supported by both Houses, some people considered it did not go far enough and advocated further changes.  In the debates in both Houses, I explained why I could not accept the suggestions put forward.  The element of certainty and security which the current law affords to the vast majority of people concerned could be seriously threatened by some changes intended to benefit a small minority of cases which would have repercussions in other cases <Col N="868" /> that would not be advocated by anybody.  I am disappointed that the question of amending the Constitution to provide that in adoption proceedings the child's welfare must be paramount is being pursued.  I thought I had succeeded in convincing the House of what a dangerous measure this might be and what wholly unacceptable consequences might flow from it.  I believe that I had some success with my powers of persuasion during the course of the debates. Some who were very strong advocates of a provision that would require the courts and the Adoption Board to treat the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration have since retreated from that position.  I see that the wording of the Labour Party motion is not quite the same as the one I had to criticise.  I can only urge those who have not already done so and who were not in the House during the course of the debate on the Adoption Bill to read very carefully the speech I made in the House on 7 February last on the Second Stage of the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution (Adoption) Bill.  I am in any case satisfied that the courts can be relied on to give due weight to the interests of the child in adoption and custody issues.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the concept of illegitimacy was one of the issues with which I dealt and as I explained at that time in dealing with this proposal very important considerations have to be taken into account.  Unless we abandon the institutions of marriage and of the family based on marriage the fact will remain that some are born within them and some are not.  That fact which has greatest practical effect so far as the present law is concerned relates to inheritance rights.  The law in this respect can be of course changed and the Law Commission will be considering it as part of their programme.  To put legitimate and illegitimate children on a completely equal basis in regard to their inheritance rights could be very unfair in some cases.  For instance a child of a casual encounter in a man's early life could turn up out of the blue and claim an equal interest in the man's estate which could have been built up in co-operation with his wife and their children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> There has been a serious misunderstanding in regard to the attitude of successive Ministers for Justice towards research in the field of adoption.  The impression has been given, and wrongly, that Ministers were unwilling to pay out the money.  The fact is that as far back as 1972 the initiative was taken by the then Minister, Mr. O'Malley, in suggesting to the Adoption Board that a suitable research project should be undertaken. In 1976 the board arranged that the ESRI form a preliminary outline of a research programme.  Discussions have since taken place between the board and the Department of Justice and between the board and adoption societies and further proposals from the board are awaited.  The pressure for regulations for adoption societies appears to stem from a reverence for the British system.  Incidentally that approach ignores the difference in the scale of operation because all our adoption orders are made by a single board with its own welfare staff to check on each case.  In Britain adoption orders are made by the courts who very often have an inadequate inspectorial system.  The aim originally was to regulate them to ensure standards and one cannot prescribe standards by regulations and this is probably recognised now by all concerned.  What can be done is to prescribe procedures.  When the Adoption Bill of 1974 was being debated the then Minister Senator Cooney asked the board whether they wished to have statutory powers to prescribe procedures for societies and the board said that they were satisfied that not only were such powers unnecessary but that they could have harmful effects.  Let me say that contrary to the impression that some people appear to have the societies never at any time argued against the idea of regulations.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the call for easier and more frequent access for children to parents who are in prison is that offenders have a statutory right to one visit per week.  Because of security and management problems it is not practicable to increase the statutory number of allowable visits but where an offender requires additional visits because of personal or domestic problems prison <Col N="870" /> governors generally allow special visits. In this, the year of the child, governors have been very conscious of the needs of offenders' children in considering applications for special visits.  In practice, however, many offenders do not wish their children to know that they are in prison.  Others prefer that their children should not visit them in a prison environment. Our temporary release system is geared very much towards helping offenders to renew or strengthen their relationships with their wives and children and families.  Most offenders serving sentences in Shelton Abbey or in the training unit or in Shanganagh Castle are allowed home leave once each month and other offenders, particularly those serving long sentences are allowed occasional home leave as part of their resocialisation programme.  These outings normally coincide with important family events such as births, first communions or confirmations.  The temporary release system has been gradually developed over recent years and the number of such releases in 1979 is likely to show a significant increase over previous years as the position of offenders' children has been particularly in the minds of those dealing with these releases.</P>
    <P>In the context of these motions I should mention the welfare service of my Department which is the primary means of contact that the Department of Justice has with children and with young persons.  This service has been greatly expanded in recent times.  The current authorised strength of the service is one principal welfare officer, 15 senior welfare officers and 115 welfare officers. The staff of the service is deployed in two main areas, the courts and the places of detention.  However, it must be emphasised that although the staff work in different areas there is close contact between them.  The supervision and help provided by the welfare service during the period of probation or detention often provides the support that is necessary to enable a young person to cope with the difficult years of transition from childhood to adolescence.  Recently a new scheme which we call the intensive supervision scheme was introduced.  This scheme is being applied initially to <Col N="871" /> young people in custody in the 16 to 21 age group.  The scheme involves intensive supervision by each welfare officer assigned to the scheme of a small group of five or six of those young offenders. The idea is that the offenders will be given enough counselling and support to enable them to cope with their problems in their own community.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment will not have any opportunity because of the time restrictions to participate personally in this debate so I would like to say a few words on his behalf.  The Government are committed to a high level of progress on the local authority housing programme.  It is recognised that many families in genuine housing need because of their financial or other circumstances look to local authority housing for accommodation. Accordingly since they took office in July 1977 the Government have provided substantial capital funds for the building of new local authority houses.  In 1978 the public capital expenditure on local authority housing amounted to £81.24 million.  Subsidies payable to the Exchequer in respect of the existing local authority houses amounted to £45 million in that year and the number of local authority dwellings completed in 1978 was 6,073.  While this was a satisfactory level of completion the programme in that year was affected by a number of unavoidable factors&mdash;we had extremely bad weather conditions particularly during the summer months and the output was 260 less than the previous year's figure of 6,333. However, the level of activity on the overall local authority housing programme, as measured by the average number of monthly dwellings under construction throughout the year and average monthly employment maintained in 1978, is at a very high level.  The average monthly number of dwellings in progress was 8,636 in 1978 compared with 8,702 in 1977 and 8,100 in 1976.  The average monthly employment in 1978 was 6,500 with smaller figures for 1977 and 1976.</P>
    <P>In order to maintain the progress of recent years on the programme and to sustain employment, the Government have provided £86 million for local <Col N="872" /> authority housing in the 1979 Public Capital Programme.  This provision will enable building activity and employment to continue at or about the same level as 1978.  Furthermore, the Government will provide subsidies to the value of £54.35 million for local authority dwellings in 1979.  At the general level, but particularly from the viewpoint of families with children seeking good quality housing, it is relevant to point out that the percentage of families of three persons or fewer on approved waiting lists has improved from 50 some years ago to 60 in 1976, to 64 in 1977 and to 65 in 1978. This trend underlines the inroads which have been made in recent years through tackling urgent housing needs.</P>
    <P>The public programme provision of £86 million for local authority housing in 1979 includes £4 million for the low-rise house purchase mortgage scheme. This scheme is designed primarily to encourage persons in existing local authority houses and persons who would otherwise look to a local authority for housing, to provide their own accommodation. It is expected that about 500 applicants will benefit from the low-rise mortgage scheme in 1979 and this figure plus completions of the order of 6,000 houses in 1979 and casual vacancies in existing housing estates should enable the authorities to provide alternative housing accommodation to between 9,000 to 9,500 approved applicants this year.</P>
    <P>Everyone would agree that so long as there are families who are dependent on the State and public authorities to provide them with satisfactory housing accommodation, it would be desirable that as much money as possible be provided for this laudable purpose. However, the total amount of capital resources to which the Government have access for all purposes is limited.  The Government have indicated that priority in the use of the available resources must be directed to productive investment, the creation of employment and the development of the economic base which governs the rate of expansion possible in social expenditure.</P>
    <P>Local authority housing must compete with other urgent essential services <Col N="873" /> in its claims upon available funds.  In allocating these funds the Government must look not only at demands for more local authority housing but also at the very high price which the community must pay for such housing.  A typical local authority three-bedroomed house starting now in the Dublin area is likely to end up costing £18,000.  Unfortunately paying out the capital cost is only the start of the cost to the community.  Each such house now provided can cost the State up to £2,200 per annum in repayment of loan charges.  It is too facile an approach to call for greatly increased investment in local authority housing and ignore the fact that if more of available resources is used for this purpose there will be that much less capital for other essential projects and proportionately less of current revenue available for such items as social welfare payments, subsidies to education and so on.</P>
    <P>The Government's present approach to local authority housing is reasonable and generous.  Between new local authority dwellings, low rise mortgages and vacancies in existing dwellings, it is estimated that between 9,000 and 9,500 families on waiting lists are being offered alternative accommodation annually at present.  The percentage of families of four persons or more&mdash;mainly two parents and two children&mdash;on approved waiting lists has fallen substantially in recent years and local authorities are commonly rehousing smaller families at the present time.</P>
    <P>As regards recreational facilities in local authority housing schemes, all plans for new schemes must include adequate and suitable provision for recreational and amenity areas, including specific provision of play spaces for children.  Local authorities are encouraged to equip these play spaces for smaller children with suitable play equipment. The play areas for smaller children are sited whenever possible within sight of the parents at home.  In the larger schemes areas are reserved for development as football pitches and so forth.</P>

      <P>It is a measure of the seriousness of this motion and of the CARE memorandum on which it is based that it has been responsible for some of the most serious and thoughtful contributions from the Government benches on a Private Members' motion that I have listened to for some time.  I was not in the House last night for the speech of the Minister for Health, but I have read the unrevised text of it.  While I will be making certain comments on it in the course of my speech, it is fair to say that it represents a very serious attempt to meet some of the very pertinent questions which have been posed in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Year of the Child, which is what we are dealing with in this motion, is of fundamental importance.  While paying some tribute to the Government's speeches on this motion during the debate, I am afraid that the Labour Party cannot accept the bland and unsatisfactory amendment in the name of the Government.  If the Government had gone into more detail and specified some of the action which they have taken and for which they ask our approval, we might have looked at it again, but a bland catch all amendment like the one moved last night cannot, unfortunately, <Col N="875" /> meet the needs of the situation.  Indeed, even in some of the points in the speeches from the other side of the House we have had an admission, however genuinely regretfully expressed, that some of the things which had been planned for the Year of the Child are not now absolutely guaranteed.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to comment on every single aspect of the motion because that could take weeks rather than minutes.  I want to comment on some of the things which appear to me to be most pertinent and to comment on some of the observations which have been made by speakers on the other side of the House.  It is a pity that the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Education did not have an opportunity to intervene in this debate.  If the Government would see their way to extending Private Members' Time I am sure we could come to some agreement on that kind of an arrangement as well.</P>
    <P>The first part of the motion calls on the Minister for Health for an early, final report from the Task Force on Child Care Services.  I was very sorry to hear the Minister for Health say that it is now to some degree uncertain that he will have the legislation based on the report before the end of the year.  I accept that his commitment to it is genuine, but I cannot understand why there should be a particular problem in producing this legislation before the end of the year.  We are not asking for it to be passed, we are not even asking for it to be debated; we are asking for it to be introduced in this House before the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

Obviously no Minister can give an absolute commitment in relation to the passage of legislation or even to its debate, because that depends on what happens on either side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an assurance from the Minister in his speech that the Task Force on Child Care is adequately staffed.  I will take this opportunity of asking him to have another look at the staffing and see whether an extra staff member or two might make the necessary difference to produce the report before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Section 1.2 of the motion urges the establishment of a Child Care Development Unit in the Department of Health. The reason for this is also related to the impending report and the legislation which will be based on the report.  Sections 1.2 and 1.3 in a sense go together because they call for structural change in the administration of services for child care which would have an on-going effect. The task force will report&mdash;we do not know what its report will be like&mdash;and the legislation will be drafted and introduced, but we do not know what the legislation will be like.  The task force report will be published and the legislation will be passed, but unless there is a continuous and specific input into the whole area of child care by way of review, the danger is that the impetus which child care will have got from the Year of the Child will have been decimated.</P>
      <P>The motion envisages basically two mechanisms.  One is the Child Care Development Unit within the Department of Health and the second is the National Council for Child Care Services outside the Department.  We do not see these two mechanisms as being in any sense hostile to each other We see them in a fundamental sense as being complementary to each other.  The need for a development unit within the Department is fairly clear.  There is&mdash;and this is not by any means a criticism of any of the hard-working public servants in that Department&mdash;a shortage of professional expertise in the area of child care.  I believe there is only one specific child care adviser in the Department of Health at the moment and one child care adviser in the Department of Education.  It is better to have one than none, but we want more than that.  We want a development unit inside the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> The Minister will remember that one of the most fundamental and successful developments in the field of education in recent years was the creation of a development unit inside the Department of Education and the creation of that unit was the sole recommendation of the OECD study on <i>Investment in Education.</i> Many of the better ideas for the development of our educational system sprang at that time from the development unit which was therein established.</P>
    <P>We must have something permanent and substantial, something that will carry weight in the internal councils of the Department of Health.  Outside the Department we need a watchdog.  We need an organisation like the National Council for Child Care Services which will have various rights.  I said I did not see it as being hostile to the Department. I would envisage such a council having among its membership public servants as well as people from the world of child care and public figures outside the Department, but it should be independent and be seen to be independent.  It should act as a consultative body to the Minister for Health and should have the right to publish reports, presumably on an annual basis, in order to determine what lines of development action might take in the future.</P>
    <P>At the moment, for example, there is very little informed criticism of what the health boards are doing in the area of child care.  We have our suspicions here and there that feet are being dragged, but we do not really know.  A body like the National Council for Child Care Services would have as a major priority the monitoring of activity in the child care area in the health boards, would be able to take almost a quasi-supervisory function off the Minister's shoulders and would be able to advise him on the effectiveness of individual health boards in administering child care services and on the effectiveness of different methods of child care that may be adopted by different health boards.</P>
    <P>Better than that would be the action by such a national council in proposing a five-year plan for the development of child care services.  The Minister for Health in his intervention suggested that <Col N="878" /> he was somewhat suspicious of the call for a National Council for Child Care Services because it might be based on the idea that children were in some sense different and separate.  He preferred to see child care in the overall context of community care and family care.  With respect we must differ from him on this because the critical thing about children is that they have nobody to speak for them.  They do not have votes.  They do not have advocates in our society.  We tend to talk a lot about them and use a lot of rhetoric about them.  Everybody is in favour of child care but there is no public organisation as such, like the National Council for Child Care Services, which would put the welfare of children first and which would act as their advocate both in public and in a consultative forum with the Minister for Health.  This is why we endorse the CARE proposal that such a national council should be established and should report to the Minister on the operation and development of all child care services.</P>
    <P>Section 1.4 deals with two particular issues which it suggests should receive priority.  The first is that of foster parents.  As Deputy E. Desmond pointed out last night, there are about 2,500 children in public care at the moment, and a large proportion of them are in residential care.  These are mostly legitimate children who, for one reason or another, have been taken into care. They cannot be legally adopted but they can be legally fostered.  Last night the Minister for Health gave us whatever assurance he was able to give that health boards, whose responsibility the promotion of fostering is, were doing all that needed to be done in this area; but we would have needed more evidence than he gave us to be absolutely certain that this is the case.</P>
    <P>The whole tradition of fosterage is something that has a very honourable and ancient background in Ireland, yet there are still 2,500 of these children in public care.  Obviously, some children come into public care and others leave; we are not talking about the same 2,500 children all the time.  If there was any <Col N="879" /> really satisfactory attempt to get a positive system or network off the ground we should see the over-all number of such children reducing by at least 100 or 150 a year.  Obviously, there will have to be always some children in public care, but we should be trying to reduce that number of children to the bare minimum.</P>
    <P>Money and staff need to be allocated if necessary to the health boards in order to promote a greater public awareness of fostering.  It is a very labour-intensive job, but there are few things on which money could be better spent than in helping to provide for the welfare of children who are at present in residential care.  A distinction is sometimes made and sometimes accepted by the public between productive and non-productive employment in the public sector.  It is often assumed that employees of the State who do not actually make things are in some sense non-productive.  Here we are talking about productivity in terms of human happiness which cannot be measured in terms of GNP; it cannot be counted or bought.  This is an area in which the spending of public money can in no way be regarded as non-productive.</P>
    <P>The second part of section 1.4 of the motion refers to the review of the staffing and financing of residential child care facilities.  A couple of points can be made on this which are so obvious that they have not been noticed.  For example, it is a sad fact that there are very few male staff engaged in residential child care.  When you think of the implications of that for the growth and maturity of the children in residential child care facilities, many of them at very impressionable ages, we really must wonder. We are well aware that in the society in which we are living there is a move away from the sharp differentiation of sex roles, certainly in relation to marriage, and indeed, in the rearing of children.  I am not saying that the children in these homes are not getting the best care they can possibly get from the people recruited into and working in those homes.  However, in so far as children <Col N="880" /> normally have two parents, one of each sex, and in so far as this is part of the normal pattern which any child has a right to expect, the lack of adequate numbers of men in residential child care poses very serious potential problems for the personal development of these children.</P>
    <P>I suspect that one of the reasons why so few men are employed in the residential child care area is that the staffing, the pay and the promotion prospects in these institutions are extremely poor.  It is almost axiomatic at this time that men tend to gravitate towards jobs that are better paid and have better promotion prospects.  If the pay and promotion prospects are not good, men will tend to look elsewhere and women will generally be left to take up the jobs available.  I am not aware of any over-all standard of remuneration for staff in residential child care facilities.  The owners and managers of these institutions have to make whatever money they have go as far as possible, and so they are greatly tempted, especially at a time when many of them, who, of course, are religious orders, are suffering from a decline in vocations, to employ relatively young and relatively inexperienced people because such people are comparatively cheap to employ.  We must look at this seriously if we are to tackle the problem of providing an appropriate level of experience and a reasonable balance between the sexes involved in child care. We will not do that unless we look at the pay and promotion prospects.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the pay and promotion problem is that the employees are paid by the institutions which are largely in private hands, many of them in church hands.  Could the Government investigate the possibility of setting up a system such as exists for primary and secondary schools?  I am not totally in favour of the recruitment methods in either of these kinds of institution, but the framework under which people are employed in them is that they are hired&mdash;and if necessary fired&mdash;and generally controlled by the private body who own the school but are paid directly by the Department of Education on a national salary scale with nationally <Col N="881" /> agreed promotional prospects.  Surely something of the same kind could be worked out for our residential child care facilities.  If this could be done we would see a very substantial and perhaps even a very rapid improvement in the over-all quality of child care.</P>
    <P>Of course it would cost money.  Not all the best things in life are free but when we think in terms of our priorities we would be well advised to put our money into this kind of area.  At the moment most of these residential child care facilities are financed on a capitation grant basis.  The capitation grant is barely adequate; so much so that it is part of the financial logic of the situation that these institutions have to keep themselves full to the doors in order to be able to break even every year.  It may well happen that one institution or another may have a proportion very much higher than average of very difficult or troublesome children who need a rather higher degree of care and more individual attention than can be provided in an institution which is absolutely full to the doors.  Yet the financial logic of the situation compels them to take in children until they have every place filled, otherwise they cannot afford to keep their financial heads above water.  We should be looking at the question of differential financing if necessary for areas of child care which are in special need rather than at the flat rate capitation basis.  This raises an administrative hornets' nest, but the alternative of simply maintaining the capitation grants on a flat rate basis at a level which forces institutions to remain crammed to the doors is going to deprive some children of some of the dedicated help which they need.  At the moment those institutions which are least imaginative in a sense get the best value out of the resources made available to them and out of the existing system.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 1.5 I do not propose to go into much detail because Deputy Mrs. Desmond referred at some length to it last night.  I can only make a plea for some sort of national monitoring system in the whole area of pre-school child care.  At the moment we are part of a society in which more and <Col N="882" /> more mothers, either by choice or by necessity, are taking up paid employment outside the home.  The natural consequence is that there has been a sharp growth in the need for child care facilities, most of which are provided privately.  There is absolutely no control over them.  The Irish Pre-School Playgroups Association, a responsible body, time and time again have called for the introduction of national guidelines.  I believe such guidelines are essential if we are not to run the risk of opening the door again to the baby farmers, threatening the possible future well-being, and the emotional and personal development of very small children by a haphazard approach while their mothers are out at work.</P>
    <P>It is a relatively small thing to ask. There would be some administrative cost involved in the monitoring of such a system, but at this point we are not even asking for total State provision for such a service.  We are asking for only the bare minimum by the State in its responsibility to all the children of the nation&mdash;that the State should at least go some length to ensure that whatever services are provided, whether by public or by private agencies, will match up to certain basic standards.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1.6 of the motion asks for:</P>
    <P>the expansion of opportunities for preservice and in-service training and support for non-residential social workers and residential care staff working in the area of child care.</P>
    <P>This is part of a general educational aspect of the problem on which I should like to spend a few minutes.  At the moment there are a couple of courses for non-residential child care workers.  The Minister for Health last night said he is to make money available for a three-day residential course for such workers.  The main courses at the moment are held at Kilkenny, Cathal Brugha Street in Dublin and in the Regional Technical College in Sligo.  I suspect that there are not enough courses and that there is a need for some kind of overview of what is happening in these institutions in the area of training for child care.  This <Col N="883" /> would be important in any case but it is particularly important now when the foundations of the child care system for the next two or three decades are being laid.  It is now that the people who will not only be the child care officers in the future but who will manage and administer the child care system are being trained, and it is the quality, the depth and the relevance of their training now that will determine how flexible and adequate the child care system will be to respond to the needs of the children whom it will be serving.</P>
    <P>We need some form of closer liaison between the Departments of Education and Health in relation both to the initial provisions of these courses, their monitoring and co-ordination.  We also need the provision of more advanced courses.  Child care is a science as well as an art, and it is extremely important that any advances in it should be, wherever possible, built into our educational programme for the future generation of child care workers.  This means there is a need not just for the basic course but for advanced courses of specialisation and so on.  I do not know if we have any advanced courses at the moment.  The immediate priority is our basic primary courses but we must not lose sight of the need for advanced courses.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 of the motion calls on the Minister for Education first of all to reduce the size of infant classes in national schools.  Under successive Ministers for Education the average size of classes in national schools has been decreasing slowly.  Less successful has been the attempt to limit the maximum number of children who may be in individual classes, and least successful of all has been the attempt to reduce overcrowding in infant classes.</P>
    <P>There is something seriously wrong with a system in which overcrowding, where it appears, tends to happen where it does most psychological and educational damage.  We accept that we cannot overnight reduce all primary school classes in the country to 25, or even to 30, as an absolute maximum average, even though the average now is <Col N="884" /> just less than 30, including many of the small rural schools.  Many classes are substantially bigger than the average.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that so many of the bigger classes are congregated at the bottom end of the school, in junior and senior infants and in first class.  We must remember that a junior infant is four years of age.  He is going into school for the first time, he is leaving home for the first time, which is perhaps even more important.  Even in the best of circumstances such an experience is likely to have a potential for trauma.  Yet the inexorable ghastly logic of the system we are operating at the moment is that such a child is far more likely to be in a large class in his first day in school than at any subsequent time in his school career.</P>
    <P>Surely something could be done, even administratively, to ensure that the burden of large classes will be spread more evenly throughout individual schools and that a particular priority can be given to children in the infant classes. That will be their first experience in school and we all know that for many children unhappily school becomes something of a prison sentence. Therefore we much ask ourselves if this is so simply because their first experience of school has been so unsatisfactory. It is inevitable that a child's total experience of school will be coloured by his initial experience, and that is why it is so essential to reduce the size of infant classes in particular.  The other main reason why this should be done is that damage done at this age is far more difficult to repair just as its corollary the good which is done at this age is easier and cheaper to achieve and more lasting in its effect.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2.2 of the motion calls for the extension of the Schools Psychological Services to cover all primary schools.  It is sad that the psychological services seem to be located for all effective purposes in the post-primary area because the logic of human development is that it is easier, cheaper and ten times more effective to engage in preventive measures than in curative measures.  It applies in medicine, in psychology and in almost every other area. Instead of spending tens of thousands of <Col N="885" /> pounds on a psychological service for primary school children, we are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds, millions perhaps ultimately, trying to patch up the personal and social problems which are created by the absence of such a service at primary level.  Instead of paying for psychologists in the primary schools, we are paying for hard-pressed guidance teachers at second level.  We are paying for probation officers, garda and all sorts of other people, whose sad duty it is to try to contain the results of not having had enough preventive money spent earlier on in the system.</P>
    <P>Section 2.3 of the motion talks about the expansion of the free school meals service and the free books scheme.  The Minister for Health spoke about the free school meals service and said he had a report completed on this service and that it revealed that there were substantial anomalies in it&mdash;which, of course, we all know&mdash;but that the implications of providing an adequate school meals service in budgetary terms are very substantial. I do not think that will be news to anybody in this House, but we have to look at it seriously.</P>
    <P>The Minister posed the question: if you have X amount of money to spend, is it the right thing to do to spend it on a school meals service, or to spend it on some other aspect of family or community care?  Of course, that is a question which ultimately he has to answer himself.  What I would urge the Minister to do&mdash;and what I think should be done more often in our society&mdash;is to publish and let us see this report; let us have the benefit of the expert advice he has had. Too many Ministers&mdash;and I am not criticising this Government in particular&mdash;believe they have to act like gods on Olympus whose decisions reach the public fully formed, and the public have to either accept or reject these decisions without knowing in any detail at all, or even in the broadest outlines, what kind of advice the Minister has had in relation to the decisions he has made.</P>
    <P>It would be very positive and of considerable assistance to the development of a public debate on our priorities in educational spending if the Minister <Col N="886" /> were to publish this report.  It would not commit him to making a decision on it, but it would make available to a wider public the fruits of publicly funded and I have no doubt very relevant research.</P>
    <P>In the area of school meals in particular it is true that this is one of the areas in which we are sometimes asking schools to make good deficiencies which exist in society at large.  There is a certain temptation to make schools the scapegoat for all the ills of society, to try to pin the blame for society on schools, to try to pin the job of solving society's problems on the schools.  The schools cannot do all of this, but they can help. It is absolutely inescapable that the benefits of education&mdash;and they could be debated in their own right&mdash;are only indifferently available to children who are undernourished.</P>
    <P>We talk about school meals and school dinners at a time when, perhaps, we ought to be talking about school breakfasts.  One of the hidden statistics of misery of our time is how many children come to school every morning without anything in their stomachs. Then we complain about rowdyism in the classroom, about vandalism, inattention and all the problems with which many of our very dedicated teachers have to cope.  They cannot cope with children who are undernourished and who, because they are undernourished, are listless, uninvolved, or disaffected with the whole educational process.</P>
    <P>We must have a school meals scheme which has been updated and has had some of its anomalies removed.  It is absurd to think that because of the present operation of the school meals system not one child in the whole of the Tallaght area is entitled to a free school meal.  We can make changes here.  We should be thinking in terms of improvement.  If the Minister cannot in conscience see his way to spending all the money the report which we have not seen might urge that he should spend on improving the system, he can at least make some improvement because the situation as it exists simply is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The same is true of the free school books scheme.  Of course, it is not a free school books scheme.  The number of <Col N="887" /> children in any school who get totally free school books at primary or post-primary level could be counted on the fingers of one hand, I believe.  At best, they get a small grant covering one-quarter or one-third of the total cost of school books, and this for the neediest of children.  At the very least the Department of Education should be considering the possibility of a buy and lease system for school books.</P>
    <P>For the capitalised cost of three years at post-primary level of the annual allocation of money for the free school books scheme it might be possible for post-primary schools to buy all the books they need for their children and lease them out, and make sure they are returned at the end of the year.  Of course there would be wastage.  Books would be lost, or burned, or defaced, or whatever, but the annual topping up cost thereafter of keeping such a scheme going would be ten times less, I dare say 100 times less, than the present ineffective, impartial and discriminatory scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice spoke about Loughan House.  He gave the impression of a victorious general retreating from the battlefield.  He almost went so far as to imply that all the critics of Loughan House had now been silenced by the manifest success of this experiment.  I beg to differ from him on this.  It is undeniably true that there was a need for a secure place for child offenders, but providing a secure place for child offenders must be seen in the context of overall child care provision.  When you look at what has happened, you have to scratch your head and ask yourself: where are the Government's priorities now?</P>
    <P>There are approximately 80 staff in Loughan House.  From the Minister's point of view, this is an advertisement for the excellence of the institution.  It has the best inmate-staff ratio of any institution in the country.  What better evidence can there be that he is caring for these 20 or so children?  That is fair enough as far as it goes, but look at the little distance it goes.  The essential political point is not to take pride in the <Col N="888" /> fact that there are 80 staff for the 20 troublesome boys in Loughan House, but one of shame that there are only the same number of social workers in the entire Eastern Health Board area.  There are probably only the same number of probation officers in the entire country. That is what I mean when I talk about our scale of priorities having been totally turned upside down.</P>
    <P>We will be looking at the sums at the end of the year.  If those sums show, as I suspect they will, that the annual cost of keeping a child at Loughan House may run into five figures, we will have to look at the situation and ask ourselves how crazy have our priorities come.  The Minister spoke also of the in-service and pre-service training of gardaí.  This comes under section 3.2 of the motion. What he said was unexceptional, but there was a real lack of any hard evidence that the kind of effort needed is being made to transform the work of the gardaí with young people into an effective and positive social instrument.  At the very least there should be a youth section in each Garda division and not a section staffed by the youngest and least experienced members of the force.  Child care is too important to be left to the young, especially to those members of the force who, with the best will in the world and the best intentions in the world, are comparatively young and comparatively inexperienced.</P>

      <P>The Minister agrees with me that they should not be.  In a certain sense we have to put our money where our mouth is.  If I am right&mdash;and I hope we are talking about an experienced and mature officer&mdash;a juvenile liaison officer is entitled only to a bicycle allowance.  If the job is important the remuneration, status and facilities afforded to the officer concerned for the performance of that job should also be appropriate.  As I said in relation to education, a young person's first brush with the law, just as his first brush with the educational system, may determine a whole range of subsequent attitudes.  I urge the Minister for Justice, through the Garda authorities, not just in terms of levels of staffing and of the maturity of the personnel involved but also in terms of remuneration and status to ensure that this will be one of the best-looked-after sections of the force.</P>
      <P>Under paragraph 3 (3) there is reference to the immediate abolition of the discriminatory concept of illegitimacy. The Minister made much of the fact that this is a very complex area and indeed it is and he pointed out that it was being referred to the Law Reform Commission.  I hope that they will look at this with some degree of urgency.  I hope they will provide, at least in an appendix to their report, some indication of the way illegitimate children are treated in other countries.  We sometimes talk about the problem of dealing with illegitimacy as if nobody else has ever faced this problem before.  I suspect that they have in other countries and I also suspect that their response to it may have a lot to teach us in many cases.</P>
      <P>The Minister honestly said that one of the main problems in relation to this was the question of inheritance and property rights.  I accept that this poses a problem, particularly in a country like ours where strong property rights are enshrined in the Constitution.  We believe that people's rights come before property rights.  The irony and the sad thing about our society is that it has always proved easier to define property rights than to define personal rights. This section of the resolution asks for an attempt to give people's rights priority over property rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> Deputy Desmond referred in detail to adoption and I will not go into the matter in any more detail than she did. However, I shall make one plea that I do not think she made in her speech.  We must institute some system of review of the whole operation of the adoption societies.  I do not want to cast stones at any adoption society but the fact that there have been so many serious legal cases in recent times involving adoption surely must raise the question of what kind of supervisory mechanism there is for adoption societies and whether it is adequate.  Of course, the State has an over-all supervisory role but I suggest that things should go much further.  The welfare of children demands as much.</P>
    <P>For example, I suggest a three-year review of the operation of each adoption society&mdash;perhaps on a staggered basis so that the administrative costs will not be too great.  This would review the activities and the success rate of placings by each adoption society in the preceding period.  The review should be stringent, designed to protect the children involved.  Some of the worst decisions can be made in the best of faith but it is not good enough to say they are made in good faith.  We must put the welfare of the children first and if that means an adequate supervisory or monitoring system that should be introduced.</P>
    <P>In relation to paragraph 3 (6), I would argue again that the adversary system such as, for example, under the various Acts dealing with the custody and control of children under which the welfare and future destination of children is decided is a very imperfect mechanism for deciding children's rights.  It should be possible for independent, caring evidence to be given on behalf of the child, not necessarily of a highly professional nature but certainly by a probation officer or a child welfare worker of some kind.  Children need advocates as well as their parents.  With the best will in the world parents can get confused between their emotional needs and the objective needs of the child, especially in a situation where they are in conflict with one another.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that the operation of <Col N="891" /> the regulations in relation to visits by children to parents in prison have been somewhat relaxed but I am sorry a more formal decision has not yet been made on allowing visits by those admittedly few children whose parents may want to see them in prison.  I would urge the Minister to keep this under continuing review so that no child who wants to see an imprisoned parent is unreasonably refused access despite the administrative problems that may arise.</P>
    <P>On the question of children's allowances, I will make a brief financial point.  When one adds up the child benefits of a man on unemployment assistance who has two children, one gets a figure of about £5.20 per child.  This decreases to about £4.60 per child for a family beyond the level of six children. We are talking about £4.60 or £5.20 per week for about 150,000 children in our society.  Whatever the Minister for Social Welfare has managed to get for these children is not remotely enough.  There are 150,000 children existing on this <Col N="892" /> level of subsistence and plainly it is not good enough.</P>
    <P>We must urge the Minister for the Environment to provide more money for the essential social and recreational facilities because without these facilities a roof over one's head can turn into something almost as effective as a prison.  In his intervention the Minister for Justice admitted that the number of local authority housing completions in 1978 was several hundred less than in 1977.  He spoke of the changes that have taken place in other areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I was told by the Minister today that he had made arrangements by regulations.  Because he has made arrangements I understand that I am precluded from raising these two matters in the debate.  The Minister did not tell me how he proposed to deal with the rights of candidates to send a communication to each elector on the register, which they are entitled to do by virtue of Rule 18 of the First Schedule to the European Assembly Elections (No. 2) Bill, 1977, which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to <i>paragraph</i> (3) of this Rule, each candidate at an Assembly <Col N="895" /> election shall, subject to such conditions as may be determined by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, be entitled to send, free of any charge for postage, to each person on the register of European Assembly electors for the constituency, one postal communication containing matter relating to the election only and not exceeding two ounces in weight.</P>
    <P>That is a statutory right conferred on each candidate nominated for the European election.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has made provision for postal voting and for sending polling cards, which I do not agree with but which I am precluded from discussing during the debate, he has not made alternative arrangements and has not amended the Act, or apparently does not propose to do so, in regard to the rights of candidates to send a communication to each elector on the register.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to tell me what he proposes to do in the matter.  It is obvious that the postal strike will not be settled in sufficient time to allow such communications to be sent.  Even if it were settled now it would not be possible for such communications to be despatched and delivered in time.</P>
    <P>Every Electoral Act since the foundation of the State&mdash;I think the first one was in 1923&mdash;made provision for free postal facilities for candidates in elections and the latest Act makes provision for free postal facilities for candidates in the European election.  The fact that the General Post Office has not been closed since the Rising in 1916, except on Sundays and Bank Holidays, until the current dispute will go down in history.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister convinces me otherwise, I believe that a candidate who is defeated or wants to question the election on the grounds that he was deprived of the right to send out a communication to the electors might well succeed in upsetting the election.  Perhaps the Minister can convince me that is not so and I will be glad if he can.  Apart from that, it is a national disgrace with the forthcoming election which is making history in the <Col N="896" /> country because it is the first time that our citizens, in common with the citizens in eight other countries, will go to the polls to elect representatives to the same assembly.  It is the first time since this country was partitioned that members of every county will go to the polls on the same day to elect representatives to the same assembly.  That will go down in history.</P>
    <P>It is appalling that candidates are to be deprived of the fundamental right to send communications to electors.  Has the Minister given any thought to this? What does he propose to do about it? Perhaps I should address this question to his colleague the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs: why is something not being done to settle this strike?  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs claims that he could not get down to discuss the matter with the striking union&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The scheme of grants towards the cost of periodic painting of national schools was discontinued in 1955 on the introduction of the present scheme of capitation grants.  My Department do not, accordingly, have the type of information requested by the Deputies at (a) and (b). The school in question was built in 1961.</P>
      <P>Boards of management of national schools are required to maintain the entire school premises.  The rate of capitation grant has been increased from £8 to £10 for the current school year.</P>
      <P>Before the question of the appointment of an extra remedial teacher to the staff of Mary Queen of Angels (1) School, Ballyfermot, could be considered an application would have to be received from the school board of management.  I have not received such an application.</P>
