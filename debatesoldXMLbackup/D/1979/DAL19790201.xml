    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the targets for economic and social development and the supporting policies set out in the Government's White Paper &ldquo;Programme for National Development 1978-1981&rdquo;. </P>

      <P>As I said last night, the programme for national development could be commendable if it incorporated a concomitant social programme for the years 1978 to 1981 but unfortunately before any programme is capable of having the full co-operation of all the people it must embody a sense of justice. I cannot find any basis in this programme for social justice.  The PAYE workers whose co-operation is needed for the implementation of this programme are being <Col N="214" /> callously disregarded.  Up to now they have been carrying the full burden of the taxation structure.  Out of every £ collected in income tax, 85p comes from PAYE workers whereas a miserable 2p in every £ is collected from the farmers. Since we joined the EEC a total of £950 million by way of grants and subsidies has accrued to agriculture and the farmers have received more than 90 per cent, or £880 million of that amount, but all they have paid in tax is £17.4 million. This is further evidence of our unjust society.  The Government must realise that in order for any programme for national development to work, there must be a sense of equity and justice throughout the community.</P>
      <P>Last year there was a growth rate in our economy of 7 per cent but no advantage whatever accrued to the deprived members of our society.  All they got were the miserable crumbs&mdash;an increase that was barely in line with the cost of living.  Regardless of all the talk there may be about the growth in our economy, there remain 600,000 people who are living below the poverty line.  In such circumstances how can we claim to have made remarkable progress?</P>
      <P>The White Paper contains vague statements about social development but there is no indication of a commitment to eliminate poverty by 1981.  There are references, though, to investigations but such investigations could have taken place years ago.  During this winter the aged have suffered badly.  We were not even able to supply them with the free fuel to which they are entitled.  There should have been a massive relief campaign to help in this regard.</P>
      <P>This year is the year of the child. There are 1.1 million children in this country but have we done anything to bring our social services in the area of child care up to the level obtaining among other member states?  There have not been any increases in children's allowance so that all we are doing is paying lip service to the needs of our people when we talk about a 7 per cent increase in economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no wish to be accused of farmer bashing.  I am in favour of the common agricultural policy but the fault <Col N="215" /> lies with our taxation structure because we are not ensuring that the burden of taxation is spread equitably.</P>
    <P>If we are to talk about progress we must talk also of the state of our industrial relations.  The situation in this regard is at a very low ebb.  We rank next to Britain as the worst in Europe in this area.  The situation can be compared with a cancerous growth eating away at our whole society.  Strikes are an everyday affair.  This situation is causing a great deal of hardship.  There is something radically wrong in a system that does not provide for the carrying out of investigations in time rather than waiting until the eleventh hour.  The Labour Court, as it structured, is not capable of tackling the problem of industrial relations.  I am wondering whether it is badly staffed or whether it is a matter of the system being archaic. As Minister for Labour in the last Government, Deputy O'Leary advocated the introduction of an early warning system.  That was an admirable suggestion.  It envisaged the inclusion of such a committee of top trade union officials but my understanding of the situation is that there were disagreements regarding the composition of the committee and that the experts would not be allowed to be members of it.  In addition the salaries offered to the officials who were to be appointed were so low that we would only have been able to attract people of mediocre calibre.  It is incumbent on the Government to ascertain, first, how we can restructure the Labour Court so that it can deal adequately with disputes and, secondly, there is the question of the inadequate staffing of the Labour Court.  The Labour Court is not properly or adequately staffed and as a result there is a backlog of cases coming before it.  When I broached the subject to a trade union official of the transport union and mentioned a 60-day cooling off period he said: &ldquo;Yes, if the Labour Court were operating properly and could deal with our cases in time&rdquo;, but a 60-day cooling off period could become a six months cooling off period because of the time lag in cases being investigated by the Labour Court.  It is incumbent <Col N="216" /> on the Government to look urgently at the question of how the Labour Court tackles and copes with these problems.</P>
    <P>Management must bear a great portion of the blame for the present state of industrial unrest.  The post office strike was a glaring example of management being absolutely pig-headed in dealing with a problem that concerned 12 hours' overtime which was eventually conceded. Tremendous overtime was involved in taking care of the backlog of work.  There was no question of that man being taken to task for bringing about a strike that was not the workers' fault.</P>

      <P>I welcome the White Paper and the Taoiseach's speech on it yesterday.  It is important at the outset to recognise that this is a step in the historical development of planning.  We have seen planning over the years since the first programme for economic development in 1959 and with this present plan we see the latest attempt at planning economic and social development. There have been many criticisms in the past of planning, its success or failure, merits or demerits.  I am totally in favour of planning as a concept.  The Taoiseach made it quite clear that the broad plans which were set out by Fianna Fáil in the election manifesto have been adhered to in subsequent policy decisions possibly in a more detailed and accurate way than we have ever done in the past.  This is possibly because we made very definite positive commitments and, in Government, we set out to achieve them.  The Taoiseach indicated that the plans which were set out were ambitious ones.  They were.  I prefer ambitious targets where we set something a little bit ahead of ourselves but which are realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that a plan must provide a sense of direction and must give to those participating confidence in the planners, in the system, in the State in total.  It must also give continuity especially in relation to investment and, in so far as the employee is concerned, in relation to the terms and conditions of his employment. This plan will give us a sense of direction.  It certainly can give us confidence <Col N="217" /> because to date in so far as we have gone we have broadly achieved the targets we have set.  We know that was the first phase of the plan and we are now entering the more difficult second phase.  The implementation of the plan and the detailed follow-through is one of the areas where, in the past and particularly during the sixties, we fell down on.  From the Taoiseach's speech yesterday it is evident that the Government are determined to pursue these plans in every detail and I trust that this will be the spirit and the attitude in implementing the plans.</P>
    <P>We have set very high jobs targets in this White Paper.  We cannot succeed in our plans unless we achieve the support of all sectors of the community.  I am interested in the development of a hire service which will be dealing with temporary hire situations.  This is one of the first steps to be taken in the programme. In conjunction with the training programmes which have been vastly expanded in recent years I see the hire agency as having an extremely important function.  To date I have not seen spelled out how the hire agency will function.  I see one of its functions as providing employment rather than disillusionment for the people.  The concept here is good and right but the detailed application will be vital.  In this concept of work we will have to examine in great detail the possibilities and potential bearing in mind the various interests that exist and the necessity to avoid conflict in any new services which are introduced.  I see the hire service as turning our problems into our opportunities.  It is not too difficult to see that the hire service could provide employment opportunities of a temporary character on community work of various kinds.  We have often spoken about the need for improvements at community level.  We have only to go out and see the great sprawling communities which have developed in recent years around our cities to realise the amount of work which can be done to add to the quality of life in these communities. Perhaps by improving the standard of these services in a temporary way we would learn where we could be doing something more permanent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> There must be considerable scope for expanding operations in the forestry sector and also for the hire service to provide temporary assistance.  The whole environmental area is one which would demand a great deal of effort and attention and perhaps through this service we would be able to provide people for environmental work.  If we stretch our imagination a little further we can also see that in relation to the various social services we have a tremendous need in terms of home helps, nursing and assistance for geriatrics.  I am sure that on teasing out the various areas of deficiency in our community we could find a great deal of work which could be done through the hire service.  Its concept is right and good.  A great deal remains to be seen as regards the implementation of this new service.  More than anything, if it provides for the school leaver and the unemployed person a guaranteed form of temporary, useful and valuable employment in conjunction with the training services, it could be a blessing.  There are many facets and areas of our activities which are underdeveloped and which, to date, we have not had the foresight or commitment as a society to develop. Through such a service we would have the opportunity to tackle some of these even in a temporary way.  From the experience we gain, we can then see what the longer term developments might be.</P>
    <P>Looking at our great asset, our young people, and thinking in terms of this hire service and the way in which it might be developed, I can see tremendous possibilities. We should give scope and opportunities to our young people who have a reasonable amount of experience from such a service.  We should put a nucleus of young people&mdash;six, eight, ten or 12 of them&mdash;to work on particular projects and give them special support. This would mean defining the projects and supporting them financially.  I see this as a blessing in disguise and we should be doing a great deal more of it. We have an enormous untapped asset, but we do not know how to use it fully at this stage.  I am not saying that in any critical sense.  It is a world-wide problem. The age of greatest contribution and innovation in a technical sense is approximately <Col N="219" /> between 20 and 35 years, which puts me beyond it.  As a society we are not sufficiently cognisant of that as a reality.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for the media and for ourselves to become totally involved in the major economic and other problems, and the obvious major steps ahead.  The developments in the next decade may well be innovations which we do not see at this stage but which are going ahead under the surface.  If we could broaden the base, we could have more outward-going, industrious and enterprising developments within our society.  We have to tackle very seriously our whole approach to enterprise, not just as enormous State corporations or consortia which are very important.  We must examine the details of our approach to enterprise as individuals.  Whether we like it or not, our young people are the most enterprising and most creative people in our society.  They need the guidance, the maturity and the sophistication of their elders, but let us be clear that the future is theirs, and never before were they trained so well to take on the task which confronts them.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the new hire agency.  It offers many possibilities. I hope it will be tackled imaginatively and will receive the support of all those in the various sectors of our society, unions, management, State and semi-State bodies, because it is a clear-cut attempt to deal with the residual facets of our problems.  I welcome it very much.  I dwelt on it for some time because it is a very important development.  I hope that, in discussions on it over the next few weeks or months, other Deputies will give their views and make their suggestions and proposals, and not just criticise and make little of suggestions just because they are in Opposition.  I hope they will add to them and enlarge them in the interests of all unemployed people, and the countless thousands of young people who are looking for jobs and will be looking for jobs in future years.  I am glad this proposal has been carried through into the White Paper.  I know it was in the Green Paper.  I look forward to the development of this concept <Col N="220" /> in association with the Manpower and AnCO services.</P>
    <P>I note in the White Paper the continuation of the Government's policy in relation to public expenditure and the proportion of gross national product being reduced to approximately 10½ per cent in 1979.  This is not surprising because it was a commitment in the Government's initial plans.  I also note the commitment to reduce the cost of the service of the public debt which has and will have in the future a great influence in freeing resources for more productive use.</P>
    <P>The question of incomes and industrial relations is one of the major topical questions of our time, not only here but particularly in the neighbouring country across the water.  I do not suggest that the various interested groups within our society should not press their claims and their views as they see fit.  Of course they must press their claims to maintain balance and to keep their parties.  I appeal to all sectors involved to consider the common sense of the proposals put by the Government and to look at the whole problem of a two-speed Europe.  This is a very real problem and has been so particularly in the past five years.  With our membership of the European Monetary System we can bring this under much greater control if we desire to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been making references to events and developments on the Continent and suggesting to the unions that they might examine the possibilities there and come back with their own proposals and suggestions in relation to developments on the Continent.  I very much welcome that approach.  I have believed in it for a long time.  When I was a young post-graduate I became very committed to this view.  At a very early age I could see the differences and I could see what was happening.  Currently many of our young people can see these differences and we are not giving them sufficient credit for what they can see.</P>
    <P>I welcome the emphasis on looking at our colleagues in Europe.  If we look at them, we must accept one fact, that is, that they are successful.  They are <Col N="221" /> vigorous in their approach to work. They do not necessarily work longer hours, but they do a day's work.  There is nothing exceptional about their standards, nothing we cannot match, but they have a commitment to work and, in their commitment, they turn out the goods within their hours of work.  It is very important for us all, whether we are in Dáil Éireann or working at the factory bench, that while we are at work we achieve a good level of productivity.  If we can do that, we can join or come close to the higher speed developments in growth and incomes which exist on the Continent.  Logically this is the way we would all like to go.  I hope everyone will bear this in mind in the forthcoming discussions and negotiations on pay.</P>
    <P>A significant development last year was the stabilisation of the £.  At this stage we have the choice of continuing to stabilise our currency in international terms or of weakening it by losing sight of the economics of our situation.  It is important to bear that in mind from the point of view of the employee.  I know it is not of relevance to those on low incomes. What is important to them is that the £ retains its purchasing power.  It is important that people on higher incomes recognise that aspect in any demands which they may make.  As far as the lower income group is concerned, we should bear in mind the criterion of take-home pay.  In regard to the developments in the White Paper and in the forthcoming budget, I trust that both the Minister for Finance and the Government bear in mind the value in real terms of the take-home pay of the lower income group. This criterion must be constantly kept in mind because it is critical for those whose incomes are in the middle and lower brackets.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement that take-home pay should be adequate.  It should meet requirements like the cost of transport, which is an expensive element for the lower income group.  We must leave the worker with a reasonable wage.  Now that we have come to the age of equality in so many areas, we must make allowances for families by giving them better allowances to counteract the movement <Col N="222" /> towards equality in incomes between single and married people.  This can be done in a variety of ways. Nobody would be too upset if luxuries were taxed more.  We have the option of putting more tax on non-essentials like drink and cigarettes.  As far as basics are concerned, we must concentrate on real take-home pay, bearing in mind the size of the family.</P>
    <P>In relation to children's allowances, I have previously suggested that the period between the ages of 12 and 18 is a critical one in terms of consumption. During that period children use basic things such as clothes and food at a higher rate than adults.  I have experience of this in my home and in many other homes.  I should like to see improved allowances in that area which would be of assistance to families with children who are continuing their education beyond second level.  The whole question of pay and incomes is important. One of the main requirements for people with incomes in excess of £5,000 per year is that we maintain the value of the £ and increase net productivity. When we are doing well we are reluctant to admit it.  The Government are striving to maintain stability.  It is vital for people in the middle and higher income groups that the programmes of the Government succeed.  In relation to the lower income group, it is important to bear in mind the criterion of take-home pay.</P>
    <P>I hope that all elements in our society will unite to fight the evils of unemployment, greed and envy.  The Government are dealing with unemployment in an effective manner.  It is up to us through our various interest groups to deal with the evils of greed and envy.  If we were faced with war we would all unite to fight.  The real problem that faces us now is whether we are prepared to unite in peace to fight unemployment and social disability.  We should make sensible plans to improve our lot.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the provision of secretarial assistance for Oireachtas Members at local level as a means of improving the quality of the service which can be given to the public. This job would come within the province of the hire agency in so far as it could be <Col N="223" /> defined as temporary&mdash;perhaps hopefully recurring.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the emphasis in the White Paper on industry. I appreciate that industry and agriculture are to receive the backing and assistance necessary for their enterprise and investment within the country.  I welcome this policy and approach, which I think is the right one.  I trust the response will continue to come from the industrial and agricultural sectors. Nevertheless, the State-sponsored sector will continue to have a major part to play.  In the Taoiseach's speech he recognises this.  He has said that it is a definite commitment of the Government to expand the food processing industry, in particular the dairy and beef industry. The IDA have drawn up their special development programme for that sector. Again, this is in line with the general policies put forward earlier.</P>
    <P>I note that the State companies have been invited to put forward proposals for expansion or new ventures to the Industrial Development Consortium.  We need to clarify our minds on the matter of State involvement in the development of industry and in meeting the targets we are proposing.  I welcome the body which is to examine a certain number of the semi-State bodies and make recommendations and I look forward to its early report.  It is essential at this stage to review the role and function of the semi-State sector and clarify our minds as to the task we see for that sector.  The Government have clearly put an emphasis on the development of private industry and I welcome that decision.  In the case of the semi-State sector we must decide whether these bodies are political instruments or development agencies. Within the semi-State bodies there can easily be confusion as to the extent to which they are either one or the other.  In the case of a body like the IDA their brief is very clear and there is no such problem but if we examine them in detail we find that in many of the other bodies&mdash;and I know this from my own experience in dealing with these bodies&mdash;there can easily be confusion between the political aspect of their work <Col N="224" /> and the straightforward, developmental one.  I believe there is no cosy in-between situation.  You can end up playing politics too much in decision-making and even having to play politics too much in decision-making because of the kind of responses that are expected even from this House and because of the questions asked in this House.  One can fall between these two things and end up trying to meet political criteria rather than risk taking in the developmental sense.  I should certainly like to see this matter cleared.</P>
    <P>I believe that semi-State bodies have a very considerable role as developmental agencies.  If they are to fulfil that role we should review the system of the employment and remuneration of the chief personnel and managers of these industries. We cannot say on one hand that we want people to undertake a semi-political, semi-cosy job and on the other hand that we want other people to take on a risk-taking entrepreneurial task without identifying the differences that exist in these situations.  Perhaps we should be looking at the feasibility of a contract system for top management in semi-State bodies which have the character of a developmental agency.  I say this because I believe that to make a real input in that sort of agency one can continue for perhaps five years and, if exceptional, one might do it for ten years but one must seriously question the desirability of retaining people permanently in such positions if we want them to act as innovators and developmental agencies.  Unless our system of payment and remuneration and reward relates to that concept and strategy it is unlikely to succeed and difficulties arise in that the people in these jobs can be viewed from various angles by various people without a clear idea as to their specific function.</P>
    <P>This would not mean that a top civil servant could not go in and undertake a task like that for five years or ten years and then revert to a more directly civil service type of function but during the period while an individual was undertaking the stress, strain and risk that go with a developmental agency he should be rewarded and compensated accordingly. <Col N="225" /> If we do not recognise this we shall lose a great deal of the potential which exists.  I should like to see this difference in the semi-State bodies analysed and examined from that point of view and arrangements made so that what I envisage can and will happen and so that a person will be able to stand up and say: &ldquo;I undertook this task for a five-year period&rdquo;, and have a suitable contract covering the time while he is undertaking that particularly onerous and risky task which can quite often, if you are to take the risks and be really developmental, involve errors and mistakes and even odium from time to time.  Unless we get people who will risk that for the sake of the country, take the risks and not have to look over a political shoulder then we are not bringing the dynamism necessary into our planning and development that I believe is possible and we shall not reach the potential we should be able to achieve.</P>
    <P>The young people have a great deal to offer in the development of this plan and I hope they will be built into it as the plan progresses.  Here we must be more imaginative in the use of our qualified personnel now that we have given them the kind of education which is far above what existed ten, 15 or 20 years ago. With the vast numbers completing second-level education and increasing numbers at third level, we must recognise the effect of this on our economy and our development.  I am very glad that the Taoiseach at every opportunity emphasises the value of the asset which we have in our young people. Here I come back to the detailed follow-through of the broad plans which are laid out in the White Paper, and the detail brings us down to how exactly we are going to give these people the kind of opportunities for which they are equipped. We have gone part of the way in that with the new enterprise development programme whereby capital will be provided if one has the ideas and the enterprise ideal.  I recognise from my reading of what has been happening in that programme that very solid, secure and mature people who have a very good background in business and industry are the kind of people coming forward.  That is excellent, and that is the <Col N="226" /> first phase or first line in that development. I would like to see us being more risk-taking and getting more of the young people into business and industry at an early stage.  Our regional technical colleges, national institutions for higher education and universities have a very serious responsibility here to give the young people an orientation towards industry and agriculture and away from purely service-type vocations.</P>
    <P>You can set the framework and give the backing, but somebody has to come in and do the undertaking.  Someone has to put his back into it.  There are no stronger backs or better minds for that than those of young people who have received a good basic education.  I would like to see more detailed teasing out of how these people might be involved.  I was involved once in an experiment with seven graduates who got down to a very mundane industrial type of project with which they would not have been familiar previously.  Arising from the experience they got in that, they went on and became involved in different areas and set up operations of their own.  They got an insight into the starting of something from the grass roots, so to speak.  We should try to find a means of getting young people with education off the ground in that sense.</P>
    <P>I welcome also what is a novelty in this White Paper, the emphasis on the co-operatives in the industrial areas. Here we have the same sort of problem facing us in that we are at a stage of innovation, and again the Government in the White Paper are providing the sense of direction and leadership and are making a commitment.  The follow-through in detail will require a good deal of risk-taking and attempts which perhaps will not be successful.  I would like to see this co-operative venture pressed very far.  I have been involved in such myself and I realise that the amount of work&mdash;unseen work&mdash;in this area is phenomenal, and no one will give recognition or identity to it until the job is completed and running smoothly.  Therefore, there is a long lead-in time, so to speak, to that sort of operation.  I am delighted that the Government are putting it down as one of their primary means of achieving the <Col N="227" /> targets.  I hope they will take into consideration here the young graduates of our universities and third-level institutes.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome very much the White Paper and the Taoiseach's speech of yesterday.  They are giving us a sense of direction and are providing us with confidence and leadership.  It is our task and the task of all the interest groups and pressure groups to take it up from there and develop the minutiae and detail which will make it into a successful programme for all our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>John F. Kennedy once said that aggression unchallenged is aggression unleashed.  In a sense this sums up present Government policy and thinking with regard to the major social and economic challenges of the day. Although many of these are very obvious and more remain to be defined or analysed clearly, the essential and fundamental failure of the Government's White Paper, and indeed the whole trinity of such papers that we have had subsequent to the manifesto, is evident. These documents indicate the unwillingness or inability by the Government to govern.  It is a fundamental concept of government that a government elected with a substantial mandate should get on with the job.  The policy of option-presenting which is much favoured by the present Government is not central to the role of government, and certainly not in the case of a government who came into office with a clear plan and a clear mandate.  These papers in some cases have taken almost two years to produce. A government who spend time in presenting options must realise that in the prevailing economic and political climate of western Europe results cannot be achieved quickly, and in some cases it is necessary to achieve results quickly. Therefore, those who indulge in presenting options, despite having given the impression that they have the answers to many questions&mdash;answers which did not need to ask people for reaction to options&mdash;must understand that that period of option assessment is a period of inertia.  There is a crying need at present for sense of government <Col N="228" /> leadership.  One gets the impression that there are very few Ministers who enjoy making decisions or the job of government, which surely must be the most exciting and fascinating social challenge. That is regrettable, because these papers that we have are interesting academic exercises, but little more.  They provide fodder for debates such as this which, in the cosmic order of things, is not going to change much anyway.  Surely in the collective wisdom of the Government and reading between the lines of these various documents that have been published, there is a clear understanding by the Government of some of the actions that need to be taken; yet nothing is happening.  That is a missed opportunity and we will pay the price of that later on.  The papers themselves are very woolly in many respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper under discussion contains very many references to policies being considered, being evaluated, under consideration, or being actively pursued.  If things are not being examined serious examination is being given to their feasibility.  Review groups are set up to examine and report on the feasibility of doing something, an interdepartmental committee established to make recommendations, a commission established which has been asked to give priority to the consideration of yet another matter.  The Government in another area are actually considering steps.  Yet again, there are proposals for the establishment of a framework for progress in course of preparation.  That is sad.  Here are a government who have to give voice to an expression as an excuse for getting on with the job of governing&mdash;a phrase such as &ldquo;proposals for the establishment of a framework for progress are in course of preparation&rdquo;. Indeed, the most junior sub-editor on the most junior provincial paper would certainly draw a blue line through that one. The sad thing is that it is not just a sub-editorial exercise.  This is supposed to be the job of government and it is not being done.  All the clauses, qualifications, review bodies and processes of consideration going on are an indication either of inability or of the lack of will to govern.  If either of those is present this country is in trouble.  I believe there is a <Col N="229" /> merit in making decisions.  I believe the people want decisions made.  I believe further that the people would be willing, even now and again, to accept in the aggregate that decisions would be right but that there would be some wrong decisions, rather than have none.  If government means anything it is about running a country, not throwing options to the winds, listening closely to the response and then timorously taking very short steps to achieve very long-term targets.</P>
    <P>The White Paper itself covers certain aspects in respect of which it would have been possible, without major political, social or economic implications, to take steps which could have indicated clearly the Government's basic willingness or backbone to get on with the job.  For example, in paragraph 2.14 there is one such example of the very scant treatment that the library of literature emanating from this Government has devoted to social policy.  The reference is to what is euphemistically called the need for the greatest degree of simplicity consistent with proper management and control of the services and that the rights and dignity of the individual are protected.  This paragraph would appear to give the impression of concern by the Government that the rights and dignity of the individual should be protected.  I am sure we all concur in that.  The one obvious gesture that could be made in that direction which could be perhaps effective in some respects is the immediate appointment of an ombudsman, but that is not said because that would be a decision. In paragraph 2.15, under the same general heading, we read:</P>
    <P>Whether directly involved or not, the Government will welcome and facilitate the contribution that local organisations make to the creation of a better life for all members of the community and, where appropriate, will do all it can to encourage the development of community-based organisations. </P>
    <P>If one could honestly believe that that meant anything, one would welcome that high-minded and noble reference. But, of course, it does not mean anything.  All the evidence and indications since this Government came to <Col N="230" /> power are that devolution of power to local bodies, local authorities or community-based organisations is contracting instead of expanding.  Therefore, this tissue of superfluous verbiage is regrettable.  It is regrettable because it does a disservice to the language it uses which, when used in future by people who mean it, will perhaps become discredited. It is even more fundamentally regrettable because it is an excuse for not governing.</P>
    <P>A Programme for National Development, which this book calls itself, should have at its core a sense of vision, a long-term understanding of the kind of Ireland towards which this country wishes to move.  That is not recognised nor is it mentioned anywhere.  Instead of that we have an understandable but limited concern with short-term targets, the underlying values and norms of which are assumed and never questioned.  The major social challenges are not alone not tackled but, in some cases, not even recognised.  There is no question whatever about the basic distribution of wealth in this country, no basic thinking or fundamental approaches to the whole question of environment. The major challenge of urban development and its frightening implications unless it is tackled in a meaningful manner remains unattended in this paper.</P>
    <P>The lack of this basic social philosophy means that a paper such as this is not as worthy or valuable as it could be.  Surely if one talks about achieving economic targets one must have some idea of the kind of society and the kind of country one wishes to achieve, or is it assumed that it is understood that there is already a national consensus, that the material, acquisitive wants of people, as opposed perhaps to the more long-term and nobler needs, are to hold the centre of the stage?  Is it expected that only the passing whim or current political fad is to find a response in government thinking?  In other words, we are not getting a fundamentalist approach here.</P>
    <P>The Government impaled themselves on rash promises prior to the election of delivering in a number of areas, particularly <Col N="231" /> in relation to employment.  The clear impression is being given that whatever the cost those promises will be delivered.  We should look not merely at the number of jobs; this is not merely a quantitative problem it is a qualitative problem.  All of our people could be employed tomorrow but the jobs could be meaningless; they could be conjured up overnight.  I do not want that kind of society.  I do not want a society in which the primary preoccupation is to get people off the live register regardless of what one does with them.  I do not believe our people want that.  We have already from the reports of psychiatrists, doctors and others interested in that field a clear indication that job satisfaction is a very important matter.  We do not read a word about job satisfaction in the &ldquo;Programme for National Development&rdquo;; it is a numbers game.  Eventually, if that is to be pursued to its logical conclusion, people will be put into roles and jobs for which they are not suited but which is the antithesis of what are their lifestyles, cultural outlooks and beliefs. At the same time any government that tries to achieve job targets, to bring people into employment, must be supported and must get the help and encouragement of every responsible individual on this island.  I would ask the Government, in their future thinking, to look more deeply at the kind of Ireland towards which this type of thinking points.  It is simplistic in its approach.  The targets it sets are economic, exclusively economic in some cases.  They do not impinge on the social area; they do not take into account the quality of the future life of this country in the event of these targets being achieved.</P>
    <P>For example, there is the question of wealth, the 6 per cent growth rate talked about.  There is also the question of increasing the wealth of the country, implying thereby&mdash;to use the now famous phrase&mdash;that &ldquo;all ships would rise on the same tide&rdquo;.  That is something at which we should look very closely because it does not bear close economic or social scrutiny.  Even in the 19th century the economist, Marshall, was meditating on why increased production did not mean <Col N="232" /> more wealth and leisure for ordinary people, to say nothing of Marx who visualised a society in which the machines worked and man was liberated.  Why does not increased production lead to more wealth?  Though staggering a little from time to time growth rates of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent per annum have been usual in what we like to call the West&mdash;actually it is Japan that has a growth rate of the order of 10 per cent average annually. In other words, Western countries ought to be between a twentieth and a tenth wealthier every year if production is not being wasted, or if there are not other problems.  Those countries, therefore, ought to be at least twice as rich in 20 years.  In fact their output has been doubled in less than that, in about 15 years, and the doubling times have been getting shorter.</P>
    <P>One could put it another way: you and I ought to be twice as rich every 15 years.  Our colleges or the other institutions in which we work ought to be not getting twice as much money but twice as wealthy in real terms.  Some calculations suggest that even with present trends our society ought to be producing 32 times as much in 70 years.  Yet we are told that we are a declining economy. Why?  Because we are wasting our production, because the simplistic assumption that more money equals more wealth, or that even increased production equals more wealth for all the people, is simply not true.  France is an interesting example, because they were slow in coming to industrial production. Between 1910 and 1939 France's industrial production rose by 5 per cent only but between 1948 and 1965 its industrial production rose by 220 per cent. In other words, in those 17 years, Frenchmen ought to have been visibly 220 per cent richer, and I am talking about the man in the street.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the wealth of the élite has increased in real terms.  I should like to ask, rhetorically perhaps, whether it is a questionable assumption that the kind of pell-mell race after increased production and alleged increased wealth is the kind of goal we should be pursuing in view of the clear evidence available that <Col N="233" /> increased wealth and increased production, unless it is accompanied by major courageous government action, does not necessarily mean that all people will benefit.  If it did we would not have the extremes in society that we have.  The elimination of those extremes should be at the heart of any programme for national development but they are not. There is no concern for eliminating them.  In the paper there is not basic concern about social justice and that is a major fault.  It is extremely regrettable.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the ownership of property comes into the same category.  Professor Sidney Pollard in a book entitled &ldquo;The Wealth of Britain&rdquo; said:</P>
    <P>While few would deny that incomes are more fairly distributed in the 1960s than before 1914, it is by no means certain that any relative gains have been made by the poorer section of the people since the 1920s or 1930s.  Indeed, one detailed study appeared to show that there was &ldquo;little increase in the amount of vertical distribution between 1937 and 1959&rdquo;, and since then the movement has certainly been the other way.  If full employment, the action of powerful trade unions and the political struggles of the century have been unable to effect a share-out of incomes since 1920, the main reason lies in the power of one factor working the other way, the uneven distribution of property ... Most of the redistribution has been within the classes, from those in work to those temporarily or permanently out of employment. </P>
    <P>Peter Wilsher, the Economic Editor of <i>The Sunday Times</i> is on record also as saying:</P>
    <P>In a modern, developed economy, like those of Britain and the United States, which is rich in capital and advanced technology, the concentrated ownership of private property acts as a major force, pushing the system towards even greater inequality.  And as labour-saving techniques, which used to be summed up in the useful but rather out-of-fashion word &ldquo;automation&rdquo;, takes stronger hold, so the balance between employment incomes <Col N="234" /> and property incomes...will move sharply back towards the owners of real wealth. </P>

      <P>Anyone who is interested can read the quotations in a book entitled &ldquo;Who needs money?&rdquo; by Herbert Lomas.  Our traditional acceptance of the economic goals to be sought are in need of review and rethinking. They do not mean that everybody will prosper and profit from their achievement.</P>
      <P>The same is true in regard to the naïve belief that is prevalent at the moment in regard to the <i>laissez faire</i> approach to job creation.  Despite the fact that the Government express extreme concern about job creation, and successive governments have made available substantial amounts to multinational companies, the return is small for the price. It is a high price to pay £120 million in capital grants in five years for 3,000-4,000 jobs, many of which are at the lower level and are semi-skilled. Perhaps we might consider again how we might use that amount of money.  We should try much harder to put into native entrepreneurial hands much of the effort and attention we give to people who, because they are foreigners, seem to get preferential treatment.  It is clear from studies by people such as Dermot McAleese, Noel Whelan and Brendan Walsh that the traditional approach to setting up substantial economic incentives to multinationals should be looked at again because I do not think it is paying the dividend it should pay.  Perhaps the price is too high; perhaps the money could be utilised in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major issues with which I am concerned such as the elimination of poverty, the question of educational standards in parts of our city, giving people a second chance in alternative modes of education and the general war on poverty and pain that I would like to see waged, all of these issues are not in <Col N="235" /> the White Paper in the way they should be.  This is not to say that the Government are a body of unthinking men&mdash;I do not believe that&mdash;but I think they are trapped by outdated economics that have not been properly reassessed in the light of modern needs and the need for a redefinition of what is productive in society.  Frequently I have been surprised by the tenacity with which senior politicians and economists hold to their definition of the word &ldquo;productive&rdquo;.  Being a good nurse, a good teacher or a good child care worker is as productive as being a producer of washing machines.  The truth is that our economics are based on a policy of waste.  The tragedy is that it is only the Government who can reverse that trend and who can rethink it fundamentally. We should not be naïve about this.  Let us not delude ourselves into thinking that the private individual who is attracted by the inducements offered to come here to set up business or the domestic entrepreneur who wants to do well financially will have as his primary motive the welfare of our people.  That is not a criticism of him, it is a fact of life. These people are in business to make a profit.  It is the job of a government to ensure the welfare of the people and the mere presenting of vast sums of money to people in the hope that everything will be all right is not adequate.  There must be a greater commitment by government to direct intervention in the major areas of job creation and social injustice. I do not care if it is called a national development corporation or any other fancy name.  The basic commitment must be there.  The policy of <i>laissez faire</i>, of sitting back and hoping that it will all work out, is failing and will continue to fail.  That commitment is not in the White Paper.  As long as it does not figure in Government thinking this country will continue to go downhill.</P>
    <P>It is a strange society that has the kind of values it holds.  On any street corner on any day of the week one can see young and not so young people with collection boxes.  Invariably they ask money for good causes; for nursing homes, for old people's homes, to combat <Col N="236" /> mental and physical handicap and so on.  I have yet to see anyone collecting for an army tank, to buy a cabin cruiser or any other element of luxurious waste that people are more and more wont to call a necessity.</P>
    <P>There is a basic misthinking in our society and naturally enough it will be reflected in the prevailing political and economic thinking enshrined in the &ldquo;Programme for National Development 1978-1981&rdquo; which is being debated.  We must have a fundamental rethink on the way our society is shaping, about the influences to which it is subjected and the cultural assaults that have to be faced. What are the kind of goals we should be considering?  Obviously the Government must concern themselves with the day-to-day issues of running a country but I would respectfully suggest that they should also concern themselves with the long-term good of the nation.  In the short-term, political aims and aspirations must take their place in a democracy, but they should not hold the stage.  At present they seem to do so with the result that we do not have a government but a form of crisis management, a day-to-day reaction to trends and events.  We have what I would call a Minister for sunken ships and broken telephones.  We have a sad situation where the whole communications network has been allowed to degenerate. I can see no improvement in the situation and the Minister for Labour could be called an industrial referee whose whistle has no pea.  Would it make any difference if these men were not in office? When one begins to question whether these Ministers are necessary there is something wrong, not perhaps with the individuals but with the way we have been doing things.  During the last number of weeks of industrial strife and chaos what role has the concept of the office of the Minister for Labour served? It was of scant service.</P>
    <P>The general negative approach of the White Paper is clear.  There is talk about taxation and the need for restraint, all the things which are apparently fairly popular with governments in the middle of their terms of office but which are not so popular with prospective governments <Col N="237" /> prior to their ascendency to office. That negative tone permeates the paper and it is regrettable.  Missed opportunities are exemplified in paragraph 2.20 of the White Paper where the the three aspects of the public service do not include the whole exciting prospect of drawing up, for the whole of the public service, a social and economic long-term target towards which the public service workers could aspire.  I am mindful of the problems that the people in the public service have, of drifting aimlessly because nobody has set them a target and nobody evaluates their work.  The paper does not even hint at the possibility of such a programme to bring about a better society, which would be an exciting undertaking for the Minister and the Government.  Instead of that, there are three alleged important aspects of the role of the public service which are little more than lip service and are the kind of things that are being done already if the public service is being run properly.  The paper contains nothing about why job satisfaction is not as high as it should be in the public service, or as to whether the public service is doing all it could do with the right kind of leadership in relation to attaining the right kind of goals.  Paragraphs 5.52 of the White Paper in relation to the Department of the Environment has the same nebulous approach.</P>
    <P>One of the major omissions in the paper is the absence of a regional approach to problems.  The difficulty is that we have a traditional Government who accept the traditional approach of parallel Departments of Government as still appropriate.  The time has now come with regard to the urbanisation of certain areas, Dublin being at the top of the list, when we should look again at the concept that Government Departments as traditionally operated are appropriate to the present complexity of social and economic problems.  The truth will eventually be forced upon us that we will have to devise a system of regional devolved government particularly for the larger communities giving them unilateral power devolved by a courageous government to deal with matters of local, social and economic concern.  Existing Departments are not just unable to <Col N="238" /> cope, they are not geared to cope.  They are oriented in a way which makes it impossible to cope.</P>
    <P>If one looked at the greater Dublin region as an example of most of the problems in urban areas, one would see that there are varying needs along a number of obvious social and economic fronts which are beginning to threaten the economic and social life of the city. Most people will appreciate that there are major challenges in the Dublin area. Either we are not able to do anything about them or we are just not doing anything.  Part of the reason is because the traditional pattern of government, the Departments of Health, Justice, Education and Labour are dealing with problems as if the problems of Dublin were no different from problems of other areas.  That approach needs to be overhauled urgently.  The projection of population in Dublin for example is an indication that there is a major crisis which is not being tackled.  The figures show that the growth in population in the Dublin region from 1966 to 1971 was 57,200 people, compared with 37,100 for the rest of the country.  While the Dublin population in 1971 constituted almost 30 per cent of the population of the rest of the State, the Dublin increase in the period 1966 to 1971 constituted 60 per cent of the total increase.  The population projection for 1991 on this basis for the Dublin area would be 1,150,000, an increase of 298,000 in 20 years.  It is important to bear in mind that these figures do not take migration into Dublin into account. We are talking about a substantial increase in the number of people in the Dublin area alone, for which, I suggest, adequate preparation and infrastructural development is not being sought.  If we are to create jobs for this vast number of people we would need a land bank of industrial lands.  There are some thousands of acres in the Dublin area most of which are in the county area, outside the city.  That means if we are to continue with what I assume to be the generally accepted good idea of maintaining a living city we will have enormous transport and commuter problems. If, as is more likely, we force people out of the city to live in the country, <Col N="239" /> we will have a dead city which is what is happening at the moment.</P>
    <P>According to a study area investigated by Dublin Corporation for the purpose of a draft development plan, one third of the industries now located in the county were relocated from previous locations in the city.  Almost 90 per cent of these were from inner city areas. Ninety per cent of one-third of the total of new industries setting up in the county had left the city because of the various and complex hostilities which an industrialist at any level in the city, as well as residents, have to contend with.</P>
    <P>If we are to talk about urban development, we are faced with a tradition in recent times of job evacuation from the city.  In the labour force projections from 1971 to 1991 one can see that the 1991 projected population for Dublin, based on natural increases, is 1,150,000, an increase of almost 300,000 over 1971.  The labour force, that is the portion of the population available for gainful occupation, is estimated to increase over the same period by 130,000.  It will be noted that the main labour force is estimated to grow, over the 1971 to 1991 period, by 95,000 to 314,000 and the female labour force by 35,000 to 146,000.  The average yearly increase in the labour force for the ten years to 1971 was 4,100.  For the following ten years, that is to 1981, the average increase is estimated to be about 5,400 for each year while the yearly increase for the ten years to 1991 is projected as 7,500.  That is based only on the natural increase in the Dublin population and it does not take into account the very real factor of immigration into the city.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, with one small exception, the number of people in employment has continued to decline consistently.  That is one of the most obvious social and economic landmarks on the horizon, there has been a constant drop in employment in the Dublin area.  Admittedly, the IDA recently came to see the lack of wisdom in their previous approach which tended to favour areas outside Dublin city.  For some mystical reason, the Dublin city area was expected to look after itself but <Col N="240" /> that has changed.  However, the efforts of the IDA may be too little and too late because the number in employment in Dublin is still dropping.  I suggest that part of the reason is that there is not sufficient confidence in the private or public sector, or among those living in the city, that the city is being governed adequately. It is not being governed adequately because the structure of government is wrong for it.  It needs to be changed. That regional approach, the ability of a Government to define the complexity of problems in a specific area and to respond structurally to those, is not referred to in the White Paper.  The many and varied studies available to us show clearly that if we are to get a revitalisation of Dublin city or employment increased, and our people to obtain a satisfactory standard of education, we will not be able to do so by saying, for example, that the pupil-teacher ratio in Athlone or Foxrock should be the same as it is in the inner city parts of Dublin.  The same applies to other areas of government.  A different approach is necessary.</P>
    <P>I wonder how the demand with regard to education will be met because it is not being met by the traditional pattern of government we have or by the Department of Education.  The demand for primary school places is likely to increase by 33,000 pupils to a total of 169,000 over the 20 years to 1991.  This is likely to necessitate additional accommodation in the range of 42 to 52 sixteen-unit schools or equivalent.  The amount of land required will depend to some extent on the number of units per school but is likely to be of the order of 200 acres.  The increase in demand for post-primary education is estimated at 25,000 pupils bringing the post-primary population to 89,000 pupils in 1991.  The number of new community schools is estimated at 25 and the related land requirement at 390 acres.  However, the local authority for Dublin city, the body responsible for the management and planning of our city, does not have a land bank for schools or responsibility in that area.  Yet, there is this enormous educational demand which will be realised within the next 12 years and which cannot be tackled unless we change the structure we now have.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> The implications of other aspects of social and economic activities for the planning of our city are also clear.  For example, consumer expenditure on convenience goods will increase enormously. I could quote figures at length in relation to this matter but I do not have time to do so.  The various elements of social and economic activity are not being responded to by a properly structured body capable of dealing with these matters. The projected labour force of 1991 has been estimated at 460,000, an increase of 130,000 over the 20 years.  To sum up that great need to create jobs in Dublin city alone and to be able to respond in a structural way to the huge problem I should like to quote some figures which I found interesting.  Based on the 1961 to 1971 trends the projected number of jobs available in 1991 in Dublin is 392,000.  The projected labour force, on the basis already outlined, is 460,000.  Assuming the traditional definition of full employment which, mysteriously to me, is 4 per cent unemployment, this would mean a total of 442,000 seeking employment or a shortfall in jobs of some 50,000.  If, on the other hand, the growth in employment was based on the slower rate of the 1966-1971 period&mdash;I suggest that the evidence is there to indicate that that is the base on which the future trend in Dublin will be dictated&mdash;then the 1991 shortfall for Dublin would be 75,000 jobs.  It should be remembered that that is for the existing population based on natural increase and not on the rate of immigration.  If one adds the immigration to Dublin from other areas, including areas outside the State, and offset emigration from Dublin to other parts one will find that there will be an estimated need of another 64,000 jobs on top of the figure I referred to.  Before 1991 there will be in excess of 139,000 jobs needed if we are to maintain the 4 per cent unemployment.  No further comment is necessary.  By that standard Dublin must be seen as a crisis area.  It is a crisis area because the structure of government is wrong for it and because the Government do not believe or refer to the need for a regional approach to such problems.  That regional approach is not a new concept.  It is valid in the <Col N="242" /> EEC and Irish context.  The Gaeltacht authority and SFADCo have at heart a regional approach which identifies and specifies certain problems in an area and responds to them in a structural way but, it appears, anything is good enough for Dublin.  I deplore that view and I ask the Government to reconsider it.</P>
    <P>The mismanagement of the city is reflected in many ways, particularly in the housing figures available to us.  The White Paper sadly outlines the continuing decline in the building of local authority houses.  It is reflected further in the mismanagement of what I call the public estate, the hundreds of acres of derelict sites.  Vacant premises at present occupy about 7 per cent of total gross floor space.  In other words, nearly 300 acres is occupied by vacant premises. We should be able to tackle the problems of dereliction and vacant premises and if there is a problem of utilising them rapidly and turning them into viable units we should have a structure of government which can do that. Unfortunately, this is not the case at present.</P>
    <P>I regret I have not more time to deal with the housing situation because the number of new houses required in Dublin from 1971 to 1991 is of the order of 111,000.  That figure is based on existing standards of deprivation and not on filling the whole need.  I hope a change is brought about in this area. Finally, I should like to refer to a fine study on Youth Employment in North Central Dublin which deals with the various aspects of the need for a regional approach to government in Dublin.  It is sad to read the statistics of tragedy in it. That report tells us that male unemployment in some areas can be as much as 20 per cent and tells us of the lack of hygiene facilities, the basic deficiency of baths and so on.  That report points out that 80 per cent of households consist of four rooms or less.  With regard to education it states that as much as 84 per cent of the young people leave school without even the most basic educational qualification.  That study, prepared by Brenda Murphy and Terri Morrissey, points out that 52 per cent of the respondents in the survey who had <Col N="243" /> left school were employed while 48 per cent were unemployed.  One of the most marked features of this whole pattern of inner city deprivation and joblessness was the degree of exploitation of these young people.  It stated that the low wages of all respondents was most marked.  Believe it or not, a mere 3.4 per cent of employed and unemployed either were or had been taking home over £30 per week, and 96.6 per cent of the people were taking home less than £30 per week&mdash;this survey was carried out last year&mdash;and no unemployed female had taken home more than £20 a week.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal in that study which could help the Government and the Minister.  Unfortunately it does not find a response at the moment in the White Paper.  I would ask the Government, therefore, to undertake a review of the structure of government particularly with regard to the need for a regional approach to Dublin.  The sheer demographic social implications of the enormous and growing problem in Dublin need a specific response and that response can only be brought about if the Government have the courage to say that Dublin, and maybe other areas in due course, needs a form of regional government with adequately devolved powers to get on and do the job and not to continue to live in the inertia which exists at the moment and which is only a recipe for growing disintegration in transport, jobs, housing and all other areas.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that and in due course to give a sympathetic response to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with some of the areas of activity which impinge on my responsibilities.  I would like to say a few words about manufacturing industry, to look at how it has done in the past year and see what the prospects are for the coming year.  It achieved vigorous and impressive progress in 1978.  There was an intensification of the strong recovery of industrial output which had begun the previous year and in 1978 it was 10 per cent higher than in 1977.  Our manufactured <Col N="244" /> exports increased their share of world trade in an international economic environment which continues to be uncertain.</P>
      <P>Employment in the manufacturing sector in the final quarter of 1978 was on present estimates 7,000 higher than a year earlier.  This represents the industry's best performance since the boom year of 1973 when there was an increase of 7,300, the highest ever.  This increase in manufacturing employment last year was a major contributor to the overall reduction in unemployment.  The growth in output in exports and in employment was accompanied by a substantial increase in industrial investment. In 1978 the Industrial Development Authority approved for grant assistance investment projects which have the potential to provide over 30,000 new jobs in full production.  This surpassed by more than 3,000 what was the highest ever job approvals target in the authority's history.  This record performance by the IDA is all the more commendable because it was achieved in the face of razor-sharp competition from both industrialised and developing countries for mobile industrial investment.</P>
      <P>When one sees the competition that we were subjected to both from within and without the EEC it is worth reflecting at this point that there are close on 20 states associated with the Community who have access to the Community, as we have, for their manufactured output but who are not subject to the rules of the Community. Some of these states are not underdeveloped in any sense of the word; they are far more advanced than we are and include countries like Finland, Norway, Switzerland and various others.  The fact that they have the same rights in the Community so far as the sale of their manufacturing output is concerned as we have and they have none of the obligations, is a matter that might be borne in mind by the Community, and in particular by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the Community one wonders if the lack of an adequate co-ordination policy in regard to state aids is wise from <Col N="245" /> the Community's point of view when it is borne in mind that small and comparatively underdeveloped countries, in the industrial sense, like Ireland, have to compete with large very well developed countries, in the industrial sense, who have had an industrial tradition for centuries where we have only started to build one in the last couple of decades. An example of this is the attitude of the Commission in the past 12 months in approving of aids to the establishment of mobile international industry in Britain, and in particular in Scotland.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that our average grant payment to a new industry up to last year, when the figures were last worked out, was about £3,500 per job. Nonetheless, the Commission in their wisdom found themselves able to approve of the British Government making a payment of many millions of pounds to a non-Community industry to establish itself in Scotland last year, and the rate of grant paid by the British, apart from other facilities they gave in ancillary ways, was £106,000 per job.  It is difficult for me and for most of us in this country to reconcile the avowed intention of the Community, and particularly the Commission, to raise the standard of living and industrial investment in the peripheral and less developed regions of the Community when some parts of it are given the blessing of the Commission to make payments of that kind.</P>
    <P>The main beneficiaries from this aura of competition which has grown up between Community countries are non-Community multi-nationals.  It is disturbing, and should be disturbing, for all Europeans in the Community that the Commission seem to condone a situation in which relatively impoverished Community states bid against one another in an auction and the benefits go outside this continent.</P>

      <P>I would hope that it might be possible for those who are concerned with these matters in the Community to consider again the consequences of not controlling that sort of <Col N="246" /> situation.  The encouraging rise in labour productivity in 1978 demonstrates the strength and potential for further rapid advance by the manufacturing sector of industry.  The present continuing high level of investment will give further impetus to exports, output and productivity growth this year.  The annual target of 10,000 net actual jobs in manufacturing over the three-year period, 1979 to 1981, inclusive, although ambitious, is a challenge which in my view industry, both private and public, is capable of achieving.  However, not alone will we fail to reach this target and thereby deprive our young population of the opportunity to work but we will also add to the number of unemployed if we continue to pay ourselves income increases which have not been earned by higher productivity and if those in employment, particularly those in the sheltered sector, choose by means of industrial action to disrupt the production of goods and services in furtherance of sectional interests.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly in the debate yesterday described references by members of the Government to the necessity for not paying ourselves income increases, which have not been earned by higher productivity, as bleating.  I ask Deputy Kelly, or anybody else for that matter, who has been critical of what members of the Government have said in this regard in recent weeks if they believe we are right.  Surely anybody who has a modicum of common sense and intelligence must know that in this or any other country we cannot afford to meet some of the claims which have been made in recent times and that if on paper they were to be met they would be met literally with paper and not with money in the real sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned in particular that many of those demands were coming from what I described as people in the sheltered sectors. The majority of those people are in public employment.  It is interesting to note the result of a survey carried out recently in Trinity College into industrial relations here last year.  The survey showed that no less than 80 per cent of the working days which were lost last year in our worst strikes were in the <Col N="247" /> State sector.  Today's <i>Irish Press</i> states that the TCD study makes the point that public service workers seem to be less concerned at the prospects of job loss through strike action.  It says that there were 509,418 man-days lost during 1978, which is 15 per cent more than in the previous year, but 34 per cent less than the worst year which was 1976.</P>
    <P>I will be speaking later about some of our public manufacturing enterprises. One is perhaps more cautious than one might otherwise have been in relation to the public sector and job creation in manufacturing industry in the public sector in particular when one considers that report and when one sees, for example, what happened to several such firms last year.  Deputy Desmond last year drew attention to the often unfair way in which public enterprises were treated on the basis that they were a bottomless well and that the taxpayer would always bail them out.</P>
    <P>There also seems in recent times to be another incentive almost for taking industrial action, which often scarcely seems justified, against public undertakings. That incentive is brought out by this Trinity College study when it draws attention to the fact that no matter how damaging a strike is, how prolonged or what losses it creates to the public enterprise concerned, that enterprise will not go out of business and the strikers can strike away with impunity, whether they are justified or not, because their jobs will always be there at the end of the day.  That situation does not arise in private manufacturing industry where firms often may simply have to disappear. It is possible for me to give examples of certain public manufacturing enterprises whose financial situation is now such that if they were in the private sector they would no longer be in business.</P>
    <P>Our participation in the proposed EMS will impose disciplines on and present opportunities for expansion by Irish industry.  If industry is to be equal to this challenge it must ensure that it maintains and enhances its competitiveness by all possible means.  It must also ensure that it directs its efforts towards the diversification <Col N="248" /> of its exports outside the UK market.  If those two conditions are met the achievement of the manufacturing job targets postulated in the White Paper will then be largely determined by the efforts of the IDA in negotiating new jobs in industry on a scale which has not previously been attained.</P>
    <P>The IDA intend to publish shortly an industrial plan covering the period 1978 to 1982.  The central objective of the plan will be the maintenance over the next four years of the extraordinarily high level of job approvals which were secured in 1978.  This will necessitate the targets of the IDA being restated upwards. In support of this relentless industrial drive the financial resources being made available by the Government to the IDA this year have been very considerably increased.  The capital resources have been increased from £78 million to £109 million and the administrative expenses have been increased from £7 million to £8,500,000. A large part of the huge budget of the IDA this year will be expended on the provision of advance factories under the largest construction programme which has ever been undertaken by them.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the White Paper to the first two phases of this programme which will provide 38 factories and four clusters at locations in all parts of the country, including a great many in Dublin, I may add for the benefit of Deputy Keating.  Last week I announced details of a third phase comprising a further 26 factories and three clusters.  Those three phases together will result in the provision of over 1.3 million square feet of factory space.  The programme, therefore, is true testimony of the Government's commitment to assist the IDA in meeting the higher job creation and job approval targets.  Factories are being and will be built in the areas of greatest employment need in the nine planning regions&mdash;we have no intention of concentrating on any one to the detriment of any others&mdash;and that is an integral part of the Government's policy of regional industrialisation.</P>
    <P>A particularly gratifying feature of the performance of the IDA in 1978 was the outturn under the small industries programme.  The year 1978 was an outstanding <Col N="249" /> one for the programme with the record total of 400 projects approved for grant assistance and a potential for over 5,000 jobs in full production.  The Shannon Free Airport Development Company performed exceptionally well in their new and challenging role for the promotion of small, indigenous industry in the mid-west.  The target of 500 job approvals which was set for them was handsomely exceeded.</P>
    <P>Equally encouraging is the response to the new enterprise development programme which is designed to encourage Irish people with the necessary ability and experience to start their own manufacturing businesses with IDA support. Twenty-two projects with employment potential in excess of 900 were approved under this scheme in 1978.  Small firms are an integral part in any country's industrial structure and their importance is coming to be more and more recognised.  In the Irish context a small firm makes a vital contribution to the life of smaller towns and villages which would not be able to support large scale industry.  The small industries programme will remain an important part of the IDA's activities.  Indeed, many of the new advance factories will be designed specifically for the smaller firm.</P>
    <P>The Government programme for the promotion and stimulation of industrial investment compares favourably with that available anywhere in the world. The new tax incentive to replace exports sales relief from 1 January 1981 will provide a powerful stimulant to investment and job creation from both home and overseas sources.  It will act as a further spur to firms to hasten the pace of the replacement and modernisation programmes which are an equally vital part of our industrial development strategy.</P>
    <P>The development of the potential of the State-sponsored sector is mentioned in the White Paper and I referred to it briefly earlier.  It was indicated in the White Paper that the Industrial Development Consortium has addressed itself to the question.  The consortium has been actively canvassing State-sponsored bodies for development proposals and a number of ideas are under consideration. <Col N="250" /> We have been stressing the importance of the State-sponsored bodies directing their considerable technical and administrative resources to consider diversification, expansion or joint venture possibilities in order to identify soundly-based employment-creating projects.  We have also indicated that the procurement of the necessary capital finance should not and would not be an obstacle to bringing such projects to fruition.</P>
    <P>The potential of the State-sponsored sector may be gauged in the context of the new projects currently being undertaken by Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta and Irish Steel Holdings Limited.  NET are nearing completion of their ammonia/urea plant at Marino Point in Cork Harbour where there will be permanent employment of 400 men and Irish Steel Holdings have now finally embarked on their development programme at Haulbowline, County Cork which will enable them to maintain the existing work force of 700 for the decades ahead.  It is worth noting at this point what the cost of these two projects is likely to be.  The latest estimate I have is that the NET project will now cost not less than £115 million.  This exceeds by an enormous margin the original estimate. I have discussed with the board the reasons for this enormous excess both in terms of money and in terms of time.  The board have given me detailed explanations as to why this has happened; they have my sympathy in the difficulties which they faced.  Perhaps one of the root causes of the difficulty is that NET is owned by the Irish taxpayer and is therefore fair game for all and sundry to have a go at.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that experience with some State manufacturing enterprises of recent times gave one cause to be worried or anxious.  This is an example of why one has good reason for being worried or anxious.  The Irish Steel Holdings development programme which took about a year to get through the Commission but which happily we have now steered through and which has now started is going to be very expensive. It is going to cost the Irish taxpayer over £40 million and is not going to create one job.  I certainly offer my very best wishes to the board of Irish Steel in <Col N="251" /> the difficult period that they have ahead of them while the construction of this new plant is going on.  I will watch with great interest how it goes because one would feel that it would be a major tragedy for public manufacturing enterprise here if the Irish Steel project were to run into some of the difficulties which its neighbour, the NET project, a couple of miles away, encountered over the past few years.</P>
    <P>There are various other State companies in the manufacturing and allied sectors whose plans for expansion are under examination, whom we have encouraged to expand and diversify but it is necessary&mdash;and the Government are satisfied of this in their own mind&mdash;that these companies and these plans and these new ideas would not be subjected to the rather unfair pressures that some State companies and organisations have been subjected to in recent times.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has pressed the Government quite strongly to maximise the State's involvement in manufacturing industry.  None of us in the Government has any ideological or other objections to doing that but we feel that we have a duty to the taxpayer to whom we are responsible in the last resort to act prudently and not to expose the public purse to the kind of dangers it has been exposed to in recent times.</P>
    <P>I want to move on to deal with the other main aspect of my Department and that is the question of trade and commerce.  As good news bears repetition I now intend to deal in somewhat more detail than I have previously with our export performance in 1978.  The good news is that in 1978&mdash;and the final figures were published yesterday&mdash;for the second year in succession Ireland's export performance surpassed both in value and in volume the growth rate of our partners in the European Economic Community.  To achieve in 1978 a new record figure of £2.96 billion, an increase of almost 18 per cent on the figures for 1977, is laudable but to do so in the uncertain trading environment of last year is remarkable and all those who contributed to that achievement deserve our congratulations on an excellent job.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> But it is not the past achievements of Irish exporters and of CTT which I wish to emphasise today but the importance of exports in translating into reality our aspirations in regard to prosperity and employment.  As the White Paper points out, the maintenance of a high level of growth in exports is one of the key conditions for the achievement of our objectives and that requires effort in terms of planning, time and money by all concerned. This year the CTT target is a figure of £3.5 billion, an increase of 18 per cent on last year's figure.  The interest not only of the economy but of the community as a whole and our social aspirations depend to a large degree on our reaching that target.</P>
    <P>For their part, the Government will make available to Córas Tráchtála the sum of £5.7 million, that is an increase of more than 10 per cent on the amount of last year's grant-in-aid, an increase of about 30 per cent since 1977, and the largest amount made available in any one year to that body since their establishment. The Government recognise the value of CTT's contribution in the past and will offer all the encouragement and support within their power to Córas Tráchtála in the future so that industry may receive the fullest possible measure of service from them.</P>
    <P>The British economy, which has experienced a minor boom based mainly on consumer spending, manifests all the symptoms of uncertainty and is expected to be less buoyant next year.  At the Bonn economic summit last July, the seven major industrialised countries agreed to embark on a concerted action policy of simultaneous economic expansion. Results are likely, however, to be gradual and though recent expansionary measures taken by the Federal Republic of Germany and Japan may be expected to have an effect in 1979, it is unlikely that expansion in the major western economies will be sufficient to offset the predicted slow down of economic growth in the United States.  Economic growth in the OECD area as a whole is forecast to register 3 per cent this year as compared with 3.6 per cent in 1978. All of this adds up to a need for increased effort on our part.</P>
    <P>CTT will expand and intensify their <Col N="253" /> promotional activities.  Offices newly opened in Madrid and Zurich bring to a record figure of 21 the number of their offices abroad and increases significantly the geographical spread of those offices in Europe.  The main thrust of CTT's efforts will be directed towards our partners in the European Economic Community and the remainder of the Continent.</P>
    <P>The level of CTT's incentive grants has been raised.  They are prepared to make available to manufacturers from their vast expertise a fund of information and advice.  They offer manufacturers the opportunity to take part in their group promotional activities in a manner which would be outside the capacity of an individual firm.  They pave the way for firms to enter new markets and ease the difficulties caused by language and cultural barriers.  They initiate studies and explore the potential of areas previously outside Ireland's trading experience.</P>
    <P>The resources of CTT are, as always, at the disposal of firms, but I cannot emphasise too strongly the need for investment by individual firms, both of time and money.  CTT seek to identify factors which hinder or facilitate the expansion of our export trade.  One factor which has already emerged as a major impediment to expansion is the lack of appreciation by many Irish firms of the role of marketing.  Many manufacturers are still primarily production-oriented to the neglect of the marketing dimension; they see themselves as makers of products rather than as sellers.  Selling is the final stage of a long process, but it is the end to which the whole process is directed and it should determine the plans and activities of the enterprise.</P>
    <P>Irish manufacturers are second to none in their ability to produce goods of competitive quality, but the long period of protectionism has left its mark: firms were assured of a home market and their horizons were limited to producing for that market.  Free trade has meant that marketing has assumed a new importance, not only for the export market but also for the home market.</P>
    <P>Manufacturers must pay more attention to their wholesale and retail trades, they must keep in continuous touch with <Col N="254" /> consumer tastes and preferences and they must watch closely the ever-changing structure of demand.  Continental and other foreign markets need to be researched and studied and kept under constant review.  This necessitates the employment of expertise and the expenditure of money; not only a change of attitude but a financial commitment is required of manufacturers.  The maintenance of a highly qualified marketing staff abroad is expensive but essential.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the resources of CTT are always at the disposal of firms, but the varying circumstances of individual firms and of sectors of industry make it impossible to provide guidelines of general application.  Every Irish manufacturer must analyse objectively the market for the goods which he produces and the competition he must face.  This must be done in sufficient depth to enable him to forecast the marketability of his products and to enable him to adopt a strategy designed to achieve the full potential of his enterprise.</P>
    <P>The challenge to industry is great.  I have no desire to minimise the difficulties or to deny the magnitude of the efforts being asked from all involved, but the impossible is not being asked.  Irish industry showed last year that it was capable of competing with and surpassing the best of Europe.  This year a greater input of effort and money is asked for.  However, the rewards are such that the effort is unquestionably worthwhile&mdash;more employment, a greater prosperity which can be shared and the knowledge that a significant contribution has been made to the well-being and security of the whole community.</P>
    <P>It is possible in general terms to divide Irish exports into three broad categories. One category comprises our agricultural exports, which are very substantial.  The second, again very substantial, are the exports from major international IDA-assisted firms who came here relatively recently, who are very strong in marketing and who often have their export markets lined up before they get into production here.  The third, who need the assistance of CTT only to a limited extent, the one on whom CTT <Col N="255" /> have to expend most of their energies, effort and money, is the part of Irish industry which is traditional, very often indigenous, very often composed of people who have survived native protectionism and who never have had a proper marketing organisation outside the country and who, except in recent times, have never thought in terms of export at all and who look on Britain and Northern Ireland simply as extensions of the home market for which a different approach is not needed.</P>
    <P>They are firms who need help but they are also the firms who have to remember that we are living today in an era of free trade, falling barriers of all kinds, that our country has a population of 3¼ million people.  They must realise that if they are to expand and to prosper, if they are to expand employment or maintain existing employment, they must think in terms of marketing abroad and that in practice, because of recent developments in regard to EMS and so on, they would be very well advised to think in terms of markets outside Britain also.  I regret to say that many of them have been slow in these terms.  CTT are pressing them as much as they can, but there is a limit to what any promotional organisation can do if the will is not there on the part of individual firms to avail of the considerable opportunities that exist today.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I should like to say something on the question of energy, which is the third main section in my Department.  One almost hesitates to use the word since it gives rise to so much passion nowadays&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the general energy situation it is important to remember that we are dependent on imports for approximately 80 per cent of our energy requirements and that even a minor political upheaval in one or other of the oil producing countries could quickly upset the balance of supply and demand throughout the world.  If that balance is disturbed Ireland is one of the most vulnerable countries.  Because of our abnormally heavy dependence on imported oil we would be the most severely affected by any disruption of supply. Therefore, we must emphasise as much as possible the necessity even at a time like this when there is not an apparent scarcity, to exercise maximum economy in the use of all types of fuel.  Because of our membership of the European Communities and of the oil-sharing system drawn up by the International Energy Agency it is hoped that the hardships that would arise from a temporary shortage of oil products would be alleviated to some extent but it would be unrealistic to think that even those arrangements would offer us any kind of guarantee in a position of world shortage.  It would be unrealistic also to think that even a minor oil shortage would not have serious repercussions for our economy unless we are all prepared to reduce our demands on energy in the home, in the factory, in transport and in all sectors of the economy.  There are very definite limits below which that demand cannot go unless industry and jobs are to be put in jeopardy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Developments in Iran in recent weeks could have serious implications for oil supplies throughout the industrialised world, including Ireland, in the coming months.  This situation is a stark reminder of the vulnerability of our economy to political events in the Middle East.  The uncertainty surrounding the oil supply situation should make us all realise the importance of reducing our dependence on imported oil and of diversifying our sources of energy supplies.  It is impossible to talk about Iran with any confidence as to what might happen. Even today there is obviously a major development.  No one can know yet what the reaction to that development will be but irrespective of what may happen it is <Col N="257" /> almost certain that Iran which up to last month was the second largest oil exporter in the world, will reduce her oil exports considerably in the future.  The previous administration in Iran pushed with great vigour for the maximum output and the maximum export of oil products.  That has been the situation for a number of years, and in particular since the oil crisis at the end of 1973. The principal reason for that was that the then Government in Iran had in mind extremely ambitious expenditure especially in the defence sector.  But a changed administration would be most unlikely to follow that policy.  Only yesterday, I understand, the British Ministry for Defence were informed that an order for more than £1 billion sterling worth of British defence equipment was being cancelled by the present Government in Iran on the grounds that they did not see the need for such a vast amount of sophisticated armoury. Whatever may happen in Iran we may take it that the output and particularly the exports of oil products from there will be reduced very substantially.  This consideration must have a major bearing on the oil supply-and-demand situation in the current year.  Already the OPEC nations have imposed for the year by way of three instalments the rather heavy increase of 14½ per cent in the price of crude oil.  That will be followed by the less significant non-OPEC countries. It is difficult to know what further effect the Iranian situation will have but we can be sure that it will not have the effect of reducing the price increase. It is likely that the shortages that will occur as a result of the situation in Iran will lead to further price increases.  It is in that context that we should think very seriously both in the short term and in the medium term about the prospect facing us in terms of our sources of energy. We must look realistically at non-oil sources of energy for this country for the next 15 to 20 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We must face the fact that there are only two non-oil sources of energy available to us which can provide energy on a certain basis and in <Col N="258" /> the sort of quantities that we are likely to require.  Those two alternative sources are coal and nuclear energy.  The European Commission have calculated, and I think that the International Energy Agency have agreed broadly with them on this, that assuming good progress is made in the research now being undertaken under the auspices of the Community and of the agency into alternative or renewable sources of energy, it could be hoped that 5 per cent of Europe's energy requirements would be met from those sources by the year 2000.  Therefore, we cannot hope to generate more than 5 per cent of our needs from those sources by the year 2000.  Indeed, we may lag somewhat behind the European average because the most promising area perhaps so far as Europe generally is concerned is the area of solar energy and we are not very strong in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital, therefore, that emotion, political motives and the various other extremes that seem to enter this debate be forgotten about and that realism be faced.  The situation is rather stark and must be faced realistically.  The fact is that we have two alternative sources of energy on which we can rely to keep this country running between now and the year 2000.  Already we have made a major decision in regard to one of those alternatives.  In County Clare there is being built a coal station that will be the biggest station of any kind in the country.  But are we to substitute dependence on imported oil for dependence on imported coal?  While coal has certain advantages it has many great disadvantages.  So far as security of supply is concerned it has some advantages but these are only relatively limited.  Coal has enormous disadvantages in regard to environment and other aspects.  We are faced with that kind of choice and we should make our decisions on the basis of what is needed by the country and not for some kind of ephemeral emotional reasons that seem to dominate thinking nowadays rather than sheer facts.  We had a terrible tragedy in Bantry four weeks ago in connection with the unloading of oil from a tanker.  Fifty people died in an instant. One could argue, but I have not heard it <Col N="259" /> argued, that oil is therefore dangerous and should not be used in this country. As far as I am aware, 50 people never died in an accident connected with a coal-powered station or a nuclear power station although there are 250 of them operating in the world today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased to be in the House when the Minister was making his contribution.  I will refer to three points before I proceed to the area I want to focus on. Two of them run logically together.  It was interesting to hear the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy make an additional ideological attack on the public sector on the basis of job losses.  Perhaps on another day or another occasion one could pursue it.  I have not seen the study to which he refers, but the statistic which he quoted was that the 80 per cent of working days lost was attributable to State companies. This could be as much a factor of the degree of employment within those companies as anything else.  He made two comments in his speech, that if we were to respond to the challenge the rewards were high&mdash;I am speaking from memory&mdash;and among them were, first of all, more employment and, secondly, greater prosperity which could be shared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the sort of conditional statement that is uppermost in the minds of this party and of the trade union movement generally if there are rewards to be gained and if greater prosperity is to be achieved.  As far as we are concerned, there is no &ldquo;can&rdquo; about it; it is going to be shared, because to talk in terms of a reward for some section of the community with an income limit, wage restraint and moderation for the vast majority of people may be economic progress but it is not social development. The Minister also made an interesting observation which, undoubtedly, was a slip of the tongue but presumably represents conventional thinking within the party of reality as distinct from the theological position of any particular faction.  We are now at the stage where the third great aim of Fianna Fáil is to provide full employment just as the first <Col N="260" /> and second aims were the unification of the country and the restoration of the Irish language.  Significantly, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy seems to be informed to the extent that he believes the population of this country is three and a half million. He was no doubt referring to the population of this State.  That is an internal ideological matter that we may wish to refer to at another stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to devote my attention in this debate to the way in which White Papers have been used as instruments of Government policy making and to look at the area of transport, specifically the question of public transport, and to show that, while the Opposition have undoubtedly been successful in attempting to inform the Government of the realities implicit in transportation policy, and particularly in the question of public transport, we are further away from critical and fundamentally important decisions than we were in June 1977 when this Government took office.  It is unfortunate that the Minister responsible is not here.  Perhaps it is that Deputy Faulkner, since June 1977, is never anywhere, whether it is in regard to action on the unfortunate tragedy the Minister just referred to or on the question of telephones, postal services, public broadcasting or, indeed, on the question of transport.</P>
    <P>One can only assume that the reason Deputy Faulkner was appointed Minister was because of his capacity to remain politically invisible since June 1977.  It is hard to conceive of any other politician occupying with such continued and professional incompetence that combination of portfolios for so long and still remain more or less politically unscathed.  Maybe this is a testimony to the inactivity of the Opposition.  I am prepared to accept that.  Part of the reason no doubt is that Deputy Faulkner is an extremely pleasant, soft spoken individual with whom it is impossible to get personally angry or annoyed unless you happen to be a commuter sitting in a bus or somebody working in CIE trying to get a decision from the Department of Tourism and Transport.  The very debacle of the formation of that half-baked Department, when they gave <Col N="261" /> away tourism and then pulled it back, is indicative of the chaos implicit in the running of the Government's activities.</P>
    <P>Government is about more than simply creating jobs or pretending to create them.  People have to travel to and from work.  What did Fianna Fáil say, in Opposition, in their manifesto with regard to transport?  Page 35 of the sacred scripture, their manifesto, which has been referred to by Deputy Pádraig Flynn as the most important document ever produced in this country, states:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will establish a transport authority to investigate and report on the measures necessary to achieve the most efficient and economic transport system for goods and passengers having regard to the need to maintain a flexible competitive transport system&mdash;thereby ensuring the facilities necessary for industrial development through the country as a whole. </P>
    <P>If that is what four years of think-tank produces in terms of policy development, then we can hardly be surprised at what was produced six months later when Fianna Fáil had the benefit of the Department of Tourism and Transport as it officially was.  The very title indicates the priorities within that Department.</P>
    <P>The White Paper of January 1978 was published by the Department of Economic Planning and Development on behalf of the Government.  In fairness to Deputy O'Donoghue he has never professed to have any knowledge of transportation, and that is quite obvious from this document.  From my knowledge of the way this document was prepared, at some stage initially submissions were taken from the various Government Departments.  Page 45, paragraph 5.12 of that document, states:</P>
    <P>The Government intend to pursue policies which will enable public transport to meet the needs of economic social development. </P>
    <P>That is the first statement and one could hardly argue with it.  They jump from that to the following sentence:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> There has been a serious increase in recent years in the losses incurred by Córas Iompair Éireann. </P>
    <P>They go on to say how much they are going to attempt to monitor the role of CIE with the intention of reducing its losses.  That was all we had for public transport.  I will not bore the House with further quotations.  That was the focus, a generalised non-statement about public transport and an immediate focusing in on the losses of CIE.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies on this side of the House tried to point out the total poverty of that kind of policy approach. Some of the things we said appeared to take root in the barren soil on the far side of the House.  I and a number of other Deputies asked questions about the electrification programme submitted by CIE, the role of CIE, and the transportation authority promised in the manifesto.  In June 1978 the Government's paper, Mark II, Development for Full Employment, was a little more explicit about public transport and the major area of public transport in the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>I will quote the relevant part because it comes back to energy for which the Minister of State has some responsibility. On page 55 in relation to the application by CIE of moneys for the electrification of the suburban rail system in Dublin it is stated:</P>
    <P>The rail commuter services also have an attractive record for their safety, efficiency in the use of energy and relatively minor contribution to atmospheric pollution.  Indeed, the Dublin Transportation Study and the McKinsey Report on CIE recognised the valuable role which the suburban system plays, and foresaw it playing an expanded role in coping with traffic growth.  CIE have proposed the electrification of the Dublin suburban railway line from Howth to Bray at an estimated cost of £41 million (at 1978 prices), and this could constitute the first stage of a comprehensive Rapid Rail Transit System envisaged by CIE for the greater Dublin area.  The total cost of such a system is estimated at about £220 million.... </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> This document goes a little further.  With the same logic which permeates the entire Government benches, having recognised that CIE had done some work and that some study had been done on transportation, and although the think tank had done nothing for four years&mdash;only after pressure from this side of the House did the Government realise that a vast volume of work had been done both by CIE and the DTS&mdash;they made the following observations:</P>
    <P>The Dublin commuter rail service is, however, already operating at an annual loss in excess of £3 million (at 1978 prices),&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;more of the same anti-CIE attitude&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and CIE have advised that a heavy additional investment in replacing rolling-stock and the signalling system will be required in the next few years.  In this situation the options arising are to electrify as recommended by CIE, to maintain the service as it is, or to change standards in various ways. </P>
    <P>The last time we had a debate on this document I asked somebody on the Government side to differentiate between those three options, to clarify the actual intention and to give some indication of what might conceivably be meant by the last option spelled out as &ldquo;to change standards in various ways&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Have the Department of Economic Planning and Development some special school for gobbledy-gook writers who come up with these weird phrases, the benefit of which is that you can take more or less what meaning you like out of them?  I referred that statement to a number of people for their interpretation. I would be quite happy to hear anybody on the Government side of the House, or any of the advisers available to them, stating what options are available to the Government in that area.  At last they recognise in this document that they have to do something and that there are marginal benefits attached to it, something of which they were not aware before.  Having recognised that, they focus on the losses and say they have <Col N="264" /> three options.  I am open to correction, but it appears to me that there are only two options: to electrify or to maintain the services as they are.</P>
    <P>If we are to take the second one literally, I would advise the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to stand in the stations in his constituency in the morning and say: &ldquo;One of the options we are considering seriously for the suburban rail system is to maintain the services as they are.&rdquo;  If he was not run down in the rush, or thrown over the sea wall at any point from Dún Laoghaire inwards, he would be very fortunate. How can anybody seriously suggest that there is an option to maintain the services as they are?  I fail to understand the logic of that.  Any commuter on the Dún Laoghaire route, of which presumably the Minister for Economic Planning and Development has some experience and knowledge, can tell you that the services are declining rapidly at the moment, and have declined seriously over the past couple of years.  Presumably, therefore, that is not an option and, in fairness to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, he is not that stupid.</P>
    <P>There is one option open to the Government, unless the Minister of State can explain to me &ldquo;to change standards in various ways&rdquo;, and that is, to electrify.  There is a possible extension to that which is to opt for diesel rather than electricity.  We can come to that later on in the context of what the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy told the House with regard to the position of diesel supply from Iran and other places.</P>
    <P>I want to move now to the White Paper before the House.  Let us see if there has been any movement, or if anything has sunk in on the other side of the House.  On reading the White Paper my first reaction was that I was pleased to see that some of the discussion articulated in this House by this party and some members of the Fine Gael Party has been recognised to the extent that it has now been incorporated in the text. We are not getting any decisions.  Lest anyone thinks I intend to use flowery phrases about White Paper, Mark III, that is not on.  At least the argument we have been putting forward has been recognised and has gained the status of <Col N="265" /> being incorporated in some form in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Presumably the Minister for Economic Planning and Development visited some of the stations, and presumably the feed-back from the various Deputies began to filter back into the ranks in the 84 seats, because on page 72 at paragraph 5.19 we are told that urban transport is now a priority area.  When I read that I felt like sending a bouquet of roses to the relevant person.  After 18 months of total chaos, of mounting congestion, of an energy crisis which the Minister has argued time and time again is so critical that we have no time for a public inquiry into the proposal for Carnsore Point&mdash;and transportation in the Dublin region is a major factor in terms of energy and has great potential for energy conservation&mdash;this Government of all the talents, with 84 seats and enormous administrative experience, suddenly discover in the phrase in the White Paper that urban transport is now a priority area.  Let us be thankful for small mercies.</P>
    <P>Having recognised that, without giving credit to the people who forced the argument down their throats, let us see what is proposed in an area now given the status of being a priority.  Paragraph 5.19 reads:</P>
    <P>Urban transport is now a priority area, as increasing congestion is causing serious delays in the movement of passengers and goods and consequent increases in costs and frustration. There is no easy solution to the vicious circle of growing traffic congestion leading to deterioration in bus services, which in turn leads to increased utilisation of private cars, still greater congestion of traffic, fewer people using buses, loss of revenue to public transport and increased Exchequer subsidy.  Improved public transport services can, however, lead to a substantial alleviation of these problems and the Government, accordingly, see public transport as having a developing role in urban areas. </P>
    <P>At last the direction is moving along a path on which there would be agreement on both sides of the House, but it is 18 months too late, 18 months after the car <Col N="266" /> tax gimmick.  What do they propose to do?  In paragraph 5.22 there is an old phrase from the second White Paper: &ldquo;...the Government propose to maintain the Dublin commuter rail services, whose existence substantially reduces the flow of road vehicles, both buses and cars, that would otherwise be entering and leaving the city during the rush hours.&rdquo;  What does &ldquo;maintain&rdquo; actually mean in February 1979?  Does it mean that they want to maintain them as they were this morning or does it mean maintaining them as indicated in June last year?  If so, would either of the two Fianna Fáil Deputies like to take their place in the queue for any of the suburban rail services and say that one of the proposals of the Government is to maintain the service as it is?  Would Deputy Ahern like to assure people who travel in from the part of the city that he knows well that that is a serious Government policy?  I think I know the answer.</P>
    <P>To take a more benign interpretation of the word &ldquo;maintain&rdquo;, if the intention of the Government is to provide money for new rolling stock, to provide capital sums for the upgrading and maintenance of the suburban rail system and the provision of new diesel locomotives, in other words, maintaining the existing type of rail service without opting for the electrification of the system, we have yet to see evidence of it.  Evidence is certainly not available in the public estimates which were published this morning.  In fact, the capital expenditure figure for CIE goes from £11.7 million last year to an even £15 million this year and that is only for miscellaneous maintenance. One can only deduct that no capital provision of the scale required has been made this year to maintain the services. Therefore, all the Government are saying is that they are not going to do anything at present for the suburban rail system.  If that is a fair interpretation, the White Paper is deliberately misleading the public.  It is my solemn responsibility to point out what I consider to be a deliberate Government deception.</P>
    <P>One could argue that in every section on transport the drafting of the three White Papers points to the difficulties in terms of costs subsidy attendant on the role of CIE and the difficulties of <Col N="267" /> providing for those services, and then immediately turns in glowing terms to the capacity of the road network to solve many of our transport problems.  This contrast between the two modes of transport is constant and glaring in terms of the gap between the perception of the role of public transport in overall economic terms and the role of an improved road system.  Yet, the argument for the road system is weak.  While we have more miles per population than any other OECD country, the national primary roads system counts for 3 per cent of our total road system and carries up to 25 per cent of the national traffic load.  Much of the capital road programme that the Government referred to is not going to create the necessary improvements and is concentrated in areas where there is major traffic congestion brought about by commuters.  Every transportation expert in the world concedes that the journey to work is the most predictable trip that an urban population is likely to make and is more readily catered for by a system of urban public transport.</P>
    <P>On a statistical note, two eminent Fianna Fáil names&mdash;Andrews and Lemass&mdash;have been associated over the years with the decimation of the rail services.</P>

      <P>There was no insult intended. The public perception of CIE is that railways belong to the 19th century. The only time anyone thinks of them is when they are being closed.  It may come as a surprise to learn that there are more railways being built at present than at any time since the beginning of the century. Major rail systems are being built in five continents.  They are being built on terms relative to economic criteria as perceived by those concerned.  More undergrounds are being built at present than at any time in the past and more cities are seriously considering building them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I move on to the overall macro benefits of energy and transportation, I <Col N="268" /> should like to refer to the invisible Minister for Tourism and Transport. Presumably the Department of Tourism and Transport had some input into these White Papers.  If one bases one's analysis on the collective impact of the three White Papers and assumes that the initial one in January 1978 summarises the Department's perception of public transport, we find that there is no recognition of the positive role of public transport and an immediate focus on CIE's yearly losses.  From January 1978 to this year the research facilities and the staffing resources of the Department of Economic Planning and Development have been augmented and it is not an unfair assumption that there are people in that Department who have looked at the question of public transport with a less jaundiced eye than the weary principal officer in Tourism and Transport whose major problem is the amount of subsidy which CIE require from year to year.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Government, as represented here, have recognised the validity of the case relative to the role of public transport, that recognition has come from within the Department of Economic Planning and Development and has not been reflected in any new thinking in the Department of Tourism and Transport.  Back at the ranch, so to speak, in the Department one year after it had come under the sure hands of the present Minister&mdash;one would have thought he had enough to do with Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;it was announced on 19 September 1978&mdash;one year and three months actually&mdash;that the Government were setting up the Transport Consultative Committee to give effect to its manifesto commitments.</P>
    <P>The manifesto commitment was to a transportation authority, albeit an authority whose simple function it would be to investigate and report on necessary transportation measures.  Nevertheless, it was to be an authority, which if the English language means anything on that side of the House, would have some kind of role to play and some sort of responsibility.  It is now being downgraded after 15 months to the status of a commission.  The members of the commission were listed and the terms of reference were published. <Col N="269" /> Without wishing to name any member of that commission it is clear that their common denominator is that they know nothing about transport&mdash;they know a good deal about other things&mdash;with the exception of one member who happens to have a role in one of the transport institutes. The apparent qualification for membership is that you can either look at transport with an ignorant eye or a fresh eye.  Either way, the requirement is that basically you do not know anything about the details and specifics of transportation.</P>
    <P>That may be the norm in the Department of Transport and Tourism and they may have felt that it was preferable to have people at the same level of development as themselves rather than people who might know something about transport, but it does not augur well for the country at large or for the achievement of any of the aspirations contained in the White Paper which at last, after 18 months, recognises that urban transport is now a priority area. We have nobody on this commission who knows any details about urban transportation: they are all extremely busy, committed people representing different parts of the country, serviced by an official from the Department. Anybody who seriously thinks they will come up with anything of consequence within the next two years is completely naive and knows nothing about the operation of our governmental system.</P>
    <P>This document is clearly a stall, a complete and total stall postponing a decision.  There is an application from CIE for a miserable £41 million, miserable in view of the £1,000 million public investment programme announced this morning; miserable in terms of the money that this Government are capable of throwing apparently like confetti into certain sectors of the economy in the hope that some of it might stick and that we might get jobs; miserable in view of the £500,000 apparently thrown into a company in Athy which was put into receivership within a couple of months; miserable in terms of the number of people, the one million passengers carried daily by CIE; miserable by reference to the number of Irish passengers carried by Aer Lingus <Col N="270" /> which apparently can get money from the Exchequer every time they turn on the tap.  Miserable by any criterion of overall Government spending is the refusal of the Government to recognise this application for money.  They have not the guts to say that they do not really care about public transport or to say that they are a right wing party which really believes that personal mobility depends on owning a tax free car and driving anywhere you like.  The Government hide behind this kind of nonsense&mdash;and it is nonsense&mdash;the Transportation Consultative Commission.</P>
    <P>One could become really angry at the state of total indecision on the Government side of the House in areas other than those in which the Government has enshrined itself by giving them overall priority.  Even taking the Government's own criterion of every project being evaluated in terms of job creation have they ever assessed the job creation potential of electrifying suburban rails? Have they looked at the detailed figures submitted by CIE?  Have they looked at the capacity for integrating our third level education system, our AnCO training programme and our unskilled workers with the whole concept of building an underground system and restoring the Inchicore works which is now being kidnapped and which it is proposed to take to Shannon where there is no coach building tradition. Coach building is a tradition that goes back years in this city.  Having done some sort of half-baked deal&mdash;which did not work&mdash;with a private enterprise organisation from another country it is now proposed to transport this industry, lock, stock and barrel west of the Shannon and leave stranded a work force which has generations of experience in coach building.  Even within the Government's criterion of evaluating a project in terms of job creation, not even that aspect of the proposal apparently has been looked at seriously.  If it had been, it would be in this White Paper and there is no reference in the White Paper to the job potential of actually building a public transport system in the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>In the eyes of Fianna Fáil public transport may have a very minor role to <Col N="271" /> play, the assumption being that as the standard of living improves the car ownership level will increase and therefore the need for public transport will reduce more and more in terms of personal mobility.  That is a totally false assumption.  Government Ministers frequently point to the age structure of the population and prior to the last election were constantly bleating about youth unemployment and the problems of youth but if one takes youth as being people under 18, none of them is really entitled to drive on the roads.  Add to that the number of people who, due to some disability or another, may not drive.  Surveys have shown that at different times in their lives up to 20 per cent of the population can expect to be physically disabled for a period from causes ranging from extremely heavy pregnancies to arthritis, broken arms and so on.  During such periods it would not be safe to drive.  We have the highest dependency ratio in western Europe, not all of it due to old age, but a certain component of it by definition of their age will be unable to drive.  I have not yet talked about the people who simply cannot afford to drive or who are terrified by driving.  On a demographic analysis alone, suspending any kind of economic assessment, by the end of this century at least 40 per cent of this population will depend on public transport for personal mobility.</P>
    <P>In the 18 months during which this country has had the misfortune of Fianna Fáil being back in office, our public transportation system has been reduced in effectiveness, undermined in morale, and has been told publicly time and time again in these documents that we are now debating that, while it may have an important role to play, it is a question of, &ldquo;Not yet shall you get the money, not yet will a decision be made, not yet can we consider your application for funds&rdquo;.  If freedom and democracy mean anything, if personal liberty, to which all of us are undoubtedly committed, has any definition at all, surely personal mobility has a major role and is a major fundamental component of any degree of personal liberation.  Yet the transportation system here has been so <Col N="272" /> starved that up to 40 per cent of the population are going to be seriously immobilised by the policies now being pursued by this Government over a period of time.</P>
    <P>Another concept dear to western democracy and dear to the republican parties, so called, is equality.  Is there no room in the thinking of Fianna Fáil for the concept of equality of access to such mobility?  Do we all have to own a car before we can be treated as having rights with regard to the question of mobility? If you do not own a car you are out of the picture altogether.  That is implicit in the kind of thinking in the three White Papers.  Somebody will try to say that Irish politics are not really ideological, that they are fought on old civil war wounds and that they bear no relation to normal politics in western Europe.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, so long as you are dividing a cake of financial resources within a community your politics are ideological.  You may try to conceal it, but resources are divided and distributed on ideological bases subject to all sorts of political influences.  But it is quite clear that the kind of allocation of resources that this section of the European Progressive Democrats have made with regard to personal mobility in the Republic of Ireland is the sort of allocation that will make M. Chirac extremely proud.  They have done a good day's work for the right-wing Gaullism in Europe in the publication of this White Paper in which they simply suspend yet again any decision about public transport in this country.  On a radio programme featured on the Saturday after the publication of this White Paper the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy FitzGerald, sought through it looking for decisions that have been made and came up with very few.  If one were to do the reverse exercise and count the number of non-decisions or postponements, the figure would be very high.</P>
    <P>I have made my political points.  An even greater tragedy is that the Government cannot claim that they are a minority Government.  They cannot even claim that they have got ideological differences of two parties.  They cannot even claim that some of their members are constantly sick.  They can claim <Col N="273" /> nothing except the 84 seats.  There is no decision.  What are the back-benchers doing in Fianna Fáil?  Is it some private club run by 15 Ministers locked in combat around the Cabinet table with one Minister apparently telling all the others what they can and cannot have, and the rest of the back-benchers getting permission to come in on debates and speaking, undoubtedly, at the private parliamentary party meetings?  What good are their 84 seats if they cannot make decisions?  If anyone tells me that in any areas outside those related to political priority and importance within the real Cabinet hierarchy there are decisions embodied in the question of public transport that are essential to the future development of this country, then I am afraid we are speaking totally different languages.  I believe I have about two or three minutes before I finish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude by picking up the thread that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy laid down towards the end of his speech, and that was the question of energy.  He identified correctly the fact that technology affords this country two options with regard to secure energy supplies in 1979. They are coal and nuclear fuel.  What he did not point out is that while the environmental hazards of coal are very real in terms of air pollution, they are at least known and they can be neutered. There is no way to neuter radiation in the sense of disposing safely for all time of radioactive waste.  Either way, if you burn coal or if you burn nuclear fuel&mdash;and let us suspend the argument as to the benefit of either&mdash;you are producing electricity and you are reducing our dependence upon oil and on the vagaries of the Ayatollahs of this world. The energy benefits in terms of the electrification of the suburban rail system surely must be apparent.  There is a bonus there somewhere that could be calculated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked at the outset about the non-performance of the public sector in terms of industrial relations.  I would hope, if he did not have the opportunity <Col N="274" /> of seeing the programme on the commuter race from south suburban Dublin into the city, that he will get a copy of it.  There is material here for a horror picture with people coming to work in the morning in varying degrees of anger and frustration which undoubtedly are going to colour their attitude to the work situation, particularly a work situation which has been starved of every degree of radical industrial democracy.  The way in which we are forcing more and more of our people to travel to work is not only inefficient in terms of energy consumption and wasteful in terms of congestion, but it is damaging to the health of the individuals involved and is seriously reducing their capacity as human beings.</P>

      <P>Any document giving a sense of direction and purpose is to be welcomed. Before I became a Member of this House it was very difficult to ascertain what was or was not Government policy.  One could not lay one's hands on a document outlining Government policy to ascertain to what plan the Government were working.  That can be said of all Governments in the past, that there was not sufficient planning undertaken. Perhaps in years gone by it was not as essential, that things did not change as quickly, when we were not members of the EEC and were not subjected to the same restrictions as obtain now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the third document issued by this Government since coming into office. There was the White Paper in January 1978, the Green Paper in July of the same year and now this second White Paper, all following on the policies put to the electorate in June 1977.  When the manifesto proposals were outlined certain people said they were old hat, that they would never work, that it would take between ten and 20 years to <Col N="276" /> implement them and we would probably hear no more about them.  These are logical and realistic proposals of the present Government.  Six months ago the Green Paper was presented affording everybody an opportunity to voice his opinions on it.  Perhaps Deputy Quinn did not read the Green Paper at that stage, that that is why he is now reading it and is confusing it with the two White Papers, because he referred continuously to three White Papers.</P>
    <P>The whole principle behind the present White Paper is the reconstruction of our economy as it was taken over by this Government in 1977.  I spoke last year in the budget debate and on a number of other occasions about what has been achieved since then.  National reconstruction was absolutely necessary and something had to be done, in gigantic proportions, to what a Government would normally have to do.  The whole philosophy behind the manifesto, the Green Paper and the two White Papers was to create employment within the constraints of good economic and financial policies.  The primary aim was to attain full employment within some projected date as quickly as possible.  In the second half of 1977 improvements were made but it took a full financial year to ascertain exactly what could be done under a good Government.  At the end of 1978 inflation stood at, I think, 7.9 per cent.  Our growth rate was double what the EEC had predicted and the highest in the OECD at 7 per cent.  That was secured within the planned, budgeted figure of 30 per cent of GNP.  Something had to be done by way of giving tax cuts, by way of giving workers more encouragement in compensation for the way they had been treated in the previous four years by the Coalition, to give entrepreneurs and industry a boost, allowing them increase their productivity and output.  One cannot expect a person to work 70 or 80 hours a week and then find himself taxed out of existence.  That just does not work.</P>
    <P>While it is always said that we on this side of the House seem to have a grá for the entrepreneurs and industrialists, those people who were unemployed in the period 1973 to 1977 and who are now working will tell one quite frankly <Col N="277" /> that that is because money has been put into investment in industry, in helping the drive to increase exports, encouraging the Buy Irish campaign and all the other worth-while projects that have created more jobs.  That is how it operates.  It is no good saying, as somebody did here this morning, that teachers and nurses are in non-productive jobs; that if the country were full of civil servants, teachers and nurses, how would they be paid if the country had no exports?  This is a small country and that is a ridiculous argument to advance&mdash;that if we do not increase our exports every year we cannot service the national debt or find the finance needed for the various day-to-day Government expenditures.  The number of jobs created in 1978, 30,000, was the highest in any year on record.  Unfortunately, it is fair to say also that redundancies at 13,000 were higher than one would have wished, making the overall figure of those employed 17,000 but which was still much higher than anything that would have been envisaged in this country two years ago.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of this Government during the past 18 months clearly has been employment.  As the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy said here this morning, last year the percentage increase in output was 15 per cent in real terms, which constituted a tremendous response from industry, illustrating that there was some point in their endeavouring to increase productivity and chase export markets.  Industrialists woke up to this realisation.  I have always said that if money is put into industry there must be a maximum return in so far as the creation of jobs is concerned.  A lot of investment in industry may go on the purchase of machinery leading, in turn, to redundancies. I am not sufficiently familiar with manufacturing industry to say whether or not that can be arrested.  For instance, it would be interesting to know what proportion of the 13,000 redundancies last year was due to money injected into industry but used for the purpose of purchasing machinery or equipment leading to those same redundancies. Certainly I know of one or two examples of that happening.  Money is being advanced <Col N="278" /> to industrialists.  I say: let them buy machinery but let them also create jobs somewhere else in their industries. Otherwise it defeats the whole purpose.</P>
    <P>There is also the Buy Irish campaign. At times it seems to be successful, when there is a lot of talk about it and then, at other times, it seems to diminish.  We are all aware that tremendous results have been achieved through this campaign. An argument that can be advanced always is that people can go into a shop or supermarket and because some foreign-made article is one penny or two pence cheaper they will buy it, thinking they are saving themselves a penny or twopence, whereas if one were to add a percentage on to a corresponding Irish-made article representing what it would save the country in dole or social welfare moneys, probably one would find that the difference between the two articles would amount to five pence or six pence. I cannot understand why such a figure cannot be calculated and, if it has been calculated, why it is not stressed more. Certainly I do not know what is that figure so I doubt if the ordinary consumer can be aware of it.  I know this exercise is carried out in other countries.</P>
    <P>It was said here yesterday that if we are to increase employment and output we must concentrate on the areas capable of having employment generated speedily.  Those are industry and agriculture.  Just as industry does so does agriculture play a vital part in our economy; 18 per cent of the national output is on agriculture and it constitutes 35 per cent of our exports. Then there are the other industries hived off agriculture, such as the food processing industry.  We are aware from the Taoiseach's statement yesterday that the IDA have an expansionary programme for that industry which is something in which I have always believed.  Every other country seems to avail of this opportunity: If one has the natural resources one should work hard and put as much money into them as possible, reaping the best results.</P>
    <P>In the agricultural sector we have the necessary raw materials and we should have the best food processing plants in the world.  I cannot understand why we <Col N="279" /> import vegetables.  Perhaps it is a seasonal problem but surely that could be overcome.  In Dublin shops and supermarkets there is a high proportion of non-Irish agricultural products and this is nonsensical.  We spend considerable amounts of money processing articles and goods for which we do not have the raw materials.  In the car assembly business it is cheaper to bring in cars that are totally assembled rather than to assemble them here.  I am very glad that the IDA are giving consideration to the agricultural industry and that financial aid will be given to the food processing industry.</P>
    <P>The White Paper refers to the long-term prospects for agriculture.  The Government are seeking to ensure the future of young people on the land.  With regard to the question of taxation of farmers, many people in the country think that everyone in Dublin is trying to take all their money from them.  It is obvious that the farmers must contribute their fair share in taxation.  That is all anybody is asking.  Everyone knows the argument of the PAYE section.  Not alone are they paying to keep their own services going and to keep going what they consider the daily requirements of the Government but they also have to contribute to farming expenses because not even that amount is generated from farming taxation.  Surely the money for these services should not come from the PAYE sector.  The expenses and the grants for agriculture should be paid for by that sector.  There is the argument that agriculture is one of our biggest areas of investment and exports but this applies also to many industries.  My own profession before I became a Member of this House, that of accountancy, is doing a booming business throughout the country.  I know of many accountants who have set up their own businesses in the past four or five years as a result of their increased workload for the farming section.  I realise that farmers have to pay a considerable amount for equipment but there must be guidelines as there are in the PAYE code.  A person cannot spend all his money on investment and then say he has no profit.  In every budget we are told that the <Col N="280" /> Government will get so much from agriculture but this never happens.  I was glad to hear the Taoiseach say yesterday that the Government will be looking for a more equitable distribution of taxation and that the farmers will pay.  A large sum of what they pay will go back into agriculture and it will relieve the burden on the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>On the industrial front the Government have taken steps to encourage the rapid expansion of investment which is vital in order to create jobs.  Some of the projects that the Government have in mind such as the film industry, the timber boom that is expected in the 1980s, fish farming and tourism are all in areas in which there will be quick employment returns.  However, there does not seem to be much progress in some of the smaller industries that are in the hands of semi-State organisations.  It is good to note that the Industrial Development Consortium are giving consideration to this point.  I presume that the telephone and telecommunications sector and perhaps parts of the public transport system are areas that will be considered to see if they could be more efficiently run on a profit-making basis.  The telephone service in England makes a very considerable profit every year but here we seem to go the other way.  It was said here this morning that in some of these areas of protected employment there are more strikes, arguments and general discontent.  I am not saying what side is right or wrong. Recent statistics show that in the near future 50 per cent of our population will be under 30 years.  We will need to create thousands of productive jobs and we will need to export a very considerable amount of our products.  We will have to move quickly in improving the efficiency of our industries.  We wasted time in recent years but that must be made up now.</P>
    <P>It appears nowadays that people are asking for increases of 40 per cent, 50 per cent or 60 per cent.  It is obvious that such increases cannot be granted.  They are not realistic.  A few years ago we got increases of 20 per cent or 25 per cent. In 1974 because there was a carry-over of the national wage agreement and because of other reasons people got huge <Col N="281" /> increases but inflation eroded any benefit and people did not have any more money.  More people were on the dole and industries closed.  That is the wrong way to run an economy.  It is much better to get an increase of 6 per cent or 7 per cent.  The main aim must be to provide employment.  The result of one person getting an increase of 40 per cent is that others are put out of work. The Government cannot allow that situation.  Whatever percentage increase is granted, it must be linked with the output from industry, with what the country can afford and with how it will affect unemployment. It is hoped that the large unions and the workforce will come to a compromise with the Government.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago a national wage agreement would be negotiated at, say, 7 per cent; but if the cost of living increased beyond that during the year the wage agreement would be reviewed. That seemed a fair method.  People cannot be expected to accept a wage agreement without hope of revision if the cost of living increases more than expected.  If the Government projections do not work out there should be a review of the wages irrespective of a national wage agreement.  Trade unionists would agree with that policy.  Another way to safeguard the standard of living is by tax cuts, which last year proved workable. Any way that would put more money into the pocket of the worker is what counts in the end, and tax cuts were an excellent idea.  Next week we will find out what will happen there.  Hopefully, all these things will lead to better industrial relations throughout 1979.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Government's aim to try to abolish unemployment within five years, it is welcome that a Government agency has been set up.  Hopefully, this agency will be unlike the Manpower agency which does not appear to be a worth-while organisation.  They seem to have provided employment for relatively few people.  People approaching Manpower are sent for interview to a certain company and it often turns out that Manpower has sent about 25 applicants for the job that morning and that it has already been filled.  An employment agency should try to create jobs or should know in advance where jobs will <Col N="282" /> occur; they should not chase the small ads. in the paper.  Such an agency should try to employ the 20,000 or 30,000 people on the unemployment register through some type of co-ordinated plan. If they cannot be employed in existing industry or in the public service, some type of project should be developed whereby people can work and be paid a few pounds more than they receive on the dole while they are seeking the type of employment they want.  By adopting such a system we could possibly export some products competitively because of low labour costs, and we could provide productive employment.  By paying people perhaps 25 per cent more than they at present get on the dole we could have a clawback from exports because of cheap labour.  I have seen places where when people were out of work a small industry was set up on a community basis giving people a small amount of money in addition to what they were getting by way of assistance from the State and it seems to work quite well.</P>
    <P>A number of youth projects implemented last year proved very successful. Rural Deputies said that it took so long for a lot of these to get off the ground that they were not very useful, but I am sure that any teething problems which the various local authorities might have had in 1978 have been worked out and once they get their allocation this year they should be able to get things working quickly.</P>
    <P>The capital programme was mentioned in the White Paper and the Government intend to spend large sums on infrastructure.  If we are to have productive industry we must have a good transport and telephone system.  In all these areas we lack adequate standards. I do not agree with Deputy Quinn's criticism of successive Governments. The money was needed to develop the agricultural industry and was injected into that area.  There is an increased allocation in the capital programme for transport.  People were crying wolf here a few minutes ago about a cutback on housing, but on the capital programme the estimate for housing for 1979 is £165 million whereas £136 million was allocated last year.  I do not see how there is a cutback <Col N="283" /> there in relation to the housing programme. The increase in the output from the building industry last year was in the region of 11 per cent.  The building and construction industry is a very big employer, so to put money into it is productive in a number of ways.</P>
    <P>In relation to local authority housing, a large number of people wish to own their own houses but because of their circumstances are unable to save up a deposit.  It is recognised and accepted that the local authority must house social welfare recipients and other such people.  It would be a good idea if they built houses at a rent of, say, £15 a week for people who wish to buy their own houses who cannot save a deposit or get a loan of £10,000 from a bank or a building society because they are considered a bad risk.  These people can save in the region of £15 or £20 a week but, by the time they have a few thousand pounds saved, the cost of the house has gone up out of all proportion.  The Department of the Environment should consider implementing a scheme to build houses and rent them to these people so that they would own them in the end. Such a scheme would bring more money into the Exchequer, more houses could be built and it would give people who would otherwise not have the opportunity to own their own homes, or who would not be able to get on the local authority housing list because they would not have enough points, a chance to own their own homes.  Such people would be glad to purchase their own house but the difference between the amount of the loan and the cost of the house is too great.  The scheme suggested is worth consideration to see if the State or local authorities should build houses and then rent them at commercial rents.</P>
    <P>It is good to see the amount of money allocated to health under the capital programme.  Health is not a productive industry but we must care for our sick people.  In this regard I should like to state that many of our institutions were built by religious orders in the 1850s and little money has been invested in their modernisation since.  I understand that as a result of the amount of money allocated <Col N="284" /> for maintenance and major development schemes many of those hospitals have been greatly improved. The problem cannot be solved in a year or two and the allocation of a few million pounds will do little.  It has often occurred to me that patients recuperating in such institutions would be better off at home.  It is pleasing to know that major hospital development will take place in Dublin over the next few years.  A major hospital is planned at Beaumont, the Mater Hospital is to be developed and so also will St. James's Hospital.  It is also hoped to erect a hospital at Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I hope that people will soon realise that they can do a lot to improve their own health.  In this regard it is incredible that so little money is allocated for the prevention of illness.  The amount of money allocated for sport is very little.  I accept that the figure was increased last year but an effort should be made to provide well equipped parks and other sporting facilities in all areas.  Junior football clubs in North Dublin have to pay phenomenal rents to private individuals for the use of football pitches.</P>
    <P>For some years the country has been under severe pressure with an increase in the number of redundancies and inflation soaring annually and the Government had to make quick decisions to prevent the unemployment position getting worse.  The White Paper represents the fourth step by the Government to cope with this problem.  We have been told by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy of the massive increase in exports last year and we are aware that inflation has been cut to 8 per cent.  We are also aware that the Government are making a determined effort to cut our foreign borrowing.  It is a big drawback to have to pay £1 in every £5 taken in taxation to service the national debt.  That is a terrible indictment of how our country was run in the last few years.  That situation must be rectified and if we are asked to make sacrifices to do so we must be willing to make them because we cannot continue on leaving the matter to be solved by a future generation.  If 1979 proves to be as good as 1978 was the country will have a lot to thank Fianna Fáil for.  The regretting years were 1973 to 1977 and <Col N="285" /> if people are not anxious to get everything they were deprived of during those years inside 12 months we will make progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>One must ask if the White Paper lives up to the major challenge facing our economy, a challenge which is spelled out clearly in a paper issued by the National Economic and Social Council.  That paper stated that by 1986 employment outside agriculture, if present trends continue, might be between 80,000 and 100,000 higher than in 1976, in other words, one-third of the increase required to absorb the extra people coming on to the employment market.  One must ask if the measures in the White Paper are such that they will change trends which are underlying our economy to treble the amount of employment between now and 1986. That is what must be done if we are to provide jobs for all our people seeking them by 1986.</P>
      <P>I do not think the White Paper measures up to that challenge.  In the course of my contribution I propose to deal with the question of agriculture.  We should realise the potential agriculture has for creating employment.  For instance, if dairy output continues at its present rate of increase, which has been high of late, an extra 3,000 jobs will be created in dairy processing by 1986.  If, on the other hand, there is a high growth in dairy output the extra employment in dairy processing is estimated by the NESC to be as high as 13,759.  The NESC estimate that more than 10,000 extra jobs could be created if a high growth in dairy output takes place rather than a continuance of the present trend of growth which is not high enough.  The same applies to cattle production.  An additional 2,000 jobs could be created in the meat processing industry.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The United Nations have asked each country to review its policies and programmes for the well-being of children during the International Year of the Child.  This process is already under way in this country.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Health, I have been given primary responsibility by the Government for child care services.  One of the main contributions to the International Year of the Child in Ireland will be the submission to me of the report of the Task Force on Child Care Services. The Task Force will be making recommendations on services for deprived children and on the legislative reforms needed to update and modernise the law in relation to children.  Whatever legislation may be required arising out of the recommendations of the Task Force will be introduced without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I will be paying particular attention to the needs of children who <Col N="287" /> are suffering from physical, emotional or material deprivation, particularly the children of itinerants.  Special emphasis will also be given to children and the family in health education programmes during 1979.  Other Government Departments are each reviewing their policies and programmes in relation to children.</P>
    <P>The Government have also set up, under the aegis of my Department, a National Steering Committee for the International Year of the Child.  This committee are representative of national, statutory and voluntary bodies concerned with the welfare of children. Their responsibility is to co-ordinate and where necessary stimulate activities for and on behalf of children during 1979. The committee are being serviced by officers of my Department.  The amount to be made available to assist organisations promoting special events during the year and to promote the aims of the year generally will be approximately £50,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his lengthy reply.  There are a number of supplementary questions which, with the permission of the Chair, I would like to ask.  I want to find out the kind of action that the Government directly will be taking. If I heard the Minister's full reply correctly, and I am open to correction on this, he indicated that he would be awaiting the report of the Task Force but that he, as Minister designated with responsibility, had no immediate plans as of now for legislation relating to children.  Is that correct?  Is he awaiting the report of the Task Force or does he have, at the beginning of the second month of 1979, specific proposals for legislation in draft form for the Year of the Child?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea is that the Task Force would put forward legislation, that they would bring forward either in final form or at least in genesis a Children's Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister has ceded to this Task Force the primary initiative in drafting the outline of such legislation and that his Department have no specific proposals of their <Col N="288" /> own for child protection legislation, such as, for example, the legislation the Fianna Fáil Party voted against when introduced by the Labour Party in the last Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may take the liberty of saying so, that is a silly sort of statement to make.  The Task Force were set up to review the legislation and to put forward proposals for its reform.  The primary purpose of the Task Force is to bring forward the new legislation.  To achieve that we appointed a High Court judge as chairman of the Task Force, specifically because of their obligation to produce a Children's Act.  I do not see how the Deputy can suggest that the Task Force should be preparing legislation while at the same time the Department may be preparing separate legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

When the Task Force was set up originally, the idea was that they would report within a matter of months; but when they got down to their task they realised they were dealing with <Col N="289" /> a very difficult, complicated area, something involving the most fundamental principles of one sort or another, and naturally the work has taken much longer than anybody anticipated.  In order to expedite the work, particularly because of its legal content, I appointed a High Court judge to take the chair and two officers of my Department, full time, to assist the Task Force.  I am confident that they will report during 1979 and that we will have the legislation during 1979.  That is subject to many reservations. The objective is that we will have a new Children's Act as part of our contribution to the Year of the Child.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister's answers, may I draw attention to the fact that my question asked for information relating to the International Year of the Child and for schemes or initiatives from his Department especially in the context of that year?  Would it not be fair to say that the Task Force was <Col N="290" /> set up some time ago and that, in the context of the answer to this question, to concentrate disproportionately on the Task Force might detract from whatever schemes the Department may be considering? Am I right in assuming that a committee with a budget of £50,000 has been set up to consider schemes?</P>

We in the Department have specific schemes for residential child care, for the situation in regard to non-accidental injury to children and in the area of adoption and fosterage.  We have a campaign in the area of infant mortality and we will have a fairly comprehensive campaign through the Health Education Bureau which will be parent-child related.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has information available which confirms or denies the statement that many mental handicap problems are caused at the time of birth; the percentage of live births, if at all, so affected; and the steps he proposes to take to ensure that the problem is dealt with in full in the greater interest of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a large volume of evidence in reports from a number of countries that mental handicap is caused by factors which occur before, during or immediately after the birth of an infant. On the basis of one Swedish study, it has been estimated that in about four per 1,000 live births mental handicap may result from such factors.  Sufficient information is not available however to state with accuracy what proportion of these are due to factors which arise at the actual time of birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to minimise the factors causing mental handicap at the time of birth <Col N="292" /> and to prevent the development of mental handicap in infants who were established to be &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; before birth, it is necessary to have a high standard of maternity and paediatric care.  The necessary measures are being taken to ensure that this is available.  In recent years 18 additional obstetricians and 12 additional paediatricians have been appointed to various hospitals throughout the country and additional equipment, including ultra-sound diagnostic machines, has been installed in a number of hospitals.</P>
    <P>The new general hospitals being provided throughout the country will include maternity units planned and equipped to accepted modern standards.</P>

In England and Wales it is about 4 per cent, in Scotland 1 per cent and in Northern Ireland 0.3 per cent.  Detailed statistics are not readily available for all other countries.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health when it is intended to set up a management board for the proposed new Tallaght hospital, County Dublin; the suggested composition of such a board, and the method whereby staff will be appointed to service the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to establish by order under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961 a board to plan, build and manage a general hospital at Tallaght and I have put a draft order incorporating my proposals before all the bodies concerned for their views.  When I have received and considered these views, I will make the order without delay.</P>
      <P>The board will, initially, be responsible for the planning and building of the hospital and it is proposed that the membership, at this stage, will comprise about 14 members, including nominees of the Eastern Health Board, the hospital boards of the Adelaide and Meath Hospitals and the University of Dublin.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that it has been traditional practice that participating health bodies and hospital boards are allowed to name their own nominees on to any new board and that this represents a radical departure, allowing the Minister his choice out of panels which are to be put forward to him by the participating bodies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very sensible and wise procedure.  If the Minister is appointing a board for which he will be responsible, which will have the expenditure of vast sums of public money, it is only right that the Minister would retain the final right of appointment.  All the interests will be met by the procedure that I propose.  I am not aware that there is anything new or different about it and my information is that what I propose in this order has been widely welcomed by all the interested bodies.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should study what I said.  I can only appoint people to this new board from panels submitted by various representative bodies.  That is a perfectly fair, legitimate and wise procedure.  Otherwise one would find the Minister for Health or any Minister of Government simply acting as a rubber stamp for subsidiary bodies which I do not think is desirable particularly in this case because this is a <Col N="300" /> building board which will have the responsibility for the expenditure of about £20 million of public funds.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The draft order for the Beaumont board was prepared and settled between all the interests concerned before I assumed office, so I did not change it.  But I found myself in the position, in appointing the Beaumont board, of being practically a rubber stamp so that I could not accede to the wishes of various women's organisations and appoint a woman member to that board and I determined that I was not going to be in that position in future.</P>

The committee has since been in correspondence with the two Government Departments referred to by the Deputy and has had discussions with Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>I understand that major financial and technical problems would arise in making the necessary modifications to public transport vehicles.  Nevertheless, there is a general desire to facilitate wheelchair users and I am hopeful that it will be found possible to meet their needs.

      <P>I do not know.  There <Col N="305" /> may be a case for the adoption of a shorter period, but in this instance we have to try to keep a balance between a number of conflicting considerations. First of all there is the patient, whose interests should be paramount. Number two, there is the necessity to have an efficiently administered scheme. Then there is the legitimate interests of the doctors.  The system in operation has been hammered out with a view to getting satisfaction all round.  If these conditions are to be changed, I suggest the matter should be agreed between the professional bodies and the general medical service authorities.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Nurses Organisation did not accept the commission of inquiry which I had suggested to them and announced on 22 November last.  Following that I had further discussions with the Irish Nurses Organisation and the other staff associations concerned.  It was quite clear to me that the majority of the staff associations representing nurses felt strongly that any review of nurses pay should be carried out under the existing conciliation and arbitration scheme for health board staff and not by a special commission of inquiry outside the scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme of conciliation and arbitration is regulated by the National Joint Council and the matter was at my suggestion considered by this body at their meeting on 3 January.  At that meeting the council set up the necessary procedural machinery to enable such a review to be carried out.  The first meeting of the conciliation committee appointed by the council to deal with the matter was held on 23 January and it is the intention of all the parties involved to proceed as rapidly as possible.</P>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the newspaper report referred to by the Deputy.  The question of a retrospective payment to nurses is at present being considered at arbitration under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  No finding has yet been issued by the arbitration board but I expect that average payment will be of the order of £130.</P>

On top of that, we had the bus strike and people could not even come in to the central point.  As an emergency measure we arranged to have them distributed at centres on the outskirts.

      <P>I did not say anything of the sort.  I said the examination must necessarily include the very important matter of finance.  At the moment, the cheap fuel scheme, as such, is confined to a limited number of urban areas.  It is a very limited type of scheme.  If there were to be an extension to a national scheme, that would be a very expensive matter.  That must be taken into consideration. There is also the fact that old people living alone have a free electricity allowance.  They also now have, where appropriate, a gas allowance.  In addition to all that, we now have a much more flexible mechanism available to us through the supplementary welfare scheme.  All these matters have a bearing on the situation.</P>

It would not be appropriate to name the prisoners concerned or the nature of the ailments being treated. However, on the information available to me at present I am informed that the three prisoners are responding to treatment in the hospital.  I can assure the House that I am, and will continue to remain, in close touch with the situation, both in regard to all aspects of the condition of the three individuals concerned and also the conditions of the protesting prisoners in general.  I can also assure <Col N="324" /> the House that, within the constraints imposed by the firm position of principles to which I referred earlier, the Government will use their influence to promote in every way possible a humane and compassionate approach to the problem and will continue to search for an equitable means of ending the degrading conditions which the prisoners have unfortunately brought upon themselves through their protests as well as the distress which it so unnecessarily causes to their parents and relatives.</P>

In the course of our subsequent inquiries we discovered that there were three prisoners under treatment.  I should mention that they are not all recent admissions, as the Deputy's question implies.  One of them has been in hospital for some weeks and is, we are informed, responding favourably to treatment.  As regards the continuing contacts to which I referred, I can assure the Deputy and the House that at every level&mdash;at ministerial level, at official level and at ambassadorial level&mdash;we have been in regular contact with the Northern Ireland Office and have asked them to keep us informed of any developments on this issue, subject to the principles to which I have already referred.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the next eight to ten years the Government face the greatest challenge of any Government for many years, that is, the challenge of providing employment for the increasing number of young people seeking it.  It has been estimated by NESC that by 1986, if present trends of economic growth continue, we will only create one-third of the jobs that will be necessary to provide employment.  Assuming we create between 80,000 and 100,000 jobs between now and 1986, it will only be one-third of our requirements.  It is an immense challenge and it is against that background that the policies and pronouncements of the Government must be judged.  I believe that the policies pursued have been ill-timed and will result in the dissipation of our natural resources in order to achieve short-term gains which will not result in the creation of permanent jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be clearly demonstrated that an <Col N="329" /> increase in economic growth will not create jobs if the resources from that increase are not used in a judicious way to increase and multiply within the country. Unfortunately the macro-economic policies of the Government of excessive demand stimulation at a time of increasing propensity to import are such that valuable Irish resources are being used to create jobs not in Ireland but in France, Germany and other countries who are sending their exports into our markets.  Economic growth alone is not enough.  To demonstrate that one can compare the performance of the Irish economy with that of the German economy over the past ten years and see what exactly has happened on the ground in those two economies.</P>
    <P>Some people might be surprised to learn that Ireland had a faster annual growth rate in production over the last ten years than Germany had.  What has happened as a result of that?  The annual rate of growth over the last ten years in the German economy has been 3½ per cent and the annual rate of growth in the Irish economy in the same period has been 3¾ per cent.  We did better than they did.  The key question to which every Government must address themselves is, how are the fruits of that economic growth, created by the work of the Irish people, being used?  Are they being used in such a way as to generate more growth or in such a way as to spend and live now without making due provision for the future?  Unfortunately, the latter course has been pursued by successive Governments.  I do not believe that we have made good use of the fruits of our economic growth and this can be demonstrated.  For instance, on average over the last ten years we have used our economic growth to run a balance of payments deficit of 3½ per cent of GNP whereas the Germans have a balance of payments surplus of 1 per cent.  We have been borrowing 9 per cent of our GNP whereas the Germans have been borrowing only 3 per cent of theirs. The results of this policy in an open economy of spending more than you are taking in have been that the jobs that should have been created by our economic growth in Ireland are being created outside Ireland because we are <Col N="330" /> sending the money that is generated in the country out of the country too quickly. That is partly as a result of the fact that we are a small open economy.  Quite clearly the traditional Keynesian method of boosting employment by demand stimulation works much less well in a small open economy than it does in a large closed economy.  We have been acting in our demand management policies as if we were a large closed economy when in fact we are a small open economy.</P>
    <P>Our policy of generalised undifferentiated demand stimulation as a means of creating more jobs has been in direct contrast to what has been the deliberate policy of successive Governments over the years.  The deliberate policy of all Governments has been to make our economy more, not less, open.  We entered into the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement originally and we subsequently entered into the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>The thrust of all of these policies has been to make our economy more open. If £1 is spent in an Irish shop it is now more likely as a result of deliberate Government policy of opening our economy that that £ or a larger share of it will end up in Germany, France or somewhere else.  Policies of generalised demand stimulation as a means to create employment might have made sense in the fifties or sixties when we were not as open an economy as we are now.  They do not make sense at present unless careful preparation has been entered into to make sure that the demand stimulation is of such a character that its results stay in the country and that we have prepared our economy to make full use of it.</P>
    <P>The results of our pursuing the wrong type of policy and the Germans pursuing the right type is that they have derived far greater benefits in terms of real income increases from a lesser rate of actual production growth than we have over the last ten years.  The fact is that while wages here over the last ten years rose at an average rate of 16 per cent per annum, wages in Germany rose by 9 per cent per annum.  However, prices here rose at an average rate of 12 per cent per annum while prices in Germany rose by <Col N="331" /> only 4½ per cent per annum.  To sum this up, wages have risen in this country by less than twice as fast as in Germany whereas prices in this country have risen three times as fast as those in Germany. The result is that real income increases in this country have been considerably less than in Germany notwithstanding the fact that we have had a slightly higher rate of growth of GNP.  The reason for that is that we have dissipated, by means of excessive generalised demand stimulation in our economy under successive Governments, the results of economic growth whereas the Germans have conserved within Germany, by responsible financial policies, the results of a lesser economic growth.  The significance of this is that they are now better off than we are relative to what they were ten years ago although their economic rate of growth has been less than ours.</P>
    <P>The Government have actually exaggerated the underlying errors that have been made by successive Governments in relation to economic policy.  Rather than reversing errors that might have been made in the past they have exaggerated them.  They have gone on what was described by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development as one of the biggest gambles in our nation's history which involved for a period of a year-and-a-half a policy of high borrowing, high demand stimulation and high imports.  This has dissipated still further and to an ever greater extent the results of underlying economic growth.</P>
    <P>The high stimulus which took place in 1977 and 1978 was seriously mistimed. It took place at the wrong time.  This stimulus, which we cannot now undertake because we have not got the resurces as we are now over-borrowed, should not have taken place in 1977 or 1978 but should be taking place now. There are two major admissions in the White Paper which demonstrate the fact that the Government realise that the stimulation of the economy at that time was mistimed.  They admit that the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign has only had a limited impact on imports of consumer goods in <Col N="332" /> 1978.  They further state that the growing proportion of personal spending devoted to imports is one illustration of a trend which requires corrective action. They go on to say that perhaps the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; compaign will have a greater effect in 1979.  If it is the case that a growing proportion of any money spent in this country is going on imports, surely that is the wrong time to start pumping in money.  The proper approach for the Government would have been to have launched the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign in 1977 and 1978 and have the demand stimulus when that campaign was well established and the Government were satisfied that the results of such a stimulus would, as a result of the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, stay in this country. What the Government did was launch the stimulus first and it is only now when that stimulus is over and the Government are telling us they will have to reduce their borrowing requirement, that the stimulus will have to be withdrawn, that it was a once-off effort, that they believe that the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign might begin to have an effect.  It is only when that is happening in 1979 that they believe that the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign might begin to have an effect.</P>
    <P>Surely the proper way would have been to do it the other way round&mdash;have the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign first and then the stimulus.  Instead, the demand stimulus which took place in 1977-8 was mistimed and did not have the results sought and led to a dissipation of our resources.  I think this can be clearly demonstrated by reference to figures that are publicly available.  We have at present a rate of inflation of 7, 8 or 9 per cent&mdash;in that general area.  Yet, in 1978 over 1979 our trade deficit increased not by 10 or even 20 per cent but by 24 per cent.  It increased by almost three times as much as the rate of depreciation of money here.  That is not a healthy situation and it is a direct result of a mistimed demand stimulus which is causing jobs to be created in Birmingham, Germany and Japan with Irish money provided by Irish taxpayers.  That worsening situation accelerated throughout 1978.</P>
    <P>For instance in the last quarter of that year exports rose by 3.4 per cent but imports of finished consumer goods increased <Col N="333" /> by 5.5 per cent, more than one-third again as much.  Imports of producers' capital goods actually fell by 2 per cent.  So we are running a deficit and, if it is for consumer goods to be directly consumed, that deficit is being used to a decreasing extent to finance capital goods for further production.  In the last quarter imports of producers capital goods fell by 2 per cent while consumer goods went up by 5½ per cent.</P>
    <P>I believe that one of the reasons why, with a slightly better rate of growth and annual production over the last ten years than Germany, Ireland has done very much worse than Germany was because of the demand policy of successive Governments&mdash;the stimulus in our economy was dissipated abroad through imports.  A second reason is that we failed to take action, in the way the Germans have done with their great emphasis on competition and mobility within their economy, in the area of skilled shortages.  We have a very high rate of unemployment and yet the Government admit that there are many jobs that cannot be filled because those with the skills to fill them are not available.  If you create a demand stimulus without the possibility of increased employment, of people with the right qualifications coming along to take up the jobs made available by this demand, the result of the stimulus obviously will be more imports or an increase in wage rates or an increase in speculation without any increase in employment.  The bottle-neck in the labour market here should have been identified before the demand stimulus took place.  Because that did not happen the result is that, notwithstanding the very high rate of unemployment, the Economic and Social Research Institute can tell us that 20 per cent of firms' returns to them have said that they cannot expand production because of labour shortages.</P>
    <P>The Government admit there are substantial shortages of skilled labour in certain categories of the building industry&mdash;bricklayers and so on.  We should be told and the Government should inquire as to why these skilled shortages can take place.  Are there artificial barriers to the training of more bricklayers, more people with the particular <Col N="334" /> skills that are scarce in the building industry?  Is AnCO free to provide extra courses and extra places on courses in these skills?  Are people already with those skills and represented in the unions for their particular crafts in a position to tell AnCO not to train any more than a particular number in these skills because they do not want extra competition?  If that is not the case the Government should say so, but, if it is, they should do something about it because it is quite unacceptable that artificial skill shortages should be maintained in our economy by anybody in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>We also need to look at the overall manpower preparation input from all arms of Government.  In my view there is insufficient co-ordination between the educational system, the industrial training authority, AnCO, and those concerned with finding jobs for those already unemployed in relation to the needs of the labour market.  Obviously, in a free economy the Government can never control and never should control the labour market, the supply of particular skills, and people should be always free to go into a particular profession although that profession may be oversupplied, but the Government can and should control what it does with its own money.  It should not be using its money, as is the case at present, to train doctors when we are producing almost twice as many doctors as there are jobs for doctors in the health services here. We are training doctors for the Canadian health services and the health services of other countries abroad.  I think that is not an acceptable use of taxpayers' money.  I am sure that is not an isolated example of what can happen when you have the educational system, particularly higher education, going in one direction, secondary education going in another, the IDA in another and the National Manpower Service in yet another direction. All these agencies concerned with the creation or provision of people with the skills necessary to take the jobs that our economy needs must be properly coordinated by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is present because I know he is aware of <Col N="335" /> the suggestion I am about to make. Something along the lines of the National Board for Science and Technology should be established to coordinate all manpower preparation and preparation of persons for the labour market by a system which would integrate with the budget for secondary education, higher education, AnCO, the National Manpower Service and whatever new agencies will be set up in this area.  These could be knitted together in a non-coercive way through such an agency concerned in the manpower field.</P>
    <P>The unique characteristic of the National Board for Science and Technology in my opinion&mdash;and I had some part in steering that Bill through this House&mdash;is not that it compels individual Departments to do certain things with their budget but that it ensures that the Government is presented with one coherent picture when making decisions about the allocation of resources between different Departments and can consciously plan as a result of an agency such as this presenting them with such a picture.  I hesitate to urge any Government to set up yet another agency because we have too many of them at present&mdash;indeed many that are being set up are set up to police other agencies&mdash;and it is a sort of never-ending Parkinsonian process.</P>
    <P>Something along the lines I have suggested would have a very valuable effect and in bringing the necessary discipline into the overall training and education system would ensure that it takes account of the needs of the labour market.  It would avoid the situation where demand stimulus does not result in the creation of Irish jobs because it is used for imports and to stimulate demand for certain types of employment, when the people to fill the jobs are not available because the training is not being provided due to the structural mess-up, which a board such as I have indicated could over time&mdash;not immediately&mdash;unscramble. I will be interested in the response of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development when he replies to the debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> I turn now to agriculture which is my own area of responsibility.  A lot of people do not realise the potential of agriculture to contribute to the creation of employment and to the overall objective, which this country and all parties share, of providing extra jobs for the people who are going to come on the labour market.  As I have said, with the present trend we are going to create only one-third of the needed jobs by 1986 for people coming on the labour market by that time.  It has been estimated by the NESC that if present economic agricultural trends continue&mdash;and these have been quite favourable&mdash;4,000 extra jobs could be created by 1986 in processing or supply industries directly related to agriculture.  That is not to be deprecated.  But they also estimate that if the right policies are pursued and if high agricultural growth takes place, we could create as many as 22,000 as against 4,000 extra jobs in processing.  In other words, 18,000 jobs in processing could result from the right agricultural policies, from new improved agricultural policies, whereas only 4,000 jobs would result if the present policy options in agriculture are continued in the present trends. When I say that 18,000 extra jobs could be created by the right policies in agriculture, I should mention that 10,000 of those could be created in the dairying sector.</P>
    <P>Agriculture can make another contribution to the provision of jobs.  First of all, there is the much neglected possibility of the creation of jobs in agriculture itself, on the farm.  There is far too ready an acceptance by economic planners generally that it is not possible to create new jobs in agriculture.  Obviously it is not possible to create over all an increase in the number of people employed in agriculture, but many of the people in agriculture are of an age which will mean that they will not be in agriculture anyway in ten or 15 years' time, and that reduction is going to take place anyway.  But there is a very strong possibility of increasing what one might describe as the active labour force in agriculture.  There should be in projection age differentiation and we should <Col N="337" /> concentrate, not solely on the overall number employed in agriculture, but on the number who could be employed in agriculture in what might be described as the active age groups.  I will not put a figure on it, but most people will know the age group to which I refer.</P>
    <P>The Government should realise that there are possibilities in this field, and they should look at the Farm Modernisation Scheme with a view not only to increasing production but also to increasing employment.  Some of the grants perhaps could be altered in such a way as to give an employment creation emphasis as well as a capital creation emphasis which seems to be almost exclusively the matter which is grant-aided in the scheme at the moment.  Furthermore, if agriculture grows fast, fewer people will leave the land, and this means that there will be less competition for jobs outside agriculture with people seeking non-agricultural occupations.</P>
    <P>Processing, increased jobs on the land and reduced prices on the land are three ways whereby agriculture can contribute directly to the national effort to create jobs for people who will be seeking them between now and 1986.  All policy-making in relation to agriculture should take cognisance of these three facts. People working in an urban environment, and particularly the trade unions who sometimes perhaps are overstrident in their criticism of increases in agricultural income, should realise that they are interdependent with agriculture and that prosperous agriculture can make a direct and immediate contribution to creating and preserving jobs for their members.  This interdependence must be stressed increasingly by all sectors of our economy if we are to go forward on a proper basis.  In this country one person in five is employed in agriculture.  Agriculture is far more important in our economy than it is in the economy of any other member of the EEC by a long shot.  We should realise this when we are talking about unemployment and employment creation.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that I feel bound to express my disappointment with the sections of the White Paper which deal with agriculture.  Indeed, they make quite pessimistic reading.  The <Col N="338" /> Government say with some pride that a rate of growth in agricultural production of 9.4 per cent was achieved in 1977, a year for which both sides of this House can share responsibility.  Without being unfair, one could say that the majority of the stimulus for the entire growth throughout that year was created prior to July 1977, but that is a matter about which one would not wish to cavil.  A rate of growth of 9½ per cent was achieved in agricultural production in 1977.  One would have expected that the Government would hope to be able to maintain the rate of growth in agriculture that they inherited from their predecessors, but no.  In the White Paper the Government say that they project a gross increase in agricultural production in 1979 and 1980 of 4 per cent&mdash;less than half the rate of growth achieved in 1977 as a result of the agricultural policies of their predecessors.  If one adjusts that growth target of 4 per cent to a net figure, the Government are talking about an increase of only 3.3 per cent net agricultural product in 1979 and in 1980.  That is a very pessimistic start to agricultural policy-making.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the global targets of 4 per cent a year for two years are not much use for economic planning to those engaged in agriculture in semi-State bodies and on the farm, wishing to see what the Government's view and intentions are, and making their own plans accordingly.  A lot of people forget the purpose of economic planning.  It is action by the Government to create a climate of certainty in which people can invest and take their own independent decisions, knowing what the Government are doing and what they intend. Merely setting a global target of 4 per cent in agriculture is no help to practical decision-making on the farm, in the factory or in the boardroom of a semi-State company concerned with agriculture. What would have been useful would have been sectoral targets for milk, beef, sheep and grain.  If individual targets were set for the individual sectors then the people in Bord Gráin would know what to expect in their sector, and the people in the CBF would know what to expect in their sector, and likewise farmers engaged in other lines of <Col N="339" /> production.  Telling them that overall agricultural growth is going to increase by 4 per cent tells them really nothing.  It is of interest to economists who are interested in comparing one paper with another and engaging in learned discussions about economic models and input and output.  It is of no use whatever to practical men making practical decisions on the farm, in the factory or in the board room.</P>
    <P>So far as economic planning is concerned, I believe that the targets set by the present Government are very weak and remiss indeed.  I do not think in any real sense one can describe this White Paper as an economic plan at all because of the lack of precision in the economic projections in individual sectors of the economy.  Certainly this plan would not be accepted in France as an economic plan within the concept of economic planning they have there, and it is a country with a free economy.  In France the plans and targets are drawn up in immense detail.  They are prepared in draft and consultations take place in depth with each sector of the economy. Then finally a target is produced that has been agreed with various sectors. That has not happened in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not believe one can say that economic planning has taken place here under this Government at all, though I readily concede it did not take place under the previous Government.  But the previous Government were honest about it.  They said they were not engaging in economic planning.  They said they believed that things were changing too fast for economic planning to take place. They may have been wrong but at least that is what they said and they were honest about it.  But the present Government were telling the people that they were going to introduce economic planning and that this was one of the major ways in which they would create employment here.  That is what they told the people before the election.  Not only were they going to create jobs, not only would they engage in getting rid of car tax and do all sorts of other wonderful things, but they were going to engage in economic planning as well to make sure <Col N="340" /> that that money was properly used.  Quite clearly this is not an economic plan because its targets are so global as to be of little value to anybody.</P>
    <P>There is another failing in relation specifically to agricultural targets in the White Paper: the targets are not broken down on a county by county basis.  I believe that there should be county development teams set up in relation to agriculture in each county, that all the agencies&mdash;the ACC, the county committees of agriculture, processing industries and so on involved in a particular county&mdash;should be amalgamated into a team and that they should set targets for their own county.  The fact is that there have been immense differences in the rate of agricultural progress in different parts of the country.  To give an example of this, over the last five years, which have been five very good years for agriculture, production on the farm in the west and north-west has increased by only one-third the rate of other parts of the country.  A realisation of that fact is not reflected in the White Paper, nor are there any measures proposed in the White Paper&mdash;there are some but not conscious measures&mdash;designed to eliminate that imbalance.  Furthermore, as between farmers the results of economic progress have been unevenly distributed.  There are some farmers whose incomes have shot ahead.  But it should be remembered that one farmer in every ten&mdash;and I am speaking now about full-time farmers&mdash;had an income in 1978 below £1,000 a year.  One farmer in every ten, a full-time farmer, perhaps with a family, was earning less than £1,000 a year and the proportion of farmers earning less than £1,000 a year in 1978 as against 1977 did not reduce, even though the proportion of farmers earning more than £3,000 a year in 1978 as against 1977 increased dramatically. Therefore, the results of progress are not being shared equally between farmers.</P>
    <P>The Government must take conscious action to deal with that.  What are they doing?  They are proposing to remove the one means that one in ten full-time farmers has of making ends meet, namely, unemployment assistance, unless he is prepared to make a full declaration of his income.  This is what, it appears, is <Col N="341" /> going to come in the budget.  That may sound very fair, but the fact is that these men probably are not prepared to make a full declaration of income because of the conservative positions they have about making any declaration of what they earn, their fear of inspectors, of Government and of anybody interfering with them.</P>
    <P>We were told also that, to compensate for the removal of unemployment assistance or the reduction in its availability, improvements would be made in the disadvantaged areas scheme, and that these two schemes were interdependent.  I ask then: why has the amount of money for the disadvantaged areas scheme in this year's Estimates been increased by 1.3 per cent only while the overall rate of increase in the budget for agriculture has been 9 per cent?  This seems to indicate that not only are they cutting unemployment assistance but they are also cutting relatively on the disadvantaged areas scheme as well, which was supposed to be the scheme to be used to compensate.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I believe that the western drainage proposals will be used only to save money for the Irish Exchequer and that there will be no acceleration in actual drainage overall.  There can be no assurance that that will not be the case unless the Government are prepared to account separately for EEC arterial drainage from money spent on drainage otherwise.  There has been a serious underspending under the heading of arterial drainage in the Capital Budget of 1978.  One million pounds voted by this House in 1978 for arterial drainage was not spent.  Almost 30 per cent of the total sum voted in 1978 for arterial drainage was, because of inefficiency in the Board of Works, not spent.  That is not a good platform from which to be launching what we are told is an EEC-aided accelerated arterial drainage programme.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the run-down in our beef herd.  The beef cow herd in this country is now almost half what it was in 1974&mdash;in other words, the number of calves being produced for beef production is being rapidly reduced. I believe we should apply now for EEC aid for a calved heifer subsidy scheme to <Col N="342" /> reverse that dangerous trend that will affect employment in the meat processing industry directly in coming years.  I believe that EEC aid would be available on the grounds that it would be a diversion from milk production.  The Government make no mention in their White Paper of making any application for this even though it is believed that the French Government will have it brought about anyway.  It looks as if the Government will again be travelling on the coat tails of the French, just as they did in relation to western drainage, just as they did also in relation to the structural grants for the west of Ireland.  They will be travelling along on the coat tails of the French and Italians.  The French and Italians will get it.  A year later the Irish Government will come up with the same scheme and pretend they got it all on their own efforts when in fact they got it only because of the efforts of other Ministers in other countries with different problems.</P>
    <P>We are told also in relation to the beef industry that the role of the CBF&mdash; Córas Beostoic agus Feola Teo.&mdash;is to be expanded.  Why then has the budget for CBF been increased by only 5 per cent when the overall budget for the Department of Agriculture has been increased by twice that amount?  That does not look like an expanded role for the CBF; it looks like a reduced role.  We are told also that the expected reduced slaughterings in meat plants could be offset by a shift to higher value-added forms of production within the meat plants.  Why then has the marketing incentive scheme proposed by the National Economic and Social Council, which would have done precisely that, which would have led to increased value added, not been adopted?  Why have the Government completely ignored that scheme in the White Paper?  A serious proposal from the National Economic and Social Council, which would have had a direct effect in increasing employment in the meat processing industry, has not alone been rejected but has been ignored in the White Paper.  I ask the Government to address themselves to that when they come round to their next paper, whatever colour that may be.</P>
    <P>We have already had signs of a mini-budget <Col N="343" /> for agriculture before any budget has been announced.  The Estimates provide for £10 million extra to be collected in appropriations-in-aid from agriculture; presumably this is in respect of fees.  We have already had the Government taking £2.3 million away from agriculture by the removal of the lime fertiliser transport subsidy.  That will increase the price of lime by £1 per ton.</P>
    <P>We have had no action on land purchase or reform.  No extra money has been provided for the Land Commission this year for land purchase.  The amount being provided for purchases under the farm retirement scheme has been reduced by 20 per cent and the amount for annuities under the same scheme has been reduced by 3½ per cent.  In other words, the Government are opting out of the land market.  They are washing their hands completely.  They do not mind now who buys land.  They are just standing back; they are not providing the Land Commission with the money to enable the Land Commission to intervene and maintain some sort of discipline and order in the land market.  The Government, for economic and financial reasons, have opted out of the land market.  They are not providing the Land Commission with the money to exercise their powers to do anything about it. They are not putting anything in its place.  It is a very serious situation which generations of farmers in the years to come will regret.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one single feature about this Government it is that they have planned well.  When the Minister for Finance in the Coalition Government was saying that there was no point in planning because we did not know what was going to happen, even at that stage Fianna Fáil were getting ready for the time when they would be back in power and when they would be able to get the country on its feet again. Long before 1977 when the then Government were saying it was impossible to plan we were doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past year the fruits of this planning are plain to see.  We are going <Col N="344" /> ahead step by step with an orderly, specific programme and so far each step has been successful.  We have done exactly what we set out to do, and much more.  In 1976 inflation was running at 20 per cent and I do not think anyone believed that we could reduce it, as we have done, to 7 per cent now.</P>
    <P>During those years of inflation in my constituency the rate of price increases was the cause of much worry and distress to housewives.  Prices were going sky-high.  At that time in an evening newspaper there was a clock indicator that showed the rate of inflation each week and it was spinning around non-stop. That does not appear any more in the newspaper because inflation has slowed down.  Now it is more or less under control although I hope to see it reduced even further in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The national reconstruction is going ahead successfully but there will always be certain sections who do not appear to gain.  In particular I am thinking of old age pensioners and widows.  I realise it is difficult to give these people sufficient incomes until we get the unemployment situation under control.  The country can become prosperous and we can look after these people adequately only when the workforce is employed.  People must have jobs.  It must be made possible for teenagers to get employment when they leave school.  It is very sad to see young people answering advertisements over and over again and more often than not not even getting an acknowledgement. The single most important item Fianna Fáil have to tackle is to get people into employment.  They are doing this and I hope they will be even more successful in the coming five years.</P>
    <P>Nothing creates a better society than where the head of the household is working and where the teenage children have employment.  Unemployment causes all kinds of social ills and unrest.  The housewife is unhappy and the husband feels degraded because he has to sit at home, unable to get work.  There are rows and friction in the home, the children are unhappy and often get into trouble.  It is impossible for families to get decent housing accommodation because they cannot afford it.  Our most important task is to have employment <Col N="345" /> for all our people.  When this is done we will be in a better position to look after our deprived citizens.  We can increase social welfare so that people will not find it difficult to cope with everyday living.</P>
    <P>In the past year we have been the envy of a number of EEC countries.  The growth rate of the economy has doubled that of EEC countries and other countries outside the Community.  When Fianna Fáil came back to office we had to do something drastic to get the country moving again.  When we derated houses it gave people a little extra money to spend.  This helped the economy.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the Buy Irish campaign.  I do not think it is working. When I purchase goods it is only when I get home that I realise they are made in some other country.  When they are shopping people do not look specifically to see if an article is made in Ireland.  It is important that a person should be able to see immediately if an article is imported.  Perhaps we could have some system where a tag or label with the word &ldquo;imported&rdquo; might be put on items.  If this were clearly legible people would know immediately that the article in question was not Irish made. People must be made aware that by buying foreign-made goods they are doing harm to our industries.</P>
    <P>When one asks in a shop if a certain article is made in Ireland it is deplorable to get the answer, &ldquo;No, it would not sell&rdquo;.  How can shopkeepers know it would not sell if it is not on their shelves?  Irish people would be much more inclined to buy Irish goods if they were readily available on the shelves and if they could see straight away which articles were imported.  There are a number of goods of foreign manufacture with the same kind of packaging as on Irish goods and it is not immediately obvious that they are not Irish made.</P>
    <P>Much has been said recently about the removal of food subsidies.  This concerns me a lot because the majority of people in my constituency benefited from these subsidies and they were perturbed because of the removal of the subsidies.  I should like to point out that we have been subsidising food for people who did not need it, for those with good incomes who were well able to pay the <Col N="346" /> cost.  We have been subsidising food for our two million tourists.  Why should we do this for people who have incomes of £10,000 per year?  I am quite certain that the Government will reimburse the people who need it.  It is better that we take the subsidies from the people who do not want them and give them to those in need.  I am sure that those who have suffered because of the removal of subsidies will benefit even more than when the food subsidies were in existence.</P>
    <P>It has been said that a lot of money is going out of the country and that we should have a tighter grip on what is happening.  One industry that is of great economic benefit is the tourist industry which has gone ahead in leaps and bounds over the last two years.  Extra funds have been allocated to CERT to train extra staff for the tourist industry.  I understand that there are 1,000 vacancies in this industry which cannot be filled at the moment and I hope that the people trained by CERT will be recruited during the next tourist season.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that a temporary hire agency is to be set up under the National Manpower Service.  This will be of tremendous advantage to the people who wish to work part-time.  The people I have in mind are married women with growing families or retired people who still have active working years ahead of them.  Part-time work is very hard to find at the moment and it is sad to see a person who did not wish to retire, with a number of good working years ahead of him, deteriorate because he has nothing to do.  A lot of these people would really appreciate a part-time job which would keep their minds and bodies active and they should be encouraged to take up this type of employment if it becomes available.  Over the last year or two AnCO have increased the places available for training and they are training many more people than before.  This gives many young people an opportunity to take up training so as to be in a better position to obtain employment.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about public transport.  The needs of Dublin city at the moment are such that it is hard to know where to start when talking about them.  Certain groups of people are against the improvement and the construction <Col N="347" /> of new roadways.  Surely, in the latter half of the 20th century the city needs new or improved roadways as well as roadways to circle the city so not to bring traffic into the city.  We also need new roads from the city to the south, the west and the north.  I do not advocate that we build huge roadways through the city but that we improve the roads and build roads where necessary.  The city is choked with traffic.  It takes one and a quarter hours for people from places like Blanchardstown and Tallaght to get into work in the morning.  Recently on a television programme people who lived two, three or four miles away from the city were interviewed about how long it took them to get to town by various modes of transport.  Trains apparently were the fastest method of transport and a rapid rail transport system from towns like Blanchardstown and Tallaght should be examined.  The bicycle was the next most efficient mode of transport, running or walking was the next most efficient method of getting to town and the bus was the least efficient.  It is a complete waste of time for people to be sitting for an hour and a quarter in a bus. People who have to sit in a bus for an hour or so every morning often feel like getting out and walking but many are middle-aged or elderly and cannot walk or run although if they did they would probably get there four times as quick.</P>

      <P>I must check that out. Something must be done about the traffic in the city so that people using the bus service will be able to get to town within a reasonable time.  It is just not on for a person to have to leave Templeogue or Tallaght at 8.10 a.m. to arrive in Grafton Street at 9.30 a.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Adjournment I know Deputy Quinn will bring up the problem of traffic wardens in the city but if the law in relation to traffic were enforced in the city it would relieve some of the problems.  Law enforcement in relation to traffic is non-existent.  It is just ridiculous to have cars parked and double parked on both sides of Harcourt <Col N="348" /> Street, for instance, so that traffic has to squeeze through.  Whoever is responsible for law enforcement should tow away illegally parked cars all over the city.  This would at least be a start in improving traffic conditions while we are planning to improve the roads in the city.</P>
    <P>One campaign that has been successful is the campaign through the Health Education Bureau by the Minister for Health for the prevention of illness.  People are becoming more aware that they can do a lot to prevent illness.  I have noticed that a great many people who smoked are not now smoking.  We have come to the conclusion that at committee meetings and in various places we should not smoke and this is a good thing.  It is now the &ldquo;in thing&rdquo; not to smoke and this has been brought about by advertising.</P>
    <P>In relation to education, my prime concern is with primary education.  If a person gets through primary school, obtaining a reasonable level of education, he is on the road to being reasonably successful in life.  It is important, if they want to go on to second-level education, that they have a good primary school background.</P>
    <P>In my view we are not catering properly for those children regarded as slow learners.  Too many children leave our schools without being able to read, spell or write properly.  Special schools are needed for such children.  A special programme of teaching is involved and it is not possible to give that in the ordinary primary schools.  Very few seem to know much about the condition known as dyslexia but a considerable number of children suffer from it.  We should set up special schools for such children or at least allocate a classroom in all schools for them.  It is my hope that the Minister for Education will improve the extension of classrooms in the coming year and increase the capitation grant which is inadequate at present.  I am aware that the Minister has already increased it, but it is still inadequate.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to learn that it will be easier from now on to obtain a mortgage to purchase a house but I do not think the average young couple will benefit from this relaxation because many of them do not have money invested with <Col N="349" /> building societies.  Those fortunate enough to have money in building societies cannot afford the repayments on a loan of £15,000 or £16,000.  Such people should be catered for in a special way.  We could help them by increasing the income limit from £3,500 to £5,000 for SDA loans.  If that income limit was increased more people could avail of the Dublin Corporation low mortgage scheme loan.  I understand that 700 people availed of that scheme last year.  The figure under that scheme was increased by the Government from £7,000 to £9,000, but even £9,000 is inadequate. The price of houses is increasing at such a pace that loan limits are out of date one month after they are increased.  We must keep increasing such limits to keep pace with the increase in the cost of housing.</P>
    <P>I hope our economy improves so that we will get more people back to work in the next two years.  I would like to see old age pensioners and widows properly looked after.  It is unbelievable that such people who have a small income are taxed. I would like to see those people exempt from tax.  There is no point in taxing an old age pensioner or a widow on an income of £20 per week.  It is not possible to live on £20 per week.  We should have more thought for those who have large families and small incomes.  It is sad to see a widow with three or four children unable to educate her children. In a lot of cases such people cannot afford to send their children to vocational schools.  We must help those widows. The Government are facing the greatest challenge of any Government since the foundation of the State and, in my view, they are on their way to accomplishing their aims.  I believe that before the five years have passed all our people anxious to get work will be in employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I should like to reject in the most uncompromising language I can muster at least some of the assumptions that seem to underlie the section of the White Paper dealing with education, and with third-level education in particular.  Acceptance of these assumptions is based on a belief and an approach to education that is as old-fashioned as the horse and cart in this technological age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> There is an assumption in the White Paper that third-level education, which, as we all know, is very expensive, is overwhelmingly a private benefit for the person who avails of it.  This assumption is then used to underpin the argument that the pattern of third-level education might have to be reviewed and, more specifically, that the financing of third-level education might have to be reviewed.  Paragraph 6.13 of the White Paper states:</P>
    <P>the Government feel that third level institutions should be moving towards a situation where they would collect a greater proportion of their income in fees and that this movement should be accompanied by an appropriate improvement in the grants scheme for poorer students.  On the second option they consider that the subsidy for board and accommodation for student teachers should be reduced, with a view to placing these students more on a par with other third level students.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposal to increase the level of third-level fees the White Paper was following a similar paragraph set out in the Green Paper, Development for Full Employment.  In the White Paper the Government note that this suggestion met with a different fate from different organisations and bodies who made comments on it after the publication of the Green Paper.  In particular they note that the National Economic and Social Council accepted the argumentation of the Green Paper, whereas the Higher Education Authority rejected it.</P>
    <P>It is not often I find myself in major disagreement with the NESC but this particular section of the NESC's comments on the Green Paper was one of the weakest sections in that paper, because it seemed to accept holus-bolus the argument of the Green Paper in relation to third-level education, an argument which sees third-level education much more as a consumer good&mdash; something you buy like a lollipop in a shop&mdash;than as something which has to be integrated as fully as possible into not only the economic but the social development of all our people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> The Higher Education Authority on the other hand, who have had the advantage which the NESC so far have not, of actually carrying out a study in this area, have come to a diametrically opposite conclusion.  It might be argued that the HEA represent to some extent a vested interest.  They are the interests which look after education.  They are the Minister for Education's advisory council on Higher Education and therefore might be expected to defend the <i>status quo.</i>  But ultimately it does not matter to the HEA whether fees are raised or lowered in higher education, except in so far as such a policy affects access to higher education and the availability of higher education.  They have a vested interest in promoting greater access to higher education and in promoting the spread of higher education, but they are not doing that as an isolated pressure group.  They are doing it simply because the social and economic needs of the country demand it.</P>
    <P>Their comment on the Green Paper which could be transferred in its entirety to the White Paper deserves the consideration of the House.  Noting that the authority had recently completed a study of fees as a component of higher education financing, the observations of the Higher Education Authority published in November last stated:</P>
    <P>This study shows that, if present fee levels were doubled, income from fees would still represent only about 33% of total recurrent expenditure. However, as this fee income would include fees paid out of higher education grants held by qualified students, the proportion of the total cost of higher education borne by the Exchequer would in fact be 75%, somewhat higher than the two-thirds suggested in paragraph 7.33</P>
    <P>The conclusion which the Authority draws from these figures is that fee increases designed to transfer a significant proportion of the cost of higher education from the Exchequer to students and their families would have to be of such magnitude as would be beyond the means of the great majority of families, most especially <Col N="352" /> those who do not reside within commuting distance of a higher education institution.  The Authority is concerned that very large increases in fees would result in:</P>
    <P>&mdash;real financial hardship to students and their families;</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>&mdash;significant reduction in demand for places in the institutions funded by the Authority;</P>
    <P>That is as plain and outspoken a condemnation of the policies being advanced in this White Paper as is possible to get and it is one which is uttered by people who know, who have the technical expertise to advise the Government, through the Minister for Education, on this matter and whose advice in this matter patently is not being listened to.</P>
    <P>It might be argued, given the results of certain international comparisons of different methods of student financing, that the way to make higher education more equitable and the way to make access to it more available, would not be by increasing fees for higher education but by introducing a further form of grant to enable those needy students who cannot at present do so, to bridge the gap between the end of compulsory education and the beginning of third-level education, because it is that gap&mdash;the gap between 15 and 17 or 18&mdash;which is impassable to students who cannot afford the opportunity cost of continuing in full-time education.  As long as that gap continues to exist, all the grants in the world for third-level education will be of no use to the student who cannot afford to bridge it.</P>
    <P>I would argue that a real development programme in education should avoid tampering in such a regressive and crude way with the mechanisms of financing the present higher education system and should concentrate on making higher education more genuinely accessible not just to those who have overcome all the obstacles in the post-primary hurdle race, but to those who are at present barred even from completing that hurdle race because they cannot afford the cost of doing so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" /> In relation to one or two other items in connection with education, the White Paper is more positive but its voice here is so faint as to be virtually meaningless. There is a reference, for example&mdash;and this is again an echo of something which found a place in the Green Paper&mdash;to the need to look at the curricula in second-level education in order to make them more relevant to the question of employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Before approaching that, I would like to go back very briefly to the second point mentioned in the White Paper, that is the question of reducing the amount of fee and grant subsidies to students in colleges of education to a level closer to that enjoyed, if that is the right word, by students in other third-level institutions. The thesis that students in the training colleges are very substantially better off in terms of grants and subsidies than students in other third-level institutions seems to be based largely on an article published in the Department of Education's magazine, <i>Oideas</i>, by a lecturer in the college of education in Carysfort and a former inspector in the Department.</P>
    <P>It is fair to remark that the figures in that article have been very seriously challenged by the Union of Students in Ireland.  I have gone to the trouble of forwarding a copy of their commentary on the figures to the author of the article concerned to ask him for his comments. I regret to state that I have not as yet received them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Boland received permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 11 on today's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Chair for the opportunity to expand further on the reply to this question which read;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland asked the Minister for Health the number of bodies under the aegis of his Department whose <Col N="354" /> terms of office have expired; the date of expiry; and the reasons in each case for failure to appoint new members. </P>
    <P>According to the Minister's reply, there are six bodies under the aegis of his Department who have run out of time and in each case he has not appointed or reappointed members so that effectively those organisations have not been able to function.</P>
    <P>In relation to some of them, and one in particular, the Council for Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Education whose term of office expired on 19 December, I can understand the reason for the delay.  I understand that it is consequent on the new Medical Council which is in course of being set up and that there will be a delay of some months for that reason, but I cannot accept, and I do not believe the House will say that the Minister was discharging his responsibilities properly, when the National Health Council, whose terms of office expired last March, have not been re-appointed in the interim.  I asked a question on 19 October last, about the date on which the current National Health Council completed their term of office and the reason for the delay on appointing a new council.  The Minister replied, at column 852, Volume 308, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The term of office of all members of the National Health Council expired on 31 March 1978.  Consideration of the re-appointment of the council is at present taking place and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement in the near future. </P>
    <P>I then asked the Minister:</P>
    <P>Would the Minister comment on the suggestion that the reason for the extension was because many of the areas in which the NHC had been engaged in are now caught up on or have been replaced by changes in legislation and the setting up of other bodies? </P>
    <P>The Minister answered:</P>
    <P>No.</P>
    <P>I then asked him:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> Is there any reason why the period for the NHC has been extended by four or five months? </P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>No. I was giving consideration to perhaps some different kind of functions for the council&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle then interjected and the Minister continued his reply:</P>
    <P>&mdash;and the reappointment of the council will be undertaken shortly.</P>
    <P>That was on 19 October last.  I let it go at that.  This was after a delay of six months when the Minister was considering some possible different functions for the National Health Council but had decided against assigning any new functions to them.  He said then that &ldquo;the reappointment of the council will be undertaken shortly&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A further four months has now elapsed and the National Health Council has still not been re-appointed. I have been contacted by members of that council who served over many years and who understood they were serving on an important body.  They understood that the National Health Council were the primary health advisory body on all matters relating to health, with the exception of remuneration.  They diligently discharged their functions and presented regular reports to the Minister on a wide range of topics.  When their term of office came to an end the Minister made no effort to reappoint them although he undertook to do so in October.</P>
    <P>I understood one of the very important functions of the National Health Council was to have referred to them all new Bills in regard to health matters so that they would examine those Bills and their impact on health matters and advise the Minister accordingly.  The Minister has apparently decided that he can do without that type of advice.  He has behaved rather disgracefully to the outgoing members of the National Health Council and has indicated by his refusal to reconstitute that body that he does not place very much value on their contributions.  There are members of <Col N="356" /> that council who feel very disappointed that their services over the years were treated so shabbily.  Even if they were not to be re-appointed there is still a reflection on the level of the contribution they made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the lack of a comprehensive social system in this country and the fact that very many people are not aware of their rights or entitlements, there has been a great move over the last few years to involve as many as possible of the voluntary organisations in informing social welfare recipients of their rights.  There has been a great recognition of the lack of care by the State in the social services field.  Surely it would have been appropriate to reappoint the members of the National Social Services Council in less than seven months after the former membership of that council had expired on 30 June last.  No Minister for Health could claim any great credit for the working of his Department if after a period of seven months the members of the National Social Services Council have not been reappointed.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na Nimheanna, whose term of office expired on 31 August 1978, have not been reappointed.  I have referred already to the Council for Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Education and I accept that there are extenuating circumstances in regard to that council. We now come to Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Dublin Dental Hospital Board, whose term of office expired on 31 December 1978.  Comhairle na nOspidéal are the most important body to decide, recommend and regulate the appointment of specialist doctors to hospitals and health institutions throughout the country.  This body have been intimately involved in the development of the hospital services.  There was a debate in the House before Christmas on that body because a time factor was involved in the setting up of the new Comhairle.  The Minister wanted to change slightly the composition of the Comhairle and he had to have that authorisation through before the end of 1978 because the Comhairle were due to go out of existence at the end of December.  A little over a month later we find that Comhairle na nOspidéal, who normally met several times each month <Col N="357" /> and who had a number of subcommittees who met most actively&mdash;some on a weekly basis&mdash;to deal with the complex matters of requests for appointments and the creation of new posts at specialist level throughout the country, have not been allowed to function during the first month of 1979 because the Minister has not appointed any members.</P>
    <P>The Minister merely said in his reply today that there were questions relating to possible revision of the future format of the organisation which needed to be determined.  I do not accept that that can be the case in relation to Comhairle na nOspidéal.  Those decisions were decided on and publicly debated in the House early last December.  The constraints the Minister referred to do not apply to Comhairle na nOspidéal, the most sensitive body involved in health affairs in the country.</P>
    <P>In relation to those six bodies the two most important matters which the Minister has failed to attend to are the reappointment of the former members or the appointment of new members to Comhairle na nOspidéal, which is now a month overdue, and the shameful treatment of the National Health Council, whose members have not been appointed for ten months.  I would be grateful if the Minister would deal with the position in relation to the Hospitals' Joint Services Board, whose term of office I understood was very nearly ended, and the term of office of An Board Altranais, which I understand are in the same position.  I would have liked to ask supplementary questions about those matters today but did not get an opportunity. There is no justification for the ten-month failure by the Minister to appoint members to the National Health Council, which was to be the primary body to advise on health matters.  They were charged with advising on and examining new legislation as it goes through the House.  The Minister has brought several Bills through the House in the last few months and has one before the House at the moment.  The National Health Council have not been in a position to give any advice, make recommendations or reports in relation to that Bill.  They have not been in a <Col N="358" /> position to give any advice or make recommendations in relation to health matters during the past ten months.</P>
    <P>It is a rather unique position for a Minister for Health to find himself in.  It is perhaps not an unacceptable or an unpalatable position for a Minister for Health to find himself in if these bodies were to make recommendations or submissions which did not meet with his favour.  There are ways of dealing with situations and if the Minister does not like the membership of a particular body or if he does not like what it is going to say, perhaps the easiest thing to do is not to appoint it at all because then he can effectively muzzle it by not allowing it to be in existence.  I do not accept that the Minister has operated in good faith as Minister for Health in relation to these matters and in particular in relation to the National Health Council and in relation to Comhairle na nOspidéal.  I would suggest to the Minister that it would be more in keeping with the functions of a Minister for Health to decide either to continue the statutory bodies in existence to fulfil the role they were set up to achieve or to replace them if he feels they no longer serve the function they were set up to serve, which he obviously does not feel in relation to the National Health Council in view of his reply in the Dáil on 19 October last.  It would be more in keeping with his role as Minister were he to do that than to engage in some of the spurious neo-health and fitness-keeping activities he has been engaged in of late and which appear to have taken up so much of his time.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am sorry that you and the staff of the House have been brought back after 5 o'clock to deal with this absolutely trivial statement by Deputy Boland.  I completely reject any suggestion that the administration of our health services is in any way interfered with by any of the matters about which Deputy Boland has seen fit to complain and go to the extent of bringing this House back here on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained today quite fully in answer to the question the reconstitution of these bodies is under active consideration. In many cases questions relating to <Col N="359" /> the possible revision of the future role or format of the organisations need to be determined and the selection of the individuals for any one body may affect decision on the membership of others.  I do not anticipate that there will be any undue delay in the appointment of these various boards where they need to be appointed.  On no occasion has any significant matter of policy or administration been interfered with in any way and there are very good reasons for any delays that there may have been in <Col N="360" /> the appointment of these bodies, in particular as I mentioned today, in cases where the membership of one body might affect decisions in regard to the others.  I will in due course make all the appointments that are necessary.  In the meantime there is no disadvantage whatever in the situation carrying on as it has carried on during the last few months.</P>

      <P>Reciprocal arrangements between EEC member states in matters of social security are governed by EEC Regulation No. 1408/71, chapter 3 of which deals with the procedures to be followed in calculating pension entitlements.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the person concerned would be entitled to have periods of insurance which he completed in Ireland after 5 July 1948 taken into account for pension purposes in the United Kingdom.  This is the date from which the United Kingdom authorities reckon periods of insurance for retirement pension purposes.</P>
      <P>However, his Irish insurance would be taken into account (a) only if he was unable to satisfy the conditions for receipt of pension on the basis of his United Kingdom insurance alone or (b) If aggregation of his Irish and United Kingdom insurance resulted in the award of a proportionate United Kingdom pension at a higher rate than the pension to which he would be entitled on the basis of his United Kingdom insurance alone.</P>
      <P>Details of his Irish insurance were furnished to the United Kingdom authorities in accordance with the Regulations.  However, they advised my Department and the pensioner that the amount to which he is entitled on the basis of his United Kingdom insurance alone is greater than the proportionate pension to which he would be entitled on aggregation of his Irish and United Kingdom insurance.  His Irish insurance would not, therefore, increase the amount of his United Kingdom pension and, if used for aggregation with his British insurance, would only serve to provide a proportionate pension which would be of lesser amount.</P>
      <P>The Irish insurance record of the person concerned is not sufficient to entitle him to any pension in this country.</P>
