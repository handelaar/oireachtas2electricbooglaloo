      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste (thar ceann an Taoisigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the UN Force in the Lebanon has frequently been subjected to harassment and that it has been prevented from fully carrying out its mandate from the Security Council by the activities of local forces supported from outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period immediately prior to 18 April harassment by local elements in the southern Lebanon area had increased. The Irish contingent in particular had come under severe artillery fire on several occasions from the socalled <i>de facto</i> forces.  It appeared that <Col N="1694" /> these incidents had been occasioned by opposition by the <i>de facto</i> forces to efforts to carry out the mandate of the Security Council, to restore the authority of the Lebanese Government in the area.  It was also apparent that Israel was in a position to exert a very considerable influence over their activities.</P>
    <P>On 18 April, I conveyed personally to the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Begin, my very serious concern at the overall situation which the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon was facing in carrying out its difficult mandate and, in particular, my anxiety and that of the Government about the safety of our own troops and that of the other contingents serving with the force.</P>
    <P>On the night of 18-19 April, intense shelling and firing by the <i>de facto</i> forces at the UNIFIL HQ in Naqoura took place and six members of the Irish company stationed there were injured.</P>
    <P>In his reply, which I received on 19 April, the Israeli Prime Minister indicated that his Government were not in a position to give orders to the <i>de facto</i> forces in southern Lebanon, but that they had influence with them.  He said that Israeli authorities had informed the <i>de facto</i> forces that Israel opposed without qualifications any firing or shelling at units of UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>The precise circumstances of the bombardment of Naqoura are now under investigation by UN experts in the field.  Since these events, there has been no major shelling of Irish forces, though the UN force is still being subjected to harassment and full freedom of movement has not yet been established.  The Government will continue to support the efforts of the Secretary General, who is responsible for the operations of the force.  I would hope in particular that the Government of Israel will do all in its power to facilitate the force in its efforts to carry out its mandate.  The Government will also continue to keep the entire situation in southern Lebanon under close review.</P>
    <P>I wish to avail of this opportunity to express the Government's firm support for the UN peace-keeping operation.  In particular, I want to express appreciation of the performance of the officers <Col N="1695" /> and men of UNIFIL under extremely difficult circumstances and to convey our concern for the troops who have suffered injuries during these attacks. Deputies will, I know, join with me in wishing them all a speedy recovery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Tánaiste in commending the behaviour of the Irish troops in difficult circumstances. Will the Tánaiste tell the House if the Government have any reservations on the UN code of combat regulations governing behaviour of UN troops under fire?  Will he state if the Government have made any representations on such reservations to the UN authorities? Have the Government any information on the immediate military outlook in the Lebanon, whether that spells further danger for Irish troops and whether any consideration has been given to the withdrawal of these troops if the basic UN instructions that troops under fire may not defend themselves adequately are not altered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that under UNIFIL's terms of reference approved by the Security Council it is provided that UNIFIL shall use force only in self-defence.  Self-defence is defined as including resistance to attempts by forceful means to prevent it from discharging its duties under its mandate.  It is clear, therefore, that troops serving with UNIFIL are entitled to return fire.  In fact, during the recent bombardment at Naqoura they did so. The question as to whether fire should be returned in particular circumstances is, of course, a matter for the UNIFIL command under the overall direction of the Secretary-General taking into account the overall peace-keeping objectives of the force.  With regard to the current military situation the position has improved but it is still by no means satisfactory.  I would not like to hazard a guess because it would be no more than that as to how the situation will develop, but I want to make it clear that it is not the intention of the Government to withdraw the Irish troops.  The Government are satisfied that the Irish contingent should be maintained with <Col N="1696" /> UNIFIL in view of the task it is performing, a task which is of very great importance not only in the area concerned but having implications for a much wider area.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that no peace-keeping operation can be without some risk. Furthermore, Ireland's continued participation in UNIFIL is the practical expression of our support for UN peace-keeping activities.  The Irish contribution to UNIFIL is particularly highly regarded.  Of course, the Government continue to monitor developments closely and to assist the Secretary-General in any way possible to minimise the risks involved.  It is essential that progress be made in enabling the force to carry out its mandate fully and I hope that Israel will now co-operate wholeheartedly to this end.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Tánaiste will agree, but I do not know of any previous UN peace-keeping operation which has been as complicated or as difficult as this.  The troops have been caught in a veritable crossfire.  In these circumstances, does the Tánaiste agree that there is a case for looking for a reassessment of the code governing UN troops in combat conditions in a situation like this in which we are asking brave men to put their arms aside when their lives are in imminent danger?  Will the Tánaiste agree there is a case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant terms of reference do not preclude the troops there from returning fire, and they have in fact done so.  The Deputy may rest assured that the whole question of the circumstances in which the troops there should engage in the use of their weapons will be, and indeed continues to be, kept under continuous review having regard to the whole object of the exercise, which is a peace-keeping one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant from the point of view of the representations that could be made to ensure that if possible the supply of arms to those people will dry up, that arms would not be made available for firing at our troops.  There was a newspaper article today which stated that the weapons originated in a certain country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that it would be helpful for me to pursue that line, but I can assure the House that the whole matter, including the aspects adverted to by the Deputy, is being monitored closely by the Government, and any steps that can be taken, particularly in conjunction with the Secretary-General and the other countries supplying contingents, are being taken to minimise the risks involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>This country is obliged under EEC directives to maintain stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products corresponding to 90 days average daily internal consumption in the preceding calendar year.  In calculating internal consumption, three categories of product are taken into account:</P>
      <P>(a)  motor spirit and aviation fuel,</P>
      <P>(b) gas oil, diesel oil, kerosene and jet fuel of the kerosene type, and</P>
      <P>(c)  fuel oils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" /> Provisional figures collected by my Department show that, on 17 April 1979, the stocks of oil, calculated in accordance with the relevant EEC directives, amounted to 78, 69 and 93 days respectively in the three categories, representing about 83 days overall. Roughly 19 days supply is stored in other member states&mdash;the United Kingdom, France and Belgium&mdash;and the remaining stocks are stored in this country.</P>
    <P>At present, weekly returns of stocks are made to my Department by the oil companies with checks carried out by officers authorised by me.  For the purpose of complying with the directives crude oil stocks may be taken into account. It has been found, however, that the EEC system of converting crude oil to products on a national basis can be misleading and a more comprehensive and realistic reporting system is being introduced.</P>
    <P>I have received no complaints from the EEC Commission regarding the failure to observe the EEC requirements for oil reserves kept within the State.  It should be noted that the directives, which originally came into effect in 1971, permit the holding of stocks in other member states.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to ask a question about internal stocks. Has the Minister included the oil at the Whiddy Island terminal, and if so how much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the oil at Whiddy is included, as it has been for many years, in so far as the crude element in the stocks is concerned.  The amount allocated in respect of Whiddy is 135,000 tons, which amounts to ten days supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The second aspect relates to overseas stocks.  Where exactly are these stocks and how accessible would they be in times of difficulties?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises because of the accessibility to these stocks in times of crisis.  Is the Minister not able to tell me exactly where the stocks are in those other countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that he has received in the recent past full co-operation from the companies concerned in regard to their storage facilities and the grades stored, and has he taken more comprehensive measures or does he see the need for more comprehensive EEC measures in relation to stocks held by the companies? Does he see the need for that to be incorporated in his own surveillance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned in the reply, I do not find the EEC system for calculating these stocks satisfactory from our point of view because it includes what they term the converted value of crude, which would not be readily available in an emergency&mdash;it would have to be refined.  That system is regarded by the EEC as sufficient for their purposes.  In the past three weeks I have made arrangements for a much more regular return of stocks both at home and abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Irish revenue and excise officers in the various depots throughout the country, including Whitegate, on a daily basis take stocks and are fully aware of the exact amounts in stock and that therefore the surprise and amazement expressed by the Minister some weeks ago as to what precisely the companies had and had not was, to say the least, a bit of special pleading on his part?  Would the Minister not agree?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I had no reason to believe at that time that the figures might not be accurate.  Indeed, in fairness to the companies, although they were somewhat higher in respect of some areas, they were found in general to be in accordance with the figures supplied. The main difference was that in the past there was a relatively long gap in respect of the periods during which the returns were made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The shortage of petroleum products, particularly gas diesel oil and, to a lesser extent, motor spirit, which has been experienced in consuming countries this year was caused by a number of factors including the Iranian crisis, and increased demand due to severe weather conditions.  Supplies to this country were in fact significantly higher in the first quarter of 1979, as compared with the corresponding period last year, due mainly to additional demand arising from increased economic activity.</P>
      <P>It may be taken that energy matters will continue to be discussed and this country's viewpoint adequately presented at appropriate EEC meetings. Meanwhile, all necessary steps will be taken, under the aegis of the EEC, the IEA and other international organisations, to ensure that available oil supplies are distributed equitably and that due account is taken of the fact that our dependence on imported oil is higher than in many other countries and that our economy is rapidly expanding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the previous European Council's decision to cut consumption overall by 5 per cent.  How does this relate to his general energy policy here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally I agree with and support the recommendation of the European Council that our consumption should be cut.  I might add that it is more difficult for Ireland than it is for many other countries because our growth rate is much higher; it is higher than any other European country.  Also the ratio of increase in oil usage or energy usage to increase in GNP is a higher ratio here than it is in other European countries and this creates particular difficulties for <Col N="1706" /> us.  We have been at some pains to point out that the 5 per cent cut back which was agreed on at the European Council and at the international Energy Agency meeting in Paris in France should be related to projected 1979 demand rather than to actual 1978 usage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reconcile for the House his admission made here just now that the reduction in oil usage is an important objective to which he himself subscribes with the admission which he made via his Parliamentary Secretary here last week in answer to a question from me that while in 1976 £70,000 had been spent on publicity promoting energy conservation, in the first three months this year the sum of £150 was spent?  Would the Minister like to comment on that disparity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says it is particularly difficult for Ireland because of our high economic growth and higher ratio of increase in energy consumption to our increase in GNP as compared to any other country in Europe.  Surely these factors should be taken into consideration in arriving at an estimation of the amount of oil to be used in this country in 1979?  Therefore a 5 per cent reduction for us is no more difficult than for any other country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because the usage in many other countries is only marginally above their 1978 levels and some of the oil companies have been seeking to supply by reference to the 1978 usage rather than to the projected 1979 demand.</P>

      <P>While there have been difficulties caused by circumstances, both inside the country and abroad, and entirely outside my direct control which involved delays in supply to some consumers, the fact is that in the first quarter of this year sales of gas/diesel oil were substantially higher than sales in the corresponding quarter last year.  It is true that the disruption caused by the dispute at the Port of Dublin caused some panic among motorists in particular, but I cannot accept that overall there has been a severe shortage of diesel fuel.</P>
      <P>Some shortage in supplies of gas/ diesel oil in the current quarter is anticipated and, as Deputies will be aware, I recently made an order providing for priority to be given to certain users of that product.  I might add that the operation of this order is being kept under close review to ensure that all essential user's requirements are met.</P>

      <P>I have informed the House twice that the deliveries of gas/ diesel oil were significantly higher in the first quarter of this year than they were last year.  I continously made the case over a period of perhaps six or eight weeks that there was in fact no serious shortage, that there was a certain element of panic-buying and things like that going on which was creating an artificial shortage.  I urged people not to partake in activities which would create an artificial shortage when the underlying situation did not indicate that there was such a shortage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of many companies they were a good deal higher than that.  Part of the problem was caused by the fact that one relatively small company, which has about 5 per cent of the Irish market, seemed to be out of supplies altogether&mdash;due to factors which were relevant to that company&mdash;and the customers of that company inevitably must have caused a certain panic within the market generally because they were going around rather frantically trying to get supplies elsewhere which gave the impression of a greater shortage than there was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that such difficulty exists.</P>
      <P>The Fuels (Control of Supplies) (Regulation of Deliveries of Gas Diesel Oil) Order, 1979, requires that agriculture, commerce, fisheries, hospitals and similar institutions, industry and tourism receive priority in the delivery of gas diesel oil.  I have no reason to believe that these priorities are not being observed by the oil companies.</P>
      <P>While there may have been some difficulties regarding supplies of gas diesel oil to fishing boats in certain areas, I am satisfied that overall there is an adequate supply of gas diesel oil for fishermen's reasonable requirements.</P>
      <P>If, however, the Deputy has knowledge of any particular cases of difficulty on the part of fishermen in getting adequate supplies, arrangements will be made to provide supplies if he gets in touch with my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that they were two new fishing boats from Skerries operating off the Donegal coast. They were unable to get supplies of diesel oil at Killybegs although it was relatively plentiful there.  Boats that normally fish out of Killybegs get their sup <Col N="1713" /> plies from the local fishermen's co-operative who, in turn, get their supplies from Derry.  One of the oil companies concerned indicated that supplies for these boats could be made available at another port or ports, but the company undertook to make arrangements for these boats on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and did so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>I do not think that there would be a great deal to be learned, by way of information of continuing value, from an investigation of the accountancy procedures of the international oil companies.

      <P>In any event I am satisfied that so far as our requirements are concerned a better knowledge of international pricing mechanisms rather than accountancy procedures is desirable.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the letter the Deputy has referred to.  I have been advised that the company in question have contracts with the majority of their customers and, as the Deputy is probably aware, contracts between a company and their customers which contain a price variation clause, remain outside the scope of the Prices Acts.  I think that it is reasonable to assume that contracts of this kind contain a price variation clause acceptable to both supplier and consumer.  Where no contract exists, the company are subject to the provisions of the Maximum Prices (Petroleum Products) Order.</P>

In view of the loophole in the Prices Acts through which people are exploiting the public would the Minister not take steps to deal with this matter?

      <P>This has been the law since 1958 and it was frequently used by suppliers and consumers since then.  It is open, as that letter made clear, to consumers who have contracts of this kind which allows this sort of variation, to decline to take further supplies.  Some of them have done so.</P>

I have had a discussion with some executives of that particular company.  They told me, as I expected, that they had lost a great deal of business among people to whom they made that sort of offer.

      <P>What does a consumer of Burmah oil do when Texaco and other companies have said in relation to supplies from them that they are sorry, that they are stopping the supply of oil and they cannot supply oil to them for another three months.  They are told by those companies that if they wanted to change over to them they could not possibly be supplied with oil.  I would like to hear the Minister's answer to that because a lot of consumers are very irate about the matter.</P>

      <P>As I tried to point out to the Deputy, who possibly did not hear me between his own further supplementaries and those around him, this company have had to do this, they informed me, in respect of two relatively small shiploads of oil which they had to buy in circumstances of great difficulty for them.  They expect shortly to be back in the more normal situation where they will be getting supplies of oil at normal prices from their normal suppliers and then they will be selling at normal prices. The company in their own interests could not continue, for other than a short period of extreme difficulty, at <Col N="1721" /> price levels of this kind because they would lose virtually all their customers.</P>

      <P>I was trying to ask a supplementary earlier.  I am afraid it is an oily one but I was told there was further oil down the line.  Since we are running out of oil can I ask the supplementary again?  Is the Minister aware that this company have recently informed one of their retailers that they will no longer provide him with diesel fuel but at the same time they will not release that retailer from his contract to supply petrol?  This ensures that that particular retailer with an offer of a contract from another company cannot accept it.

      <P>The reporting of oil stocks held by the oil companies has been stepped up from monthly to weekly intervals and such reports are being given in much greater detail than heretofore.  Moreover, spot checks of stocks held at the oil terminals and elsewhere over the Easter period revealed no discrepancies.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that there is little or no opportunity for the oil companies in this country to hold supplies in stock in anticipation of price increases. My concern at the moment is that stocks are at rather low levels and I have asked the oil companies to replenish them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The stocks which we hold at the moment are less than what would be the normal stocks because of the run on them.  I suppose that ideally one should ask the companies to run down their stocks as much as possible before an increase takes place but that is not feasible commercially.  It cannot be done.  I would be happy enough as long as there were not excessive stocks awaiting a price increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is confusing the question.  It is not a question of running down stocks.  It is a question of charging a higher price for existing stocks before they are replaced by new stocks.  The Minister is deliberately confusing that.  We are concerned that no additional price should be charged until the stocks at present there have been exhausted and replaced by new stocks, which is precisely what in opposition the Minister kept pressing on our Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible, at the present time, to indicate what further, if any, increases in oil prices may be implemented during 1979.  This would be dependent on a number of factors including any further decisions by OPEC as regards oil price movements during 1979.  All price increase applications from the Irish oil companies will be examined by the National Prices Commission and my concern will be to ensure that the Irish consumer does not have to <Col N="1724" /> pay more for oil products than is necessary to ensure continuity of oil supplies.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, I am satisfied that any price increases implemented by the oil companies were warranted on the basis of increased crude oil and product costs.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give effect to certain taxation changes announced in the budget and to make some other provisions which I will deal with later.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of budgetary policy in 1979 is towards growth in employment and output, so as to assist in achieving the Government's objectives for economic and social development. With the increased dynamism of the private sector arising from the success of the Government's policies to date&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the contribution to growth from the public sector can be scaled down, enabling the Exchequer borrowing requirement to be reduced to 10½ per cent of GNP.  However, the public sector resources will continue to be applied so as to maximise their ability to induce growth.  In this way, my budget was designed to be stimulatory, but not excessively so.</P>
      <P>The stimulatory design of the budget is clearly evident from the reorientation of expenditure, with the main emphasis being placed on investment.  The public capital programme is estimated to reach £974 million in 1979, a massive increase of 22 per cent over the 1978 outturn. This increase runs well ahead of the increase in expenditure on current services, which is expected to grow by about 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Taoiseach announced on 25 April details of a plan for a &ldquo;National Understanding for Economic and Social Development&rdquo; which would provide a framework for continued economic and social progress. The implementation of the terms of this understanding is conditional on acceptance of the provisions of the pay policy for 1979-80, which has been agreed between the employer organisations and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to follow on the expiry of the 1978 national wage agreement.  I would hope that the terms of this understanding will be accepted by all concerned.  Should the provisions be rejected or if, subsequent to acceptance, they should be widely disregarded, then the parties involved will not be obliged to honour the commitments made in this understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both in the budget and in the proposed national understanding the Government have shown their desire to continue their policy of reducing the disincentive effect of personal taxation.  In the 1979 budget, reliefs were given costing an estimated £30 million in 1979 and £47 million in a full year, which removed some 40,000 taxpayers from the tax net.  The combined effect of the 1979 increases in personal allowances <Col N="1758" /> and the large increases granted in 1978 means that we have increased the value of the single person's allowance by 68 per cent and the married person's allowance by 103 per cent, more than doubling it, in two years.  The additional special allowance for PAYE taxpayers which the Government have proposed under the national understanding, subject to certain conditions, is further evidence of the Government's active concern in this area.  I shall be introducing an enabling provision by way of a Committee Stage amendment to cater for this special allowance.</P>
    <P>Combined with these tax reliefs, the pay increases proposed in the national understanding will ensure a significant rise in real incomes.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the individual provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 which is effective for 1979-80 and subsequent years, provides that the income limit for the purposes of the dependent relative tax allowance will in future automatically be equal to the personal rate of the social welfare contributory old age pension, payable to a person aged 80 years, or over, and living alone.  The income limit for 1979-80 will be £1,129.  The provision is designed to obviate the need for annual legislation to revise the limit by reference to budget increases in the pension.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 give effect to the budget day proposals for increases in personal allowances and the amendment of the lower rate bands.  The revised bands and allowances are set out in the respective tables incorporated in these sections.  In addition, provision is made under section 3 for a reduction in the income tax child allowance which reduction is related to the increases given in the social welfare children's allowances.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides an additional personal allowance of £250 for a parent who is widowed, deserted, separated or unmarried and who has a dependent child or children resident with him or her.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that no part of the new pay-related contributions applying as from 6 April 1979 under the Social Welfare Acts will qualify for income tax relief.  However, there has been a compensatory <Col N="1759" /> reduction in the rate of contribution.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides relief in respect of the labour element of expenditure by householders on the improvement and maintenance of their residences, including gardens.  The relief, which applies for the year 1979-80, is confined to the excess over £50 of the amount of such expenditure.  The maximum amount of expenditure which will qualify for relief is £450.  The scheme will apply, among other things, to insulation and it is hoped that it will contribute towards job creation and energy conservation.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that, with effect from 1980-81, premiums and other contributions under permanent health insurance schemes designed to maintain earnings during illness will be allowed as deductions for income tax purposes.  The section also secures that any benefits payable under such schemes will be charged to tax and will be within the scope of PAYE as from 6 April 1980. At present, benefits are not regarded as income for tax purposes unless and until they have been received for more than a year.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 are concerned with income tax relief in respect of personal interest.  Section 8 increases from £2,000 to £2,400 the maximum amount of personal interest which, ordinarily, will qualify for income tax relief.</P>
    <P>Section 9 scales down the maximum qualifying amount of interest in cases where employees and company directors enjoy the benefit of loans made at preferential rates of interest.  The ceiling of maximum relief allowable in such cases will be scaled down in the proportion which the preferential rate of interest bears to a specified rate, 12 per cent.  The effect is that where a person's borrowings are all at a preferential rate of interest, he can enjoy full interest relief on borrowings up to a total of £20,000.  Under section 8, the limit of £2,000 in respect of interest on borrowings by full-time employees of public companies to purchase shares in the companies in which they are employed is also being increased to £2,400.</P>
    <P>In line with the increase in the income <Col N="1760" /> tax limit, the limit on the deduction of certain interest which is treated as a charge on income for corporation tax purposes is being increased in section 20 from £2,000 to £2,400 a year.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the taxation, as from 6 April 1980 of short-term social welfare benefits, as announced in the White Paper &ldquo;Programme for National Development&rdquo;.  Section 11 enables certification procedure relating to tax recovery to apply to cases where an assessment is being appealed.</P>
    <P>Chapter 11, which comprises sections 12 to 15, deals with the taxation of farming profits.  As announced in the budget, the threshold of liability is being brought down from £60 RV to £50 RV and the multiplier under the notional basis of assessment is being raised from 90 to 125. Provision for these changes is contained in sections 12 and 15.  Section 12, in addition, provides for marginal relief in the case of individuals occupying farm land of £50 RV to £59 RV, that is, those becoming liable for tax for the first time.</P>
    <P>As also announced in the budget, provision is made in section 14 to enable a farmer to opt out of the notional basis of assessment on certain conditions. This section also provides that the Revenue Commissioners will have the right to require accounts to be lodged for the preceding one or two years of notional assessment and to determine if the accounts indicate a higher liability than that charged on the notional basis.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that farmers becoming liable to tax for the first time may opt to be taxed on the basis of their current year's accounts, as such farmers may not have been keeping accounts already.</P>
    <P>The present Bill does not, of course, provide for the revised system of taxation for farmers which has been devised by the Government and of which details have already been publicly announced. The revised system will be implemented as from 1980-81, subject to enactment of necessary legislation in due course.</P>
    <P>Chapter III contains four sections dealing with losses which are designed, first, to rectify an anomaly by which, in certain circumstances, a trader could claim relief for the same loss for tax purposes <Col N="1761" /> more than once and, secondly, to allow a trader to set a trading loss incurred in the year preceding the year of assessment against other income charged for the year of assessment.  This latter provision represents a liberalising change.  The present position is that losses incurred in the carrying on of a trade, if not set against other income in the year in which the loss is incurred, can be set only against future profits of the same trade.  These provisions are contained in sections 17 and 16 respectively. Sections 18 and 19 are consequential technical changes.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV contains only one section, that is section 20, to which I have already adverted in the context of deduction for interest.</P>
    <P>Chapter V contains various income tax and corporation tax provisions.  As announced in the budget, stock relief is being extended for a further year.  As the inflationary conditions which gave rise to the introduction and continuance of stock relief have considerably abated, relief under this Bill will be restricted to three-quarters of the amount which would be allowable if the relief were simply continued without any modification. Section 21 contains the relevant provision.</P>
    <P>The next three sections are concerned with capital allowances.  Section 22 extends to the end of 1980 the operation of the 20 per cent investment allowance applicable to capital expenditure on new machinery and plant in the designated areas.  Section 23 corrects a drafting flaw in the provision in last year's Finance Act, which introduced &ldquo;free depreciation&rdquo; for industrial buildings and hotels.  In section 24 I am extending for a period of five years the initial allowance of 100 per cent for capital expenditure on new machinery or plant and secondhand ships, and the 50 per cent initial allowance and 4 per cent annual allowance for capital expenditure incurred on industrial buildings.  This is a further indication of the Government's determination that every opportunity be given to entrepreneurs to expand their activities with a view to increasing employment.</P>
    <P>The next section is also concerned <Col N="1762" /> with employment.  Section 25 provides for the exemption from tax of payments made to employers under the employment incentive scheme and the employment maintenance scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 26 enables the Revenue Commissioners to approve for tax purposes a retirement annuity contract which contains an &ldquo;open-market option&rdquo;, that is one which can be transferred from one assurance company to another.</P>
    <P>Chapter VI is concerned with anti-avoidance.</P>
    <P>Section 27 prevents the abuse of a tax relief intended for persons with very small incomes.  Deputies may recall that in a press release issued on 18 September 1978 I gave notice of my intention to introduce a provision of this nature.</P>
    <P>Section 28 is intended to counteract abuse of the tax relief available in respect of certain covenants.  The practice has grown of the higher income classes transferring slices of their income, under convenant, to their children over 21 years with a view to avoiding tax.  From 6 April 1979 transfers in excess of 5 per cent of the disponer's income will cease to benefit from this practice.  However, I am providing that the position will remain unaltered where a child or grandchild who is permanently incapacitated, physically or mentally, is concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 29 is a third anti-avoidance measure.  It is concerned with dividend stripping, which is a device by which a tax advantage could be gained through buying shares of companies which have accumulated reserves and the taking of a dividend on those shares.</P>
    <P>The last chapter of Part I contains two capital gains tax provisions, both of which are of a relieving nature.  Section 30 introduces a relief from capital gains tax in the case of a disposal by an individual of a house occupied rent-free by a dependent relative.  Section 31 allows a disposal by a mother to her illegitimate child to qualify for relief under section 27 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975. Under the section mentioned, if certain conditions are fulfilled, relief is given on the disposal by an individual aged 55 <Col N="1763" /> years or over of business or farming assets to the individual's child.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with customs and excise matters.  Sections 32 to 37 confirm the budget increases in excise duties on beer, spirits, tobacco products, wine, cider and perry.  Section 37 also provides for relief from the new maximum rate of duty on cider and perry from stocks held by manufacturers on 7 February 1979 where these did not exceed 20,000 gallons.  The rate of duty on these stocks will be the new intermediate rate.  The concession takes account of the hardship which the immediate imposition of the new maximum rate could impose on these manufacturers having regard to the low flat-rate duty of 5p per gallon which had remained unchanged since 1940 until this year.</P>
    <P>Section 38 provides for an increase in the penalty for unlicensed bookmaking from £100 to £500.  The present penalty has remained unchanged since 1963.</P>
    <P>Section 39 repeals an old customs provision contained in section 15 of the Finance Act, 1934, which has the effect of exempting from VAT importations of antiques by unregistered persons.  This exemption discriminates against VAT-registered traders in antiques within the State, who are required to charge VAT at the 10 per cent rate on their sales.</P>
    <P>Section 40 confirms a 1978 Order providing for the metrication of excise duty on hydrocarbon oils and replacement of the bushel in the law relating to excise duty on beer.  The order was made by the Government under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957.  Details are set out in the Explanatory Memorandum.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains two value-added tax provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 41 amends subsection 18 (1) of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, which deals with the inspection of business records of persons liable for VAT, so as to ensure that inquiries may be made not only in respect of liability to tax but also in respect of claims for VAT repayment where no liability to tax arises.</P>
    <P>Section 42 confirms the application of the standard 20 per cent VAT rate to <Col N="1764" /> radios and record players as announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with stamp duties.</P>
    <P>Section 43 will be of interest to charities, since it exempts from stamp duty transfers of lands and houses for charitable purposes in Ireland to bodies of persons or trusts established for charitable purposes.  The introduction of this exemption brings the position in stamp duty into line with that obtaining in income, corporation and capital taxes where there is a special relief for charities.  Sections 44 and 45 make certain changes of a technical nature in companies' capital duty, which is a stamp duty chargeable on the formation of a company or on an increase in its capital, while section 46 imposes an interest charge of 1.25 per cent per month where such duty has not been paid within the prescribed time.</P>
    <P>Sections 47 to 49 are concerned with new stamp duty arrangements for transfers of stock and shares through the Stock Exchange.  These arrangements became necessary as a result of a new computerised Stock Exchange transfer system which came into operation last month.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill contains a few miscellaneous provisions which are on the usual lines and do not call for comment.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally, the Finance Bill should be one of the most important pieces of legislation to be put before the House.  This year I do not think we can elevate it to that position.  The Bill is designed to give legal status to the measures announced in the budget, but so much has happened so far this year in relation to the budget that this Bill has lost much of the relevance it would otherwise have.  It is ironic that debate on the Bill should begin on this significant day, on the day when the farmers are meeting at the Spring Show, on the day on which there is a PAYE protest march and on the day which is the feastday of St. Joseph the Worker.  This measure, therefore, has little relevance to the events taking place outside this <Col N="1765" /> House.  This Second Stage is being introduced by a Government who have not done anything right during the past six months, a Government who by Irish standards have an unprecedented majority in this House.</P>
      <P>It is inconceivable that any Cabinet could have made such a mess of the economy or, indeed, of the ordinary politics of the country such as that which we have been witnessing since October last.  There are the problems on the industrial relations scene and the appalling situation of the Government not knowing what compensation was offered or when that compensation was due to be paid in respect of our entry to the EMS.  There have been the efforts on the part of the Government to cloak some of the budgets we have had this year, as if these budgets were not important.  For instance, there was the removal of the food subsidies a week before the budget of 7 February, though I would put the word &ldquo;budget&rdquo; in inverted commas because of its having been dismantled so much since then.  In addition there have been the inadequate increases in social welfare payments and pay-related benefit and the reduction in the allowance for children in terms of the income tax code.  During my speech on the budget I referred to its as being antifamily and anti-farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been the extraordinary pantomime of the 2 per cent or the now-you-see-it, now-you-do-not levy announced on 7 February and which we were told was designed to bring the farming community into line with the remainder of the taxpayers.  But within a few weeks the Government had decided under severe pressure that they would not introduce the levy on condition that an acceptable rate of tax was agreed to by the farmers before 1 May.  I shall not go further than to refer to what the farmers have been saying as agitation on their part, though some of the remarks made yesterday by leaders of the farming community would not appear to me to be suitable terms to use in a democracy. That agitation on the part of the farmers provoked the huge march of PAYE people six weeks ago.  One can understand the sense of resentment on their <Col N="1766" /> part when the PAYE sector know that people in the area of capital gains can have these gains indexed while the ordinary person on a salary cannot avail of such indexation.  That march would have been much smaller were it not for the intemperate and ill-advised remarks of the Minister for Finance in Brussels on the previous day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy may contribute after I have finished.  I suspect that those intemperate <Col N="1767" /> remarks of the Minister resulted in the people concerned being more determined to ensure that they be treated fairly in terms of the tax systems.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the national understanding.  It is unfortunate that already one of the main unions have decided not to recommend acceptance of this national understanding to their members.  A wage agreement or some form of understanding is needed in respect of the level to which wages may increase between now and next year. The most important platform that we have for growth is our exports.  Consequently, our exports must continue to be competitive.  One of the cost elements in respect of exports is the level of wages.  It is important that that cost proportion does not increase faster than the comparable costs of our competitors in other countries.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the figures released this morning sound a warning about exports and imports based on figures for the past 12 months.  The document issued by the GIS on behalf of the Central Statistics Office, dated 20 April 1979 shows that for the year ended March 1978 our import excess over exports was £516 million, whereas for the 12 months ended March 1979 it was £911 million, a growth of 80 per cent.  That is a warning not only for the Government but for all Members of this House, for those engaged in industry and for our trade union leaders.  We cannot provide employment for all our people unless we continue to show a strong growth in exports. If we are to increase our exports we must ensure that our costs are competitive. We must be able to compete at home and abroad with goods manufactured elsewhere.  For that reason I hope that agreement is reached between the employers and the trade unions in regard to incomes.  The Government have a role to play in that they can influence take-home pay by reducing the tax burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were two elements in the budget which many people considered sneaky. The Government appear to be taking back with the left hand what the Minister announced he was giving with the right hand, that is, the increase in the <Col N="1768" /> allowance for single and married people. I refer to the abolition of the 20 per cent band at the lower level.  This meant that all taxpayers came into a higher tax band.  The other element is the reduction in the children's allowance from £240 to £218.</P>
    <P>The second paragraph on page 6 of the document &ldquo;National Understanding for Economic and Social Development&rdquo; reads:</P>
    <P>As a contribution to promoting the present National Understanding the Government will provide a special allowance for PAYE taxpayers at a cost of approximately £39 million in 1979.  This allowance will operate in December, provided (1) that the budgetary position is reasonably in line with expectations, and (2) that any funds needed for employment creation, which is a first priority, have been made available.</P>
    <P>The end of page 2 reads:</P>
    <P>The Employer and Industry Organisations will contribute 50 per cent of the necessary finance for this programme to yield up to £10 million collected by means of a ½ per cent surcharge on the employer's social security contribution.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether the paragraph in page 6 relates to the paragraph at the bottom of page 2.  The Minister should make an unequivocal promise.  In his speech he said that he intended to introduce an amendment to the Finance Bill to take account of the £39 million referred to in page 6.  The Minister should say clearly that the two conditions attached to the national understanding have been removed and that the £39 million will be made available whether or not the budgetary position is in line with expectations.  The budgetary position is the responsibility of the Government.  Neither the employers nor the unions had any say in the matter.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure that the employer organisations will agree with either condition because the famous employment targets were not devised by them.  These targets are the Fianna Fáil Party's targets.  We now find that half of the cost <Col N="1769" /> of fulfilling Fianna Fáil's promises must be met by the employer organisations. The more successful the private sector in increasing employment the more they will pay for the shortfall that may occur during 1979.  If those two conditions were removed, the national understanding would receive a warm acceptance from both sides of industry, although some people will argue that the 15 per cent wage increase is too high and is more than the country can afford. I presume the Government are hoping that what we might lose in industrial relations through a lower agreement we may gain in industrial peace through a higher wage agreement.</P>
    <P>All this has been negotiated with the EMS in the background.  It is possible to trace the start of the Government's lack of confidence in dealing with the economy from the first time the EMS was mentioned last October.  I am sure that no one will forget the contradictions between the Taoiseach and his Ministers in relation to the EMS.  Early this year we were still not clear where the money was coming from or if it was coming at all.  I am glad that the position has been clarified and that the £45 million will be made available.  In last week's newspapers the Minister was reported as saying that there was nothing in the negotiations to prohibit the money being used in this way.  During the debates on the subject in this House we were given the impression that the money was being made available to help us overcome the problems of entering the EMS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The national understanding has been negotiated against a totally different background to any other wage agreement because we are now inside the EMS in which, according to the <Col N="1770" /> Minister and the Government, different standards are demanded of us.  I am trying to determine whether the national understanding measures up to what is required of us inside that system.  We were told, for instance, that we would have lower inflation rates.  One of the things which prompts people to look for wage increases or fringe benefits is the amount they have to pay for mortgages. We were told when joining the EMS that interest rates would be lower.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We were not told that.  I can tell the Deputy now what was said on numerous occasions, namely, that the EMS would create the circumstances in which, if we took advantage of them, we could have lower interest rates.  We were at great pains to stress that we would not automatically have lower interest rates.</P>

Everything appears to be far worse now than before we joined, including the rate of inflation.  Earlier the Minister tried to tie me down to exactly what he said in Brussels and, as I have said before, this Government are extremely good at using words.

      <P>On a point of order, does the ruling now being made by the Chair follow precedent?  My recollection of precedent is that one could cover on the Finance Bill as many items as in the budget debate because it is the same matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the same matter and there is not the same latitude on the Finance Bill as on the budget debate, which took days.  We cannot have a second budget debate. The Deputy knows that and this has been ruled several times in the House. This is a taxation measure.  We are discussing taxation arising out of the budget and other taxation measures in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>During his speech the Minister stated as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Taoiseach announced on 25 April <Col N="1772" /> details of a plan for a &ldquo;National Understanding for Economic and Social Development&rdquo; which would provide a framework for continued economic and social progress.  The implementation of the terms of this Understanding is conditional on acceptance of the provisions of the pay policy for 1979-80, which has been agreed between the employer organisations and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to follow on the expiry of the 1978 National Wage Agreement.</P>
    <P>He went on to refer to tax reliefs.  Once the Chair allows the reference to &ldquo;a framework for continued economic and social progress&rdquo;, the Chair may not rule that we may use only the same number of words or spend the same amount of time discussing this matter as did the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that.  The Deputy has spent the past ten or fifteen minutes discussing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt with it as it concerned personal taxation and the effects of personal taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be doing that, too. There is more affecting personal taxation than the rate at which it is collected, though that is obviously the most important part.  I could not accept that the Chair would confine me to using the same number of words or the same length of time as the Minister.  That would be most unfair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Frequently during the debates in December and during the budget debate there was reference to a 5 per cent inflation rate at the end of the year.  This figure was used again and again, particularly by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, but also by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  Evidently that <Col N="1773" /> meant that it was 1.25 multiplied by four, if that was the figure between mid-August and mid-November, giving an annualised rate of 5 per cent.  The impression taken&mdash;I am not sure whether it was meant to be given&mdash;was that the annual rate of inflation for 1979 would be 5 per cent.  This figure was used frequently during wage negotiations as an incentive to people to moderate wage demands. The Minister for Finance used the figure several times during his budget speech and referred to the necessity for wage moderation, saying that the increases of last year could not be repeated this year.  There had been a wages drift from the original figure of 5 per cent, which had been arrived at after great soul-searching and investigation by very competent people who decided this was the appropriate figure for the Irish economy in 1978.  Within days it had risen to 8 per cent and when the budget was introduced the Minister prefaced his remarks on pay policy by saying that the end-of-year inflation for 1979 would be 5 per cent.  He then said that last year the increase in wages had been 16 per cent and that obviously this was an inappropriate figure for 1979 and would not be justified again in current circumstances.</P>
      <P>Certainly the impression was given that the end-of-year inflation rate of 5 per cent, which would be less than the 7.6 per cent rate for the 12 months ending November 1978, would indicate that a proportionate decrease in the level of incomes for 1979 was required by the economy.  Only by some probing in the early part of this year was it discovered that this 5 per cent inflation rate at the end of the year was arrived at by multiplying by four what is prophesied to be the increase in inflation between mid-August 1979 and mid-November 1979. When that was established, people became suspicious of every figure produced by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Government's own interest it would be far better for them not to indulge in playing with words which appear to give the impression that they mean one thing and are tied to it, and that when they said the inflation rate would be 5 per cent that was what they <Col N="1774" /> meant.  When it was discovered that the rate would not be 5 per cent, the demand for more wages increased.  People are now looking to the Government for more than was offered in the tax reductions announced by the Minister in the budget.  Again to-day, the Minister referred to increasing the tax allowance for married couples by 102 per cent, or 104 per cent, or whatever the figure is.  He did not refer to the fact that everybody has moved into a higher tax band.  He did not refer to the fact that people with children will have a smaller allowance for income tax purposes.  He did not refer to the fact that the portions of social welfare contributions which were allowable for tax purposes are not allowable now.</P>
    <P>Some people have got correct tax assessments, but many more have not got correct assessments because of the postal strike.  One group of people told me that they are better off by 1p a week. In those circumstances, people feel they are being conned, or codded, or fooled, and that the Government are endeavouring to paint a picture with words which bears no relation to the reality of life as they know it.  That also applies to many other actions by the Government.</P>
    <P>We had a perfect example of that here today when the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy was answering questions about the oil crisis.  He is the hero on the white charger who took on the dragon of the oil companies in Holy Week, the villains who were robbing the Irish people of their rightful share of world oil.  He was a very much quieter boy here today.  He had to admit that it was his own laziness for three months which caused the crisis.  There was also his insulting behaviour in referring to the people of this country as criminals.  The Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy R. Burke, appeared on a television programme 48 hours before the Minister said the oil companies were doing the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy abused the public first and then the oil companies, and then it turned out that he was the one who should have been taking the abuse because he was too lazy to do anything.  There was a programme on RTE on Good Friday morning dealing with food prices.  The commentator had done a survey on prices between Easter 1978 and Easter 1979.

      <P>People are concerned about what they have left in their pockets when they have paid their bills. This woman said the price of meat went up by 35 per cent and the price of vegetables by 100 per cent.  Obviously people who find themselves so much out of pocket because of these huge price increases will look for relief in other directions. They want more relief under the tax code.  That is a normal reaction.  If the Minister is allowed to refer to that when he is replying he will say those figures were not arrived at in a scientific way.  I do not know how they were arrived at.</P>
      <P>The reality is that people know they are worse off this year than they were last year and that is why they are looking for relief under the PAYE system. That is the point I was making about the national understanding.  It will not be good enough for the Minister to say if certain conditions are met now he will give relief at the end of the year under the PAYE system.  He must say quite clearly that people are entitled to these reliefs and he will give them come hell or high water next December.  That would be a major step towards having the national understanding accepted.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I would be glad if you did not try to rule me out of order on this.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Such orders must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and should appear on the Order Paper. Is that not correct?  My understanding is that it should appear on the Order Paper but it does not so appear.  The Minister tells me that he has now signed this controversial 2 per cent levy.  This is something that should be included in the Finance Bill.  Certainly, it will mean revenue collecting.  It was dragged into a piece of legislation referring to oil, petrol and so on, where it had no relevance. The only explanation I can come up with why it should be introduced by ministerial order and not in the Finance Bill we are now discussing is because, if <Col N="1778" /> it had to be voted on in this House, Deputy Gibbons, the Minister for Agriculture, would not have voted for it. That must be the only explanation for it, and the Government had to see under what legislation they could drag in the 2 per cent levy.  That would save them the embarrassment of the Minister for Agriculture not going through the lobbies in favour of a tax on farmers.  Obviously, I cannot say whether that is correct or not, but it is reasonable to speculate that this is the reason why it was introduced by ministerial order and not by way of the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The farmers were given to 1 May to agree a system of taxation or accept the levy, which we are now told is being introduced today.  There is no doubt that the system of taxation announced last week by the Taoiseach and the national understanding referred to today by the Minister, due to be introduced perhaps in next year's budget or later on this year, contain provisions that will not be acceptable to at least some section of the farmers.  I shall just refer to one of them, because Fianna Fáil made such a fuss in Opposition and, indeed, since they came into Government about the wealth tax. However, they propose now to introduce under the changed name of a resource tax a wealth tax for just one section of the community, the farmers.  The farmers, having protested so vehemently for so long about the wealth tax being introduced by the previous Government, would be very foolish now to accept a wealth tax under another name from this Government, in fact, the basket of taxes announced last week and which the Minister said could be introduced some time later in the year.  Indeed, the first rumblings have come from the farming community on these taxes.  The Government, having bought off the farming community at the expense of PAYE workers, then buy off the PAYE payers by announcing, on the same day as the national understanding, a list of taxes on farmers that will certainly appear to the farming community to be extremely severe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the year are we going to see this Government again turning tail because of the farming community and <Col N="1779" /> backing down from these tax proposals? Is this something that the Government are hoping will help them to get the national understanding accepted by the unions and employers but which they have no intention of implementing? Time will tell.  We shall not know whether that is so until the discussions start with the farming organisations. I am certain that, if the Government think they can cod the farming organisations by bringing in a wealth tax and calling it a resource tax, they will get a very rude awakening throughout the summer.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is on Committee Stage I shall have a number of amendments to propose.  On section 2, I shall be proposing, as I proposed last year and as the Minister turned down because he said it was not practical, to introduce an amendment to index the tax band on the table at the top of page seven.  The Minister said last year that he could not accept this, that that would not be fair. Certainly, the Minister voted down that amendment.  Yet, later on in the same year, last October or November, he introduced amendments to the Capital Gains Tax Bill in this House.  One of the amendments the Minister introduced was indexation for people who make capital gains; in other words, that there would only be tax on real gains and not on the illusory gains brought about by inflation.  These gains by the ordinary taxpayer are exactly the same but they are of benefit to the Minister for Finance inasmuch as every year, when people get wage increases, they come into a different tax band and the Minister gets increased taxation.  Therefore, he does not have to come into this House and increase the level of taxation.  I want to stop that now, and the Minister knows and agrees that this is the correct thing to do.  When in Opposition the Minister introduced in Private Members' Time a motion to index the tax bands and allowances for all income tax payers. However, since he went into Government he has refused to accept this; but he does accept indexation of people under capital gains tax.  I want the Minister to do exactly the same for one form of <Col N="1780" /> gain, salary gain, as he does for another form of gain, capital gain.</P>
    <P>I shall certainly be looking to amend section 3 which reduces for 1979-80 the child allowance from £240 to £218. The Minister justifies this on the basis that he gave increased children's allowances. As I pointed out on the day of the budget, these children's allowances are very small and of very little benefit to people with large families.  One should not claim to give a relief in one case, take it off a few paragraphs further down and then say that one is doing something for families.  The Minister did not refer to the fact that he did not give child allowance increases last year.</P>
    <P>I certainly welcome section 4.  I shall be seeking to amend section 5.  I do not think it would be that difficult to apportion the amount of the pay related benefit in relation to health pensions and old age pensioners.  It has always been operated so that these people got £64 or £68 against their tax.  This is something which should be restored.  The Minister should also review the position where people in the private sector who are not under the Social Welfare Act pay for a pension.  They go to an insurance company and buy themselves a pension for age 65.  The premium they pay is allowable against tax.  Why should somebody who pays the same thing, a premium to the State, not be allowed the payment of that premium for tax relief as in the case of a person who buys it from a private company?  I would like to see that restored.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 7 of the Bill.  The provisions of this section are due to come in next year and the people receiving this money will have to be receiving a payment from an insurance company, health board or some other source and will be taxed on what they receive.  I would like the Minister to keep an eye on this section and to introduce an amendment to this section 7 or in next year's Finance Bill so that the people who are in receipt of an allowance at the time the Bill comes into operation&mdash;that is to say persons who become ill next January and are sick for six months overlapping the period in which the Bill comes into operation&mdash;would not go from a state of <Col N="1781" /> not being charged tax at the end of March next year to being charged tax during April of next year.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word or two about section 9.  This refers to taxing people who have preferential loans from banks, insurance companies and so on.  I will say some day that this was a just thing to do.  At the same time it was very untimely for the Minister to announce it in the middle of wage negotiations when bank employees are looking for increases for dealing with the complexity of the EMS.  I am not going to discuss this again, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am merely saying that the bank staffs are looking for an increase.  It is difficult to decide how people look on these things.  Do they accept that they should be paid less because they have this perk? Do the Government say that this is a perk that is available to nobody else, it is really a benefit in kind and therefore should be taxed as if it were part of their salary?  On that argument, very many people have perks of that nature.  Will the Minister next year drag somebody else into that category?  Soldiers and gardaí get uniforms.  CIE employees and Aer Lingus employees have free travel. To take it to the absolutely ridiculous, even Members of this House get subsidised meals.  Is the Minister going to drag all these people in and say, &ldquo;You all have some benefits in kind and we are going to tax them&rdquo;?  Will we have the absurd position whereby the meals we enjoy here are going to be considered a benefit in kind and will be taxed?  It was unwise to introduce that this year.  The people who enjoy benefits of this kind consider that if they are deprived of the benefits they are thereby accepting a lower salary for their services because part of what they are paid is involved in this preferential loan that they get.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say on the details of the Bill.  I will have a number of amendments to introduce later on.  I welcome the amendment contained in section 31 which allows the passing on to an illegitimate child.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) For the purposes of paragraph (a), an illegitimate child who has not, on or before the date of the disposal, been legitimated or adopted in the <Col N="1782" /> manner described in section 36 (a) (ii) of the Finance Act, 1977, shall, if the disposal is made to him by his mother on or after the 6th day of April, 1979, be the child of his mother.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to see if there is any danger of some illegitimate child being disadvantaged if his father wanted to make a gift to him in this regard. Perhaps this is covered under the Finance Act, 1977 or perhaps some regulation states in relation to these matters that &ldquo;mother&rdquo; means &ldquo;parent&rdquo;, whether male or female.  I ask the Minister to look into that before Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that others do not follow the same pattern.  It is said that those who sow the wind will reap the whirlwind and if ever this proved to be true it is now under the present Fianna Fáil Government.  When in Opposition they did not exactly say that there was no necessity at all to have tax but they went as far as they could in that direction.  They criticised any and every tax imposed by the previous Government. They went so far as to suggest that it was simply a matter of talking away taxes and that they could very well be done without.  This was the pattern they followed and the wind which they sowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming into this House on so many occasions and, as Deputy Barry mentioned, putting down motions in Private <Col N="1783" /> Member's Time to say what should or could be done and then refusing to do that when they took office is an example of the dishonest way in which the country has been run for the last two years.  The desperate unrest in the country at present has been brought on as a result of this activity of the present Government before they took office. While there have been comments about the motives of those who marched in the PAYE march some time ago, it was a fine day and a lot of people went out for a daunder.  It was a good-humoured march.  Nobody would say that about today's march.  It was raining hard, and anybody who likes to go outside the gates of this House even now can take a look to see how people who are paying PAYE feel about the way in which they are being treated by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is not so much the fact that tax is being put on to them but that it is unfair and accepted by so many people as unfair. If the Government were to make up their minds, as all Government in the past had to do, to bring in a budget, decide on taxation and stick to their guns, that would be acceptable.  Before the budget was introduced at all this Government proceeded to introduce minor budgets&mdash;Deputy Barry referred to this matter also&mdash;taking away something from people, putting on a little bit of extra taxation here and there and then introducing a budget which took nearly a record time to read out in this House.  Then within hours they backed down from that budget but not before the Minister for Finance and some of his colleagues, including the Taoiseach, had stated categorically that there was no way they would back down from it.</P>
    <P>They had hardly made those definite statements when they proceeded to back down very quickly.  We all look at the annual conferences of other parties on television, because we wish to see how the others are doing.  It was very interesting to note the proposed change in the 2 per cent levy which it was intended to introduce, the reception it got and the guarantee given by the <Col N="1784" /> Minister that that was the end of it and that there would be no change.  Then without any apology to anyone, it was found necessary to offer to change it. This is where I find the Biggest fault with the present Government.  I am amazed at the way they say they will do something and then change their minds.  While that may have been all right from some of the bright boys in the Cabinet before 1972, because they were known as kite fliers, it is not good enough from politicians who have been four years in opposition and are again back in Government, and who consider themselves to be senior politicians.  They should not suggest that certain taxation may be imposed and then back down as soon as somebody starts to talk.</P>
    <P>I lived in rural Ireland all my life, and I know how rural people operate.  I would not like to see a war between urban and rural peoples.  If ever a Government, through taxation, attempted to cause such a war, it is this Government.  I have had a unique experience in that I was on the workers' side and a party to a number of the first national wage agreements negotiated. On the Government side I was a party to agreements up to two years ago.  I can claim to have slight knowledge of the way in which these agreements are worked out and of the interpretation of them.  In the interests of the country I, like the previous speaker, hope that there will be a national agreement which will allow the people to live in peace and harmony and which will allow workers to have something with which to pay their shopping bills after taxation.  The Minister said in his speech:</P>
    <P>The additional special allowance for PAYE taxpayers which the Government have proposed under the national understanding, subject to certain conditions, is further evidence of the Government's active concern in this area.</P>
    <P>That phrase more than anything else will contribute to the rejection of the present proposal.  That says &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;.  The workers have been taken in too often by Fianna Fáil to accept the suggestion that if everything turns out all right they will get some <Col N="1785" /> money back.  That relates to even external matters which the workers cannot control.  It is obvious that the people who negotiated this agreement took an awful lot on trust.  From the workers' point of view, I, in my time as a trade union negotiator, would have found it extremely difficult to accept that, but as a member of the Government I would have been happy if I had got away with it.  It leaves the whole thing wide open.</P>
    <P>In this Finance Bill provisions are made to ensure that the people already carrying the main burden of tax will continue to carry it, but they are given the impression that they are getting something off, whereas the abolition of a tax band means that in many cases people are in a worse position than they were before.  The suggestion that this will help the taxpayer is illusory.  There will be substantial wage increases this year. That is accepted by everybody.  Immediately upon that the people who were taken out of the tax net will be brought back in at a higher rate.  There is no point in saying that 200,000 people are being taken from the tax net.  That is all cod, because they will all be back again at a higher level of taxation.  The whole thing is a bit of a farce.</P>
    <P>I and most farmers agree, that farmers should pay the same amount of tax as everybody else.  There is no reason why one section of the community should have to pay tax at a different level.  Down through the years many farmers, particularly small farmers, were unable to pay tax.  Many of these farmers are doing well at the moment and nobody begrudges them their wealth.  But they must now accept that they must pay their fair share of taxation. Perhaps the Government should introduce a system whereby farmers' incomes can be assessed in the same way as PAYE earners' incomes are assessed. The earnings of self-employed people ought also to be assessed in the same way.  Very often by keeping quite they can get out of paying tax.  If that were done there might be a general reduction in the rate of taxation.  Recently we tried to make up how much actual spending money a PAYE earner would have after taxation and everything else.  Even for the supposedly well off PAYE earner the <Col N="1786" /> amount of disposable income was pitiably small.</P>
    <P>This debate relates to the Finance Bill but practically everything people buy is affected by tax.  Nobody need tell me that I can go into a shop and buy something that is tax free.  The cost of bringing the goods to the shop from the place of manufacture is affected by the cost of fuel and the cost of production is also affected by it.  Right down along the line taxes upon taxes are added and the eventual buyer of a product pays the cumulative amount of tax.</P>
    <P>Comments were made about whether we would be able to continue to complete abroad if wages were too high.  Being aware of the rate of pay in most of the countries with which we complete, and being able to compare the cost of production in general, I see no reason why the situation here should not be very much better.  While the Chair rules that the EMS is not a subject for discussion here, surely the cost of production here, as affected by the EMS, must come under this Bill.  Surely the fact that Irish exporters are selling at a lower price and importers are importing at a higher price, is a matter that is covered in a general way by our taxation code.  The profits made by manufacturing companies are affected to a great extent by that item.  There are many companies who did not stamp insurance cards when that had to be done, they are not paying VAT and they owe the State many thousands of pounds.  Is any effort being made to deal with these people?  Recently I met three gentlemen and they were very critical of the way unemployed workers were getting what they called charity from the State.  I was very annoyed at their attitude as these three men had got substantial grants from the State because they were able to make a case that they needed them.  In two instances they were not able to make such a case.  In case the Chair should rule that that is out of order, I would point out that it is included in the provision of the money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In certain cases where employees tried to obtain social welfare benefits it was discovered that the insurance cards were not stamped.  When I made some further inquiries it transpired that VAT had not been paid either.  It would surprise many people to learn the amount of VAT that comes to the State eventually when refunds are taken into account.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance would be able to cut down on much of the paper work.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amount of money available to local authorities for road grants, according to the political views held by people they were prepared to claim that the situation showed a big improvement on the previous year, that slightly more was provided than in the previous year or that less was provided than in the previous year.  It was only when we succeeded in checking on the VAT that had been deducted from the road grants at local level to be resubmitted to the Minister for Finance that the amount of money was reduced substantially in every case.  We have the situation where, due to taxation and VAT being introduced for the first time, not only the county roads but also the national and primary roads are a disgrace and a danger.</P>

If we are going to talk about taxation we must be allowed to comment on what I consider to be very unfair taxation.  I do not think that money should be collected from local authorities by the State.  Where they are given it it should be left to them.</P>
      <P>Just before Easter I raised the matter of petrol and oil supplies.  The Chair made a ruling on that but I think I will be allowed to make this comment.  I asked the Ceann Comhairle for permission to raise the matter but he said it was not urgent and he was entitled to make that ruling.  I raised the question on the Adjournment and the Minister of State said it was not urgent.  Subsequently I was asked to go on a radio programme and I made the point that the Minister responsible should use his powers to ensure the flow of petrol and oil.</P>

The Government are responsible for what happens but in this Dáil when Fianna Fáil Ministers are asked questions they hang their heads and will not answer.  Taxes come from things that are sold and used throughout the country. The Government deliberately prevent such sales and therefore they are responsible for any shortfall in tax revenue. There is no point in their saying that the PAYE people or the farmers are not doing enough.  How much tax do we get from tourism?  Is it not true that tourism is falling flat this year, that there is not a hope of that industry being able to survive unless something is done quickly? The difficulty there has been caused because of the postal strike, because people cannot get through to the hotels to book their holidays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not attempting to make the House disorderly.  I have never done it and I do not propose to begin now.  I am trying to prove that there is no point in discussing the Finance Bill here if we are to be put in a situation like Rome burning while Nero fiddled.  That is the situation we are facing.  You have ruled both Deputy Barry and me out of order on the EMS and I am finding it very difficult to make certain points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1792" /> What does taxation amount to?  I know a social welfare recipient who paints. Not only is he unable to pay tax but he cannot live because he cannot earn enough money.  However, if he were a wealthy painter in this city, no matter where he had come from, he would not have to pay tax no matter how much money he earned because there seems to be one law for the rich and another for the poor.</P>
    <P>We have to face up to the situation as we see it.  People cannot afford to shop any more because of price increases granted by the NPC.  Yet in face of that we have been told that workers should not look for too much of an increase in their pay, that they would upset the country.  At the same time, the man with the expensive car, the big house and the expensive way of living has not anything extra to pay.  It is about time we faced up to this.  I was a trade union official for many years and I did not like strikes. They must be avoided if possible in the interests of the workers, but I would be the first to say that a worker must get enough to live on and he is perfectly entitled to take the advice given to him by his union.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this Bill to tax short-term social welfare benefits is retrograde and should not be implemented.  I am one Deputy who had the experience of finding himself unemployed and I know the degradation of having to try to live on unemployment benefit.  It is all right for people who always had full and plenty to talk.  They do not know the conditions in which the unemployed and the sick are living.  I am not in favour of this proposal, although I appreciate that certain contributory old age pensioners have a lot more money coming in than many of us in the House and that if they got away with it they would be laughing. I realise that if some old age pensioners, for instance, are employed by a local authority, something should be taken from them, but we must remember that the amount they are getting is very much less than what they were getting when they were employed.  It is unfair that we should try to force them to pay back more than they can afford.  During their lifetime they pay taxes and it is not right <Col N="1793" /> that they should be forced to pay them when they are no longer able to earn a wage or salary.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made by Deputy Barry to mortgage rates.  It might be said that that is not a matter for the Finance Bill but in fact it is.  I know from my period in office that the tax which building societies must pay to the State on the money which is loaned to them affects the mortgage rate.  Some effort will have to be made to rectify the situation. The promises made by Fianna Fáil are not the answer to the problem.  There must be some other way.  How can the Government expect young people who are getting married and who have to pay £4,000 or £5,000 for a site and £15,000, £16,000 or £20,000 to have a house built, to pay a mortgage at the present rates of interest?  The Government say that the EEC and the EMS and so on will eventually give us low mortgage rates, that we will be down to the 5 per cent or 3 per cent which they have in Germany and other places.  This is simply not happening and that is because this Government are not doing their job.  The Government might ask why we did not do it when we were in office. We came through the biggest recession seen in the last half century and succeeded in getting through it relatively unscathed.  It is no answer for Fianna Fáil now in an attempt to get away with this to point the finger at us.</P>
    <P>Another thing that I would be terribly afraid of is this phrase &ldquo;subject to conditions which are laid down&rdquo;.  It leaves the situation wide open for the present Government, if things are not going right when they are out of the present trouble&mdash;and it is trouble with two elections coming up&mdash;to introduce their supplementary budget and double up all around.  With their majority they can sit tight for a couple of years and hope that things will blow over.  What the Government are doing now on taxation is playing the two ends against the middle, attempting to get a solution&mdash;not a permanent solution, not even a short-term solution until the next year's budget&mdash;such that they will not have people complaining about the way they are being handled when it comes to 7 June.  In fact <Col N="1794" /> what the Government would say is that everybody will be expecting a little and the reference in page 2 is the obvious reference to that.  When the time comes they will say they are very sorry but because things did not turn out the way they hoped they will not be able to give anything.  That is the attitude of the Government.</P>
    <P>It is just too bad that we cannot get a straight answer when questions are asked.  It is just too bad that on radio, television or anything else we do not have certain key ministers who should be able to give answers not giving them because those Ministers just cannot be found.  They are missing.  They will not even turn up at functions in their own constituencies in case they would be asked questions.</P>
    <P>Taking one thing with the other it is quite obvious that this Finance Bill is hardly worth the paper it is written on.  It is being introduced simply to give the Government a breathing space until they are able to do what they really intend to do.  Anybody who wants the evidence as to whether or not that is correct has only to check back through the last six months, and more particularly the last three months, to see all the times that Fianna Fáil decided to do something and, when the chips were down, changed their minds and decided to do something else.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry asked why the question of the 2 per cent levy was not on the Order Paper today.  The reason it is not on the Order Paper is because this is a device which allows the Government to avoid discussing it.  It is the second time they have done that in the last two or three months.  They have kept an important item off the Order Paper and the reason for keeping it off is so that it will not be discussed in the House.  If it is on the Order Paper it can be discussed within 21 days; if it is not down it cannot be discussed here.  It is a matter which is of vital importance not alone to the big farmer who will be kicking up murder about it but to the small farmer.  It is of vital importance also to the old age pensioner who has a car and wants to sell it; before he gets anything the Minister for Finance must get his 2 per cent.  They will all have to pay their 2 per cent if it is <Col N="1795" /> operated.  We have so many people saying now that they will not collect, they will not participate, they will not agree. We have the meat factories talking about wholesale lay-offs and talking about the people they have already had to lay off.  We have people talking about a shortage in cattle and others talking about sending them across the Border where there will be no levy because it is at the factory gates that the levy is collectable.</P>
    <P>Where do we stand?  Do the Government really know what they are doing in regard to taxation or are they, as I suggested a few moments ago, just paddling along hoping that something will turn up, hoping that 7 June will come more quickly than it is coming and that they will be able to stall any serious action until after that date and when that happens they can do what they originally intended to do anyway?</P>
    <P>I am also informed by some of my colleagues in this House who got their pay cheques today that they got a rather rude shock when they looked at some of the deductions made.  Perhaps this is another way of getting an extra few shillings; it is not an awful lot of money but cumulatively it amounts to quite a lot.  I suggest that the Government should sit down and make a definite decision on the budget.  They should decide what they want to do and remember a former leader of the Fianna Fáil Party for whom I have great respect talking here about whether or not there should be a yearly budget or a twice yearly budget or if it would be better to plan for five years ahead.  Fianna Fáil have taken all the options. They have a yearly budget, and a twice yearly budget but they certainly are doing very little planning.  They are looking at it from every side and they are looking for some way in which they can get out of the problem which they got themselves into.</P>
    <P>The reason I did not bring in with me the Fianna Fáil manifesto, which I look at very ofter to tick off all the things that Fianna Fáil did not do&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is because when I look at it I realise how many untruths were offered to the people in it.  I did not bring it in because I felt sure that fairly quickly I would be ruled out of order.  It is only right that anybody who tries to talk about the manifesto should be ruled out of order because it has become nearly an obscene document, containing so many things that are blatently untrue and unfair and there is no possibility of its objectives being carried out.</P>
      <P>While on Committee Stage many comments will be made about this Bill not with much hope indeed of getting any changes made in it because we are always reminded of the majority that can put anything they like through&mdash;it is the duty of people like myself in this House to point out in a broad way what we consider is wrong with it.  We can leave the fine print to Committee Stage when we will have an opportunity of dealing with the Bill section by section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that until now people paying social welfare contributions were entitled to a tax remission if they were stamping a card.  They no longer stamp a card, they still pay social welfare contributions and they still have to pay tax on that as if it was an income.  As was pointed out earlier by Deputy Barry, there is the danger that little by little attempts may be made to take away things from one section, passing it on to the next and so on.  I remember the evening before the last general election talking to a large group of farmers who were rather anremember the solemn guarantees given by a couple of Fianna Fáil candidates present that, if they did not abolish it altogether, certainly they would not interfere with the multiplier or with the valuation limit.  Two years is an awfully long time in politics.  We have now this new round of taxation.  The Government must make up their minds to deal with taxation in the way in which it should be dealt.  Unless they decide what they want, surely nobody else can?  There have been many interpretations by the few Ministers who appear in public and make statements.  They state certain things and almost within 24 hours one of their colleagues will flatly contradict <Col N="1797" /> what was said.  I believe the bad habit was picked up from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development over the European Monetary System.  Not alone did they not know what was happening but they still do not know what is known by those attempting to operate the system.</P>
    <P>One other minor point&mdash;minor to most people&mdash;is the taxation proposed to be imposed on bank officials who are getting loans for certain reasons.  Most people refer to bank officials as if they were the wealthy of the country; of course they are people doing a job.  I should like to remind the Minister for Finance that, whatever about new loans, existing loans which are part of a trade union agreement and which have been written into such an agreement cannot legally be interefered with.  I have fairly lengthy experience of this.  While the Government may like to feel from time to time that they are the tough guys and may like to be tough with somebody when there are so many with whom they cannot be tough, certainly they laid it on the line there.</P>
    <P>I wish we had industrial peace in this country.  I hope there will not be a vendetta built up because of statements of representatives from one side or the other about whether there is mob rule or whatever obtaining&mdash;and people in glass houses should not throw stones.  I hope there will be no future trouble between country and town inhabitants.  This can be avoided only if it is seen by everybody that the Government are intent on giving everybody a fair deal.  So long as there is the position in which the State from day to day cannot make up its mind what it is going to do, then so long also will the danger of these troubles remain with us.  Our taxes would be more usefully employed if Ministers, Ministers of State and so on who are at present chasing around the world remained at home until such time as the country is going again.  After all, that is what we were promised before the last election.  Let us see some action from them now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I disagree <Col N="1798" /> with Deputy Tully, as he indicated I was likely to do.  He has said that this Bill is not worth the paper on which it is written.  I cannot agree with that sentiment in any respect.  One of the major objectives of the Bill is an increase in employment, the creation of 25,000 additional jobs in the coming year.  The Bill is geared also to an increase in output and towards a reduction in the burden on PAYE taxpayers, a matter which has been the subject of considerable discussion in recent times.  In this budget the Government have gone a step further in reducing that burden.  It is geared also to obtaining a fairer contribution from the farming and self-employed sectors.  The details of these objectives are outlined in the Bill and in the national understanding associated with it.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the Bill is related to the social policies of the Government as laid down in their White Paper.  Their principal social policy is to eliminate unemployment, to tackle the inequalities in our society, to encourage community development as far as possible, and to review the efficiency and effectiveness of our, administration, ensuring real, positive gains in incomes, particularly for those in the social welfare groups.</P>
      <P>The two previous speakers have been critical of the Minister for Finance in relation to this Bill and what he has done.  Objectively it is true to say&mdash;and will be seen by anybody looking objectively at the facts&mdash;that the present Minister for Finance has done more for the PAYE contributor and for equity than has anybody else in the past.  He has also achieved something extremely important in that connection: he has managed to keep inflation over the last year at the very reasonable level of just under 8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that the main thrust of his budgetary policy in 1979 is growth in employment.  If we do not accept this as being the main thrust of this Bill, then we will find ourselves at variance with its main provisions, because the Government have been consistent in adhering to the objectives of growth in employment and output.  It is easy to see why the Government have committed themselves so clearly and <Col N="1799" /> positively to this goal.  If we look at the numbers of children currently at school we will discover that almost one third of the population is in full-time education and that between 50,000 and 60,000 young people leave our educational establishments annually in search of employment.  The Government recognise this as one of the major social evils and difficulties of our time while also constituting one of our greatest assets and opportunities.  Consequently, this Bill is geared to the provision of employment needed by these young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister is his statement made reference to the &ldquo;National Understanding for Economic and Social Development&rdquo; announced last week. Deputy P. Barry and Deputy Tully made appeals for the removal of the two conditions mentioned in connection with the £175 additional tax-free allowance to be paid in December next.  Presumably, if they are to be paid in December the revised tax certificates will have to issue about October.  The argument they make is that if people are to receive this extra £39 million they are entitled to it and it should be given to them now.  Deputies Barry and Tully have missed the point of this measure as introduced.</P>
    <P>When a Minister for Finance at the beginning of a year prepares his plans and targets it is clear that neither he, the trade union representatives nor the employers know exactly what the outturn of that year will be.  My understanding is that although increases in wages over 15 months of the order of 15 per cent have been agreed, with additional measures, nevertheless the Government have said that if we achieve our targets this year they are prepared to give us a bonus or rebate at the end of the year.  Many people in recent days decried this concept because it is related to performance but if we are not prepared to relate our activities to performance there is little hope for us and few can have confidence in us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is related to the Government's performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is related to the general <Col N="1800" /> performance of the economy.  I am prepared to accept a bonus on the basis of performance of a Deputy in the House.  However, it would be difficult to measure the performance of a Deputy in the House.  If the economy goes well in any year public servants do not receive a bonus.  Admittedly, they will benefit by virtue of the fact that the base for the next year will be a better one as a result of the success of the economic plans during that year, but public servants do not benefit in bonus terms as those involved in industry do.  We are all aware that if plans go well in an industry there is a fair chance that the workers will get an extra week's wages and, in some cases, an extra two weeks' wages at the end of the year.  There is no such performance-related measure in the public service.</P>
      <P>There is considerable merit in such a measure in which our general performance during the year can merit an additional bonus.  It is an incentive, admittedly a small one, to public servants to assist exporters and industrialists to achieve their targets in employment, output and productivity.</P>
      <P>I am aware that this concept is reasonably common and successful in countries like Japan, not necessarily in the form of tax rebates but in other forms.  Are we afraid to attempt any new concepts after reaching an agreement?  It has been stated that if this agreement works the Government will give £39 million in tax concessions.  In a full year that will amount to £50 million.  Are we not prepared to attempt such measures? Are we too conservative to see a possibility in such measures or, as Deputy Barry stated, do we feel that people are entitled to this rebate anyway and there should not be any relation to performance? In my view there should be a relation to performance if we are to provide the jobs for the children who will be coming on the employment market over the next 10 years.  There must be a relation to performance if we are to succeed in the EMS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I like the concept and its dependence on two conditions is the minimum requirement that could be asked for.  One of those conditions is that the budgetary <Col N="1801" /> position in the last quarter of the year is reasonably in line with expectations. That is reasonable and it does not tie anything down to percentages or ask too much of anybody.  It merely states that we are dependent on our performance together as trade unions, employers and Government.  The buck stops here now because the punt is with us.  We cannot say, as was stated so frequently in the past, that if the English pound is devalued or changes we have to follow. In the EMS we have been maintaining our own stability and progress is within our own ambit.  The Government are saying that the budgetary position should be reasonably in line with expectation and have also told us that funds needed for employment creation, the first priority, will be made available.</P>
    <P>I understand that the employers and the Government will contribute 50 per cent each of the funds suggested, to be deducted on a certain basis during the year.  If the national understanding goes ahead those funds will be available automatically.  I do not see what those who criticise the national understanding are talking about.  They are trying to run away from reality, a reasonable option which has been offered.  I was amazed to hear the two leading Opposition speakers saying that they would like to see the Minister remove the latter two conditions.  They missed the novel concept of it.  If we are interested in the economy, national development and in the jobs we have heard so much about we should be prepared to try this concept. I am sure all our people would be pleased to receive an additional bonus at the end of the year, given that the economy will perform broadly in line with expectations.</P>
    <P>The national understanding also guarantees living standards in that workers will be automatically compensated for price rises above the 7 per cent which is provided in the package.  That represents a major step forward.  In addition to the 7 per cent there is provision for a 1 per cent rise for each 1 per cent increase in prices up to 11 per cent and ½ per cent for each 1 per cent after that.</P>
    <P>Some of the media and the papers in particular pointed out that the national <Col N="1802" /> understanding was a well worked out document and that it is a very valuable supplement to the Finance Bill before us today.  As the Minister said, this will be brought into force by an amendment on Committee Stage, particularly to cater for the special allowance of £175 being made.  It is interesting to note that this allowance will also apply to a working wife.  There will be two allowances in the case of a working husband and wife.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the two previous speakers and find it very difficult to accept their arguments.  The Minister has stressed that this Bill is geared towards growth in employment.  As well as the measures in the Bill the Government have also, through the national understanding, undertaken to establish national hire and enterprise agencies to ensure that the employment targets are reached.</P>
    <P>When we talk about people being entitled to certain things we have to think of where we stand in Europe.  Deputy Barry said that the main interest of people is the money in their pockets, their take-home pay.  I agree with him in relation to that, but people are also concerned with what that take-home pay will purchase.  When we look at the gross domestic product <i>per capita</i> of people employed in Ireland and in England and compare that with West Germany and the Netherlands, we find that over the last five years we have been doing very well compared with the UK.  We have been closing the gap considerably.  Our increase has been 73 per cent over the period 1972-77, while the UK increase was 58 per cent.  They are still left higher than us because they started at a higher point.  If we take the mean of the UK and Ireland we find that the increase over that period was 3,700 dollars per person employed.  The comparison with the UK is very good but when we look at our friends in Germany and the Netherlands we find that the increase there over the same period was 12,000 dollars.  People just cannot say they are entitled to an increase.  They are entitled to it if they work for it.  We must be prepared to work.</P>
    <P>West Germany and the Netherlands <Col N="1803" /> are currently growing in wealth at two and a half times the rate of the average of Ireland and the UK.  We have linked ourselves with the EMS and have brought in a high degree of exchange rate stability.  If we want to enjoy the levels of wealth and income on the Continent we must be prepared to raise our productivity and output in line with our possibilities.  We have to see our national understanding not alone within our own context but in the much broader context of Europe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry and Deputy Tully referred to the removal of the 20 per cent income tax band.  Deputy Barry said that the outcome was that everybody now pays more.  This is not true because the allowances were increased.  He did not mention that the reliefs given in the budget have removed 40,000 taxpayers from the tax net, 21,000 married people and 19,000 single people.  The single person's allowance was increased by 68 per cent and the married person's allowance was increased by 103 per cent, which was more than doubled in two years.  One would think, when listening to the Opposition speakers, that the Minister had done very little in this connection.</P>
    <P>I asked a question on 13 March last about the change in allowances which has taken place and was given the information that the allowance for a single person in 1973-74 was £299, in 1974-75, £500, 1975-76, £575, 1976-77, £620, 1977-78, £665, 1978-79, £865, and 1979-80, £1,115.  It is quite clear from those figures that the annual rate of increase in 1975-76 was £75, in 1976-77, £45, 1977-78, £45, 1978-79, £200 and 1979-80, £250.  During the first two years for which the present Minister for Finance was responsible the rate of allowance for a single person was increased by £450 whereas in the last two years of Coalition the increase was £90. The Minister for Finance has increased the tax-free allowance for a single person during his first two years in office by five times the rate the Coalition Minister increased it in their last two years in office. This does not include the extras that are raised in the national understanding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1804" /> With regard to allowances for a married couple during the same period they were in 1973-74, £494; 1974-75, £800; 1975-76, £920; 1976-77, £1,010; 1977-78, £1,100; 1978-79, £1,730 and 1979-80, £2,230.  If we make the same comparison for the first two years the Minister for Finance has been responsible for, including the provisions made in the Finance Bill, we find the allowance for a married couple has increased by £1,130.  For the previous two years for which the Coalition were responsible, there was an increase of £180, £90 each year.</P>
    <P>The figures show that this Minister has done more than anyone else.  I am not saying that we have achieved all that is desired or that there are not other ways in which the taxation system could or should be varied; but I am saying that the Minister has done more in his two years as Minister for Finance than anyone else did previously, especially if compared with the two previous years. The increases for married couples with two or three children are recorded in the answers given to parliamentary questions on Tuesday, 13 March 1979.  The Minister has been making substantial progress in easing the burden on these people.  That is his firm commitment and he is pursuing that objective in this Bill. Combining these tax allowances with the measures in the national understanding of a 15 per cent increase over the next 15 months, if inflation can be kept down to the levels given in the targets for 1979 there is every reason to expect that there will be real increases in income in the coming year.</P>
    <P>There are various other measures in the Bill which I welcome.  In section 1 the income limit for a dependent relative tax allowance will in future be automatically equal to the personal rate of social welfare contributory old age pension payable to a person aged 80 or over and living alone.  The limit for 1979-80 will be £1,129.  This measure is welcomed by everyone.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 relate to increased personal allowances and the amendments of those allowances.  The Minister has been making considerable progress in improving these allowances while at <Col N="1805" /> the same time keeping the value of the pound at a reasonable level through a low rate of inflation.  Children's allowances have been a source of considerable comment, and rightly so, because they are extremely important.  I, and many other Deputies, am aware of the importance and the effect of these allowances.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided a 28 per cent increase in expenditure on children's allowances, which is very welcome.  The increase for the first child is 52 per cent, from £2.30 to £3.50 per month; for the second child it is 34 per cent; and for the third and subsequent children it is 14 per cent.  For a family with five children this is equal to a 22 per cent increase.  A mother of three children will receive an extra £3.25 per month, or a 29 per cent increase.  I welcome these increases but in future I should like the Minister to introduce some differentiation, with higher rates of increases for children between 12 and 18 years of age, because at that stage these children are growing and consuming large amounts of food.  Consequently, this is a very expensive period of their lives.  Perhaps the Minister would take up this suggestion.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for an additional personal allowance of £250 for a parent who is widowed, deserted, separated or unmarried, with a dependent child resident with him or her.  This measure is welcomed by all Deputies and I should like to record my particular welcome for it.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for relief in respect of the labour element of expenditure of householders on the improvement and maintenance of their residences.  We should be looking more closely at such measures to see how they can be put into operation.  The relief in 1979-80 is confined to expenditure in excess of £50 and the maximum amount which would qualify for relief is £450.  I note from the Minister's speech that this scheme will apply to, among other things, insulation. I was particularly glad to see the introduction of this measure, which it is hoped will contribute towards job creation and energy conservation.</P>
    <P>I was also interested to note in the Minister's speech something which I had <Col N="1806" /> not known previously, that is, that included in this scheme is not only the maintenance of residences but also the maintenance of gardens.  This is a very interesting measure.  I do not think anybody realises that this measure exists; I am not sure if it has been spelt out in detail previously.  It offers the opportunity to improve landscaping and amenities throughout the country, particularly in city areas, and to improve gardens, residences and to provide employment at the same time.  I hope this measure will be recognised and availed of.  A figure of £450 is considerable and offers a great deal of scope for development in that area.  This is an area in which we have not been outstanding, probably because we have always had it too easy.  We have beautiful countryside and surroundings but we did not have to work very hard to preserve or develop them.  Because of the expansion of our cities and towns people are realising that, if action is not taken quickly, a great deal of that beauty will be completely lost.</P>
    <P>There is considerable scope for this sort of development, and I would welcome it.  We tend to be a little on the mean side when it comes to the planting of large trees and shrubs.  If one goes to other developed countries one finds that the transplanting of much larger trees and shrubs is a speedy way of improving the environment.  Perhaps this measure could, if used properly, lead to much greater development in this area.  We are very competent in production in this area and it could lead to considerable exports if it were developed.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 deal with income tax relief in respect of personal interest.  I am glad that figure on which full relief in respect of interest on borrowings can be claimed has been increased to the equivalent of a figure of £20,000, which represents a figure of £2,400, as the maximum amount of personal interest which can qualify for income tax relief. This is an important measure from the householders' point of view.  It keeps pace with the changing costs of the normal semi-detached or reasonably priced dwelling.  It is a development which will be welcomed by young people and <Col N="1807" /> newly-married people setting up homes.</P>
    <P>I should like something to be done in relation to savings.  The figure for savings last year of £65 million was a record.  I should like to see where that figure came from.  Most of it came from the farming sector, where the new income provided a flow of cash, a great deal of which would have gone into short-term savings for future development. It is true to say that 1978 was a record year for savings, but it cannot have been a record with the ordinary householder in the city area whose savings would be very small.  There is still an allowance of £70 for the husband and £70 for the wife on interest earned on bank deposits or loans.  People are reaching a stage where they will be prepared to save a proportion of their disposable income.  I should like to see people encouraged to save in the bank and by way of national loans. Interesting saving certificates are available under the post office system.  I should like to see an improvement in the allowances for savings.  I do not know if there is any technical reason why this should not be done.  There would be a greater increase in savings if we had such allowances and I mentioned this point during the budget debate.</P>
    <P>When I was in Japan recently at a conference I inquired about savings policy there.  I found that it is a major factor in the Japanese approach to investment. Major benefits are given for saving.  I heard some commentators say recently that they regard this kind of interest as unearned income and consequently it should be taxed very heavily.  I should like to see families encouraged to save £5,000 or £10,000 as security for themselves.  We are nearing the time when that should be possible.  It would also provide a great deal of money for investment in our economy.  I welcome the step the Minister has taken and suggest that this aspect of savings should be considered in future Bills.</P>
    <P>Chapter II deals with the question of taxation of farming profits.  This is an area which caused a great deal of controversy recently and Deputy Barry had several comments to make on it.  He did <Col N="1808" /> not say what he might have said and that is that, despite all that was said in between, the 2 per cent levy is still there. People seems to think it has vanished.  If one reads carefully the Minister's and the Taoiseach's statements at the time of the budget, one realises that it was intended to be a short-term measure.  It was a supplementary measure to the normal taxation.  This is a point which did not come across to people.  The Minister outlined all the additional taxation and said he wanted a better distribution of taxes and a larger share from the farming sector up to a certain percentage of income.  He also said that he was proposing an additional and separate measure to bring in this money.  In proposing that, the Minister said he was prepared to discuss an alternative package with the farming community, because it was an unusual supplementary measure.  However, the Minister's principal requirement was to bring in the amount of money which would ensure a better distribution of taxation overall within our society.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned that the incomes in the agricultural sector have improved. Farmers have passed from a very difficult position five or six years ago to one of a reasonable standard of living and are now in a position to make a fair and reasonable contribution to the overall budgetary requirements.  In the budget the Minister changed the threshold of liability from £60 rateable valuation to £40 and he changed the multiplier under the notional system from 19 to 125.  He also made a number of other changes at that time.  As we all know, the Minister has announced, as part of the national understanding, that a new package will apply from next year which will ensure that a fair and reasonable contribution will be made. The package will bring the threshold down to £40 poor law valuation and will mean that the notional system will be gone entirely.  It will introduce a resource tax of £3.50 per £1 of poor law valuation over £70 poor law valuation, which is a very reasonable level at which to introduce it.  It will mean that the taxes to be taken from the farming sector will be due from 1 September of the current year.  In the meantime, until that <Col N="1809" /> package comes in, the 2 per cent levy will go ahead and, indeed, has gone ahead as from to-day.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried to be as fair, as reasonable and as patient as he could. He has been misunderstood, and perhaps some people set about to misunderstand what he is attempting to do. If one reads what was said, 1 May was the date by which these final agreements had to be made.  It is clear that the 2 per cent was there and it is in operation as of now.  Consequently, the Minister has maintained his responsible approach to the problem, which, we all must admit, is not an easy one.  Nevertheless, the Government have said that we must face up to the question of a fairer spread of taxation and it can be clearly seen that that is what is being done.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for the exemption from tax of payments made to employers under the Employment Incentive Scheme and Employment Maintenance Scheme.  Again, this is totally consistent with the Governmen't approach throughout the budget and other measures that have been taken, whether the EMS or the Finance Bill here today.  Anything that can reasonably be done to improve employment, given the very substantial employment targets that we have, will be done by the Government.  That is a consistent aim which can be clearly seen and I welcome this measure in that it may give a further incentive to employers to participate in these schemes.</P>
    <P>Chapter VI is concerned with anti-avoidance. We should all be quite clear about the fact that the Minister is committed to reducing avoidance and evasion of tax and ensuring that all sectors pay a fair share.  This is again a difficult task, because when one comes to the self-employed or the business sectors there are different norms and different situations to be faced in assessing profit or real income.  The steps taken recently by the Minister will go a long way towards ensuring that the various sectors make a reasonable and correct contribution and that avoidance and evasion are kept at the lowest possible level.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in one statement made recently that the kinds <Col N="1810" /> of income in different sectors as recorded by the Revenue Commissioners would be made public, not mentioning the individuals concerned but giving an idea so that people can clearly see levels of income in different types of employment in different sectors.  Here also the Minister, in a further effort to counter evasion where it occurs, is aiming at the highest reasonable level of transparency.  This is necessary because there is at present a great deal of misunderstanding about who pays what and what they pay for.  In fact, a number of self-employed people have come to me who claim&mdash;and I believe them&mdash;to be paying their full and fair share of tax and yet they are being berated by their neighbours.  One man was quite upset. He believes it is essential to keep himself straight and right in connection with taxation, because if one goes wrong and is discovered, the Revenue Commissioners can go back for a number of years and cause one great trouble.  Yet, in attempting to keep himself right, he recognised and mentioned to me the fact that the two neighbours who complained to him worked in semi-State organisations and regularly did &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; in the evenings in respect of which he is quite certain they are not paying income tax.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that we should come down to this level of one neighbour fighting with the next about what they are paying or not paying.  We need a fair, reasonable and transparent system, a system that can be seen to be fair and to work and which will give the best possible allowances depending on circumstances. The Minister has gone some of the way in this regard and I am confident that he is convinced that it is one of his major targets and will continue to be such.  The much quoted manifesto makes the point that every effort will be made by the Fianna Fáil Government to improve take home pay, particularly through improved tax free allowances, so that when a person works it is more encouraging and valuable because of the amount of money he can take home.</P>
    <P>Many other questions arise regarding taxation.  Some people are quietly raising one question while others are afraid of it, and that is the question of how the money is spent and administered.  We <Col N="1811" /> must be constantly concerned and vigilant to ensure that our administrative structures are such that those who administer the finance of the State have every opportunity to do so effectively and efficiently.  The Committee on State Sponsored Bodies are currently examining the situation in regard to these bodies and this is something about which the Government and Members of the House are naturally concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill offers considerable progress in regard to the development of our financial and economic affairs.  It contains numerous measures which are valuable and, taken together with the national understanding, I think it offers a very good package to both workers and employers for this year, and for the next 15 months in respect of the national understanding. If we could cease focusing on one another and concentrate on national economic development and progress, perhaps we could together make a bigger cake or&mdash;to change the metaphor&mdash;as has often been said, make more blades of grass grow where one grew before and generally stimulate our economy making the fullest possible use of our tremendous asset of young people, about whom this debate should really be.  It is their future that we consider and discuss, their jobs that are in question when we talk of how much we are prepared to accept and whether we are entitled to something or not.</P>
    <P>Overall, we must bear in mind that the Government kept inflation down below eight per cent last year and are committed to keeping it at that type of level for the current year.  If they do that, these measures are all very valuable because the tax free allowances we get are meaningful.  However large tax free allowances may be, if inflation is not kept under control and if economic development and real gain in national wealth are not progressing, we gain nothing.  I am confident of the future because I know the Government are tackling comprehensively the development of the economy and it is within the framework of this comprehensive task that this Bill must be seen.  I wish to record my own tribute to the employers and the <Col N="1812" /> members of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who have been entirely consistent, in my view, throughout recent months of debate and criticism and upheaval. This shows clearly that those people who are sitting around the table are very conscious of the real task facing the Government and of the real determination of the part of the Government to pass on, to workers in particular, the benefits of our economic development. The responsible attitude being adopted by the Government is clear.</P>
    <P>One of our major problems is that the same degree of understanding does not permeate much more widely through our society.  Perhaps some of the blame lies with us as public representatives who so far have failed to convince the people generally of what the Government, the trade unions and the employers are attempting to do.  The degree of responsibility shown by the ICTU has been high having regard to the noises that are being made.  Perhaps we should be doing more to ensure that people further down the line and further away from the focal point have a better understanding of what is being attempted by those with whom rests the ultimate responsibility. There may be a real problem here.  If there is not I fail to understand some of the statements that are being made currently such as the statements that we have had from Deputies Barry and Tully in relation to the national understanding and to the two clauses concerning the tax rebate of £175 at the end of the year. This rebate represents a very welcome and novel measure.  If people realised what is the intention and also how easy it is to achieve the performance targets that we have set ourselves they would be more inclined to co-operate in this regard.</P>
    <P>In principle the national understanding is a mechanism for further participation in the future on the part of all employees and taxpayers in the overall growth and development of our economy.  We are all committed to and involved in this growth.  All of us either contribute or take from it and I would prefer to see us contribute and in this way living and working together more happily.  The economy is in good order. It is in good hands.  I congratulate the <Col N="1813" /> Minister not only in regard to this Bill but in respect of the measures he has taken recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Today is significant, not only because it is May Day but because it is also the day of the second big protest by PAYE workers.  Both are inter-related.  Is it not significant, also, that today we should begin debating the Finance Bill?</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to Deputy Woods.  To say the least I was amused to hear him say that the economy is in good shape.  I suggest that in the hands of this 84-seat Government the country is almost on its knees.  I almost had to beg for sufficient petrol today to enable me to reach Dublin to speak on this Bill. If some of those Deputies who are oozing with confidence regarding the economy were living in some of the more remote parts of the country such as Donegal, west Cork, Clare or Kerry, they would realise that the situation is very different from the picture painted by them.</P>
      <P>The oil situation is causing havoc not only to car owners but to industrialists. We have neither a postal nor a telephone service.  The tourist trade is in ribbons. In regard to sickness benefit, if anybody concerned is claiming his payments from Great Britain he will not have been able to receive any money for the past seven or eight weeks.  Despite this situation there are Fianna Fáil backbenchers who have the audacity to talk about this great economy which is in the hands of this magical 84-seat Government.  People who talk in these terms are being completely hypocritical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not my intention to begin my speech on those lines but I had no option after listening to speakers from the Government side.  This Bill is farcical because of the numbers of times that the budget to which it relates has been changed.  One change relates to the 2 per cent levy in respect of farm produce sales.  This proposal was changed before the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  After that event we were told that it was decided not to go ahead with the levy and now it is to be implemented.  Is this what government is all about?  If the Government introduce measures they should <Col N="1814" /> abide by them regardless of whether they prove popular to Fianna Fáil backbenchers and to the grassroots of that party.</P>
    <P>I have never known a budget to be changed before in so many respects.  The changes have been major ones and have been made in an effort to satisfy some members of the community but instead of achieving their objective they have proved to be only a hornet's nest throughout the country.  One of the hopes in respect of this Bill is the achievement of full employment.  The Government must be criticised on their failure, particularly in the west, the south-west and the north-west of the country to create employment.  Certainly there has not been any new industry set up in my area during the past two-and-a-half years.  Perhaps 25,000 jobs have been created but what has happened to those tens of thousands who have been made redundant in the meantime?  Our unemployment figure represents a 9.9 per cent national average but the situation is worst in my county where the figure is 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>We all agree with the desire and the necessity to reduce unemployment, with the necessity to increase the net number of jobs, but this is not happening in most parts of the country.  The postal strike has continued for much too long and I join with the many other Deputies who have appealed for a settlement of the dispute. This strike must be costing the country many millions of pounds.  It is only now that it will begin to affect the Exchequer purse because, for instance, people cannot return their PAYE forms. Neither can VAT returns be forwarded to the Department.  Grants are not being paid and the position is the same in respect of headage money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We must not debate the postal strike now when what is before us is the Finance Bill which deals only with taxation. Other Deputies have been reminded of this several times already today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, industrialists and other businessmen cannot post their VAT returns.  I should like to know if the Minister for Finance has given any <Col N="1815" /> thought to gathering the large amount of VAT which must be outstanding at present.</P>
      <P>I have heard many backbenchers talking about the great increases given to the PAYE sector.  During the budget debate I mentioned that the 20 per cent rate had been replaced by a 25 per cent rate. Even allowing for the increases in tax allowances for single and married people, the PAYE sector did not get a net increase. The increases in food prices have not been taken into consideration in relation to taxation.  Only a few weeks ago the increase in food prices of more than 16 per cent was given great publicity. The increase in tax allowances for single and married persons does not make up for the increased food prices.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods quoted large percentages when he talked about the increase in the children's allowances and in the income tax allowances.  If he talks to the people at grassroot level, he will find that people are dissatisfied with our taxation system.  We should consider the introduction of a fairer system of taxation. Those in State and semi-State employment have no way of avoiding the tax net although many people manage to avoid it.  The Department of Finance should consider the question of tax evasion when they are introducing an increase in tax allowances for the PAYE sector.  I believe that the PAYE sector will continue to march until they are treated fairly.</P>
      <P>People on unemployment benefit have been given only a 12 per cent increase and pensioners have been given only a 16 per cent increase.  These increases are small in relation to the inflation rate, which even the Minister for Economic Planning and Development now admits will run into double figures by the end of 1979.  If inflation doubles, the pensioners and the unemployed will have to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the 2 per cent farm levy, it was interesting to hear the previous speaker talking about a resource tax on the farming community.  So far, I have not heard Paddy Lane or any other member of the farming organisations talking about this resource tax.  The <Col N="1816" /> previous speaker said that the 2 per cent levy would be operational only until next year's budget when it would be replaced by a resource tax of £3.50 on every £1 land valuation over £70.  He also said that the threshold, which was reduced this year from £60 to £50, will be reduced next year from £50 to £40. Deputy Woods seems to have inside information on next year's budget.  I suggest that the figure of £70 is only the start and that it will be reduced to £40. This means that those with land valuations of £40 and upwards will have to keep books and will have to pay income tax on anything in excess of £40 plus a tax of £3.50 on every £1 increase in valuation.  To date we have not heard too much from the farming organisations in regard to the resource tax.  I have always said that the farmers should pay their fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>In my county the Government are considered to be a disaster.  The tourist trade is poor this year; petrol is scarce; the fishermen cannot get diesel fuel for their boats.  The Department of Finance should ensure that counties like Clare, Galway, Kerry and Donegal are not left without petrol and oil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann aware of the promises of the Government contained in pages 10 and 11 of the Fianna Fáil Manifesto relating to prices to:</P>
      <P> (i) restructure the National Prices Commission;</P>
      <P>(ii) discourage increased costs and prices in all areas where it has control and influence;</P>
      <P>(iii) investigate middle men's margins;</P>
      <P>(iv) fully disseminate, at least once a week, to radio, television and newspapers comparative prices of supermarket consumer goods;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" /> (v) abolish the seven day rule arising out of the outer UK zone in respect of fuel price increases;</P>
    <P>(vi) investigate why Northern Ireland prices are less&mdash;apart from tax reasons&mdash;than prices in the Republic for the identical product from the same supplier and the same factory, for example motor cars, parts, tyres, detergents, processed foods, biscuits, clothing, and</P>
    <P>(vii)  examine the accounting procedures of the ESB with a view to reducing the price of electricity&mdash;</P>
    <P>Notes the continued failure of the Government to take decisive action in these areas after almost two years in office;</P>
    <P>further notes the recent sharp increase in food, housing, fuel and other commodity prices sanctioned by the Government and condemns this abject failure of the Government to implement its election promises on prices. </P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion and debate is to bring to the attention of the public that quite a number of the soft options in regard to prices and inflation, which were rather glibly handed out by this Government prior to the last election, have not in reality been achieved.  I have no illusions whatsoever about the very considerable difficulty which has faced every Government of this country in their efforts to moderate, not to mention control, price increases.  I am acutely aware, as is every responsible Deputy, that very often one man's wage increase can result in another man's price rise. Notwithstanding these factors, we must examine carefully the assurances given by the Fianna Fáil Party prior to the last general election that they would exert a major influence on the price situation, particularly in relation to food products. I am quite certain that the conclusion this House should come to, which undoubtedly has been reached by people outside, is that the Government have not been particularly successful in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1818" /> During the election campaign Fianna Fáil canvassers went from door to door with the famous gospel&mdash;not the manifesto, which was rather large for digestion&mdash;in the form of a handbook called the &ldquo;Fianna Fáil Canvasser's Guide for 1977&rdquo;.  It is rather interesting to quote the section on prices and a couple of questions in that guide.  It is stated that the following are some of the typical questions which the electorate would ask:</P>
    <P>Isn't it just wishful thinking that Fianna Fáil can keep inflation at bay in the world situation?</P>
    <P>No. Much of our inflation has been caused by the government's own action, i.e., a quarter of last year's price increases was directly inflicted by the Coalition in the 1976 budget and this was apart from increases in transport fares, phone charges and other increases inflicted after the budget.</P>
    <P>Another question is as follows:</P>
    <P>Will Fianna Fáil put VAT back on food?</P>
    <P>No. On the contrary, Fianna Fáil is in favour of food subsidies which reduce the price of every-day foods and we pressed the Coalition to introduce them for the best part of a year before they finally did so.</P>
    <P>So goes on the famous canvasser's guide which was trotted out on every doorstep. Inflation would, in effect, be controlled rigorously by the Fianna Fáil Party.  On the assumption that we have elections about every four years, we are now half way through the term of office of Fianna Fáil and there is massive dissatisfaction with and genuine concern at consumer level about the major increases in food prices in recent months.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Horgan, put down a question on 21 March relative to food price increases and the answer given was that between mid-May 1977 and mid-February 1979 the increase in the cost of food items in the CPI was no less than 23.3 per cent, as against an overall increase in the CPI of 15.6 per cent.  I do not deny that prices increased by about 22 per cent when we were in office in the midst of a world economic recession when the price of oil was rocketing every month.  Now, in a period of relative calm on the European scene <Col N="1819" /> in terms of inflation, Fianna Fáil can still record an increase in the food price index of no less than 23.3 per cent.  As every housewife knows, between mid-May 1977 and mid-February 1979 there was a 30 per cent increase in the retail price of bread.  This is quite phenomenal. In the midst of a most appalling world situation, the Coalition did not manage to increase the price of bread by 30 per cent.  In the period mid-May 1977 to mid-February 1979 butter increased by no less than 29.1 per cent and the retail price of milk increased by a staggering 43.7 per cent during the period of the present Administration.</P>
    <P>We all know that about 60 per cent of inflation is imported.  There is a limit to which any Administration can control inflation but I do not recall increases of that magnitude hitting the housewife. These increased prices have caused consumer aggravation and anger against the Government.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question I put down for today I learned that, since mid-May 1977, the average price of beef increased by 25p per lb. and the price of potatoes increased by no less than 30p per stone. Politicians take a fairly jaundiced view of the propaganda of others but any politician who believes his own propaganda is rather foolish.  I remember the thousands of circulars which were distributed in Dún Laoghaire describing the Coalition Government's shopping basket and alleging horrific increases in prices, the implication being that the Fianna Fáil Party would get to grips with that problem.  Notwithstanding the fact that Fianna Fáil returned to office in a period of economic and social growth after the recession in the economy, they failed to come to grips with some of the major increases in commodity prices.</P>
    <P>One thing which affects families most is the price of foods.  I learned today that, since mid-May 1977, under this Administration the price of bread went up by 7p a loaf, the price of cheese went up by 7.4p per lb., the price of sugar went up by 7½p per kilo and, as we all know, the price of butter went up by 8p a lb.  Under the Coalition Government <Col N="1820" /> the price of potatoes went up by 37p in four years.  It increased by 30p under Fianna Fáil in two years.  Leaving aside the impact of the recession, the Fianna Fáil Party cannot be particularly proud of their record.</P>
    <P>We made a genuine effort to restructure the National Prices Commission. All the paragraphs in the motion are direct quotations from the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  The previous Government opened seven price line centres to receive complaints and inquiries.  When we took office in 1973 there were only nine inspectors of consumer prices.  When we left office there were close on 50.  We made a major effort in that regard.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy said that without question he would restructure the National Prices Commission.  He was not very specific about it.</P>
    <P>On 31 January 1979 Deputy Horgan asked the Minister what steps he had taken to implement his policy of restructuring the National Prices Commission. He replied:</P>
    <P>Following my review of the structure of the National Prices Commission, I decided, with a view to enhancing its capacity to discharge its statutory functions, to appoint Mr. Patrick M. Lyons, who is a member of the Restrictive Practices Commission to act as an additional member on the prices commission.</P>
    <P>There is the restructuring.  I have a high regard for Paddy Lyons.  He is an excellent member of the prices commission. Undoubtedly he was very effective on the Restrictive Practices Commission as well.  It is fair to say that he is a wellknown supporter of this Administration, not necessarily an uncritical supporter but a supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party on balance.  One reads his column in <i>The Irish Press</i> and <i>The Sunday Press.</i></P>

      <P>The Minister added one new member to the commission and then suggested: &ldquo;I have now restructured it.  I have revised their terms of reference.  I have given them a new brief. I have put teeth into the NPC.  I have expanded the scope of their operations.  I have provided them with a whole host of additional staff.&rdquo;  That is what I would regard as restructuring an organisation. The National Prices Commission is an excellent body doing immeasurably good work.  I have the greatest regard for the staff.  I worked with them before I became a Member of this House.  To suggest that adding one new member to the National Prices Commission can be called restructuring it is an exaggerated use of the English language.  By no stretch of the imagination can that promise in the Fianna Fáil manifesto be regarded as being fulfilled.</P>
      <P>We had massive assurances from Fianna Fáil that they would investigate middle-men's margins, whatever that means.  Every week we have complaints about the middle-men on the roadsides who &ldquo;con&rdquo; people out of their money. Nothing much is being done about roadside trading, apart from a promise of legislation later in the year.  We have middle-men in the tourist industry who charge people 55p for a pint of Guinness, and 60p if they can get away with it.  In some establishments they charge 65p for a pint of Guinness.  This happens in hotels which cater for tourists.  They get away with it and they damage the tourist trade in the process.  No great effort is being made in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have middle-men in the motor insurance industry.  Under this Administration the cost of motor insurance has doubled for many motorists.  Despite very strong protests, no effort has been made to come to grips with that so-called service to the motorists.  In recent years the Opposition made every effort to convince the Government that there should be a State system of motor insurance under a State body similar to the VHI.  That was rejected and, in the <Col N="1822" /> meantime, people have to pay ever higher prices for motor insurance.</P>
    <P>There is a promise in the manifesto that Fianna Fáil would fully disseminate, at least once a week, to radio, television and newspapers comparative prices of supermarket consumer goods.</P>
    <P>Apart from some effort once a week or thereabouts on a radio programme to convey some basic information to audiences the dissemination has been paltry.  The previous Minister was belted around the head in this House when prices, sanctioned by the NPC, approved by the Minister, and which the Minister stood over were published in the newspapers.  In recent months quite a few increases have been brought in either immediately after the Christmas dinner, when food subsidies were abolished, or immediately prior to the Minister disappearing to sell milk in China.  We have had, in relation to price increases, the promise of dissemination of a wide ranging degree of information on supermarket consumer goods and their comparative prices.  That has certainly not been implemented by the Government.  This is another part of the manifesto which the Government would wish to bury quietly.</P>
    <P>In another part of the motion we see the current confusion&mdash;and that is about the most polite term one could use&mdash;in relation to the proposal to abolish the seven-day rule arising out of the outer UK zone in respect of fuel prices.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy has gyrated around every oil depot in this country, on the one hand trying to get the benefits of the seven day rule and on the other hand trying to convince the oil companies that they should not get any benefit for that themselves. The Minister, in Opposition, waxed eloquent about his determination to abolish the seven day rule, but he has not done so.  His performance this afternoon was pathetic.  He seems to have had a love-hate relationship with the oil companies and this afternoon had a reassuring form of affection.  He was very mute about it, even when we pointed out that he was condoning an increase of no less than 60 per cent in domestic fuel oil in relation to one company, namely the Burmah Oil Company.  That company were mentioned <Col N="1823" /> in this House and that is why I am mentioning their name.</P>
    <P>Where does the Minister stand in relation to the UK outer zone?  Is he for it, or is he against it?  Does he intend to abolish it, or does he intend to abide by it?  It would be an interesting exercise to have the Minister elaborate on what exactly he intends to do on that particular issue.</P>
    <P>Having had tantrums in front of the oil company executives and walked out on them, gone back after the Taoiseach had phoned the companies and got them to deliver another tanker-load of oil, and then realising that that kind of conduct does not impress anybody, the Minister now has a polite affection towards the oil companies.  This is no consolation for the fact that the Minister is about to become the Minister responsible for petrol at £1 a gallon.  Indeed, in relation to domestic heating fuel, the Minister seems to cast a blind eye on one company, at least, who are demanding no less than 60 per cent of an increase in relation to continuing their contract with domestic customers.  That particular company have several thousand customers.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised massive investigations into why Northern Ireland prices are less, apart from tax reasons, than prices in the Republic for identical products.  Indeed, the Fianna Fáil manifesto was quite explicit.  It mentioned motor cars; it mentioned parts and tyres; it even mentioned processed food and detergents.  It went on to have a go at biscuits and at clothing.  There has been a remarkable silence for two years on the part of the Government in relation to the outcome of those investigations, if they ever took place.  We have not got much information at all.  There was implicit in that manifesto a promise. &ldquo;Probably after we have finished our examination you will have a cheaper motor car.  You will probably have cheaper clothing relative to the situation in Northern Ireland.  We can assure you that we will rigorously investigate the situation&rdquo;.  The paucity of information from the Government in relation to these items certainly speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the notorious examination <Col N="1824" /> promised in relation to the accounting procedures of the ESB with a view to reducing the price of electricity, no less.  My colleague here, Deputy Horgan, asked several questions of the Minister and got a bland reply that the matter was under examination on the part of the Government and, in due course, the working party would report and we would have no problem, presumably when the matter came before the Minister.  It would be interesting to know precisely the outcome of that examination in terms of a report to this House and the effect it actually had on the reduction, if any in the price of electricity.  These are the items which have been promised to the Members of this House, in terms of a reduction.</P>
    <P>The one item that I would pick out would be the question of food price increases. The Government had ample warning, long before they took their final decision to abolish food subsidies, in regard to the substantial increases in food prices.  For example, between mid-August 1977 and mid-November 1978 the price of beef had gone up, in that period alone, by 19 per cent; mutton and lamb had gone up by 28 per cent.  The price of tomatoes had gone up by 116 per cent.  The price of bread, even at that stage, had gone up by 16 per cent; flour by 16 per cent; biscuits by 13 per cent; fresh milk by 12½ per cent and cheese by no less than 25 per cent because of the withdrawal of the subsidy.  Notwithstanding these increases which occurred between mid-August 1977 and mid-November 1978 what did the Government do?  They decided to abolish the food subsidies, to jack up the cost of food to the less advantaged in this country.  It caused a great deal of public unrest and cynicism about the good intentions of the Government and, of course, has resulted in quite substantial manifest public unrest.  A good deal of dissatisfaction with this Government evolves around their decision in relation to food subsidies.  The situation here is directly related to the cost of living and the CPI, and there has been no assurance on the part of the Government that in eight months time we shall not see the further two phases of reduction in food subsidies.  All the indications are <Col N="1825" /> so far that they still are hell-bent on going ahead and having another reduction next January and a further reduction the January after.</P>
    <P>We have the Government amendment. It is ludicrous that the Government amendment proposes to delete quotations from their own manifesto which are in our motion.  It is a rather ironic situation.  The Fianna Fáil Party are now deleting a section of their own manifesto in the terms of the motion. Obviously there are bits of the manifesto that they would prefer to forget.  They would want to bury them with all possible speed and so they have done a bit of expurgation from the record itself.  It seems that the Fianna Fáil Party are now voting against important sections of their own manifesto.  That is a very odd situation.  It is a very odd measure of progress in the past two years.  The Government do not have the confidence of this House in relation to monitoring, control and exerting a decisive influence over the level of consumer prices in this country.</P>
    <P>If I may tease gently the Minister of State, I recall reading with some incredulity about an interview which the good Minister had with Michael Finlan as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> away back in the first flush of the majority of 20.  The Minister was asked about the price situation in relation to oil.  I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 12 July 1977:</P>
    <P>When you ask what will happen if prices start to rise again, she shudders and then laughs.  &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asks.  &ldquo;Haven't we already reduced the price of petrol and on top of that haven't we discovered oil off the coast of Galway? What more do you want?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am afraid that all our quotations &mdash;and I have had a few in my time&mdash;in the first flush of enthusiasm of a new Government have a habit of catching up with us.  The oil off the coast of Galway has yet to appear.  It comes from Whiddy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We would dearly wish to see it.  Pending that, the Government have a good deal to answer for in relation to the prices situation.</P>
      <P>One final factor I will refer to is the spate of industrial disputes which are undoubtedly adding substantially to the cost situation in industry.  Companies have to depend on the rickety telephone system which we have at present and their costs are escalating day by day. This serious situation has to be taken into account by the Government in bringing about a settlement in a number of disputes.  Whether it is tourism or manufacturing that is in question they are depending on telex, on telephones and on getting messages through for basic materials and depending above all on the shaky cash flow situation which is affecting many companies.  This is going to be a price-cost factor in the years ahead which will escalate further the level of general inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have been sitting back, not taking much action in relation just = "right" li = "1" ri = "3"&gt;Cr.to the NPC.  We have the spectacle of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development coming in here and saying that all is well, not to worry, the last quarter of 1979 will show inflation working out at about 5 per cent.  We are a four-year Government, not a quarterly Government and all the implications at this stage are that inflation is back into double figures and the Government have not exerted themselves particularly in relation to the control of basic food commodities particularly in relation to food subsidies.  The absence of this control and of any real effort to the part of the Government to exert an influence has been manifestly evident and has resulted in substantial consumer dissatisfaction which will undoubtedly manifest itself in the elections to come and which at least at the minimum proves that the rather glib, high-handed and sweeping promises made by the Government at the last <Col N="1827" /> election have proved impossible to fulfil and self-defeating in terms of exerting control on inflation in recent years.</P>
    <P>I have moved the motion in the name of my colleagues and my fellow Deputies here.  I see no merit whatever in the amendment put down by the Government.  It must have exerted a great deal of imagination to dream that up.  It would have been better just to vote against our motion because the amendment is contradictory and of no great benefit to this debate.  The exposure of the promises contained in the Fianna Fáil manifesto has been overdue and we said so at the time of the election. Whether it is the price of houses or of agricultural land that is in question, no effort has been made on the part of the Government to exert any real influence. In relation to the other items I have mentioned, their manifest failure has also been singularly evident in recent years.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity presented by this motion to highlight the significant achievements of this Government in fulfilling their pre-election commitments to effective price control and to ensure that only the minimum price increases are passed on to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A little over 12 months ago this House debated a somewhat similar motion on prices.  Deputy O'Toole moved the motion on that occasion and referred to the statements made by Fianna Fáil <Col N="1828" /> prior to the general election.  Deputy O'Toole said that Fianna Fáil had a perfect right to make these statements but that they had not the right to say that something was being done when it was not being done.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and I told the House what had been done, what was being done and what would be done in the future.  I will list for the House the decisive actions the Government took over the last two years in all the areas mentioned in the motion under discussion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond, who moved the motion tonight, intervened in the debate last year to accuse the Minister and all of his colleagues of not having a thought in their heads as to what revised guidelines should operate for the National Prices Commission.  Even Deputy Desmond should be able to deduce that, not only had the Minister and his colleagues worth-while thoughts, but that they have consistently proved that they have the ability and concern to translate those thoughts into effective and decisive action.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment was and is for effective price control.  Shortly after taking up office the Minister had his first meeting with the National Prices Commission to discuss the restructuring of the commission together with detailed proposals for a more rigorous examination of price applications.  A number of meetings were held over the last two years and meetings continue to be held at appropriate intervals.  As a result of this continuous review changes were introduced in line with the Government's pre-election manifesto.</P>
    <P>Following a review of the structure of the National Prices Commission the Minister appointed an additional member to the commission.  Deputy Desmond's remarks about that additional member, implying that the member was a Fianna Fáil Party hack, are extremely regrettable coming from a Member of this House.  The commission undertake a very substantial volume of work.  The reports they present to the Minister each month are a testament to the excellent work they carry out on the many aspects of price control and economic trends.  By altering their structure <Col N="1829" /> the Minister enhanced their capacity to discharge their statutory functions.</P>
    <P>One of the primary concerns of the Minister on taking up office was to review existing methods of price control. The results of the Minister's meetings with the National Prices Commission were that a number of changes were made in the criteria for reviewing price applications.  There is now a more rigorous examination of price proposals. The changes introduced have increased the Minister's control and influence in the prices area.</P>
    <P>The Minister extended the period of notification of proposed price increases from two to three months in the case of major firms to enable price proposals from these firms to be fully examined. The Minister also requires such firms to report each year on efficiency and productivity improvements.  The requirement for export exemption from price control was raised from 25 to 35 per cent of total volume so as to encourage firms to greater efforts to increase their exports.  The Minister directed the National Prices Commission to pay particular attention to the import costs of the Irish subsidiaries of multinational companies.  The Minister thought this to be extremely important to prevent the parents of such companies charging excessive prices for supplies in order to benefit the holding company abroad and in this way evade price control regulations. The commission are currently completing a report of a study of the effect of such transfer pricing on price levels here.  The Minister also asked the commission to intensify their examination of the effects of currency fluctuations on companies' imported raw material costs and to keep under continuous review world market prices for world materials and commodities.</P>
    <P>In the pre-election manifesto Fianna Fáil promised to investigate the middlemen's margins in areas where there was an inordinate difference in the prices obtained by the producer and the price paid by the housewife for the same products&mdash;for example, meat, fish, poultry, fruit and vegetables.  The Minister asked the National Prices Commission to undertake these investigations <Col N="1830" /> and these have now been completed. Studies of margins on meat, poultry, fruit, vegetables and fish were carried out.</P>
    <P>As far as meat was concerned, the commission concluded, in their December 1977 report, that despite increases in gross cash margins on beef and lamb in Dublin there was no evidence of excess profits in the trade. The commission have continued to monitor gross cash margins on meat throughout the country to ensure that margins do not increase unreasonably.</P>
    <P>The commission engaged consultants to study poultry margins.  The conclusion was that there was scope for more competition in poultry sales between supermarket outlets.  As a result of their surveys the commission discovered what they regarded to be an unjustifiably large increase in the gross margins on chickens between January 1978 and December 1978.  A maximum prices order for chickens was immediately made by the Minister to reduce chicken prices significantly.  The order came into operation on 5 February of this year.</P>
    <P>A study of middlemen's margins on fish revealed that there was no evidence of excessive profits on the part of wholesalers, processors or retailers.</P>
    <P>The study of middlemen's margins in relation to fruit and vegetables concluded that margins were not excessive except possibly in supermarkets.  Formal control of fruit and vegetable margins by maximum prices order would create serious administrative difficulties; it would be virtually impossible to relate a controlled price to a clearly defined quality of produce and this would render an order ineffective.  The best way to reduce margins is through improved efficiency and increased competition.  To this end the commission are continuing to monitor fruit and vegetable prices on a weekly basis and the results are broadcast by RTE and published in the daily papers.</P>
    <P>Arrangements were made in November 1977 for RTE radio to begin broadcasting fruit, vegetable and poultry prices on a weekly basis.  The information is broadcast in the course of a consumer li = "2" fli = "-1"&gt;Cr.affairs programme every Friday morning.  The information, supplied by <Col N="1831" /> the prices inspectorate, is given in the form of advice to the consumer as to where the best value is available.  Information on meat prices is also broadcast on a monthly basis.</P>
    <P>Since 1 December 1978, the fruit and vegetable prices are also being presented each Friday evening on RTE 2 television.</P>
    <P>In addition, since January 1979, the same information has been sent to the four national daily newspapers for publication in their Friday editions.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of consumer information, I would like, once again, to encourage all consumers to bring complaints of overcharging or seemingly excessive prices to the notice of my Department so that they can be investigated.  Complaints can be brought to the Minister's attention, to the attention of the Department or to the attention of the Priceline Offices located in various centres throughout the country. During the year ended 31 December 1978 the prices inspectorate investigated 4,292 complaints, of which 3,998 were received at the Priceline centres.  They found that 2,452 or 57 per cent were well founded.  Evidence of the contravention of price control orders for legal proceedings was obtained in 1,963 instances. There were 558 breaches of price charge display orders and as a result of the work of the inspectorate refunds were made in 1,489 cases.  During the year 1,056 traders were fined a total of £8,317 and were ordered to pay £1,860 expenses for breaches of orders made under the Prices Acts.  From 1 January 1973, to 31 December 1978, there were 6,029 prosecutions of which more than 98 per cent were successful.</P>
    <P>In regard to the seven-day UK Outer Zone arrangement for the control of petroleum product prices, this was introduced in December 1973 when there were severe oil supply problems.  When the Minister assumed responsibility for price control in 1977, he decided to retain the link with the UK Outer Zone for the time being simply because it suited us to retain it.  This was borne out in July 1977 when the oil companies in Britain reduced their wholesale prices and, in accordance with the arrangement, the <Col N="1832" /> Minister was able to require the Irish oil companies to reduce their prices by similar amounts.</P>
    <P>Further reductions in the Irish companies' prices were made in late January-early February 1978 and again in November 1978.  The January-February 1978 reductions were made on a voluntary basis by the companies themselves because of the appreciation in the exchange rate of sterling against the dollar.  These reductions broke the direct link between wholesale prices in Ireland and those in the UK Outer Zone as Irish wholesale prices for the particular petroleum products involved became lower than the UK Outer Zone prices.  The pound continued to improve in value against the dollar and the ri = "2"&gt;NilMinister approached the Irish oil companies in September 1978 to make further reductions in their prices. However, the companies were not prepared to make these further reductions voluntarily and the Minister then made the Maximum Prices (Petroleum Products) Order, 1978, which fixed maximum wholesale prices for the various petroleum products as well as maximum retail prices for petrol and domestic kerosene.  The prices fixed under the order were ½p per gallon lower than the prices which the companies had been charging.  This reduction, of course, increased the differential between wholesale prices in Ireland and those in the UK Outer Zone.</P>
    <P>The prices of petroleum products have been increased twice in recent months.  On 14 March 1979 the Irish oil companies were allowed to implement price increases which were similar to increases already implemented in the UK and were designed to compensate the companies for the increased cost of crude oil and for other cost increases. The second increase came into effect on 23 April 1979 but the amounts allowed were not on that occasion identical to increases which had recently been implemented in the UK and this in fact changed further the differential between Irish wholesale prices and those in the UK.  It is quite clear, therefore, that the direct link between wholesale prices in Ireland and those in the UK Outer Zone <Col N="1833" /> has not been operating for the past 15 months.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to a further point raised in the Labour Party motion&mdash;the question of Northern Ireland prices <i>vis-à-vis</i> prices here for similar products.  The Minister asked the NPC to investigate fully why, apart from tax reasons, Northern Ireland prices are sometimes lower than prices here.  A number of investigations were, in fact, carried out with particular reference to motor cars, spare parts, tyres, detergents, biscuits and frozen foods.  Individual factors were discovered in each case.  There were some broad reasons, namely, for products made here, higher unit domestic costs of production due to the smaller market in the Republic; higher transport and distribution costs here due to various reasons, including lower density of population and greater distances between major centres of population; lower costs in Northern Ireland due to the operation of certain investment grant and employment subsidy schemes; the use of UK recommended list prices in Northern Ireland while shoppers here have to pay the transport and import costs; the lower cost of some food materials because of differing Green £ rates in the EEC.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the point that higher VAT and excise duties operate here especially in relation to motor cars and spare parts.  The Minister has ensured that prices here and in Northern Ireland are monitored and compared on a continuous basis and that in so far as is possible disparity in prices is fully justified.</P>
    <P>The Minister initiated an examination of the accounting procedures of the ESB.  A working party representative of the ESB, the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy and the other economic Government Departments has been conducting an in-depth examination of this matter.  Representatives of the National Prices Commission have also been available for consultation when required.  The working party are in the process of finalising their report which will be submitted to the Minister shortly.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset, and I repeat it now, that the Government are fully committed <Col N="1834" /> to effective price control.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy continues to be personally responsible for price control policy. Over the past two years the Minister has refused or reduced recommendations from the NPC for price increases on a wide variety of basic commodities. These included building materials, bottled gas, tea, flour, sugar, drink and petroleum products.</P>
    <P>In fact the actions of the Government over two years of office have had a remarkable effect on the rate of inflation. This success has been achieved in the main against a background of adverse external economic pressures over which the Government had no control.  Let us look at the rates of inflation recorded over the past two years and compare these with the astronomical rates which were commonplace during the Coalition's term of office.</P>
    <P>The annual rate of inflation to mid-November 1976 was a startling 20.6 per cent.  The annual rate to mid-November 1977&mdash;less than six months after the Government took office&mdash;was 10.8 per cent.  That was the lowest recorded up to then from mid-February 1973.  In other words, the rate of inflation had been halved, a remarkable achievement when we remember that the rate in the year to May 1975 was 24.5 per cent, the highest rate achieved in recent years.</P>
    <P>The inflation rate figures recorded in 1978 are worth mentioning.  In the year to mid-May 1978 the figure was 6.2 per cent; to mid-November 1978 it was 7.9 per cent.  The latest available figure, the year to mid-February 1979, is 10.8 per cent, but the increase here is to some extent attributable to non-recurring price increases.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer at this point to some increases specifically mentioned by Deputy Desmond this evening.  I will refer to the prices of various commodities such as bread, tea, beef and so on and look at the percentage price increases, first of all from June 1977 to date, and compare them with the rates of increase from March 1973 to June 1977, the Coalition term of office.  The increase in the price of bread during Fianna Fáil's term was 31.1 per cent as compared. <Col N="1835" /> with 66.6 per cent during the Coalition term.  The increase in the price of a pound of tea was 28.2 per cent during Fianna Fáil's term of office and 212 per cent during the Coalition's term.  The increase in the price of a pound of beef during Fianna Fáil's term has been 28.8 per cent and during the Coalition's term 49 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am making what I regard as a valuable comparison between price increases during our two years in office and those during the Coalition's four and a half years.

      <P>The price of potatoes during Fianna Fáil's term increased by 38.8 per cent.  During the Coalition's term the percentage increase was 119.8.  The price of a pound of sugar during Fianna Fáil's term increased by 40.8 per cent.  During the Coalition's term the percentage increase was 218. The price of a pound of butter during Fianna Fáil's term increased by 30 per cent and by 84 per cent during the Coalition's term.</P>
      <P>Each of these increases takes into account the removal of the subsidies which the Opposition parties said would have a tremendously bad effect on the CPI. From mid-February 1973 to mid-August 1977 the CPI increased by 100 per cent.  From mid-August 1977 to mid-February 1979&mdash;I am giving the latest figures available&mdash;the increase was 14 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion asks the House to &ldquo;condemn the object failure of the Government to implement its election promises on prices&rdquo;.  The fact is that the <Col N="1836" /> Government have lived up to their commitments on price control.  The House knows this and the country knows it as well.</P>
    <P>Perhaps unfortunately, Deputy Desmond happened to mention our present industrial situation, with particular reference to one dispute which has been the cause of tremendous concern to all of us in the House, regardless of which side we are on.  He said it is having a tremendously bad effect on our image abroad and as well will tend to lead to substantial price increases when the figures come to be counted at the end of the dispute.  When referring to that dispute one wonders whether it might be in the interests of the Opposition, or some parties in the Opposition, to help prolong the dispute.  I do not think many of the utterances in this House have been particularly helpful towards its solution. In the European constituency which Deputy O'Toole and I represent in the House, certain vehicles belonging to the institution in which the dispute is occurring have been carrying election posters for the Chairman of the Labour Party, who happens to be a European candidate.</P>
    <P>As I have said the Government have lived up to their commitment on price control, as people inside and outside the House are very much aware.  None of us would suggest that difficulties will not occur in relation to price control but we will deal effectively with these difficulties as they arise.  We are not just sitting back.  Our commitment is on-going, and I can assure the House that the Minister's aim remain the same&mdash;effective price control, ensuring that the consumer will be protected adequately from excessive price increases.  Price control policy is kept under continuous review to ensure that it is in a form that is best suited to the prevailing economic climate.</P>
    <P>When the House considers my outline of what the Government have done in this regard in the past two years, I am sure it will accept readily our amendment to the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not honestly think that the Minister is as naive as her statements here tonight would lead us to <Col N="1837" /> believe.  She is an intelligent human being of ability and she has been trying to convince us in the Opposition, and indeed herself, that what has taken place in the past 20 months is something of which she can be proud.  It is far from it, and well she knows it.</P>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity to debate this subject at this time.  We are discussing promises versus performance.  In 1977 Fianna Fáil embarked on what has transpired to have been a reckless road in order to purchase votes in the 1977 election.  That road is now strewn with the victims of those promises, with great hardships because the party in Government have failed to live up to the promises set down on paper at that time.  Indeed I must give them credit for committing their promises to paper although that action may or may not turn out to be a good thing.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil presented the electorate with a package of which one section dealt with prices&mdash;the now infamous Fianna Fáil manifesto.  A substantial portion of that section is outlined in the motion.  The Minister would have us believe that, due to the efforts of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, a major improvement has taken place in the NPC in so far as they can monitor and control price increase applications. Apart from very peripheral changes, there has not been any substantial change in the NPC format.  I should like to say now, as I have often said, that they are to be complimented on the work they are doing.  No major change has taken place; they always did their job despite allegations made by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy when in Opposition that they were not doing their job.  Indeed they were and against great odds at the time and they are still doing a good job within the terms of reference laid down for them. So on that point the Minister is not going to convince anybody about the major changes that are taking place in the restructuring of the National Prices Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, on the question of the National Prices Commission let me say that the Minister has the knack of coming into this House and announcing at <Col N="1838" /> the odd times when he was in a position to do so that, as evidence by the case of the 5 per cent in the ESB many months ago, there has been a decrease in prices.  But when price increases come about there is no statement from the Minister; it is quietly shoved out through the GIS and the NPC take the rap for the price increase.  In other words by implication they are blamed but the Minister is not to be blamed.  The Minister is using the NPC and it is unfair of him to do so.  There was a section related to price control specifically which said that where the Government had direct influence they would not allow price increases to take place.  That is part of the manifesto and yet on New Year's Day in 1979 we had substantial increases in basic food commodities due not to any outside influence or factors but due directly to Government intervention through the partial withdrawal of food subsidies.</P>
    <P>This is surely flying in the face of solemn promises given to the electorate which reacted very favourably to the party which gave out promises and reacted to the extent of giving them 84 seats in this House.  Yet a year-and-a-half later that same party is back piling hardship upon hardship through the direct intervention of the Government in partially withdrawing food subsidies.  Let me remind the House that indeed the further withdrawal of food subsidies is still part of the Government's policy.  It first saw the light of day in the Green Paper last year and was reiterated in the White Paper last December.  So the political facts of life now are that there is still 20p per lb. of a subsidy left on butter which, according to the Government, will be taken off; there is still 5p on a large loaf which will be taken off; there is still 1½p on a pint of milk which will be taken off if we are to believe the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Of course nowadays it is impossible to believe anything.  Some weeks ago the Minister for Economic Planning and Development tried to justify in this House the removal of food subsidies on the basis that they were introduced at a time of very high inflation.  At the time he was quoting the 7.9 figure as being the figure for the quarter ending mid-November <Col N="1839" /> 1978.  In that situation he said there was no need to retain food subsidies.  That was on a Tuesday night in this House.  On the following Thursday afternoon, less than 48 hours later that 7.9 per cent turned out to be a rate of 16.8 per cent because on that Thursday afternoon was published the consumer price index figures for the period mid-November to mid-February and on that afternoon we discovered that over that three-month period the figure was 4.3 per cent; annualised, that is a rate of 16.8 per cent.  I wonder could the Minister or the Minister of State present justify the removal of food subsidies in the light of that information?</P>
    <P>These are some facts which we cannot deny.  Now in saying this I am not trying to confuse the issue as the Minister of State did by giving us figures for the National Coalition's time in office versus Fianna Fáil's time in office.  The only difference is that in her case she was comparing one period with a period which was twice as long.  I am disappointed that the Minister, who is a member of my own profession, would try to do a thing like that.  Indeed as she knows a first class child would not get away with it in a national school.  Let us be honest with ourselves and compare like with like.  Where things are comparable let us compare them and where they are not let us not try to confuse the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are that the Minister gave figures for two periods one of which was twice the length of the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>She tried to convince us that these periods were comparable.  The fact is that over the past 20 months price increases of five basic food commodities have taken place, increases in the region of 30 per cent on average.  That is an undeniable fact.  They are the commodities which were included in the famous <Col N="1840" /> National Coalition basket of 1977.  We can add to that the figures given today by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in connection with the two meat items, beef and lamb; we discover that beef has gone up by 35 per cent in that time while lamb has gone up by 50 per cent.  These are official figures given by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and yet the Minister can tell us here that prices are being monitored and that price control is very much in vogue at the moment and is being practised.  If that is so, I would ask the Minister to ask some of her constituents in West Galway what they think of the current price increases in basic food commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have to ask them.  I know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I know and the Minister knows the answer would be that things are going up day in, day out.  The Minister of State mentioned one thing which intrigued me&mdash;in the light of what I have said&mdash;that the price increases which resulted from the withdrawal of food subsidies would be non-recurring price increases.  Does that mean the Minister of State is now saying that no further subsidies will be removed from the foods on which they are present?  If that is so, would the Minister say so categorically, and so amend the White Paper, the Government's policy on this issue?  I challenged the Minister for Economic Planning and Development on that some time ago in this House and he evaded the issue when winding up on the budget debate.  The Minister of State has implied very strongly that no further food subsidies will be removed.  If that is so, I would ask that that statement be made in plain English that people can understand and avoid this evasive kind of language which could mean anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of housing the Minister of State made the point that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy had gone to great lengths to ensure a reduction in the price of building materials.  I should like to know where these reductions took place because, if they did, definitely they did not reach the consumer.  The Minister is aware herself <Col N="1841" /> that in her own city&mdash;which is reputed to be the most expensive housing area in the country, not the most favourable tag to be attached to any area&mdash;house prices have gone literally mad in the past 18 months.  I understand that in 1978 house prices generally increased by something like 34 per cent.  Yet we are told the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, through his negotiations and consultations, succeeded in reducing the cost of building materials. That may very well be so but if we are so taken up with price control and if the Minister's Department are so deliberate in their views on the matter and so enthusiastic to ensure that the consumer gets a fair deal why not translate these negotiations into reductions to the consumer? That is not happening.  There is something amiss somewhere.  That is the only conclusion I can draw from what I see happening and I am sure the electorate is just as confused as I am about this kind of statement.</P>
    <P>The question of oil and energy has been raised also.  The Minister went to great lengths to outline for us the background to oil price reductions in 1978 and the breaking of the agreement regarding the seven-day UK outer zone promised to be abolished by Fianna Fáil. A year later they said it was impossible to do so.  Now the agreement is broken by default, not by any deliberate action on the part of the Minister or the Government.  The Minister of State went to great lengths to outline the background to that.  Mind you, she did not spend much time on the latter day history of our oil situation since January last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an hour's discussion on all that today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is obliged to give a balanced view and statement, not to give one side of the position only. The Minister may or may not be aware that people are concerned about the position today.  They are concerned also about the price they are paying for oil to-day. They are concerned also about the fact that the Minister and her Department would seem to have lost control of price control in oil at this very <Col N="1842" /> moment.  I shall not talk about Question Time today; hopefully we will have one more hour tomorrow along the same lines.  What I am saying is that there are oil companies exploiting us here.  The Minister was given a national pat on the back for his stand against the oil companies a few weeks ago.  What did it turn out to be?  It transpired that the Minister was going through the motions of being a tough man to justify the confirmation of a price increase the following day; that it all it amounted to.  The Minister of State knows that as does the Minister himself.  We were not given the information sought today on many issues; at present this country is not being given the information sought.  On the question of oil prices we want to know whether or not oil companies are in a position to hold this country to ransom.  Our people want to know what controls the Minister can impose to ensure, first, an adequate supply of fuel for energy and, secondly, at what price, and can that price be controlled? Those are the questions left unanswered today and remain unanswered now by the Minister of State.  A more balanced view should have been given by the Minister of State in her explanatory note on which oil prices are all about because to 99.99 per cent of our people seven-day outer zone agreements do not mean a thing, not one iota; what they are concerned with is when they will be paying £1.20, £1.30 or £1.50 per gallon for petrol.  That is the issue at stake.  Likewise they want to know if they can get heating oil.  They want to know also if they can obtain sufficient diesel oil for their tractors to farm their land.  Seven-day outer zone agreements are technical matters which affect people very much but the questions the ordinary people are asking are not being answered in plain language they can understand simply because the Minister or the Government have not the answers because, if they had, they would shout them from the rooftops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had evasion.  We have had figures thrown at us.  The Minister of State must admit that the figures she gave are not figures that can be taken at face value.  It would take a very swift operator of a mathematical calculator to figure out exactly what were the comparative <Col N="1843" /> figures from the two sets given by the Minister because she was referring to two total different periods.</P>
    <P>On the question of the media, on the dissemination of information concerning prices, let me refresh the Minister's mind.  In their manifesto there was a very definite promise that Fianna Fáil, in Government, would ensure adequate weekly dissemination of information on prices.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blaney has received permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the non-supply of oil by a certain company to County Donegal, particularly to the remoter areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing what the Chair has said or making little of the advantage I have in being given an opportunity to raise this matter but I should like to point out that I sought to raise this question as it relates to Donegal and other remote areas.  My query was not confined to the misdeeds of one company although it concerns one company more than others.  I make that statement for the purpose of the record because I am aware that the record of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is slightly different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I want to bring this to the attention of the Minister in the hope that he can do something to relieve the situation of our people and retailers of petrol and oil.  Some of those retailers in one company system have not received as much as one gallon of supply for five weeks.  While this may be regarded as just hard luck in the case of the retailers who are solely supplied by the Burmah Oil Company, it is a scandalous system when the real picture is looked at because a number of those <Col N="1844" /> retailers depend for their livelihood on their service stations.  They have not had any income for the past five weeks despite all sorts of promises and the allocation on paper of quotas for the months of April, May and June. However, those retailers have not received any supplies for April.  The people of Donegal are left with a shortfall over and above any percentage cut that other companies may have applied.  People throughout the country are mesmerised as to the Minister's indication some weeks back that the cuts amounted to approximately 5 per cent. Some companies are operating a 5 per cent cut, others a 10 per cent cut and others 20 per cent, but in the case of Burmah it is a 100 per cent cut in Donegal and other remote areas in the country.</P>
      <P>The reason I mention Donegal and other remote areas is that these privately owned retail outlets supplied solely by the Burmah Company in the past received their supplies from Derry distributors on behalf of the Burmah Twenty-six County company.  Over the years that has been useful for the Dublin company but the contracts held by all retailers south of the Border have been with the Dublin-based Burmah company although their supplies, for convenience, were distributed by the Belfast company through Derry.  Normally when there was any shortfall in Derry, Belfast rowed in and made available the supplies but now Derry has not had any supplies to distribute to anybody in recent weeks and Belfast do not want to know anything about Donegal customers.  At the same time Dublin, whose customers they are, do not want to know them either except to make promises on certain occasions.  In fact, a specific date was given before Easter for the delivery of supplies and the making up of full April quotas on the arrival of a tanker in Derry on 19 April.  That tanker had not arrived when I last had the opportunity of knowing what was going on up there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should take into consideration that in Donegal and other western counties who are suffering in the same way other petrol companies are cutting supplies by up to 20 per cent in some cases.  The result is that people living <Col N="1845" /> in those counties are not being treated uniformly in this critical time of shortage of supplies.  That also applies to all other oil products.  The Minister who has told the companies where he thinks they will have to get off&mdash;more power to him for doing this&mdash;must find a way to level out the supplies and if there is a shortage it should be borne by the entire community.  It should not be borne in a haphazard way like the present system. He should also take into consideration families who depend entirely for their income on the sale of petroleum products. They have not had any business or income, or any promise of an income, because of the cessation of supplies by one company.  This is a serious situation because those people have not had any assurance that the situation will change next week or next month.</P>
    <P>The business and goodwill which such people have built up will disappear if they are not given supplies very soon.  In my view the general run of petrol retailers have been given a raw deal in that they are being left to carry the can of the public ire because many people believe, spurred on by incomprehensible statements about supplies, that retailers have an endless storage capacity in the ground in which they are storing supplies in the hope of getting a rake-off. The Irish distribution centres of those multinational companies are probably not to blame because I doubt very much if they had any huge oversupply built up waiting for the price increase which they had hoped to get, or the one they got last week, to make their rake-off.</P>
    <P>I believe it goes much further afield than that, and we are not talking in terms of a few hundred pounds, a tankful of petrol in a retail outlet, a few thousand pounds in the rake-off which might be taken from some of the distribution storage points around the country.  We are really talking about the multi-nationals making millions overnight on oil that they probably have not yet got but have bought forward.  This is the sort of racketeering I believe we are dealing with, and they are the sort of people we are dealing with.  This is the sort of end product which I hope the Minister can do something about.</P>
    <P>I am sure I have got across to the <Col N="1846" /> Minister a picture which he has been getting elsewhere.  I appeal to him to do something, if he can.  I feel that, if he can do something, he will.  If there is anything the Minister can do, even if it is rough treatment for those people, let him speed it up because they deserve the roughest treatment: they are certainly not good friends of the country in relation to their behaviour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will stay strictly to the motion on the Adjournment.  Deputy Blaney referred to the distress being caused in Donegal by what seems to be an unequal distribution of oil supplies, particularly petrol and diesel, throughout the country.  When this crisis blew up about three weeks ago I felt that the intensity of it was the same in all parts of the Twenty-six Counties.  In the last week it has become quite obvious that places furthest from the capital are suffering most.  We would like an explanation for that.  Are the oil companies favouring the environs of Dublin and the surrounding counties at the expense of the more remote regions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blaney mentioned the Burmah-Castrol company which seem to have gone almost out of existence as far as our oil supplies are concerned.  Is it fair that people who have been customers of this company for years are now almost completely cut off from oil <Col N="1847" /> supplies?  In the very remote regions they are almost without oil supplies.  It is difficult in this time of scarcity for those people to turn to other suppliers and request them to give them supplies.  Those companies, whether they are Shell, Texaco or other companies, have not sufficient supplies to meet the full demand of their own customers so they can hardly provide a supply for the Burmah customers.</P>
    <P>We have heard various rumours why the Burmah company are unable to fulfill their commitments.  I hope the Minister can give some explanation about the background of this.  Is it entirely due to the troubles in Iran where this company seem to get most of their supplies? Is there some internal reason within the company's structure?</P>
    <P>This is a very crucial time of the year for the farming industry.  The Minister has repeatedly stated that the farming and fishing industries will be given priority when it comes to the supply of diesel oil.  It was brought to my notice recently that people with large tracts of land awaiting cultivation cannot get supplies of diesel oil.  I brought some of those cases to the Minister's office as late as today.  We were told two weeks ago that this matter would be overcome, but this has not happened.  There are thousands of acres of land all over the country where corn should be planted within the next week or so which cannot even be tilled.  This is because there is a lack of uniformity, as stated by Deputy Blaney, in the distribution of existing diesel supplies.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us at Question Time today that the oil installations have not got their normal supplies but he led us to believe that the supplies were not much below normal.  What percentage cutback has there been in supplies?  What hope has the Minister of improving the situation in the near future?  I speak here tonight because of the critical situation in my constituency, which is one of the remote regions mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

Working people cannot get to their places of employment; sporting fixtures and social occasions have to be abandoned because there are not sufficient petrol supplies to get the people to those centres.  I appeal to the Minister to see that the distribution is uniform.  It is obvious that there is not a fair distribution of the available supplies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they did not go the right way about finding it.  I am in the difficulty that the Deputy mentioned Burmah in particular.  As Burmah are one of the very small suppliers in Donegal most of the research done for the purposes of this debate was done in relation to the other companies, the larger ones, as Burmah are not a very significant force in the oil market in County Donegal.  I have not as much information, therefore, as one might normally have in regard to that company in that area.  I can say in general terms that the volume of complaints from Donegal, both before various steps were taken to rectify the problem that then existed and that have existed since then, is very small indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were complaints on behalf of two trawlers, temporarily based in Killybegs and which come from another part of the country that they were not getting supplies; it appears supplies were available there but that difficulty had to do with local patronage rather than a shortage of oil and the problem was sorted out eventually.  Apart from the problem of those two trawlers, since the beginning of these difficulties the Department have received only three <Col N="1849" /> complaints in respect of Donegal.  I venture to think that part of the reason for the small number of complaints may be that they could not get through to complain because they are more cut off than the rest of the country.  Nevertheless, over a period of several weeks there have been only three complaints.</P>
    <P>On checking today with the three main companies supplying Donegal, they have confirmed that in most cases they have had no complaints, and in others that they have had a very small number of complaints.  I do not want to quibble with Deputy Blaney's assertion that some Burmah petrol stations in Donegal have not had any supplies for five weeks&mdash;I do not know if the Deputy's information is up to date&mdash;but it would seem that that is very unlikely to be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am absolutely certain that they did not get supplies for four weeks.  Burmah's phone in Dublin still does not answer.  That is a very bad sign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Burmah company have had particular difficulties.  I do not want this House to discuss in any detail the commercial affairs of a private company for obvious reasons but, since the Deputies referred to them, I should make some reference to their special difficulties. In the past they got all their supplies from Burmah UK which has one refinery only at Ellesmere Port on Merseyside.  Ellesmere Port was 100 per cent dependent on light Iranian crude. That refinery is not typical in the sense that the particular crude they are refining is principally crude which is used as a base for refining into lubricants.  Burmah are associated with an oil, specifically lubricating oil, called Castrol which does a fairly large business in both Ireland and Britain.  When their supplies of Iranian crude came to a stop earlier this year, they found themselves in much greater difficulty than any other company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were also at the disadvantage that they are much smaller than the other companies.  They had not the international spread to enable them to look elsewhere easily and therefore have been <Col N="1850" /> worse hit than any other company in this country.  I think it is correct to say that they were almost totally out of supplies; they were totally out of gas diesel oil and at one stage, had only something like one or two days of petrol.</P>
    <P>I had discussions with their chief and senior executives and my officials had several discussions with them and we have been able to sort out most of the difficulties for their commercial customers.  They were fairly significant suppliers to the agricultural market, road haulage and plant hire markets in Munster, for example, and we were able to get another company to supply those commercial customers.  I am informed that Burmah had sufficient supplies for their priority customers over the past two weeks, either through direct imports or by the product swapping arrangement which they in common with other countries go on with and which is a help in terms of distribution.</P>
    <P>That is why I am surprised at what Deputy Blaney had to say.  I know he would not say it unless he believed it to be true, but what he says seems to be at variance with the information coming into the Department.  Before Easter we were flooded with complaints which we did our best to sort out, and it was only when the order was made under the 1971 Act a few days before Easter that we succeeded in beginning to sort out these difficulties and in getting companies to make arrangements between one another.  Since Easter there has been only a handful of complaints in the Department and the companies confirm that they are not getting any volume of complaints and that they are able to meet their priority customers.</P>
    <P>There are non-priority customers whose needs for gas diesel oil at the moment probably cannot be met, and by this order they are precluded from being met until the priority customers' needs are met in full.  I make no apology for that because it is the priority people who count.  There is no great hardship involved for the non-priority people.</P>

      <P>On the question of Donegal, there was a problem caused temporarily through circumstances outside the control of everybody on this side of the Border due to the fact that two of the main companies in Donegal get their supplies from a depot in Derry.  Apart from whatever problems they may have had in Derry, there was a strike of Northern customs officials on a number of days which resulted in tankers being sent back.  This caused certain difficulties because the tankers were unable to go back to Donegal for several days. So far as any individual complaint is concerned, if Deputy Blaney gives my Department details of the retailers who allege that they have not got any supplies for five weeks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

These amounts differ in some respects from the figures published in the six-monthly Reports to the Oireachtas on Developments in the <Col N="1727" /> European Communities (Annex II) which represent the amounts of grants and subsidies approved.  This is because there is normally a time lag between the <Col N="1728" /> approval of grants and the date of their payment, with the result that receipts from the Community to date have been somewhat less than the amount of grants approved.</P>

    <P>With regard to the Deputy's suggestions in relation to publicity to encourage people to become kidney donors, I would draw attention to the nationwide publicity campaign recently inaugurated by the Irish Kidney Association in conjunction with the Health Education Bureau which I was invited to launch on 2 April 1979.  On that occasion I appealed for wholehearted support for the campaign to inform the general public and I gladly avail of this opportunity to reiterate that appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following are details of overall price increases since May 1977 on the Commodities in question, following recommendations from the National Prices Commission, to which I raised no objection: Bread, 7p per 800 gm loaf, wrapped and sliced; Cornflakes, 7p per 500 gm packet; Cigarettes, 3p per packet of 20; Beer, 6p per pint bottle; Cheese, 7.45p per lb. (wholesale); Beans, 6p per 29½ oz. tin; Sugar, 7.5p per kilo; Tea, 1.75p per lb. on average; Butter, 8p per lb.</P>
      <P>All the above are retail price increases with the exception of cheese, in which case price increases are approved at wholesale level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coffee and frozen fish fingers are both imported items and I cannot exercise any control over the import price of these commodities.  Importers with a turnover of more than £250,000 per annum are required to make application for increases in the cash margins which they take on imported products. However, no such applications have been received from importers of these two commodities in the period from mid-May 1977 to date.  The retail prices of coffee and frozen fish fingers are not controlled.  On account, however, of a reduction in import prices, the retail <Col N="1737" /> prices of the popular brands of coffee in supermarkets were reduced by 55p per 4 oz. jar since May 1977.</P>
    <P>Beef and potatoes are both primary agricultural products and as such producer prices are specifically excluded from the scope of the Prices Acts.  The retail prices of beef and potatoes are not controlled.  However, I am aware from the monitoring of these prices which is carried out by the National Prices Commission, that since May 1977 average prices of beef increased by about 25p per lb. and average prices of potatoes increased by about 30p per stone.</P>

The regulations provide that specified local authorities are responsible for determining the number of new public hire vehicle licences which the Commissioner may grant in the period upto the 31 August 1979, and in each succeeding period of 12 months.  The regulations also prescribe that the commissioner must be satisfied that an applicant for a new licence is a fit and proper person to hold such a licence and that, where the number of valid applications exceeds the number determined by the local authority, the commissioner will determine the successful applicants by lot.  I will send the Deputy a copy of the regulations with an explanatory statement which I issued in October 1978.  At this stage, I have not sought returns of the numbers of licences issued in each of the specified areas.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the possibility of securing aid from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (FEOGA).  Under Regulation 17/64/EEC, rural water schemes were formerly eligible for FEOGA aid but rural road works under the local improvement scheme were not eligible. Rural water scheme are no longer eligible for FEOGA aid, except in the case of schemes for which applications were lodged with the EEC Commission on or before 31 December 1978.  Such an application was lodged on behalf of the Fournocks group scheme, County Meath, and the amount of FEOGA aid requested was £8,816.  The decision of the EEC Commission on this application is awaited.</P>
      <P>As group water schemes in County Meath no longer qualify for FEOGA aid, the question of application procedures does not arise at this stage.</P>
