    <Title>Courts Bill, 1979: Second Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. D. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I dealt with the subject in a general way and I undertook to the Deputies opposite that I would deal with the specific points raised on the Bill itself.  A number of matters of importance were raised which should be met.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating wondered if judges could be appointed administratively rather than legislatively.  Article 36 of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Constitution relating to the Courts, the following shall be regulated in accordance with law, that is to say;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>i.  The number of judges of the Supreme Court, and of the High Court, the remuneration, age of <Col N="599" /> retirement and pensions of such judges, ...</P>
    <P>If the Constitution was amended in this connection Deputy Keating's suggestion might have some relevance.  While his point of view is arguable, it is not sustainable under the Constitution.  I respectfully suggest to him that the proper way to appoint judges is under the present system and by the means now applied.  Judges should be appointed publicly and there should be discussion on their appointment in the manner in which this subject was discussed yesterday. It was a worthwhile and healthy exercise. I should much prefer that judges be appointed under legislation and in full view of this House so that they are not seen to be appointed by way of subterfuge. Regardless of the constitutional requirement, the subject should be discussed openly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating suggested that some judges of the High Court were sent home because of lack of staff.  We investigated the matter and found there was no substance in that suggestion.  I use the word &ldquo;suggestion&rdquo; because I do not think the Deputy made the comment by way of charge or allegation.  He raised the matter in the ordinary way and the answer is that no judge was sent home because of lack of staff.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said there should be additional reforms in this Bill.  The question of law reform generally is being pursued vigorously in the Department of Justice. I hope that there will be substantial law reform measures before this House in the new Dáil term or in the session after the Michaelmas term.  I do not intend at this stage to mention the areas in which there may be reforms but I want to inform the Deputy that substantial work is being done on this matter in the Department. I have been appointed to assist the Minister for Justice in regard to that and other matters having regard to the burden put on the Minister in the matter of security and other issues.</P>
    <P>The Post Office strike was mentioned by Deputy Keating and by Deputy Enright.  It is true that the effect of the strike on High Court civil jury actions has been quite considerable.  Jury summonses  <Col N="600" /> are usually served by post but since the Post Office strike started in February of this year it has not been possible to summon jurors for High Court actions.  As a result no High Court jury actions have been heard in Dublin since early March and the jury sittings in Cork which commenced on 23 April lasted only one week instead of the usual two weeks because not enough jurors were available.  The reason for the lack of jurors was that we could not serve jury summonses on them because of the postal strike.</P>
    <P>The High Court is due to rise for the long vacation at the end of July and will not resume sittings until October.  There is no possibility of jury actions being heard in the High Court before October and then only if the Post Office strike ends in time to permit of the service of summonses.  The average delay from the date of setting down a jury action to the date of hearing was ten months on 6 April 1979, at the end of the Hillery term.  Accordingly, the average delay period will have risen to 16 months by the end of October.</P>
    <P>It is understood that the President of the High Court has urged litigants to have their cases heard without juries but he has not had a very favourable response.  This brings us back to the point raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  He believes strongly that civil juries should be maintained.  It is clear that when there is an absence of civil juries and there is a non-jury situation on offer, that litigants will not accept a non-jury situation. There is much in what the Deputy said apart altogether from the principle involved in retaining the jury in a civil action. Litigants want juries to adjudicate on their claims.  In the Easter term only one case opted for trial without jury. That copper-fastens Deputy Fitzpatrick's argument in regard to the retention of the jury system.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned accommodation. I have an extensive note on this question and will do my best to summarise it.  At present there are nine courtrooms available for High Court business and one High Court judge sits in the Special Criminal Court in Green Street.  At the moment it is possible to accommodate all ten High Court judges <Col N="601" /> at sittings in Dublin.  Judge Costello's temporary absence has already made a courtroom available for one judge. Because High Court judges have other duties to discharge elsewhere than in courtrooms in Dublin, there are many occasions during the year when courtrooms are available which could be utilised by the proposed additional judges.  Those occasions arise when the High Court goes on circuit to hear appeals and some original actions at provincial venues; when, for example, it goes to Cork in January, April and July to hear original jury actions; when judges are working in chambers in preparation of judgments, vetting transcripts of cases, writing notes on cases appealed to the High Court, studying relevant papers for sittings of the Court of Criminal Appeal, and when in the court of Criminal Appeal, which is comprised of the Chief Justice and two High Court Judges.</P>
    <P>That raises another matter which was mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick, that is, people imagining that a judge's function is to sit only for four hours a day, apart from the concentration required during that four hour sitting.  A judge has a great deal more work to do than just sitting in court.</P>
    <P>The President of the High Court expressed concern at his inability to arrange for the appropriate type of hearing of State side matters, such as <i>habeas corpus, a certiori mandamus</i> and prohibition.  There is provision for the hearing of these court cases by a divisional court of the High Court consisting of three judges.  This arrangement, which is highly desirable from the point of view of certainty and authority in matters of public importance, was commonly availed of up to about ten years ago and many of the leading reported decisions on these aspects of the law are those of such divisional courts.</P>
    <P>Because of pressure of business in the High Court, the frequency with which the courts could be established has declined and since 1974 the President held only two, although it is understood that there were many other cases in which he felt it would have been appropriate. The restoration to the High <Col N="602" /> Court of the capacity to have important issues of a kind already outlined tried by a divisional court rather than by a single judge would release two courtrooms on occasions.  The courtroom accommodation which could be made available in the manner outlined is expected to be sufficient to meet the needs of the three proposed additional judges.  A further jury courtroom is now being planned in the area of the Four Courts building.  A court office is being renovated and a court is being created.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It is clear from what the Minister of State has said that he is able to fit in the judges by way of a shoe-horn operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very effective shoe-horn which works and will be seen to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): What about the general public and the jurors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with this matter in the course of my reply.  I understand the President of the High Court expressed satisfaction with these arrangements. That is the reality.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the comfort and general reception of litigants in the Four Courts area.  It must be admitted that the space available for jurors and litigants is inadequate.  This matter will have to be looked at urgently because the people from the country, for example, are going round in circles, they do not know what they should be doing or where they should be going.  That is not a reflection on the practitioners; rather it is a reflection on the accommodation available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already dealt with the jury system.  Deputy O'Connell raised the question of the appointment of judges, and I referred briefly to it last night. When the Coalition were in power nine appointments were made.  Those people were of the highest integrity and have not been found wanting in their service as judges.  Equally, people appointed by successive Governments, whether Fianna Fáil or Coalition, have never been <Col N="603" /> found wanting.  Therefore, the system is not a bad one.  Deputy O'Connell suggested that we should have a panel similar to the Planning Appeals Board, an excellent board which is independent of any outside interests but with respect to the Deputy's analogy, the two do not bear comparison.  On the one hand, we are dealing with planning appeals and, on the other, we are dealing with people. While I agree that people are indirectly involved in planning appeals, nevertheless the system has worked well and has been seen to have worked well.</P>
    <P>From my own experience I can only say that the system should not be abandoned at this stage.  Deputy O'Connell raised the matter as a matter of opinion and in any democracy a matter of opinion must be discussed and analysed and so on.  His opinion is not an unreasonable one.  Indeed it is an opinion that has gained considerable currency over the past ten years and people have suggested that perhaps the best way to appoint High Court judges would be by an independent tribunal or by an independent board.  It is a point of view and it is not an unreasonable point of view.  My opinion is that, having regard to the experience of the people who have been appointed to the High Court, the present system is not a bad one and it has never been found wanting.  The reality is that there has never come before these Houses of the Oireachtas the question of a judge's conduct, good, bad or indifferent.  That is not a bad record in the short history of this nation. So the present system can bear scrutiny and examination and it is a matter of opinion whether it should be changed or not.  That deals with the point raised by Deputy O'Connell and touched on by Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the moving of judges, I know what Deputy Fitzpatrick is speaking about.  I agree that, when a judge of the High Court sits in the High Court, he should not be left with the same type of duties to deal with year in and year out.  This again is a matter for the President of the High Court.  A High Court judge should not feel that a particular court is his court from the time he <Col N="604" /> goes into it to the time he retires.  The reality of the situation is that it is covered by the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961.  This entitles the President of the High Court to deal in whatever way he feels proper with the running of the High Court, so it is really a matter for the President of the High Court and it would be wrong for us to interfere in any way with that particular method.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): When I made the point I was not for one second suggesting that the Executive should start moving judges about, but I know that the President of the High Court is invested with the power to arrange the business of the High Court and to appoint judges to sit in one court and to change them about and, with due respect to everybody, I was making the point that the learned President should exercise that power more frequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the President of the High Court will read the Dáil debates on the matter and take note of what the Deputy has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of family law cases in rural areas, which was raised by Deputy Enright, is one of the more important points raised.  The point made was that family law cases are sometimes held in public.  This is a rather shocking situation because the whole spirit of family law is to give the litigants privacy, particularly in the context of the type of case involved, and to have their cases heard out of the general hearing of the public.  But again we come back to the matter of physical accommodation.  The truth is that some of the rural district courthouses here are simply not fit.  It is unfortunate indeed that the situation which Deputy Enright outlined arises, but it is a reality at the moment.  In some instances, though not in all instances, district justices in operating the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, have operated it with great compassion and with great consideration but even their limits can be stretched by the lack of accommodation. What has happened is unfortunate and all we can do is appeal to the district <Col N="605" /> justices, having regard to the lack of accommodation and the physical space available, to do their best in the circumstances until we, who in the final analysis have the ultimate responsibility, can do something about the situation and indeed to apologise to litigants who have suffered this type of humiliation.  In all the circumstances we will certainly do our best to ensure that that sort of situation will come to an end as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The law on the matter is quite clear. The Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, section 25, Conduct of Court Proceedings, states:</P>
    <P>(1)  Proceedings under this Act shall be conducted in a summary manner and shall be heard otherwise than in public.</P>
    <P>(2)  Proceedings in the High Court and the Circuit Court under this Act shall be heard in chambers.</P>
    <P>If there is no physical accommodation available in some of the courts, as outlined by Deputy Enright, I do not see how they can be conducted otherwise than in public.  It is unfortunate that this has happened but I would like to make it clear that the point is a valid one and it certainly will be listened to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright mentioned the postal strike and I dealt with that at the beginning of my reply to the various points raised by Deputies opposite.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright also mentioned the arrangement of lists of cases and proposed a preliminary calling over the lists.  It is a point and it certainly will be examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright also mentioned the matter of the High Court becoming more available on circuit.  He may be discussing original actions rather than appeals from original actions and, if that is the case, then he has a reasonable point.  However in regard to the High Court circuits, the Northern Circuit sits in Counties Cavan, Donegal, Louth, Meath, Monaghan and Westmeath.  The Southern Circuit sits in Counties Cork, Limerick and Kerry.  The Eastern Circuit sits in Counties Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Offaly, Tipperary, <Col N="606" /> Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow and the Western Circuit sits in Counties Galway, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo.  The appeal towns for the Northern Circuit are Cavan, Letterkenny, Dundalk, Trim, Monaghan and Mullingar.  The appeal towns for the Southern Circuit are Ennis, Cork, Limerick and Tralee.  The appeal towns for the Eastern Circuit are Carlow, Naas, Kilkenny, Portlaoise, Tullamore, Clonmel, Nenagh, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow and the appeal towns for the Western Circuit are Galway, Carrick-on-Shannon, Longford, Castlebar, Roscommon and Sligo. The High Court, as we know, sits in Dublin all the legal year round.  It sits in Cork three times a year, February, March and July, to hear original actions. Twice a year also, in March and October, the High Court travels throughout the country on circuit to hear appeals from the Circuit Court and while on circuit it also hears original actions in Limerick, Galway and occasionally in other centres when the demand arises and as required.  I have already outlined the appeal towns in which the High Court on circuit sits.  We know the composition of the present High Court.</P>
    <P>It is hoped, and it is certainly the wish of the President of the High Court, that when these three new appointments are made the sittings in the towns where the original hearings are heard, Limerick and Galway, will have an additional judge assigned to deal with the backlog of cases where this arises.  It is hoped indeed that, arising out of this Bill, that situation will be cured for a period of time anyway.  That may answer Deputy Enright's question about the High Court on circuit.  This Bill goes a long way to do something about it.</P>
    <P>On the question of shorthand note-takers, I understand from my own short experience at the bar that shorthand note-takers sit in on criminal cases at the moment but that there are actually recording sessions as well in criminal cases.  In other words, a technological advance has been made.  In criminal cases there is experience of actual sound recordings made of the action.  I agree with Deputy Enright in this regard.  I do not want to put shorthand note-takers <Col N="607" /> out of business, quite the contrary. However, I understand that from the point of view of speed and efficiency, while not in any way under-valuing the work being done by the court reporters, we should have recordings of High Court proceedings where necessary. This would not put the shorthand writers out of work because they would be engaged in the setting up of the machinery and in taking some shorthand notes and so on.  I expect that such an advance will be made in the High Court in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Freelance reporters are engaged sometimes by litigants. Deputy Enright referred to the appointments of more district justices.  The 1977 Act provided for an increase to 39.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The effect of that Act was to make permanent the justices who were then temporary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This also is a matter that will be kept under close review. Deputy Flanagan, while paying tribute to the justices, referred to the delay in bringing cases forward and made the point that cases should be dealt with as speedily as possible.  He welcomed the Bill in terms of its leading to the more expeditious treatment of cases but he may have implied that it was not going far enough.  In this context he and Deputy Desmond raised the possibility of the creation of more High Court judges.  Unhappily, having regard to the increase in crime in our society, and having regard also to the increase in High Court jury actions in Civil matters, there may be need in time for more High Court judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We join with Deputy Flanagan in paying tribute to all those people who have been appointed down through the years.  The Deputy suggested also that some of the ladies in the legal profession might be considered for appointment to <Col N="608" /> the High Court.  I am confident that there are women in the profession who possess all the qualities and qualifications necessary for the High Court. From my short experience of the Law Library I know that there are women there who have the highest legal qualifications.  In Britain there are lady judges in the High Court and there is no reason why, in time, we should not have women judges in the High Court here also.  That is part of modern development. Women are treated, as is proper, as equal to men in terms of job opportunities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to delays in respect of reserved judgments.  As I pointed out last night judgments are reserved usually because of the complexity of the cases involved.  When a lengthy and complex case has concluded the judge cannot be expected to write a judgment immediately.  He may have to hear a case the following day.  It may take some considerable time before a judge is free to prepare a judgment.  Effectively, he has to retry the case on his own and go through all the issues again before reaching a conclusion.  The operation is quite tortuous from the point of view of the judge.  While justice is sweetest when it is freshest, there are circumstances in which delays are unavoidable. I am sure the President of the High Court remains in touch with judges who hold reserved judgments for an unreasonable length of time.  Such cases would be the exception but there may have been some from time to time, as Deputy Bruton has suggested.  However, I am confident that the situation will be kept under constant consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton raised the question also of judgment debts.  This is a matter that can be considered in the context of other legislation, but there would appear to be an injustice in the payment of interest at only 4 per cent in respect of these debts.  That figure is scandalously low and must be updated having regard to the disgraceful bank and other charges of which all of us are well aware.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) refers to a prescription or authorisation to be issued by a registered medical practitioner and makes reference to &ldquo;a specified document&rdquo;.  For clarification of the intention of this section it would be useful if the Minister could explain the difference between a prescription and an authorisation, on the one hand and, on the other, if he could say what is the purpose of subsection (5).  It is a rather unusual subsection and I have been at a loss to understand its intention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, to take the Deputy's question about subsection (5), its purpose is to enable the Minister to make provision for certain persons like pharmacists, their employees and gardaí who in the course of their business and official duties on occasion may come to have documents in their possession.  The provision is by way of a safeguard to ensure that they will not be caught up in the general provisions about forgery, fraudulent authorisation and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It rather seems to imply as well that, apart from the rather outlandish provisions of the Bill in general, possibly there is an intention that after all this machinery is set up whereby people go to doctors to get prescriptions, go to chemists to get contraceptives, to have some sort of police force or team of forged contraceptive prescription investigators travelling the country visiting pharmacists and inspecting prescriptions that have been issued and that those people, for the purposes of carrying out that inspection, would themselves be immune from prosecution by virtue of subsection (5) and the Minister's regulations made thereunder.  I am hesitant to suggest that that extreme is what is behind this subsection. I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify that aspect for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is no intention to have any sort of exceptional police activity in this area.  In fact what is here is really on all fours with the provision in the Misuse of Drugs Act.  I do not think the Deputy was on that committee, but it is the same sort of situation.  I think the Deputy understands that most of those provisions are not really for everyday application; they are really to deal with the occasional exceptional situation.  It is necessary to provide these sorts of provisions in this type of legislation as a precautionary measure.  Most of our general experience <Col N="611" /> is that once these things are on the Statute Book they are very rarely called into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately subsection (6) ends with the words &ldquo;shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;.  Then we know that being guilty of the offence brings one under section 14 (3) which in part reads:</P>
      <P>... to a fine not exceeding £500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both the fine or fines and the imprisonment.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Minister does tend to adopt this mollifying pose, position, whatever one likes to call it, in respect of this Bill.  The hard truth is that without any doubt&mdash;it is quite obvious&mdash;he has had a very difficult time in getting this Bill brought to the House at all, seriously defective as it is, because of the intensity, dedication, vindictiveness&mdash;whatever one likes to call it&mdash;or the hostility or opposition to the Bill.  That opposition will continue to survive after this Bill goes through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming back to what I call the attempt by the Minister to mollify us into allowing a section like this to go through because it will be very rarely referred to, or very rarely brought into action.  My case is that our experience contradicts this suggestion by the Minister, that if there is any loophole at all, any way in which those opposed to this Bill can fight this Bill, can impede the extension of what they consider to be an objectionable type of contraception, that is the artificial type of contraception, they will use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore to bring in a Bill of this kind, with a section of this kind about a prescription as a specified document or authorisation, is an extremely dangerous <Col N="612" /> thing to do for those of us who do not accept the very restrictive nature of the Bill and its inbuilt hostility to the artificial methods of family planning.  This is a struggle, a conflict of ideas, attitudes and positions in a certain situation.  Obviously I must oppose the decision of the Minister to hand to what I consider my opponents in this struggle such a powerful weapon as this very heavy penalty.  I would not mind if the penalties were minor ones&mdash;warnings, and fines of £25, £50 and so on.  I would not mind that so much; I would object to it but I would not mind it so much.  Those are very heavy penalties.  If the Minister looks at the success of those impeding the extension of artificial contraceptives over the years I am sure he will realise that this is something we should not agree to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting my argument in the context of the penalties.  The penalty imposed in this Bill for the possession of an authorised condom or any of the other things is a much heavier one than the penalty in the 1977 Misuse of Drugs Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to explain that this is a purely mechanical section.  It is the sort of section which is included for operation purposes in all legislation of this sort.  There is nothing special about it so far as this Bill is concerned.  It is a safeguarding section to ensure that the terms of the Bill are adhered to by the general public and all those specifically concerned with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of the penalties is simply a reflection of the jurisdiction of the District Court.  The level of penalties which the District Court can impose on summary conviction has been increasing over the years.  My information is that the Supreme Court and the High Court would regard the level of penalties in this Bill as those which are appropriate to summary jurisdiction.  There is nothing more specific in it than that.  Each Bill which comes along has to take into account  <Col N="613" /> the movement as a result of inflation and other circumstances in the level of penalties which are appropriate to summary jurisdiction in the District Court.  It is on that basis that this Bill is framed.  There is nothing specifically penal imported into the Bill.  It is simply keeping in line with the trend in legislation generally in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so and I thank the Minister for attempting to clarify the matter.  Would the Minister not agree, even accepting that inflation has been frighteningly high, that in the case of a first offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 the fine on summary conviction was a fine not exceeding £50. In this Bill we have a fine of £500 and six months.</P>

A fine of £500 is now equated to six months.  I have a clear recollection of putting legislation through the House some years ago when £100 and six months was regarded as the equivalent level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>On that evidence it appears we are treating this matter of a prescription for a contraceptive as something which is even more dangerous than drugs.  I remember the tremendous hysteria there was when that Drugs Bill was being discussed.  I objected to it but the House took a very serious view of it.  The difference between the approach then and now in relation to the penalties makes us appear to be regarding the possession of an unauthorised contraceptive as a more dangerous thing.  A person who finds himself in the possession of an unauthorised contraceptive, having bought contraceptives abroad, brought them back here and then been accused of having them illegally brings this down to a curiously hostile and unbalanced attitude of mind.  The Minister talks about balance but if ever there was a lack of balance in the punishment fitting the crime, it certainly seems to be in this case, the idea of putting a person in jail for six months or fining that person £500&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is an outrageous proposal that an individual should have to go to a chemist with a prescription. This is a criminalising of the whole process of the contraceptive service, as if it were related to the drugs problem which could be said to be a very serious problem in any society.  If one is not taking seriously the business of whether one involves oneself in contraception or not, and if some unfortunate garda or crank comes along and says that the person has come in without a properly written prescription, one is involved in a criminal process.  The Minister frequently referred to the fact that he was glad to have taken this away from the Department of Justice and to have brought it under the Department of Health.  This kind of thing is pushing it back to the Department of Justice because it is certainly not appropriate to the Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The section reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, make a grant to a person to finance, or assist in the financing of, research into methods of family planning that do not relate to the use of contraceptives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My only objection is to the last two lines &ldquo;that do not relate to the use of contraceptives&rdquo;. I do not understand why there should be this restriction.  The Minister is correct in asking for money if he has to, which is something that a number of us doubt.  We feel that the Minister can provide money for research projects of different kinds through various devices.  It comes as a surprise to think that the Minister may not be in a position to provide money if he feels that he should.  If the Minister feels that he can get the money from the Government for this, he should get it, because there is no doubt that tubal ligation and vasectomy, which I mentioned to try to show <Col N="617" /> what I felt were the criteria, is the safest method of contraception.  Even that has its psychological problems and so on and it is not entirely safe.  However, it is the safest and then one runs down through the various kinds, the condom, the spermicides, the IUD and the pill, none of which are absolutely reliable. The pill is very tedious and is dangerous in the 35 plus class.  To answer Deputy Flanagan, we must continue to remember that pregnancy is dangerous especially in the 35-plus age group.  A person concerned with pregnancy or contraception is faced with the business of considering the question of safety which is always a great dilemma for her. My only consideration is the right of the lady choosing contraceptives to have a multiple choice of contraceptives to protect herself from pregnancy and from having an unwanted child.  None of these methods is absolutely safe.  The IUD can lead to the formation of cancer and the pill can lead to blood clotting and coronaries. This arose in the McGee case and that is why I introduced the provision for multiple choice, so that a person can decide which is the safest.  It is quite unlikely, with the exception of sterilisation which people understandably seem to accept with reluctance, that one is left with the rather unsafe methods and therefore I cannot see why the Minister would restrict them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not restricting them.  There is a very simple situation here and there is nothing convoluted about it.  I am advised that I have all the necessary statutory authority to allocate funds for research into all forms of birth control and I have existing agencies and institutions capable of carrying out that research.  There is some possible doubt that that might not extend to natural family planning and it is simply to enable funds to be spent on research into natural family planning methods that this section was put in.  It does not mean any restriction of research into natural family planning methods.  Research is going on into all these areas and there is no reason why it should not continue.  I have the statutory authority to make funds available for that and the research will be pursued.</P>

It appears to be an entirely unnecessary section within the context of the Bill because as the Minister said he has the authority to make money available for research into various matters pertaining to the health of the people.  The Government have apparently decided that the Minister for Health should have the responsibility for introducing the legislation in this field. At present the Minister has authority to make money available for research into natural family planning methods.  This section was inserted in an effort to persuade some of the Minister's colleagues who might otherwise be reluctant, to support this Bill.  If there is a need for the insertion of this section so as to validate any moneys that might be made available there is an equal need to insert a section to make moneys available for research into other methods.  There is no need for either; the section is superfluous.  It is part of the sugar coating in this legislation to make it more acceptable to some people who otherwise would not be prepared to go even the short distance that this Bill takes us.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 28a not moved.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this section because, as Deputy Boland said a moment ago, the Bill is riddled with face-savers, and this is one of them.  On section 9 the Minister had a plausible explanation for the bias in the Bill as a political protective device.  The whole is sodden with a sense of guilt at the very idea of introducing this Bill.  I submit there is not a reason on earth why section  <Col N="619" /> 10 should be in the Bill except that it is a sop to the militant natural family planning lobby.  It is their business, and I am not complaining about it.  They have worked very hard to smear this Bill, restricted and all as it is.  They have tried to lead people to believe that artificial contraception is inextricably linked with abortion, and section 10 seems to support that idea.</P>
      <P>The introduction of abortion through legislation is a very serious decision to take and though all European societies have taken it, it has never gone through without heart searching, intensity of argument and the expression of deeply held views.  It is a very profound question affecting the whole structure of society, moral outlook and so on.  It need not arise here in this Bill because if we were considering the introduction of abortion it would be done in a separate Bill, and I am sure the Minister has no intention of introducing any such Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I should be led on to defend my argument that the section should not be here when I point out that contraception&mdash;and the freer the contraception the more likely it is to happen&mdash;leads to a reduction in the number of abortions.  It is not easy to dogmatise about abortion but it might be appropriate to cite some European figures.  In Italy, when the contraception laws were at their most rigid, there was the highest level of abortion.  Another interesting figure is that in 1974, when contraception was made free in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, the rate of abortions tended to get lower.  Of course all results need not necessarily be cause and effect.  Our abortion rate is very high, a known figure of 3,500 annually, and possibly 7,000, and it has continued to rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is possible to argue that absence of free contraception tends to increase the rate of abortion rather than the other way.  I think the most compelling argument in this matter is that referred to by Deputy Vivion de Valera in relation to the 1861 Act, which is still on the Statute Book.  It is an astonishing thing to read about what happened to people and the peculiar crimes for which <Col N="620" /> provision had to be made.  Section 58 of that Act deals with abortion, and that section is still operative in our society. Therefore I do not think it is necessary to bring in section 10.  The section provides:</P>
    <P>Every women being with child who is intent to procure her own miscarriage and shall unlawfully administer to herself any poison or other noxious thing or shall unlawfully use any instrument or other means whatsoever with a like intent, and whomsoever with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman, whether she be or not with child, shall unlawfully administer to her or cause to be taken by her any poison or other noxious thing, or shall unlawfully use any instrument or any other means whatsoever with a like intent, shall be guilty of a felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable at the discretion of the Court to be kept in penal servitude for life, or for any term not less than three years, or to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years with or without hard labour and with or without solitary confinement.</P>
    <P>The Minister's mild, practically innocuous section looks very strange side by side with the enactment already there, which is binding and I would imagine being held <i>in terrorem</i>.  I think the last time it was used was in the 1950s when the case ended up with a life sentence in Dundrum or a sentence of penal servitude.</P>
    <P>To use his own phrase, if he is <i>bona fide</i> interested in the proposition that abortion shall not be carried out, he should take that section of the 1861 Act and introduce it in his own Bill, if what he wants to do is to frighten people from carrying out abortions.  Section 10 looks silly side by side with that section of the 1861 Act.  I share Deputy Boland's belief that this was put in in support of the hostile and inaccurate propaganda&mdash;I suppose all propaganda is inaccurate in some way but this is deliberately inaccurate&mdash;designed to create the impression that once we follow family planning to be accepted here, particularly the use of artificial contraceptive, then we would be heading on the high road to legal <Col N="621" /> abortion, euthanasia and all the other dreadful threats made over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in total agreement with all the points made by Deputy Browne on this section.  My main disappointment in relation to the section is that no attempt was made to define abortifacients.  Section 7 of the 1974 Bill stated:</P>
      <P>The Minister may appoint a Committee to advise him on whether or not a particular appliance, instrument, drug, preparation or thing, or an applicance, instrument, drug, preparation or thing of a particular class, is an abortifacient (whether or not the applicance, instrument, drug, preparation or thing is also a contraceptive).</P>
      <P>(2)  The Committee shall consist of not more than five persons and shall include persons with medical qualifications.</P>
      <P>(3)  A licence under section 2, 3 or 4 shall not be granted in respect of a contraceptive which in the opinion of the Committee is also an abortifacient.</P>
      <P>Apart from all the other difficulties we have dealt with in relation to the situation doctors and pharmacists will find themselves in when endeavouring to implement this measure they will have the continuing problem of whether or not items which they prescribe as contraceptives may also be described as abortifacients in their effect.  Consequently, that places the doctor in the invidious position of having to define for himself whether or not a contraceptive is an abortifacient and whether, if he prescribes it, he is unwittingly putting himself outside the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the other unacceptable requirements the Minister is endeavouring to place upon doctors in this legislation, I do not believe it is fair to expect a doctor, without any guidance from the Legislature to establish what is or is not an abortifacient.  There has been a continuing debate over the years as to the abortifacient effect of some artificial contraceptives and there are varying schools of thought in relation to this matter.  The Minister may make the <Col N="622" /> argument that because there is varying opinion on this matter it is impossible for him to provide a definition of what is or is not an abortifacient but whatever his difficulties might be they are nothing in comparison with the difficulties which thousands of medical practitioners and pharmacists will find themselves in when they see, for instance, that the sale, importation to the State, manufacture, advertising or display of abortifacients are not authorised by the Bill.  It is possible that they are being placed outside the law in the prescribing, importing or selling of items which might subsequently be found by the courts or otherwise to be abortifacients.</P>
    <P>Had the Minister used the same device that was used in 1974 to deal with this matter, the appointment of a committee to issue guidelines or definitions as to what was or was not an abortifacient, he would have improved this legislation immeasurably.  Some Members went into detail on this matter on Second Stage but, in spite of that, the Minister has not seen fit to enter any amendment to meet that case.  I would have thought that the arguments made in relation to this might have been acceptable to the Minister and his colleagues. I was disappointed that the Minister did not make any effort to assist doctors and chemists who will be involved in the morass the passage of this legislation will create in relation to what is or is not an abortifacient.</P>

      <P>I will make an attempt to bring about a discussion on a similar amendment on Report Stage.  I viewed this section as one of the most important in the Bill.  It is noteworthy that those responsible for the drafting of the section titled it &ldquo;saver in relation to abortion&rdquo;.  Those responsible might easily have dropped the words &ldquo;saver in relation to&rdquo; and titled the section &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; because that is what the section deals with.  I am surprised and astonished that the Minister has brought in such an evilly disposed and ill-conceived piece of legislation, with particular reference to section 10.  I am also surprised at the lack of examination of all the implications involved by those responsible for the drafting of the section. The section states that nothing in the Act shall be construed as authorising the procuring of abortion and it is extraordinary that in 1979 we take such a provision so casually without serious thought.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that in a democratic Parliament dealing with such a section which in proper terms means the procuring of murder, the participation in murder and killing, there are only four Members present.  It is a poor commentary on the interest shown by Members of this House and on the outlook of the nation, that a section of a Bill which deals with the taking of human life can pass so casually through the House. Everyone knows that there are many countries&mdash;including our nearest neighbour, Britain&mdash;in which abortion has been legalised but this does not in any way, justify these numerous murders taking place and it must have a disturbing effect on the mind and conscience of everyone connected with it.  It has been established, and can easily be established, despite the opinions of learned medical authorities such as Deputy Browne or any other medical subscriber to this Bill, that most of the contraceptives which can be prescribed will bring about, and are bringing about, abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are only four Deputies in the House and this very section that we are dealing with so casually is an attack on human life.  It is a cover-up.  The title of the Bill is a saver in relation to abortion <Col N="624" /> and a saver in relation to killing.  We must bear in mind that human life comes from God alone and He alone can take away human life.  We have read of the deplorable and disastrous experiences of people in hospitals engaged in the administration of abortion.  They can see the baby&mdash;which can rightly be described as a baby, with all its features&mdash;left on a tray, gasping for life, moving and kicking, and while it is resting on that tray it must be murdered. How can people justify such an action&mdash;the murder of a baby, physically able to cry, to turn, able to move its gentle and feeble muscles?  Almighty God is the giver of human life and no Act of Parliament, no political party, no Minister of a Government, no authority in existence, has the right to take away that life, or interfere with it.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed that the section is titled a saver in relation to abortion.  No matter what safeguards we include someone will drive a coach and four through this legislation.  As an example, Finance Bills were tightened up, secured, fastened down, but there always was a group who could drive a coach and four through them.  The very fact that abortion and murder are mentioned in a section of this Bill will give new energies to the motivation of intellectuals who have been pressing for this legislation.  These people will next be pressing for abortion.  They will be examining, with all their modern intelligence and the best possible materialistic and pagan medical opinion that can be gathered, in what way they get around this legislation, like the tax dodgers under the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a lobby here, particularly in relation to section 10 of this Bill, that is not satisfied with seeing a Bill of this kind being passed.  They will look upon a Bill containing this section as giving them a right, something to go on, since section 10 titles itself a saver in relation to abortion.  They will organise pressure groups so that, at a later stage, a coach and four can be driven through paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of section 10. A few years ago, it was looked upon as improper and wrong to advocate family planning, other than the natural method, by advertising and display of a variety of <Col N="625" /> notices in papers, journals and books. No matter how the Minister may think he is tightening section 10 it will not prevent the movers and those behind the scenes who are seeking to destroy human life and to legalise abortion from advertising.  The section contains only feeble wording in relation to the sale, importation, manufacture, advertising or display of abortifacients.  The wording of the section is too loose.  Who is going to decide what contraceptive is an abortifacient? People will be able to drive a coach and four through section 10 and other sections of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us, and I accept his word, that he has discussed this legislation with all interests.  Section 10 must have been the subject of major discussion. I doubt if anyone could have gone to the Minister to discuss family planning legislation without dealing with the question of abortion, the safeguards against abortion and what steps must be taken to discourage by every means in our power the taking of human life.  The Minister must have had many discussions in relation to this matter.  I should like to ask the Minister if he has given very considerable thought when drafting this legislation to the teachings of the Catholic Church in relation to abortion, or was he and those responsible in his Department for materialistic and pagan legislation such as this prepared to throw aside the teachings of Christ, prepared to throw aside the teachings of the Catholic Church and to seek so-called truth elsewhere?</P>
    <P>Life commences at conception.  What greater authority could the Minister have been advised by other than the teachings of the Catholic Church in relation to the taking of human life?  In the world today there are people who take their own meaning from what is written with authority.  Ten years ago <i>Humanae Vitae</i> was issued and it was one of the most important documents in the past 2,000 years which set out a code of conduct and guidance.  It dealt clearly with human life, the protection and value of human life and it referred to the way governments and legislators were to regard human life in their legislation.  I do not know to what extent the officers in the Department of Health or in any <Col N="626" /> other Department involved in legislation of this kind took <i>Humanae Vitae</i> as a guideline&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I am asking the Minister in what way he considered the teachings of the Catholic Church on human life and the way in which abortion, the killing of life, has been condemned.  I wish to quote from <i>L'Osservatore Romano</i> of 14 September 1978 a paragraph from an article by Most Rev. Dr. William Gordon Wheeler, Bishop of Leeds, <i>Humanae Vitae, 1968-1978</i>.  Bishop Wheeler stated:</P>
      <P>I would reply that politics, on their own, have no answer.</P>
      <P>He was dealing with the taking of human life.  He continued:</P>
      <P>Certainly they could help by acknowledging the dire consequences of this destruction and frustration of life.  They could indeed set about the revocation of all legislation that destroys human life and dignity.  They could also initiate positive enactments to extol the real meaning of life in time and eternity.  In addition, they will have to acknowledge, sooner or later, that there are realms in the governance of man which are beyond their competence.  They should be listening anew to the voice of the Creator. Neither opinion polls nor majority votes are on a par with the truth that comes from God alone.</P>
      <P>They were the views of a very eminent churchman dealing with the dignity of human life and the respect there should be for human life.  The State has a right to acknowledge completely the teachings of the Catholic Church as laid down very clearly in <i>Humanae Vitae</i> which sets out the guidelines not alone for all Catholics but for all Christian people who seek the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Minister has completely rejected the teachings of the Catholic Church in relation to the dignity and <Col N="627" /> respect for human life in this section, where did he look for advice and guidance? On page 4 of <i>L'Osservatore Romano</i> Bishop Wheeler said:</P>
    <P>The right to life is at a discount. More human life was destroyed in one year of Abortion in U.S.A. than in the whole of the Vietnam War.</P>
    <P>... It can never be right for her to declare lawful what is in fact unlawful, because this, by its very nature, is <i>always opposed to the true good of man.</i></P>
    <P>He referred to statesmen and men in public life with reference to contraception and abortion.  This paragraph clearly relates to this section of the Bill:</P>
    <P>If only people would read the whole of <i>Humanae Vitae</i>, which they rarely do, they would realise that it is a document, not only of great appreciation of love in marriage and the indespensable role of the Christian family, but also one of great compassion. These things were overlooked ten years ago when the outcry centred on the few lines dealing explicitly with contraception.</P>
    <P>He quotes the words of Christ himself when he says &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and have it more abundantly.</P>

      <P>The Deputy appears to be making a Second Reading speech.  He should get back to section 10.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with a serious problem of which the Minister is afraid.  Otherwise the saver in relation to abortion would not be mentioned here.  Direct abortion is never, under any circumstances, allowable. Direct abortion like any other form of abortion can be described as taking human life and, in plain language, can be described as murder.  Since the Minister is responsible for this section, I would like to know if he consulted the pronouncements on this subject, particularly that made by the late Pope Pius XII, who said that every human being, <Col N="628" /> even a child in its mother's womb, has the right to life directly from God, not from parents or from any human society or authority.  No human authority, no medical, social, economic or moral indication can produce a judicial title to the direct deliberate disposal of an innocent human life.  Whether it be a saver in relation to abortion or otherwise, these are statements of truth which those who advocate abortion can never disprove.</P>
      <P>If we are to have savers in relation to abortion those provided in section 10 are very poor and do not mean anything. There is a prohibition under section 58 of the Offences Against the Persons Act, 1861 and a few feeble lines about the sale, importation into the State, manufacture, advertising or display of abortifacients.  There is also the question of consultation.  There is nothing to prevent anyone having consultations about abortions.</P>
      <P>Men in public life must shoulder their share of the responsibility.  Instead of providing a welcome for a human life, the facilities which would enable that human life to develop, expand and extend, and which should be available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is getting away from the section. I would ask the Deputy to deal with the section.  I have given him plenty of latitude.  The section deals with prohibiting abortions and we cannot have a full scale debate on the whole scene of abortion.  I would ask Deputy Flanagan to get down to the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">

      <P>Not alone does the Minister owe the House more information  <Col N="629" /> but he owes the nation in general greater safeguards than are provided in section 10.  The Minister is aware of the position in other countries in regard to this matter.  He must also be aware of the effect, for example, in Sweden where abortion has been legalised and has resulted in psychiatric disturbances in women who have procured abortions. There is nothing in this section which conveys the seriousness of this matter. The savers cannot be regarded as such. That is why I feel the Minister is regarding abortion as an everyday occurrence and something that is not worthy of serious note instead of regarding it as the most serious and the gravest possible crime that one could be guilty of, the carrying out of murder, the taking of human life.  For that reason I thought that the amendment I had suggested earlier would answer the case and I hope, with the assistance of the Minister and the Chair, that it may be possible for me to get this in on Report Stage, as I will certainly try to do.  It is the most important section in the Bill. Abortion is wrong; it is dangerous; it is murder; it is an attack on human life; it is an attack on everything we stand for. For that reason I feel that this legislation is not alone wrong but is evilly disposed; it is the most evilly disposed section in the whole Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I referred to the marginal note at the side of the section to which Deputy Flanagan has referred.  I want to assure the House&mdash;though my assurance may not be necessary because the majority of Deputies experienced in passing legislation know it&mdash;that these notes are really of no statutory significance or legislative import; they are more in the nature of aids to the person perusing the legislation. Primarily they are for the purpose of identification so that a person flicking through the legislation will be able readily to identify the section or part of the legislation he is seeking.  I merely mention that in passing.  They are of no legislative significance of any sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing I want to say is that Deputy Flanagan is not correct when he says that the approach to this section is casual.  I want to assure the House again <Col N="630" /> that this section was the subject of long, careful and earnest consideration by me and by my advisers because it deals with something of fundamental importance, something which many people in our community feel very strongly about.  It is a subject about which there is, perhaps more than anything else in modern life here, an almost overwhelming consensus.</P>
    <P>The first question I had to consider was whether or not it was necessary to put in a section of this sort at all.  There is already a statutory provision against abortion in the Offences Against the Persons Act, 1861.  It is a provision which has stood the test of time.  The first question one has to address oneself to is whether or not it is desirable to leave that section stand without doing anything further because it has stood the test of time.</P>
    <P>I am certain that there is an overwhelming opinion in this country against abortion.  Whatever divided views there may be about contraception and family planning and about the use of artificial contraceptives there is an almost overwhelming universal agreement that abortion is wrong and should be statutorily prohibited.  I do not think any Deputy in the House would quarrel with that view.  Therefore, taking that strong universal opinion into account it seemed to me that it was desirable to restate the law, if possible, in more positive terms than hitherto on the prohibition of abortion.  Hence we have section 10.  The section is constructed very carefully.  It is framed to ensure that the original section in the Act of 1861, which has stood the test of time, would not be taken from in any way and also that in so far as further provisions were necessary, they would be made.  I suggest that, first, the section is necessary and, secondly, that in the manner in which it is put forward it meets the purposes I have outlined.  The wishes of the majority of the people would be, I think, that the statutory prohibition of abortion should continue and also that anything which in effect is abortifacient would be prohibited.</P>
    <P>The only real argument about the section is whether abortifacients should be defined and in this context I take note of <Col N="631" /> Deputy Boland's suggestion that the legislation should provide for the establishment of a committee to advise the Minister on whether any contraceptive device was an abortifacient.  I thought about that, too, but what we are doing here is in keeping with the best principles of legislation.  There is always a temptation in drafting legislation to say too much, to try to nail everything down, but very often one finds that the further one goes in trying to tie up every loose end the worse the situation becomes. Therefore, the best type of legislation is the simple and straightforward kind.  I suppose that the ultimate in that respect are the Ten Commandments which take the form of &ldquo;thou shalt&rdquo; or &ldquo;thou shalt not&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I consider the section as it is framed to be the right way to tackle the problem.  We state simply that abortifacients are prohibited legally.  If we begin to spell out the type of abortifacients we have in mind we are, <i>ipso facto</i>, including all those that we do not mention but that is a type of problem that presents itself in practically every piece of legislation one prepares.  It is fairly clearly established by now that, unless it is absolutely necessary to do otherwise, the best procedure in legislation is to have simple and straightforward statements of what one has in mind.  That is the process we have adopted on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that medical knowledge in regard to what is or what is not abortifacient is changing and evolving.  In regard to most contraceptive devices, the majority of medical people would reserve their opinion.  They would not be prepared to state categorically whether any type of artificial contraceptive is abortifacient.  In this regard I quote with approval what Deputy O'Connell had to say during the course of the debate, as reported at column 266 of the Official Report for May 9:</P>
    <P>I do not see any need to include a definition of abortifacient in this Bill. In the present state of our medical knowledge, we are not in a position to say what are and what are not abortifacients.   <Col N="632" /> There is only medical conjecture about how these drugs act.</P>
    <P>I agree with that view.  Therefore, the right approach seems to be that the legislation would state simply the prohibition against abortifacients and then to leave the decision in any case to medical evidence before the courts, if necessary, as to whether the device in question is an abortifacient.</P>
    <P>In that connection, too, there is a development which may go some way to meeting Deputy Boland's concern, that is, that the Irish Medical Association at their recent annual general meeting set up a special committee to study the question and the advice of that committee will be available to me as well as to others in relation to the implementation of the legislation.  But given the state of medical knowledge and opinion now the proper way to frame this section is to indicate that abortifacients are prohibited legally and then to decide in any particular case that may arise whether the object in question is an abortifacient.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to follow the wide-ranging path taken by Deputy Flanagan.  It is not necessary for me to do that and neither is it necessary for him to persuade anybody here that the legislation should categorically prohibit abortion.  That is common ground on the part of practically every Deputy and among the overwhelming majority of the population, ordinary men and women. The only point I think I should take up with the Deputy is the question of whether the section is adequate.  The general thrust of his remarks was to the effect that the section is inadequate and will not achieve the purpose which both he and I and most other Deputies have in mind.  I suggest that the section achieves what we set out to achieve and I am reinforced in that view by the fact that the amendments which Deputy Flanagan sought to have made would not add anything to the section as framed.  I have studied them very carefully.  I have taken advice about them and it seems to me they would not add anything to the strength of the section.</P>
    <P>I believe the section is as watertight and as categoric as it can be.  I am not <Col N="633" /> saying that by way of defeating Deputy Flanagan's amendments because they are not before us.  I am merely saying that to illustrate that the section is adequate. If Deputy Flanagan, with all the intensity he feels about this subject, could not devise amendments which in my view would add to the strength of the section, then the section must be adequate as it stands.  I am quite satisfied that, if one goes into the wording of the section and the amendments, one will find that there is nothing in the amendments which would strengthen the section, make it more secure or adequate in any way.</P>
    <P>My position on this section is very clear-cut and very definite.  I believe I am interpreting the universal wish of the people in continuing the statutory prohibition against abortion and abortifacients. I believe this action does that adequately.  I cannot envisage anything further that I need do in this particular area.  I want to avail of this opportunity to mention my approval&mdash;I know most Deputies would agree with me&mdash;of the efforts of those organisations which are endeavouring to deal with the tragedy of abortion in the community and to assure them of any support they may need in their work.  That is perhaps outside the scope of the discussion on this section, Sir, and if I were to go into that area you might bring me back to the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said.  While I disagree with Deputy Browne in relation to what he has said about the section I appreciate the necessity for inserting this section in the legislation and that it should be clarified that the Bill is not authorising or providing for abortion in any way. The necessity for inserting section 10 is because of the confusion as to what is or is not an abortifacient.  I am particularly upset that the Minister sees the section improved because the Irish Medical Association have set up a committee to advise the medical profession about what they believe to be abortifacient in its effect. That confirms the point of view which my party hold, that there is a very grey area about what is an abortifacient. A large responsible element representing many, but not all, of the medical profession  <Col N="634" /> in the country, the Irish Medical Association, have now publicly recognised that and said that they are setting up a committee to advise their members.</P>
      <P>Should the committee not have been written into the Bill so that the Minister might be advised in a formal statutory way and so that doctors when prescribing and chemists when supplying would know clearly where they stand?  On other occasions Ministers are at pains to point out that anything which is not written into the statutes does not have the full weight and power of the law.  I accept the very good work which the committee of the Irish Medical Association will do in this area.  We are now being advised to accept that the work of that committee will have the effect of providing the guidelines necessary for the unfortunate professional people who are invited to try to implement this measure.  Would it not have copper-fastened the position of the medical profession so that they would know that a committee enshrined in the legislation under section 10 had advised the Minister that devices (a), (b) and (c) were in their view abortifacient and that the Minister by the way section 10 is worded would automatically make it clear that the prescribing of those devices for contraceptive purposes would be illegal because it was the view of the committee set up under the Bill that they were abortifacient in their effect? That will not be the situation now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While any recommendation which the IMA committee will make to their members will be helpful in assisting them to come to a decision, it will not be binding on them.  It will not be binding either on any other person who is in dispute about the abortifacient effect of some of those devices.  The Minister should realise that there is likely to be a situation where some people who are totally opposed to the prescribing of artificial contraceptives in any shape or form and who feel very strongly that some of the artificial contraceptives are abortifacients in their effect will afterwards exhort the Director of Public Prosecutions to take prosecutions against doctors because they have prescribed things which those persons or <Col N="635" /> organisations will put up evidence to show are abortifacient in their effect. This will leave everybody involved in this field in a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>Surely the way to clarify that would be to have an expert committee enshrined in the legislation and that their decisions as to what is or is not abortifacient in its effect would be the guidelines which could be implemented by doctors?  That would have been a far preferable situation from the point of view of the Irish Medical Association.  I invite the Minister, between now and Report Stage of the Bill, to consider the points of view I have put forward and which are very much like the points of view that would presumably have been put forward by Deputy Flanagan in amendment No. 28a, which would to a large extent have the same effect as the viewpoints I have put forward.  I ask the Minister to have a serious discussion about this with the medical interests with whom he has had discussions in the preparation of the initial Bill as to whether or not it might be preferable if such an amendment were written into the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain sympathy with the Minister because he is caught between two fires.  I do not care to discuss the merits or otherwise of abortion because I believe it would require a separate Bill put forward to defend it.  I was glad that the Irish Medical Association established a committee to clear their own minds on this issue of the abortifacient nature of some of the drugs and appliances that are being used for their own use and so on.  But there is this danger, if we write this into the Bill.  The Irish Medical Association are notoriously anti&mdash;well not notoriously anti, that would be unfair&mdash;but there is this fairly powerful influential group of people within the Irish Medical Association. This is true of all medical associations.  I think I said earlier in the debate that doctors, and particularly gynaecologists, were particularly opposed to the extension of contraception, for obvious reasons&mdash;conscientious reasons I know, <Col N="636" /> at times out obviously there is a large vested interest involved also.  But it is quite obvious that any committee set up by the Minister to advise him on this, as was suggested by Deputy Boland, must contain a number of the most authoritative and influential members of the medical profession, particularly the gynaecologists.</P>
      <P>If I might read from a newspaper report of a speech by Dr. Arthur Barry, a distinguished gynaecologist, on this subject it might make my point for me better:</P>
      <P>Artificial contraceptives were anti-life and inevitably led to the propagation of abortion clinics and abortion on demand, a gynaecologist claimed yesterday.... Dr. Barry said the two methods could not be taught by the same people, or even housed in the same building since one method was for life and the other anti-life.</P>
      <P>Then talking about religious instruction to young people he added:</P>
      <P>... that those giving religious instruction to young people should ensure their pupils knew contraception was a grave sin.  Dr. Barry stressed that artificial contraception led to abortion and the women who embark on this evil course, and the doctors and nurses who carry out the murder, are just as blood-soaked as the soldiers sent down by Herod from the Fortress of Antonia in Jerusalem to slay the innocents of Bethlehem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fighting words.  I am just attempting to establish that the Minister might find himself the prisoner of these very deeply and fervently held views.  But, at the same time, they are views which are really unsustainable with regard to the majority of methods now in use and particularly the one conditionally referred to by me as the most satisfactory, the sterilisation, and then the condom, spermicides. But in between there is no doubt that there is a difference of opinion.  The Minister might then find himself with some of the pills on which I understand there is the greatest difference of opinion, as Deputy Dr. O'Connell said, and not absolute certainty about some of them.  I am afraid this is a question on <Col N="637" /> which the Minister must take a stand&mdash;it is one of the responsibilities of being a Minister in a situation like that&mdash; between the arguments he hears on both sides here, and three sides in this case. He must eventually arbitrate between us all and make his decision.  His decision is to try to introduce an efficient family planning service which would be safe, effective, affording multiple choice, accepting the different kinds of ladies who would be requiring it.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot pass that decision on to anybody else, unless he was to broaden the committee, have some medical people, and then have alternative opinions.  He might then save himself being put into a very dangerous situation in which his Bill is completely negatived by a recommendation of this body on, say, the pill, by the doctor who is opposed to these things generally but who said that the pill is the safest of all of these.  The Minister might find himself under this section, or in accordance with the committee advising him, depriving the majority of people who wanted to use the safest of methods&mdash;or the easiest or most acceptable method, I suppose, as things are at present&mdash;of the pill by a decision of this committee.  Therefore, he would have to be very cautious before he decided this.</P>
    <P>I shall not pursue the discussion on abortion at all because it is much too complex and emotive; there are too many great issues involved in it.  I have the greatest sympathy for Deputy Flanagan in his very powerful indictment of it but I do not think it is as simple as he makes it appear.  For instance, from my recollection of my training years, many years ago now, I understand that the Catholic Church accepts that in certain very dire circumstances it is permissible to carry out an abortion.  I understand that that is in circumstances where the life of the mother is at stake. Therefore, it is not a simple subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, but it is not a black and white subject at all.  Secondly, <Col N="638" /> I would make this point to him: that what is now called natural family planning was at one stage considered an anathema by the Catholic Church, that they have come round to the position at present of accepting it as the acceptable form for Catholics.  It is a good thing they have done that.  But there is no reason why people other than Catholics, that is, Presbyterians, Church of Ireland, Jewish people, atheists, agnostics and all these other minority religions in our society&mdash;elsewhere it is different&mdash;should have to wait for the Catholic Church to make its mind up in order to be able to carry out a particular procedure.  In a final reference to his comment that it can never be right for the church to declare lawful that which is in itself unlawful, I remember once taking up this point with a very distinguished theologian from Maynooth, at present in the United States, at a public meeting when I put this point to him, not arising out of the natural and artificial but on another issue: how could it be that at a certain time in the life of society, in the life of the Catholic Church, something which would be considered permissible, acceptable, at another period in its life was considered to be sinful?  His answer to me&mdash;I suppose a very responsible, mature, sophisticated answer, however one likes to describe it&mdash;was that this all arose from the factor of the changing world, in the changing world.  Naturally for most of us politicians who would like to be able to accept that kind of political philosophy, at the same time it is, I suppose, rational, understandable, something that has got to be accepted. But it is also a fact which has allowed us to make the progress we have made even to getting to this stage of discussing family planning today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  In an endeavour to enlighten the House and indeed Deputy Browne, no theologian, modern or ancient, can change the fact that the Fifth Commandment of God is there: fifth, thou shalt not kill.  No theologian, past, present or future, can alter that.  With reference to what the Minister has said&mdash;and I shall not repeat one syllable <Col N="639" /> of what I have already said on this section&mdash;this section is like a mouth without teeth trying to chew stones. Would the Minister agree that this section would be stronger if it included a few lines pinning the complete responsibility on the manufacturer, so that in the event of a contraceptive having been proved to have brought about an abortion the manufacturer would be responsible as were the manufacturers of the thalidomide drug, against whom great, justifiable claims were made.  If a person accepts on a medical prescription that a contraceptive will not bring about an abortion she should be able to claim against the manufacturer if an abortion results from using the contraceptive. There seems to be a difference of opinion within the medical profession as to what will or will not cause an abortion.  The Minister should pin the responsibility on the manufacturer.  If the responsibility were on the licensed manufacturer it would not rest with varied, undecided medical opinion.  There would be nothing wrong with putting firm teeth into section 10 in this manner.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 5, after &ldquo;contraceptives&rdquo; to add &ldquo;provided that in any legal proceedings the burden of proof of conscientious objection will rest on the person claiming to rely on it&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned with the conscientious objection clause.  I accept that people have a right to object on a point of principle but it is not quite as simple as that. Conscientious objections have had a distinguished record in men's history from the beginning of time.  We are all well aware of the marvellously courageous <Col N="640" /> attitude of the pacifists in times of war, and their refusal to carry out something which is contrary to their conscience. Nobody would object to that.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be passed as a decision of the Government and will be binding on all our citizens.  One cannot lightly feel that one can resist the law unless one makes a case which can be justified in court.  In relation to the decision by Deputy Gibbons, his conscientious objection there must be a matter of considerable embarrassment to the Minister for Health.  His stand seems to be completely indefensible because whatever about the right of the private individual to dissent and to establish his right in a court of law, I cannot see how a Government member can dissent from his Cabinet responsibility as laid down in the Constitution.  The Cabinet as a whole are collectively responsible to Parliament for legislation, and the Taoiseach has no right or power to minimise that responsibility because in so doing he ignores the constitutional requirement that</P>
    <P>The Government shall meet and act as a collective authority, and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably right to give certain powers of dissent, but I want to ensure that a person who seeks to establish a point in court will be responsible for any of the expenses incurred in taking such a case to court.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister agree that while we all accept that a person could have a conscientious objection on an issue of this kind if he wants to establish it then, as most conscientious objectors throughout history had to do, they must suffer to some extent at least in establishing the genuine nature of their conscientious objection so that people will not use the conscientious objection clause in a frivolous way to get out of doing work that somebody else will have to do.  They can prove their conscientious objection if they take an action in court and are responsible for paying for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all there is not a definition of &ldquo;conscientious objection&rdquo;. That is the point I was trying to make, and Deputy Browne alluded to it.  What is a conscientious objection?  Is it the consistency that has been shown by Deputy Oliver Flanagan and others on this side, or is it political expediency? The Minister has a neck to speak about conscientious objection when his party did not see any need for it during the debate on the Bill before the House while the Coalition were in Government.  If anything highlights Fianna Fáil's duplicity in this regard, this section does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points about this amendment.  First of all, I do not think it can be translated into practical terms.  The amendment speaks about legal proceedings.  It is not anticipated there will be legal proceedings. The section as framed states that a person can refuse to participate in the implementation of the legislation on conscientious grounds.  I cannot visualise a situation in which there would be legal proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that on conscientious grounds a number of them will refuse to participate, but that would not be a ground for legal proceedings. Therefore, on practical grounds the amendment does not stand up, is not necessary and is not called for.  The second point is in relation to Deputy Browne's thinking on this matter, which astonishes me.  Of all Deputies, I would have thought the one to stand out for the rights of a conscientious objector in any situation would be Deputy Browne.  His suggestion that a conscientious objector has to prove the grounds of his objection would surely be a negation of the right conscientiously to object.  I would have thought that an objection based on conscience is something entirely for the individual to decide.  I do not think anybody should go inside another person's conscience, and how then can a person establish the right of an individual to a conscientious objection?  I would have thought that any interference with the right of an individual conscientiously to object to something would be anathema to Deputy Browne.  I have to reject the amendment because of its impracticality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of conscientious objection, it has been traditional, and obviously in the last war, that people do not want to go to war though they would be under orders to go to war at a time of general mobilisation. In the last war, if they claimed they had conscientious objection to violence, to killing people, obviously they had to go before boards to assess the cases they made, simply to establish that it was not a matter of claiming privilege&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy does not approve of having to go before a board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person disapproved of something and if somebody else had to do it because he did not do it, he must establish that his reasons for not doing it were not simply from selfishness or because he did not want to expose himself to danger, that it would be better if somebody else did it.  That is not conscientious objection but self-interest.  If <Col N="643" /> your concern was that you did not want to kill somebody in war time, then you would have to establish you are not a person who wanted somebody else to do your fighting for you, like so many of our armchair militants in relation to Northern Ireland, but that you were a person who felt genuinely that it was repugnant to you as a human being to take up arms against a fellow human being. Having established that, such a person would then go off and do some rather dreadful unpleasant work.  Such a person would have to accept that he must prove he was prepared to do some menial work in order to show the sincerity of his objection.</P>

      <P>The newspaper article referred to by the Deputy examines the trend in take home pay in the period end-February to end-November, 1979.  The author concludes that, for a single person earning £70 a week, the increase in take-home pay during that period would be 8.39 per cent, while the corresponding increase for a married man with two children earning <Col N="645" /> £90 per week would be 9.34 per cent. Latest estimates of movements in the consumer price index during the period mid-February to mid-November 1979 suggest that the increase will be of the order of 7 per cent during the period. Quite apart from the substantial increase in real incomes enjoyed by the workforce in 1978, therefore, the Government's pay policy will enable workers to enjoy a modest increase in real incomes during the period in which the policy will be in force.</P>
      <P>Given the deterioration in the economic outlook due to both the higher cost and restricted supply of oil as well as the damage caused by industrial disputes, there is little scope for any real improvement in incomes this year for those already at work.  The best that can be hoped for in growth terms, this year, would be a rise of about 5 per cent. Higher oil prices will absorb 1 to 2 per cent of this, representing a transfer of income abroad which cannot be compensated, a further 2 per cent would be accounted for by the incomes of those newly employed&mdash;here the aim would be to at least match last year's rise&mdash;this would leave at best somewhere between 1 to 2 per cent for improving incomes of those at work, and even this would not be possible unless there is maximum co-operation from all sections.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>One Irish pound is now equivalent to approximately £0.95 sterling.  The difference is due essentially to the recent strength of sterling against all the EMS currencies including the Irish pound.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to quantify the effects upon trade with Great Britain and Northern Ireland of the deviation between the two currencies in the current year.  This will depend on various factors, including the magnitude and direction of currency fluctuations during the rest of the year.  In general, it can be said that the present depreciation of the Irish pound against sterling should, if it continues, in the short term help to improve competitiveness of Irish industrial products in the British and Northern Ireland markets and also on the home market against goods from these areas. The same applies for the 10 per cent of agricultural exports which are not covered by the CAP.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the present depreciation will give rise to some increases in import costs.  As regards other possible disadvantages, I covered these in my reply to previous questions from the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the implications for trading relationships with other countries, these would depend upon the exchange rate changes involved.  For trade with our other European partners, we have, of course, exchange rate stability through our membership of the EMS.  Generally speaking, it can be said <Col N="649" /> that we have managed to maintain the competitiveness of Irish goods in third countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain the consistency of deciding unilaterally on economic issues and pleading for political consideration on the other hand?  Does he not consider that economic co-operation between North and South is only equally as important as political co-operation between North and South?  How can the deputy leader of a Government and a party who proclaim that they seek Irish unity decide unilaterally on economic issues without considering the political implications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the decision to join the EMS at a time when it was clear that Britain was not entering.  If that is what he is referring to, the reasons and the considerations involved were debated fully in this House.  I note that at that time the Deputy had an opportunity to vote against that decision but chose not to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, 25 per cent of our total exports will benefit by the devaluation of the IR£ against sterling. On the other hand, is it not true that roughly 50 per cent of our imports come from the UK and that all of them will be affected by the devaluation of the IR£? Therefore, the advantage which the Minister claims&mdash;even though he admits that it is only short term&mdash;in the revaluation of the two currencies is very temporary and the fact that we have to pay more, particularly for capital goods and raw materials for reprocessing, will reflect very quickly in the increased costs of Irish goods going to other markets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the amount and terms on which loans or grants are to be made available to Ireland (a) from the EEC, and (b) as a result of bilateral negotiations, in connection with our entry to the EMS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the Community measures.  At their meeting last December, the European Council decided in favour of Community measures designed to strengthen the economies of the less prosperous member states participating in the EMS. Under these measures, loans of up to 333 million European Units of Account&mdash;that is £225 million&mdash;per year from the European Investment Bank and the New Community Instrument (Ortoli Facility) are being made available on special conditions to Ireland over a five-year period.  These loans, which are to be concentrated on the financing of selected infrastructure projects and programmes, are to be subsidised, at a rate of 3 per cent.  The value of these interest subsidies will be about 67 million EUA&mdash;£45 million&mdash;per year over the five-year period; a total of £225 million. The subsidies will be payable to Ireland on a capitalised basis with their full value being paid over when the loans are borrowed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the bilateral transfers which our Community partners have agreed to make as a result of negotiations, the position is as follows.  The transfer from the Federal Republic of Germany is conditional on the Government raising at least DM 150 million&mdash;£37 million&mdash;by way of long-term loans from German credit institutions in each of the years 1979 and 1980.  The 1979 borrowing has been completed and the first instalment of the bilateral aid, equivalent to about £13.3 million, is to be paid on 2 July 1979.  A similar payment will arise in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessary financial protocol with <Col N="653" /> the French authorities was signed on 27 April 1979.  The bilateral aid is to include certain trade credits at reduced interest rates and a 23-year loan to the Government at a rate of interest of 3 per cent per annum and a moratorium of ten years on repayment of capital.  The availability and amount of the loan are conditional on the purchase of French goods and services related to the execution of industrial or infrastructural projects. The process of identifying suitable projects is in hands.</P>
    <P>The bilateral transfers from the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark are expected to amount to 6 million EUA&mdash;some £4 million&mdash;in each of the years 1979 and 1980.  It has been agreed in principle that it will not be necessary for the Exchequer to raise loans specially in these countries in connection with the transfers.  The Dutch and Belgian authorities have indicated that their Ministers will be writing to me shortly regarding the detailed arrangements for making the transfers.  The Danish authorities have indicated that the transfer arrangements will be completed when the arrangements for the transfer at Community level have been finalised.</P>

      <P>I would think very shortly after the regulation is adopted.  The adoption of the regulation is held up at the moment because of a certain stance being taken by the British Government. That stance may well be clarified at the forthcoming meeting of the European Council which is to take place tomorrow and Friday, as a result of which the regulation could be adopted very quickly at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers.</P>

As I have indicated to the House, the reason for the delay is the attitude which has been adopted by the British authorities in regard to the regulation.  There is a reasonable hope that it will be sorted out within the next few days and there is no reason to believe that the moneys coming to us will not be available in this financial year, which is important.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated that there is no record of any contractors having been dropped.  Perhaps I should explain that any contractor is entitled to tender for work advertised by the Commissioners of Public Works.  All tenders received are fully considered.  In addition, the commissioners have a list of approved contractors for a number of services, for example, general building, civil engineering work, electrical and mechanical installations, provision of office and school furniture, window cleaning, and so on.  Contractors from the approved list are specially invited to tender <Col N="661" /> even when tenders are sought by public advertisement.  To qualify for inclusion in the commissioners' list, a contractor must furnish with his application a list of works completed by him and their approximate value, together with references from architects or engineers or other qualified persons who supervised his work.  The application is then considered on the grounds of suitability, experience, general set-up, and so on.  If the contractor is acceptable to the commissioners he will be invited to tender for works within his competence.  If he is awarded a contract, his performance on it is taken into account in connection with any other work for which his tender may come up for consideration.</P>

      <P>It has not caused any practical difficulty in regard to the apprehending of these boats.  The normal procedure is that the plane acts as a spotter and is able to ascertain when a boat is inside our waters.  It immediately notifies a naval boat and the naval boat makes the actual arrest.  I am satisfied that that procedure is effective.  Planes are equipped with a global navigation system which enables them to ascertain the precise latitude and longitude of the vessel at sea.  They can communicate instantly with the naval vessel.  The naval vessel is the only practical way of effecting an arrest.  A plane cannot arrest a boat.</P>

      <P>The Government have already made every effort to achieve the reopening of this factory.  A basis for the reopening was settled after long and detailed negotiations between an Irish company and various State agencies. Regrettably, when details had been finalised the company concerned had to withdraw from the proposed takeover because of the action of a small group of picketers at the factory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I understand the circumstances surrounding the unfortunate <Col N="670" /> withdrawal by the Irish company concerned, is the Minister aware that he has power under the Forestry Act to make moneys available and to take over Munster Chipboard? Therefore, would he consider taking over this company and operating it as a nationalised company in order to broaden the whole forestry processing interest?  Would he not agree that Munster Chipboard could form an integral part of the overall growth of our forestry policy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the concern being expressed by Deputy Collins but I am still hopeful that if a sensible attitude is adopted by the very few people who, against the wishes of the majority of the workers and of the major union involved, are engaged in the picket operation, we can revive the original arrangement we had reached with Cement-Roadstone. On the question of funds, the State has made substantial moneys available in an effort to bring about a joint viable project between Scariff and Munster Chipboard under an umbrella management that would enable a rationalisation programme to take place in respect of production.  We have put together a very attractive package.</P>

As the Minister responsible for forestry I cannot allow a situation to develop whereby outlets of this importance in regard to thinnings from forest lands would disappear.  I should have to consider the option suggested by the Deputy as well as considering other options, but I am still hopeful that the Cement-Roadstone proposal can be implemented.

We cannot afford to allow the chipboard factories, which are the main outlets for these thinnings, to disappear.

      <P>On the latter point, I propose to announce very shortly a substantial increase in the price of land for afforestation purposes.  However, there is an overall reluctance on the part of farmers to sell land at present for afforestation purposes.  This is mainly <Col N="675" /> because of the high-price situation obtaining within the Community for land for agricultural production and also because land is being regarded now almost as a bank.  People are holding on to land in a way that has not been experienced before.  This is because of the escalation in land values, but it is a situation that is proving very difficult for the Department in terms of acquiring land for afforestation purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport to outline the reasons why the Government have now decided to grant the massive increases in prices to CIE in regard to bus and train <Col N="684" /> fares and freight charges, and in view of the fact that the mainline passenger rail services will be increased from Monday next to outline the plans he has made to alleviate the hardship likely to be caused by those price increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Tourism (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE submitted proposals for increases in rates and fares, ranging on average from 15 per cent to 20 per cent, to meet increases in labour, materials and other costs.  The proposals were examined by the National Prices Commission, who found that CIE's allowable costs were greater than the revenue expected from the proposed increases and that the application fulfilled the normal criterion for price increases.  Since the submission of the CIE proposals, it has become apparent that CIE's deficit in 1979 will substantially exceed their original projections due primarily to large increases in labour and oil costs and the adverse effects on revenue of industrial disputes earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, having regard to the observations by the National Prices Commission, the application and in the light of the board's financial situation, the Government decided that the board should be permitted to implement the increases sought subject, however, to no increases being made in the fares of fare-paying school children.  Even with the increase in rates and fares the £35 million subvention provision for CIE in 1979 will now be seriously inadequate.  CIE have sought a substantial increase in the subvention and I am at present examining the matter.  I feel that it would be unreasonable to place the total burden of the increased cost on the taxpayer and that users of public transport should bear at least part of the increased cost.</P>

What type of subsidy or allowance does the Minister intend to make to users of CIE in view of the fact that their price increases are approximately 15 per cent to 20 per cent coupled with an ESB increase <Col N="685" /> of 19½ per cent, all of which are likely to add 1 per cent to the consumer price index?

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 29:</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to conscientious objections, I was trying to establish that a conscientious objector had a genuine objection to involving himself in procedures under this Bill.  The Minister suggested that it was impossible and undesirable and that a person need only say that he did not agree and opt out of a service and that there was no responsibility on anyone to see whether the objection was founded on a good premise and that it was something which could be established as a reasonable explanation for a person's refusal to take part in the service.  I mentioned the possibility of the frivolous use of section 11 allowing a person to opt out of the service on frivolous grounds.  The Minister also said, amongst other things, that my attitude to conscientious objections was surprising.  I pointed out that the establishment of a board for the war time pacifists, non-violent people, was accepted and understood as being a reasonable precaution to take in times of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> The Minister also said that this would be impracticable.  However, it is practicable because it exists and works in the British Act on contraception from which this amendment is taken.  This amendment is realistic and is particularly important because of the nature of the service and because of the deeply rooted conflicts of ideals, opinions and attitudes on foot of this whole question of family planning.  We are now at the stage where we at least have a family planning service even though it is orientated towards natural rather than artificial family planning. We now begrudgingly have other kinds of family planning.  There are still people in the medical professions and in the social services who will be involved in running the family planning clinics for the Minister who would consider it a conscientious decision as to whether they should run a service which the Minister tells us he will make sure caters for both artificial and natural family planning methods.</P>
    <P>There will be many people in the medical and nursing professions opposed to natural family planning.  The opposition to artificial family planning has been extremely effective.  It is powerful and is based in the Catholic Church, some of whose militant organisations, the Knights of Columbanus and so on, are very powerful.  As well as that, some months ago a document was circulated by the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin to the various hospitals under his jurisdiction, to the people involved in the health service, telling them that they should not take part in what could be considered services antagonistic or alien to the ones generally accepted by the Roman Catholic Church here.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the right to do so if he wishes, but would he not consider that he is building into the Bill a section which is an incitement to sabotage the artificial contraceptive side of the scheme?  Many people will be subjected to pressure as we here have been subjected to pressure, from sophisticated blandishment right round to common abuse.  There will also be economic pressures which can be used subtly in the business of getting jobs or promotion in hospitals.  We all know how this can be <Col N="690" /> done.  Many of the hospitals, indeed the vast majority of them, are controlled in some way to varying degrees by members of the various Orders of nuns. We have seen even in this House that the Fine Gael Party have had to allow Members to make their own decisions, and that Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the Minister's reply was to ask why we should go through the process of going to court or setting up arbitration machinery, and I am pointing out that pressures on such doctors and nurses will be considerable, and unless their objections are genuinely on grounds of conscience they could be from motives to sabotage the scheme.  I am trying to insert a proviso to set up some arbitration machinery.  Otherwise people who have objections to working within the scheme can take the line of least resistance and say they have conscientious objections, possibly because somebody outside has told them to do that.  The Minister will find it hard enough to administer the scheme faced with the opposition he already has but there will be others genuinely opposed to the scheme.  There will be people who will sort out the difference between artificial and natural family planning and there will be doctors and nurses in Catholic hospitals who will have genuine objections to participating in the scheme for artificial contraception.</P>

      <P>The Deputy put forward a case and I dealt with it.  Does he want me to deal with it again and again, <i>ad infinitum</i>?  I have nothing more to add.  The Deputy has raised a number of issues on his opposition to a conscientious objection clause in the legislation.  Of all the Deputies here I would have assumed that Deputy Browne would be first to allow that anyone with a conscientous objection is fully entitled to exercise it, and that is that.  I did not think this innocuous, harmless section would incite all this attention. I have said that Deputy Browne's amendment is not a practical proposition, that there is no question of taking legal proceedings and therefore there is no question of the amendment being applied, that it is irrelevant, that it is absurd to think we should have to establish a board before which people would have to go to explain a conscientious objection to artificial contraception.</P>
      <P>Do we not all know that people have been expressing their opinions on this <i>ad nauseum</i>?  What is the purpose of going ahead with this charade of establishing a board before which people would have to go to explain their conscientious objections? It is a non-argument and if the Deputy wants to keep it going&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Not yet.  The Minister should have replied to the case I made in regard to the people involved, nurses and <Col N="692" /> doctors.  It is comparable to the existing situation in Great Britain where many nurses and doctors will not take part in the administration of the Abortion Act and the British Government have had to deal with it in their own way.  Here, if a member of a health authority is faced with the problem of carrying out some part of the artificial contraception service and refuses to make it available, a legal action could fall in the High Court. A doctor or a nurse could say, &ldquo;I do not agree with it; you can have natural family planning.&rdquo;  Under this section a woman can be denied the right to have a free choice in regard to family planning and the Minister is deprived of the power to ensure that she gets the service unless in some way or another the matter is brought to court.  Is that the situation the Minister will accept, a situation in which a constitutional action might arise from the denial to an individual of the right to make her choice of service?</P>
      <P>The amendment is not an absurdity and the Minister's point therefore is not adequate.  Without doubt there will be conscientious people and there will be privileged people refusing to implement the scheme.  Knowing his strength, the Minister's attitude surprises me.  Considering all the pressures of this kind that have been imposed here over the years, he has been subjected to enormous and practically unprecedented pressures and he is suffering possibly from the stress of that.  But my fear in this is that unless he introduces some kind of safeguard he is providing the opposition, through a serious comprehensive family planning service comprising natural family planning and artificial family planning or contraception, with an ideal instrument for sabotaging the whole scheme.  To that extent I am attempting to warn the Minister of the possible dangers which arise.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 11 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this is the section on which we can talk of the right of conscientious objection to the different <Col N="693" /> kinds of family planning, as this right affected the decision of a Minister not to accept the decision of the Supreme Court.  The provisions of this Bill, lame and inept though they may be, are the decision of the Minister and the Cabinet. The Minister made clear in his opening statement that this Bill was brought in in reply to the majority decision of the Supreme Court on the McGee case. Therefore, this decision was arrived at in order to put right an anomaly created by section 17 of the 1936 Act.</P>
      <P>A Minister is bound by his constitutional responsibility to accept that &ldquo;the Government shall and must act as a collective authority and shall be collectively responsible to the Departments of State administered by Members of the Government&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>No more than anybody else can a Minister appear to take up a contrary position.  Everybody would acclaim his decision to say that, because of his conscientious objection to the laws being proposed by his colleagues in relation to family planning, he could not agree with it and because he was dissenting he would withdraw from the Cabinet.  That is the honourable position to take up and a number of us have done so over the years.  It needs no defence.  It may be right or wrong but it is an honourable position to take up.  I cannot see how a person in this position who saw his own colleagues in Cabinet facing a decision which some of the others surely found as distasteful and certainly politically undesirable or unwelcome as he did, simply chose to walk away and appear to be the Simon Pure of the Cabinet.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Browne will not proceed on these lines. It is not in order under this section which <Col N="694" /> deals only with conscientious objections that will arise when the Bill becomes an Act and in its operation then.  Anything that has happened up to now, the conscientious objection of any Member of the House or anybody else, has nothing to do with this section.  I ask Deputy Browne to get back to the section before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of conscientious objection will be used by people who say that they will not operate this Bill.  My case against that position is that under the Constitution nobody can deny an individual, any other citizen in the State, his rights under the Constitution. That is what is being done.  That is what is proposed under this section 11 and this is the position taken up by the Minister in his use of conscientious objection in refusing to play his part in collective responsibility in making his decision joint with that of the Government. Therefore, it is a completely false position, a cowardly position, and in his situation the correct thing for him to have done was to resign as a member of the Cabinet.  I am sure the Minister present will agree with me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Chair when he says that we are dealing with conscientious objections after the Bill is passed.  Now, is the important, desirable time for the conscientious objector to show his hand, to come forward and not be afraid to display courage.  Reference has been made on section 11 to the conscientious objector, but we seem to forget the most important fact that the conscience must be a well-informed conscience.  If we feed a computer with a variety of types of information, unless the computer is fed with the truth the truth will not be revealed from the computer.  Those who will be administering this Bill when it is an Act will have an extremely tough struggle with their consciences. Numerous people in the medical and nursing profession up and down the country will be associated with the main purpose of the Bill and chemists will be involved seriously in its administration. Here section 11 will have to be examined very closely lest in administering this Bill <Col N="695" /> there may be people of materialistic or atheistic mind who will be pushing their views down the necks of others who will be administering the Act without due regard to the conscience and judgment of others.  There may be conscientious objectors who object on principle to the giving and fulfilling of prescriptions. Principle is extremely scarce commodity in this country and an extremely scarce commodity in this House when compared with the situation 25 or 30 years ago.  There are some rich people who have not yet sold their principles.  Principles will be involved in the administration of this legislation.  What will happen to the conscientious objector employed in the Minister's Department?  How will he or she stand for promotion?  Will such an objector be covered by the legislation dealing with unfair dismissal and discrimination in employment?  There are many who profess allegiance to the Protestant churches who take an equally serious view of contraception and abortion. What guarantees are available that conscientious objectors will not be the subject of dismissals or discrimination in regard to promotion?  Such guarantees are vital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the practical intellect we can form our own conscience.  No amount of pressure can alter the formation of conscience. Deputy Browne referred with a degree of sincerity to the circular sent recently by the Archbishop of Dublin to hospitals.  This was not an effort to intimidate. It was a circular advising and informing Catholic workers of their duties as Catholics.  Reference has been made to certain organisations who feel that it is right to enlighten the public. The Catholic Church can point out to legislators what is right and what is wrong, but they leave it to the legislator to make up his own mind.  There is no question of pressure.  Pressure groups have not succeeded in influencing the votes of legislators.  Every legislator makes up his own own mind according to his own conscience and what he believes to be true.  The same will apply to the doctor who will be asked to administer this legislation.  He may well wash his hands completely of the <Col N="696" /> Haughey contraception and abortion Act.  Perhaps I should not have mentioned the Minister's name but he is responsible for every section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with doctors, nurses, health board staff, officers of the Minister's Department, chemists and a variety of other people. Someone has a duty to mould the conscience to ensure that it will be well-informed and that sound judgment will prevail.  That is where the advice and guidance of people like the Archbishop of Dublin is desirable.  He has a duty before God to speak courageously on health and hospital matters.  The circular outlines the duties being performed by Catholic members of staff so that they will not be involved in the atheistic and materialistic work of destroying human life.  It is vital that the conscience should be fed with the truth.  If the conscience is to develop on the right lines the seeds of truth must be conveyed so that it is well-informed.</P>
      <P>When this legislation comes into force the Minister will be shocked at the number of conscientious objectors.  He will see the reaction of those who have an active and well-informed conscience. There is a solemn obligation on legislators who are familiar with every section of this Bill to endeavour to advise those who will be administering it of the moral and social dangers and of the harm and damage legislation of this kind will do to the quality of life in our society.  When their consciences have been enlightened, by their sound judgment, this legislation will be put where it should be put, on the shelves in the Minister's Department to decay, be covered with dust, and surrounded by cobwebs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> Even the dumbest citizen, even the most unintellectual citizen, even the citizen who has the least education, has a natural insinct not to kill, not to harm, not to damage, not to raise an objection to the Divine law, the law of Providence, the law of God.  That human instinct is there.  Many thousands of people have not disclosed their intention to the Minister to object totally on grounds of conscience to this legislation.  They will be correct in doing that.  There is nothing worse for people than having to struggle with their consciences.  That is disastrous physically and mentally.</P>
    <P>The conscientious objector will come forward courageously.  There is a great necessity to cultivate the conscience of those who may not fully understand the gravity and the seriousness of this legislation.  I hope and trust that doctors, chemists, their assistants and everybody connected with them, will use sound judgment.  Their consciences cannot be fully informed unless they see the truth. Ignorance is no excuse for not having a well-informed conscience.  The work of spreading the truth and condemning heresy and wrong is beginning.</P>
    <P>I trust that the conscientious objectors will not find themselves out of work or victimised.  The Minister probably does not foresee any victimisation of the conscientious objector.  The conscientious objector can be the subject of disastrous discrimination.  We have seen this in other spheres.  What an amount of evil and money is behind the pressure groups who are pressing for this legislation for contraception and providing the gateway to be opened completely for abortion. The conscientious person who makes himself heard against the administration of this Bill may find himself at the bottom of the rung for the promotion to which he would otherwise be entitled. I want an assurance from the Minister that that will not be the case&mdash; not that his assurance will be worth much, because there are evilly disposed people in high places who will use their evilly disposed methods in an endeavour to put evil above what is right.</P>
    <P>I am glad this opportunity has arisen for me to speak well of those who have conscientious objections against working <Col N="698" /> this Bill and to enlighten them on the grave dangers that will exist for them in the exercise of their consciences.  I know I am being extremely helpful to them when I advise them not to struggle with their consciences.  They are justified in their belief that to handle legislation of this kind is wrong in every aspect and to every degree.  A great section of the Irish population will respond magnificently and will make known to the Minister their conscientious objections to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that, in our public service whether at national or local level, if any man or woman came forward to his or her superiors and indicated that he or she did not wish to take on some duty or participate in some action because of a conscientious objection, that would have been acceptable.  I think that is true. That would prevail normally and reasonably throughout the whole public service and, indeed, in the private sector as well.</P>
      <P>Because of the sensitivity of this subject, family planning, and because of the conflicting views widely held about it, I deemed it expedient in this case to go further and to write into the Bill the right of any individual to refuse to take part in the implementation of the legislation if it is conscientiously objectionable to him or to her.  I really think this is a sensible and wise section, a section which deals with what could be a difficulty for many people.  As I say, normally in our society the rights of conscientious objectors are respected and upheld.  In this case they will have a full statutory provision to protect their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not have thought it necessary to say this but Deputy Flanagan addressed the question to me specifically and I suppose if I did not answer it something might be read into that, so I must avail of this opportunity to state categorically that there is no intention whatever anywhere to penalise anyone in any way for availing of this section.  In fact, the position of anybody is fully safeguarded constitutionally and legally.  I could not possibly visualise any circumstances arising in which people would be penalised, or impeded, or inhibited in <Col N="699" /> any way because of their wish conscientiously to object to having anything to do with artificial contraceptives.  That is what we are really talking about.  I would not think that would apply anyway, particularly in view of the fact that this section is there to which anybody can point in defence of their position.  This debate has taken many a turn but the idea that, from any side of the House liberal or conservative, there would be objections to a simple straightforward conscientious objection clause surprises even me.</P>
    <P>I recommend the section to the House because it is an important safeguard in this area.  I do not think it is necessary. Normal civilised procedures would obtain in this matter as they do to other matters in our public service and elsewhere but, in case there is any doubt about it, there is specifically granted to people the right not to participate in the implementation of this legislation if they feel in conscience that they do not wish to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister. I accept there is a need and it would be right to include a clause dealing with persons who have a conscientious objection in any legislation of this kind.  I would not agree with the remarks made earlier by Deputy Mitchell in relation to conscientious objections.  It might be better to allow other people to express their views on matters of individual beliefs and personal conscience and we would more accurately reflect the differing views obtaining in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the marginal note describes the section as being one dealing with conscientious objections, there is no reference in the section to conscientious objection.  Nowhere does it suggest that persons will not be proceeded against because they have decided not to participate in the implementation of this measure on grounds of conscience.  People who, not for reasons of conscience but because they feel the provision is unpalatable or unacceptable or would not improve the other business they may be carrying on, would be entirely excluded <Col N="700" /> by the manner in which this section is written.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the section does not specifically say that this clause is to be a saver in relation to people who genuinely have conscientious objections. The marginal note is not interpreted by the courts as being part of the statute.  It is merely a guide.  I am surprised that objection of conscience is not specifically written into the wording of the section.</P>
    <P>There is merit in the case made by Deputy Browne when he was speaking on his amendment.  It may not be so lightly dismissed as the Minister was inclined to do.  There may be a situation where people in the medical or pharmaceutical profession could find themselves being challenged in the courts as to why they were not prepared to participate in the operation of the scheme.  We have established that married people, whatever about others, by virtue of the McGee Supreme Court ruling, have a constitutional right of access to artificial contraceptives.  If a doctor, without giving any reasons why, was to deny them the script or authorisation necessary to obtain artificial contraceptives, if those people lived in a remote rural area and had not easy access to another doctor or if the situation obtained in relation to a chemist, it is conceiveable in the case Deputy Browne makes that those people might feel that that chemist or doctor, through his refusal to participate, had been party to denying them the constitutional right which the Supreme Court has specifically made available to couples within marriage.  From that point of view, one would have thought it would have been important that grounds of objections of conscience might have been written into section 11 rather than merely contained in the marginal note.</P>
    <P>A medical card patient visiting his doctor may have contraceptives prescribed for him and, while he will have to pay for them in the chemist, his visit to the doctor will be deemed to be free of charge.  That anomalous situation, if it is to obtain, would mean that a medical card patient, visiting the doctor with whom he is registered, who finds his doctor is refusing to implement the <Col N="701" /> provisions of the Bill might feel he had a case against that doctor or might be so advised by other people.  Any doctor or other professional person who, on genuine grounds of conscience, wants to opt out of the odious task this legislation purports to give them, should be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>Before Report Stage I should like the Minister to consider whether objections on conscience grounds should be specified in the wording of the section. Will the Minister give any indication why it is not specified?</P>

      <P>I am concerned to discuss the question of the penalty clauses and what is involved in regard to the Bill.  I have struggled to do so a few times.  It is not possible to bring a Bill into the Dáil and implement it without some kind of penalties.  If this absurd Bill has to be passed, it is logical to accept that some kind of penalties must be provided.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister serious that a person guilty of a first offence under the Bill:</P>
      <P>... shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
      <P>And that:</P>
      <P>A person guilty of a second or subsequent offence under this Act shall be liable, on conviction on indictment, of a fine not exceeding £5,000 together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a fine not exceeding £250 for each day or part of a day for which the offence is continued after the first such day or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both the fine or fines and the imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are discussing the question of family planning but on a number of occasions during the debate the Minister, throwing his hands in the air in the delicate and elegant way that is characteristic of him, chided us for our criticism of him and asked was it not a very good move to take this Bill from the Department of Justice to bring it within the ambit of the Department of Health.  However, what is totally inexplicable to me is that the Minister considers it necessary to punish people in terms of penalties that are out of all proportion to what is <Col N="703" /> regarded to be the offence.  For instance, a person found in possession of an IUD or a condom, without having an authorised prescription for such device, is to be deemed to be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  There is no offence by reason of possession of any such device.  It is simply a matter of importing or selling contraceptive devices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>But will it not be an offence to be in possession of a contraceptive device without having the appropriate doctor's prescription?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such offence as the offence of possession in this legislation.  In that regard the Bill differs very much from the Misuse of Drugs Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me&mdash;and this is the kernal of the objection to the Bill &mdash;that one must go to a doctor and be given a prescription for contraceptive devices before being entitled to be in possession of such devices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, the only offences that can be committed in terms of this legislation are the ones that are referred to specifically. Possession is not considered to be an offence in terms of this Bill and, consequently, does not attract court proceedings or penalties of any sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us discuss then the question of persons selling contraceptives. Are they to be subject to the penalties provided for in section 4, for instance?  That section provides that a person shall not sell contraceptives unless the sale is in accordance with the various conditions laid down but if these conditions are not present anybody selling contraceptives will be guilty of an offence and the question of an offence brings us to the question of a penalty. <Col N="704" /> The penalty in this case is extravagant. It is out of proportion to the nature of the offence.  The penalty should fit the crime.  Why should there be this provision for excessive penalties in respect of somebody who, for instance, sells a dozen contraceptives?  It would seem that the Minister has over-reacted throughout this Bill to what is after all a health measure, a provision which hopefully will improve the living standards of our people, stemming from the capacity to make available to people a comprehensive family planning service. Therefore, I would consider it very wrong that a Minister for Health should undertake this criminalising process in relation to something that is intended to help the community by way of improving their living standards and welfare. The penalties provided for in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, were designed for the protection of people against drug pushers.  We all agreed with such provisions because they related to the misuse of a number of serious addictive drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could help the Deputy by way of explaining a few points.  When the Deputy says that I am criminalising this area, he is not correct. He must realise that when we pass legislation here, we intend it to be enforced and the only way in which we can ensure its enforcement is by providing for certain penalties.  The Deputy could make the same criticism in regard to the Misuse of Drugs Act whereby, according to the Deputy, the Minister for Health could be said also to have engaged in criminalising activity, but that is not the issue.  All that is involved either in that Act or in this Bill is the provision for penalties in respect of offences that are created in the interest of the protection of the general public.  In the Misuse of Drugs Act pushers are dealt with separately.  There is no first offence so far as they are concerned.  The only reason for a mitigated penalty appearing in the Misuse of Drugs Act in respect of a first offence is that in that Act possession is an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why we on the special committee which dealt with the Act, decided in our wisdom that for a first offence possession would be deemed to be an offence <Col N="705" /> carrying a nominal penalty.  The situation is different in respect of this legislation because we are dealing only with people who for commercial reasons break the law deliberately.  Therefore, it is legitimate that the normal District Court penalties should apply to them. There is nothing savage or penal about what is proposed here.  These are the levels of penalties now regarded as appropriate for summary conviction in the District Court and that is why they are fixed at £500 or six months in prison. These are maximum penalties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's intervention.  It was very helpful but I would distinguish between the possession of dangerous addictive drugs and the possession of items relating to a family planning scheme.  My difficulty here is that I do not believe in the concept of criminality.  However, that is not a matter for discussion now.  There are two different situations involved, rather like the situation in advertising.  The Minister would say that I say we should not advertise tobacco and we should advertise contraceptives and so on.  One has to take up a position where one can defend the fact that in one set of circumstances one can behave in one way and justify it, and in another set of circumstances that one can reserve for the District Court the power to inflict penalties but that those powers would be fitting to the crime of selling a dozen contraceptives.  It seems to me that the fine of up to £500 is something that, if I were Minister for Health, I would not care to be associated with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the level of fines, I suppose they are an improvement on the situation last week where somebody would have been taken out and shot.  The Minister should sit down and take a look at this matter.  I am not certain that he is absolutely correct in saying that possession is not an offence under this Bill.  Section 4(4) states that a person who contravenes this section or regulation for the purpose of this section shall be guilty of an offence.  This deals with the provisions concerning how a person shall not sell contraceptives unless the sale is in accordance with the <Col N="706" /> regulations and the person is the servant or agent of a pharmaceutical chemist. Section 4(1) (b) (ii) states that a person shall not sell contraceptives unless the person to whom the contraceptives are sold is named in the prescription or authorisation in writing.</P>
      <P>There are two sets of people mentioned there.  The first is the person who shall not sell.  If that person sells to somebody other than the person named in writing on the prescription he is, by definition in subsection (4), guilty of an offence.  We would all accept that.  There is also the person to whom the contraceptives are sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no offence there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It states that a person shall not sell contraceptives unless the person to whom the contraceptives are sold is named in the prescription.  The section goes on to say, in subsection (4), that a person who contravenes this section shall be guilty of an offence.  Either person may have contravened the provision of this section.  We dealt, not as extensively as we might have done otherwise, during the discussion on section 4 with the situation where the spouse of the person to whom the prescription has been issued would not technically be entitled to go to a chemist and have contraceptives sold to him.  If Mrs. Haughey or Mrs. Boland went to a chemist and a prescription was made out in Mr. Haughey's or Mr. Boland's name and the chemist dispensed the prescription, then not only has the chemist violated the provisions of section 4 but it could equally be argued that the person who went with the prescription, which was not in her name, had also violated it.  That seems to be further proved by the provisions of section 8, which we discussed earlier today, which relate to forged or fraudulently altered prescriptions or authorisations.  It seems that a person who had contraceptives dispensed by tendering a prescription which was not in his name could be deemed to be in violation of section 4. The Minister seems to be very adamant that that is not the position.</P>

These are just the level of offences which are regarded now as normal, appropriate offences for legislation of this sort.  There is nothing intentionally punitive about them.

Why could he not have said that he can see it in relation to all the drugs we have been talking about, heroin and so on, and the damage they can do, but what damage can it do to sell contraceptives to somebody?

      <P>Is it not the point of Deputy Flanagan's amendment that the regulations under section 3 (3) be presented to the House in draft form, rather than our having the continuing haste to have them discussed afterwards, by endeavouring to have time allocated to discuss the regulations?  If the regulations came before the House in draft form they would not come into effect until the House had positively confirmed them.</P>

      <P>I want every regulation to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and to be approved by resolution before they come into force. We have no guarantee that the Minister will be Minister indefinitely and we could easily have a Minister for Health in the future who would make regulations which could be considered dangerous to the public welfare.  Before any regulations come into operation the Dáil and the Seanad should have an opportunity to examine and discuss them.  This type of legislation will affect the quality of life, and the elected representatives should have an opportunity to examine any regulations made before they come into effect.  The Minister might tell us that no responsible Minister for Health <Col N="712" /> would make hasty regulations, but the House should have an opportunity in the interests of the family, which is the fundamental unit of society, to examine regulations which could have a detrimental effect on society.  For those reasons my amendment is desirable and I would ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>Because they are before us we might as well talk about them.  What is involved is the net issue of whether we have regulations and follow the normal course of laying them before the Oireachtas, giving Members an opportunity to discuss them and to annul them, if necessary.  That procedure has been followed for good and sufficient reasons.  There would be a disadvantage in adopting the first procedure, which suggests that the regulations would become effective only when they had been passed by both Houses.  That could involve long delays: the House might not be sitting or the pressure of Parliamentary time might be such that there would be a delay of many months before the regulations could become effective.  I do not think that would be desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill has a number of separate provisions, each of which is related to the programme for the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis.</P>
      <P>First, there is provision for the payment of a levy on all milk supplied for processing and on all cattle slaughtered within the country or exported live.  The second main provision is to allow for the operation of a price differential by creameries, pasteurisers and other milk processors as between milk supplied from disease free herds and that supplied from infected herds.  Third, there is a provision which is designed to enable information to be obtained about the use of lands, especially lands let or rented, which are being used for grazing cattle.</P>
      <P>The fourth main provision is for an extension of the normal time limit available for the institution of proceedings for offences under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966 and under this Bill.  A fifth provision is for a substantial increase in the penalties at present stipulated in the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.  Finally, there is a saver clause relating to certain Orders made in connection with the eradication of disease in the past.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision to provide for the payment by farmers of a direct contribution towards the cost of eradication of bovine disease was announced in the Programme for National Development 1978-1981 published last January. This contribution will reinforce the farmers' commitment to completion of the disease eradication programme as quickly as possible.  It will also make farmers more concerned to see that the substantial amount of money spent on disease eradication is used to maximum effect.  In the current year, provision has been made for a total expenditure of £22 million for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis.  This amount will, most likely, have to be increased in the coming years as full compulsory measures for brucellosis are gradually extended to the rest of the country.  The farmer contribution from a levy of 0.5p per gallon of milk and £3 per bovine animal slaughtered or exported live is estimated to amount to about £10 million over a full 12-month period.  The levy will be payable directly to the Department of Agriculture in the case of milk and bovine animals slaughtered.  In the case of live cattle exports, the levy will be collected prior to export by the Revenue Commissioners for transmission to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill relating to the operation of a price differential as between milk from disease-free herds and that from infected herds are of an enabling nature.  I have, in recent months, repeatedly sought to impress on producers that time is not on our side as far as disease eradication is concerned. Already, the EEC has at an advanced stage a measure which, when adopted, will govern intra-Community trade in liquid milk.  It could in due course effectively exclude from that trade all milk derived from herds which are infected with disease.  This measure may foreshadow pressure at a later stage in relation to dairy produce derived from <Col N="719" /> what some of our overseas customers would regard as suspect milk.</P>
    <P>A significant reduction in the price of milk supplied from herds with either TB or brucellosis infection could also prove to be a most effective way of bringing home to the herd-owners concerned that we cannot afford to tolerate continuing delay in getting rid of these diseases.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that any funds accruing to milk processors as a result of operating a price differential system will not go to the Exchequer.  These funds could rather be used by the processors either to increase the price paid for milk from disease-free herds or to provide appropriate services to herdowners to help them fight disease.</P>
    <P>There are a number of consequential sections of the Bill which are necessary to ensure the efficient administration of both the levy and the milk price differential system.  These relate to such matters as the keeping of records and access to those records for checking purposes by inspectors and authorised officers from my Department.  These are customary provisions normally included in legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that there is nothing whatsoever in this Bill to give officers of the Revenue Commissioners any new powers of access to records kept by meat factories or milk processing plants.  The only involvement of the Revenue Commissioners, so far as this measure is concerned, is in relation to the collection of the levy on live cattle exports&mdash;that and no more.</P>
    <P>The provision which would allow information to be procured about lands used for the grazing or retention of cattle is designed to meet a gap which has been found in the existing controls.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What section are those powers in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal with the sections individually on Committee Stage.  This applies especially where lands are let or rented.  It is often difficult in these cases to establish the identity of either the owner or the user of the lands and to ascertain the ownership and health status of cattle kept on the lands. <Col N="720" /> Failure to trace the origin and ownership of the animals can frustrate the operation of control measures.  It is, therefore, considered essential to have the power to procure relevant information in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>The normal time limit for the taking of proceedings as imposed by the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, is six months after the date of the offence. This limitation has given rise to considerable problems in relation to offences under the disease eradication regulations. Many suspected breaches of the regulations require detailed and painstaking investigations over a period of time.  In other cases it may be some time after an offence occurs that the evidence comes to light.  For example, the illegal movement of an animal may be disclosed only when the animal is discovered some months later in the course of a test in the herd to which it moved. There have been cases of this kind where proceedings could not be taken because of the six months' limit.  The opportunity, therefore, is being taken to extend to two years the time limit within which proceedings may be instituted for an offence under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, and under this Bill.</P>
      <P>The maximum penalties provided for in the 1966 Act have been criticised for some time as being unrealistically low in this day and age.  There will, I feel sure, be general agreement that the present maximum penalty of £100 on summary conviction is indeed far too low and provision is being made to increase this to £500.  In the case of conviction on indictment, there will be a maximum fine of £2,000 and/or imprisonment up to two years for certain offences such as interfering with ear tags or falsifying certificates. I hope that these increased penalties will act as real deterrents to certain abuses which, I am afraid, have been all too common in the past.  The increased penalties provided for in the Bill will leave the tag-switchers and other unscrupulous individuals who flout the disease regulations in no doubt about the earnestness of the intention.  They can now take notice that it is our intention to prosecute such abuses with all the energy and vigour possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some vague doubts have been expressed <Col N="721" /> about the validity of some orders made previously under certain Disease of Animals Acts in relation to the declaration of an area to be either an attested area or an attested or disease free area.  The saver provision in the Bill is included solely for the purpose of removing any such doubts.</P>
    <P>The eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis is now one of the most urgent problems facing the livestock industry in this country and one that must be given top priority.  The provisions of this Bill are necessary to hasten achievement of the goal of early eradication.  It is the survival of our cattle, beef and dairy industries, on which depends a very large part of our national prosperity that is at stake.  I, therefore, recommend the Bill to Dáil Éireann for its early and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some aspects of this Bill with which I should like to deal briefly in so far as they are acceptable to us.  Those are the ones concerned with the increases in penalties. There is common case on all sides of the House that the penalties which were set in 1966, at a time when money was worth a lot more than it is worth now, and when perhaps the disease problem was not as acute or as urgent as it is now, have become out of date. Therefore, the provisions in section 22 to increase them are acceptable in principle.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the section concerned with the lengthening of the time within which proceedings can be taken are also acceptable to us in principle&mdash;section 17&mdash;subject to the matter being worked out in some detail on Committee Stage.  There is something in what the Minister said.  Evidence of intent in relation to this matter does not come to notice all that quickly and there may be a need to remove the limit of a mere six months within which proceedings may be taken against people who have <i>prima facie</i> committed an offence against the diseases of animals legislation.  We all agree that those who are engaged in breaches of the law in this area are deserving of rigorous pursuit by the appropriate authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some doubts about the provisions <Col N="722" /> in section 23, which is another of the relatively non-contentious provisions in the Bill, concerning the validation of acts done by the Minister notwithstanding the fact that they were not done by the Minister in relation to an area to which by order a declaration had been made by him either declaring the area to be an attested area or an attested or disease free area.</P>
    <P>This section is justified by the Minister on the grounds that &ldquo;some vague doubts have been expressed about the validity of some orders made previously under certain Diseases of Animals Acts&rdquo;.  The Minister should have been a little more specific as to what he meant by &ldquo;some vague doubts&rdquo;. He is not taking the House or the country into his confidence if he justifies an unusual provision in any legislation on the grounds of vague unspecified doubts.</P>
    <P>We are having too much experience in this House of subsequent validating legislation where something has been done wrong by the Minister, or perhaps his predecessor or predecessors, and the Minister, whether he be the Minister for Agriculture or another Minister, validating it subsequently.  We had a recent and more controversial example in-the case of the Minister for Justice concerning the Garda Commissioner. Something that has been done illegally, it appears, or without the full process of law, has to be validated subsequently in retrospective fashion.</P>
    <P>To my mind that-is not good law making.  A situation should not arise where matters which have been dealt with improperly at the time, and as a result of the impropriety a person has a good cause of action, have to be put right by retro-active legislation.  Section 23 is another example from this Government of more retro-active legislation.  It is bad legislation.  Anybody who has studied law knows that is the case, and anybody who is a student of common sense knows that a law which says something was illegal in the past, even though at the time the act was committed there was no certainty that it was illegal, is clearly a bad law.</P>
    <P>What is particularly of interest in the case of section 23 is that this may be <Col N="723" /> validating potential criminal proceedings whereby offences committed, which on the basis of the legislation then existing may well not have been offences because the legislation was inadequate, now by virtue of section 23 become offences subsequently.  There is a great need for clarity on exactly what will be the consequences of section 23.  If this will make something a criminal offence which was done in the past, and which at the time it was committed was not technically a criminal offence, it seems to me to be very wrong that this should be done.</P>
    <P>The need for section 23 arises from a particular court case in Birr, if I am not mistaken, in the District Court or the Circuit Court.  I am not sure which court it was.  If that is the case, we should have been told that.  We should not have been told it is a question of some vague doubts.  I hope in his reply the Minister, who appreciates the need for clarifying these matters, will give fuller information than the Minister on whose behalf he is reading the brief deemed it necessary to give in the brief.</P>
    <P>I have been dealing with the uncontroversial parts of the Bill and I now come to the more controversial parts. The first is the provision for payment of a levy on all milk supplies for processing and on all cattle slaughtered in the country or for live export.  We in Fine Gael will be, throughout the process of the Bill through the House, resolutely opposing this levy by every parliamentary means available to us.  I hope the Government make no effort to steamroll this measure through the House or to curtail debate on it.  It is a measure of considerable importance.  Not only will the levy as it is at present composed constitute a charge of approximately £10 million in the full year on farmers, but it is clear from the Minister's speech that there is the likelihood that the levy, which as it stands at present is .5p per gallon in the case of milk and £3 in the case of a bovine animal, will be increased substantially and frequently in the future if the Government have their way.  They have built into the Bill a provision whereby this levy may be increased by order without need of subsequent legislation.  I, and I know I speak <Col N="724" /> for my party, do not want to give the Government power to introduce the levy or increase it to an indeterminate amount by order.</P>
    <P>The Government have adopted a policy of taxation of the farming community by means of levies on goods produced by them.  The use of a levy as a means of taxation is crude and unfair.  It is crude because it takes no account of the circumstances of particular industries. The £3 per bovine animal slaughtered will be collected, if it is to be collected, on every animal being sold for slaughter or for export regardless of whether or not that animal has made a profit or loss to the person selling it.  The evidence presenting itself in relation to the likely profits to be made from the summer fattening of cattle for beef suggests that, if a profit is made, it will be very small, and there is a strong possibility that a loss will be made.  If the Government have their way and this legislation is introduced, a farmer who may have a loss of £10 a head on the fattening of an animal will have to pay another £3 in levy to the Minister.  He will also have to pay a 2 per cent levy to the Minister for Finance, which will probably add another £7 or £8 to the loss.  Instead of a loss of £10, he will have a loss of £20 per head directly as a result of levies introduced by the Government, one to finance disease eradication and one to finance the Minister for Finance.  That is not acceptable to us.  If the Government intend to impose this levy without adequate parliamentary debate and bludgeon it through the House, we will resist it in every way we can.</P>
    <P>It is an unfair levy as between individual farmers.  Some farmers have incomes which are so low that if they were assessed for income tax purposes they would not be in the income tax net at all and would possibly qualify for supplements of one kind or another to their income, supplements which they do not get.  Every farmer, no matter how poor or badly off he is, will have to pay £3 levy per animal slaughtered or exported and .5p per gallon of milk.  The disease levy is also unfair as between farmers who have co-operated with disease eradication measures and those who <Col N="725" /> have not.  There were campaigns in the past where farmers were encouraged by people who saw fit to give them advice&mdash;these are people with whom I have, in this respect no sympathy&mdash;to hold on to diseased cattle, whereas if these animals had been got rid of the incidence of disease would have been considerably less than it is.  Some farmers did not accept this advice but got rid of their animals and co-operated fully with the Department in disease eradication. The farmer who got rid of disease from his own herd and prevented it spreading into other herds and those who have made no effort to eradicate the disease will be paying the same levy.  That is another ground on which it can be argued that this levy, as well as being crude, is unfair.</P>
    <P>In relation to the meat trade, is it not possible that this levy may well be a levy to be paid by the consumer in certain circumstances?  It will be paid on all heifers slaughtered for the domestic butchers trade&mdash;it is mostly heifers that are slaughtered for that trade&mdash;in the same way as it will be levied on all cattle either slaughtered here or destined for export live.  In a situation where the demand for beef in the market-place is greater than the supply, butchers would be competing with each other for beef and in such circumstances who could guarantee that the levy would be paid by the farmer, and apparently the intention is that the farmer is to pay the levy?  In a situation in which demand exceeds supply it is axiomatic that the levy will be paid by the Irish consumer though I know that is not what is intended.  I do not agree with the imposition of a levy at all, either on the farmer or on the consumer, but I am sure that not even the Government would wish to impose this levy on the consumer. However, they have not taken any measure either in this Bill or in any legislation in relation to levies to prevent the levy being passed on in full in certain circumstances to the consumer.</P>
    <P>In the case of milk for liquid consumption, for instance, there are possibilities of preventing a levy from being passed on to the consumer by reason of there being a controlled retail price for liquid milk.  Therefore, the dairies can be <Col N="726" /> prevented by law from charging the consumer more than the fixed price by way of adding on a levy.  The same applies in respect of any product which is the subject of retail price control or which is being exported in substantial quantities.  In the case of a product that is being exported in large quantities and in respect of which the price is being set outside the country, the price will apply both to the portion of the product that is being sold within the country and that which is being exported because at the time of its sale there is no way of distinguishing whether it is for export or for consumption on the domestic market.</P>
    <P>In the case of meat the Government's argument will be that because we export a lot of meat, its price will be determined at the time of the sale of the cattle by the export price and that, consequently, it should not be possible for anybody to have to pay more for an animal by reason of the existence of a levy and to pass that levy to the consumer since the levy cannot be passed to the foreign consumer who, if he so wishes, can buy elsewhere.  That is the likely argument to be put forward in respect of the case I am making, but the counter-argument to that can be put forward by anybody who has any knowledge of the way in which the Irish beef trade operates.  Beef destined for the domestic market is heifer beef generally.  It is rare that heifer beef finds its way into the factories for export to foreign markets.  This is the case sometimes in respect of cow beef but that is mainly for the canning trade. Bullock beef is what is used largely for supplying the export market.</P>
    <P>I submit that basically heifer and bullock beef are intrinsically different commodities and that the type of beef that is bought for the domestic market is specifically heifer beef while what is bought for the export market by the large meat factories such as those at Grand Canal Street, Leixlip and Midleton is bullock beef.  It is possible that in regard to heifers the price will be bid up to include the £3 per head levy in such a way as to ensure that the levy will be paid by the consumer.  There is no precaution in this Bill or in any other measure to prevent that happening.  The only way in which it could be prevented <Col N="727" /> would be to have a retail price order for meat, though that, too, would be virtually impossible to draft because meat, unlike milk or butter, for instance, is not a uniform commodity.  It varies in quality. Some meat is hung well but if it is not hung well it is very tough.  Also, some animals produce better beef than other animals.  Much depends on the breed. Therefore, one sirloin steak is not the same as another.  Consequently, it would be impossible to have one maximum price level for sirloin steak.  In addition, it would not be possible to apply the same price per pound to other cuts as might be applied to sirloin.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the difficulty of imposing a retail price order for meat I submit that in a situation in which demand exceeds supply on the domestic beef market, the £3 levy will be paid by the consumer though that is not what is intended and is something which would be opposed strongly by Deputies on all sides.  But it is not sufficient for the Government to say that it is not the intention that the levy be passed to the consumer.  They must indicate precisely how, in the circumstances I have outlined at some length, they can and will prevent this levy being paid by the consumer. They have not done this so far in relation to the 2 per cent levy introduced on 1 May in respect of all agricultural commodities.  I am not optimistic that they will succeed in doing it in the case of this commodity.  If the Government want proof that the 2 per cent levy in the case of meat is being paid by the consumer all they need to do is to ask any housewife, who is accustomed to buying this commodity, if she thinks she is paying the 2 per cent levy or if she thinks somebody else is paying it.  I am quite sure that her answer will be that the levy is being paid by her.  This levy will also be paid by the housewife.</P>
    <P>This is another reason why I believe this levy is a bad one.  It is a bad tax in principle; it is unfair, it is crude, and it is capable of being paid by the consumer. Those are good reasons why this levy is wrong in concept and wrong in execution. If the Government want to find some way of raising money to finance disease eradication this certainly is not <Col N="728" /> the way in which it should be done.  I do not know who thought up the idea of the levy.  I would be very surprised if the Department of Agriculture were the inspiration behind this levy.  I do not believe this levy was conceived in the Department of Agriculture.  It certainly was not conceived by anybody who has any knowledge of the way Irish agriculture works or the way in which the market for foods in Ireland works.  It was obviously thought up by somebody who has little knowledge of either and little sympathy for either.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this Bill I would like to draw attention to, that is the provision in relation to a milk price differential.  The best way of explaining this is to read out section 8 which states:</P>
    <P>In case a notice under section 6 of this Act is given, then for so long as the notice is in force the following provisions shall apply:</P>
    <P>(a)  notwithstanding anything contained in any agreement, the amount payable as regards milk supplied to and received by a dairy produce manufacturer, milk pasteuriser, milk bottler or other person described in section 6 (1) of this Act, at any time while the notice is in force from a herd to which the notice relates, shall be, and shall only be, the amount payable apart from this section reduced by an amount calculated at the rate per gallon standing for the time being prescribed for the purposes of this section,</P>
    <P>(b)  it shall be unlawful for such manufacturer, pasteuriser, bottler or other person to pay in respect of such milk an amount other than that which is appropriate having regard to paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
    <P>This section gives the Minister for Agriculture power to say that in the case of a farmer who has received a notice that his herd is infected, whether or not it was his fault&mdash;it may well be that his herd became infected through somebody else's fault&mdash;the price for his milk is reduced.  We all know the situation where a farmer has a bad neighbour who <Col N="729" /> does not look after his herd properly. Disease can spread in the case of tuberculosis on the wind across the fences from one farm to another.  We have no vet in the House at the moment who would be in a position to give us technical advice on this matter.  It is a well-known fact that disease can spread and that a farmer who has a perfectly clear herd, who has taken every precaution to prevent disease breaking out in his herd, can become infected and become the recipient of a notice of infection under section 6 of this Bill.  If that man receives such a notice it is open to the Minister under section 8 to decree that the price for any milk produced by him can be reduced to any extent the Minister decides.  The Minister could decide to reduce the price of that man's milk by 80 per cent.  The Minister could decide that the price for the milk would be cut to one-fifth of what it was before the notice of infection was issued.</P>
    <P>There are no limits on the amount by which the price can be reduced under this section.  There are no provisions which say that this power shall not be used where the herd owner is not at fault in a situation where disease has broken out in his herd.  The Minister is absolutely free to introduce this drastic and unlimited reduction in the price being received by that farmer for milk sold by him to the creamery because the notice of infection has been issued.</P>
    <P>This gives the Minister a power which, in those terms, he should not have.  I do not dispute the principle that milk from a clear herd is worth more than milk from an infected one and, if that milk from a clear herd is worth more, more money should be paid for it. That is a sound principle but I dispute the possibility that the Minister could introduce a heavy penalty whereby the price for milk is reduced by far more than the value it is reduced in real terms by the incidence of disease.  This could be exercised under the provision of section 8 in a discriminatory fashion.  There is no saver in this Bill against this happening within the terms of section 8.</P>
    <P>The Minister can prescribe the amount by which the price paid to those farmers may be reduced without necessarily having to receive the approval of <Col N="730" /> the House before he does so.  I take it that the Minister will be able to do this by order under the Bill.  If he does it by order there is no requirement within the provisions of section 18, which deals with orders, for those orders having to be approved by the House.  The procedure is the normal 21-day procedure whereby orders may be annulled without the need for the affirmation of the House to be given to the Minister in exercising powers given to him under section 8.  It is possible for the Minister to introduce, without the approval of the House, a most discriminatory and unfair scheme for penalising milk producers without regard to fault and without regard to the real, if any, reduction in value of the milk being sold to the creamery as a result of a notice of infection having been issued to them indicating that there was an incidence of TB and brucellosis in the herd.  This is unfair and we strongly oppose it.  No Government have the right to take that sort of power no matter how just the cause in which they take it.  It is not enough for the Minister to come in here with a series of platitudes about the need to eradicate disease and so forth as if all those who oppose him are not in favour of disease eradication. The Minister should not come in here and give us a lengthy oration about his dedication to disease eradication in justification for this unfair measure and imply that those opposing him are not dedicated to the eradication of disease. That certainly is not the case, because we are all in favour of disease eradication. That type of argument should not be used and I hope the Minister will justify line by line the provisions contained in section 8 and other sections which I outlined as being discriminatory and unfair.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to tell us exactly how he intends to use the powers of section 8, because he did not spell out how he will use them in the speech he made in introducing the Bill.  All the Minister said was that the provisions in the Bill related to the operation of a prices differential as between milk from disease free herds and that from infected herds and are all of enabling nature.  The Minister does not say what he will be <Col N="731" /> enabled to do and what he intends to do. Why did the Minister choose in his brief speech, in which he introduced a very strange set of proposals, not to tell us what he proposed to do when he got these enabling powers under section 8? The Minister's silence in the matter is ominous.  Even if the Minister's intentions are perfectly good, which I accept, and even if he intends to exercise these powers in an even handed way in the national interest, that should be written into the legislation.  Just because the Minister has good intentions is no justification for making bad law.  The provisions in section 8 will be on the Statute Book long after the Minister has ceased to be Minister, if they are not repealed by a successor, so it is no justification for the Minister to say that he has good intentions.  Section 8, as it stands, constitutes bad law because it is vague and gives the Minister unspecified powers.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that any funds accruing to milk processors as a result of operating a price differential system will not go to the Exchequer.  These funds could rather be used by the processors either to increase the price paid for milk from disease-free herds or to provide proper services to herd owners to help them fight disease.</P>
    <P>What guarantee is there that they will be used for that purpose?  There is no guarantee, and yet we are asked to accept section 8 on the grounds that the Minister thinks the funds could be used to increase the price paid to other herd owners or to provide appropriate services to herd owners.  Who will decide what are the proper services to herd owners to help them fight disease?  There is no machinery for deciding whether a service is appropriate or not for deciding whether or not this money is being properly used and is being passed on to herd owners who are clearing their herd properly.  All we have here is a statement from the Minister that these funds could rather be used for this purpose.  The Minister, referring to sections 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the Bill, also said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> I want to emphasise that there is nothing whatsoever in this Bill to give officers of the Revenue Commissioners any new powers of access to records kept by meat factories or milk processing plants.</P>
    <P>  If they are not getting new powers, why are they listed in the Bill?  The very fact that these powers to the Revenue Commissioners to inspect the records of meat processors and milk processing plants are in the Bill at all is an indication that the Minister is not telling the truth when he says that the Bill does not contain any new powers.  If the powers already exist there will be no need to have them in the Bill.  Every butcher will have to keep records of every animal he slaugters for a period of six years afterwards.  One can imagine a butcher keeping information about every animal from every herd owner for six years. Section 11 sets out the documents to be kept:</P>
    <P>(2)  Records or other documents kept by a person pursuant to the requirements of subsection (1) of this section which are in the power, possession or procurement of the person and, in the case of any such record or other document which has been issued by the person to another person, any copy thereof which is in the power, possession or procurement of the person, shall be retained in his power, possession or procurement for a period of six years from the date of the latest transaction to which the records or other documents relate: provided that this section shall not require the retention of records or invoices or any other documents in respect of which the Minister notifies the person concerned that retention is not required, nor shall it apply to the books and papers of a company which have been disposed of in accordance with section 305 (1) of the Act of 1963.</P>
    <P>Then the section sets out what an accountable person means: any dairy produce manufacturer, milk pasteuriser or milk bottler, or a person by whom milk is sold or offered for sale, or who receives milk from a herd for processing, <Col N="733" /> and so on.  It includes a person with a small milk round who purchases milk from three or four farmers and sells to 30 or 40 households in the neighbourhood.  We must keep records for a period of six years.</P>
    <P>We have been told that these are not new powers.  A person who might slaughter one animal a week for sale in his own stall must keep and produce such record.  Section 12 provides:</P>
    <P>(1)  An inspector or an authorised officer may, for the purpose of making an enquiry which he reasonably considers to be necessary either in relation to liability to levy (other than levy payable in respect of an animal which is exported live from the State), or an obligation to make reductions under section 8 of this Act, of any person, enter at any reasonable time any premises in which the inspector or officer, has reason to believe that such person is carrying on business and the inspector or officer may request the production of, search for and inspect any records, books or other documents whatsoever relating to milk or animals and may remove and retain any such records, books, or other documents for such period as may be reasonable for their examination or for the purpose of any proceedings for the recovery of levy payable under or by virtue of this Act or for an offence under this Act.</P>
    <P>If you have not been keeping a record for six years there are penalties.  The Revenue Commissioners will be entitled to visit the premises at any time, including a Sunday, and demand to see the record, say, for an animal slaughtered five years previously.  We have been told by the Minister that this Bill does not give the Revenue Commissioners any new powers.  Section 12 also provides:</P>
    <P>(2)  Upon request made by an inspector or an authorised officer at any premises in which a person carries on business, the person, or any person employed by him, shall produce to the inspector or officer all records, books, or other documents relating, whether solely or otherwise, to levy, a reduction under section 8 of this Act or <Col N="734" /> milk in relation to which such a reduction is made, and which may be in the power, possession or procurement of the person to whom the request is made and shall permit the inspector or officer to inspect and remove any documents so produced.</P>
    <P>(3)  A person shall not impede or obstruct an inspector or an authorised officer in the exercise of his powers under this section.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where, in pursuance of this section, an inspector or an authorised officer enters any premises, carries out any search or requests production of any document, he shall, on request, produce his warrant of appointment or his authorisation under this Act, as may be appropriate, to any person affected.</P>
    <P>If anybody fails to co-operate with the inspector he shall be liable to prosecution and if convicted to a fine not exceeding £500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for six months or to both.  The Minister's statement that this does not give new powers to the Revenue Commissioners is of doubtful veracity unless one accepts that similar powers have been given in the order introduced six weeks ago to facilitate the collection of the 2 per cent levy, which we have been assured is to be of strictly temporary duration.  Of course that order was not made under the Finance Bill, in which case the Oireachtas would have been given an opportunity to debate it.  These powers were introduced deliberately in a way which prevented discussion in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer generally to the operation of the disease eradication scheme throughout the country.  It is of considerable urgency that every measure be taken to eradicate disease.  Unless we take urgent action we face the possibility that it will not be open to us to export our livestock or livestock products to other parts of the EEC.  I support any reasonable measures taken to accelerate disease eradication in this country and I have forborne deliberately from criticising certain measures in principle which, although unpopular, I considered necessary from the point of view of disease <Col N="735" /> eradication.  Certain decisions taken by the Minister were very unpopular with certain sections of the farming community. I am speaking particularly of the 30-day test.  Such measures were introduced at the wrong time or were in the wrong manner and without the proper notice.  I have said in the past that I did not believe that they were wrong in principle and I did not criticise them in principle when the Minister introduced them.  This was deliberate on my part because I believed that action along these lines, although perhaps not in the precise form that the Minister took, was necessary to eradicate disease and if we do not take such action we will face serious problems as a community.</P>
    <P>Many other disease problems will come up in the future which will have to be dealt with in a serious fashion.  Bovine leucosis may become a problem in this country.  We have had an outbreak of bovine leucosis here resulting from the importation of Canadian cattle brought in for breeding purposes.  If this problem becomes severe action will have to be taken to eradicate this disease in a similar manner to the action taken to eradicate brucellosis.  This is a possible problem which we will have to face in the years ahead.  It is important that we get bovine tuberculosis and bovine brucellosis off the agenda so that other diseases which may arise can be dealt with.  Both bovine tuberculosis and bovine brucellosis are a severe health hazard to humans.  A considerable amount of unpasteurised milk is consumed which comes from areas where these diseases exist and there is a danger to health in this situation as long as these diseases are endemic in the community. Many people here, not all of them directly connected with agriculture, are suffering from the human version of brucellosis. This is most acute among people who are in direct contact with livestock as part of their normal work but it is not by any means confined to them.  I would like to see action taken to get rid of the root cause of this, which is the widespread existence of brucellosis in cattle from which the disease spreads to humans.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> I would also like to see better public health measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease.  The liaison between the officials responsible in the Department of Agriculture and in the health boards in relation to potential outbreaks of brucellosis in humans arising out of the high level of incidence of the disease is inadequate.  There is no established procedure whereby officials of the Department of Agriculture who become cognisant of the existence of an outbreak of the disease in their area notify the health boards of this and of its possible consequences for human health. These officers and the district veterinary officers perhaps in some cases have informal contact with the health boards and in some cases they may even meet the health boards and give information which would be useful to the health boards in helping to prevent these diseases occurring in an area and to warn families of the precautions they should take if they are likely to be in contact with this disease in order to prevent it taking place among the humans.  That may happen on an informal basis or an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement between individual veterinary surgeons or individual officers of the Department of Agriculture in some areas and either doctors or officials of the health boards in the same areas, but there is no form of procedure whatever for liaison between these two arms of the fight against these diseases, the veterinary and medical arms.  There should be a clearly established statutory procedure for requiring that the public health authorities be notified of any outbreak of an agricultural disease which has potential danger for human health, and that statutory notice be served by the officials of the Department of Agriculture or by any person qualified to know that such danger exists.  That provision should include veterinary surgeons.</P>
    <P>I would like to see also much more stringent inspection of premises where health hazards are likely to exist or to germinate.  We know that this is a responsibility not of the district veterinary officers of the Department of Agriculture but of officials who are also veterinary surgeons in private practice who are employed by the county councils. <Col N="737" /> These men have private practices and they are supposed to inspect all places where milk is produced and where animals are being slaughtered, including every butcher's stall and every milking parlour in the counties for which they are responsible.  There are not enough of these people.  It is possible to imagine that a veterinary surgeon who has a choice of going out to answer a call for which he will be paid by a client or going to the same client to see if his dairy is hygienic and possibly to prosecute him if not, unless he is a saint or has something against his client, is not going to go rushing off enforcing the public health regulations when he can go out to do a job on a sick beast and be paid for it.</P>
    <P>The arrangements made for inspection of premises from the point of view of securing adequate hygiene and so forth are quite inadequate and I would like to see action taken to strengthen these.  The county councils are not the appropriate bodies to have responsibility for this.  It should be dealt with either by the Department of Health or the Department of Agriculture, I am not sure which.  I should like to see an interdepartmental committee set up by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health to consider this matter and see what action can be taken to ensure that proper inspection takes place to maintain standards of hygiene. It is vital for the reputation of our food industry, for the protection of tourists and the reputation of this country, that adequate means of enforcement be found in relation to food hygiene.</P>
    <P>Prevention is better than cure in relation to bovine disease.  There is a great need for a publicity campaign to alert farmers to the ways in which they can prevent an outbreak of disease.  In Northern Ireland the veterinary services are very much engaged in educational activity.  This is not intended as a criticism of the officers here but rather a criticism of the system under which they are operating and also of the very high work load they bear.  Their counterparts in Northern Ireland call meetings of farmers and adopt a somewhat missionary approach to disease eradication. They do not sit in offices waiting for problems to arise and then take penal <Col N="738" /> action.  They call meetings of farmers on their own initiative and explain the nature of the problem.  They tell them that it is in their interest that these diseases be eradicated and that it is better to adopt some fundamental hygiene and other precautions than to seek compensation from hardship funds.  They take farmers into their confidence in that outgoing educational fashion.  Much could be done at that level at meetings of farmers in different counties called at the initiative of the district veterinary officers.</P>
    <P>A great deal could also be done by advertising in the press and on radio.  I regret that it is only good farmers who pay much attention to the farming press and listen to what is said on the radio. The fellow who has a real disease problem does not pay much attention. Disease can spread very easily from the herd of a bad farmer to that of a good farmer.  It is only necessary to have one bad egg in a basket for the whole basket to become affected.  The outgoing approach I have described is one way in which something could be done.  I do not believe the answer is to be found in the penal approach which is reflected in this legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for the introduction of the levy but does not give any indication as to how long the levy will continue. It is quite possible that brucellosis and TB could be eradicated but there is no guarantee that in such a situation the levy will be removed or reduced.  There is no connection whatsoever between the level of the incidence of disease or the amount being spent by the Government on disease eradication and the level of the levy.  At some time in the future twice as much money could be raised by the levy as is being spent by the Government on disease eradication.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent that.  There should be a provision in the Bill whereby there would automatically be a reduction in the levy in the event of a fall in the level of incidence of disease or a fall in the level of Government expenditure on disease eradication.  The Minister has already threatened that the levy might be increased in the years ahead, but he has given no indication that it might be <Col N="739" /> reduced.  Why has he not mentioned this possibility?</P>
    <P>The levy of £3 per head will be exactly the same for every animal, regardless of its value.  It will be charged on an animal being sold to the knacker for £5 because it is so riddled with disease that it is suitable only for dog food.  The same levy will be charged on a pedigree animal being sold for £2,000.  The farmer selling the valuable animal pays no more than the farmer selling the animal for £5.  Equally the farmer selling the calf for slaughter will pay the same as the farmer selling the mature animal. There is no discrimination between different types of animal.  That is unfair.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem that the hardship fund exists in the clearance areas but does not exist in the pre-intensive areas.  It is quite possible for a substantial outbreak of disease to take place in pre-intensive areas.  Farmers in those pre-intensive areas do not qualify for the hardship fund, but they will have to pay this levy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak about the recent announcement of a 20 per cent increase in ESB charges which can be classified as nothing short of a savage and brutal increase in charges which affect all the community, but will have a very serious effect on the less fortunate members of our society.</P>
      <P>When this Government were in Opposition they gave great prominence to the increases in prices which occurred during the Coalition period of office. They made absolutely no allowance for the world recession at that time.  They said that if they were allowed to govern they would stabilise and control the cost of living.  They have been in office for two years.  They were elected largely on the promise that, if they were returned as the Government, they would quite easily control the cost of living to the satisfaction of the people of Ireland.  They got a massive unprecedented mandate from the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since they took office we have had a series of price increases.  They have done nothing whatsoever to control the cost of living.  I should like to ask the Minister responsible to the Cabinet and to the people of Ireland when he received the application for the ESB price increases.  I want him to answer that because the <Col N="741" /> people want to know.  I should also like to know when did he put the application before the Cabinet and when was it approved. I want those questions answered.  If they are not answered I will have to assume the application was with the Minister long before the European and local elections and, for reasons of political expediency, he withheld and concealed that vital information from the people.</P>
    <P>The people will question the integrity of the Government if those questions are not answered.  I have a very high regard for the Minister, but I want to know was that information withheld because of the elections which took place on 7 June. The Minister is obliged to answer these questions.  If he does not answer them truthfully, the credibility of the Government will be at stake.  As a Minister in a responsible position and answerable to the people, he must answer truthfully. We all recall the Minister in another country who told a lie to his Parliament and subsequently resigned.  That is exactly what I will be expecting if we cannot hear the truth from the Minister.</P>
    <P>The increase in ESB charges will have very serious effects on the economy. There is no doubt about that.  Many of the complaints received by people in public life come from people who are experiencing difficulty in paying their ESB bills.  They come to their public representatives to see if they can make some arrangements with the ESB to meet charges which are already exorbitant. Because of this 20 per cent increase those charges will be beyond their means.  That is why I refer to the increase as vicious and savage.  A Government who made so many promises in their manifesto should be ashamed to allow such an increase to be imposed on the people of Ireland.  Do they fully understand that the cost of living is far beyond the means of the ordinary working class, those receiving social welfare payments, deserted wives and widows? They cannot make ends meet.</P>
    <P>I have heard Ministers say in this House: &ldquo;The cost of living is not high.  It is not beyond control.  We have it well in hand.&rdquo;  When they say that, they are speaking for themselves.  They are speaking about their own standards. <Col N="742" /> They are not speaking with a knowledge of ordinary working class people.  That is a dangerous position for any Government to find themselves in.  They do not understand or know what is happening to ordinary working class people.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal today from the Government about increases in the price of fuel and oil.  Now we are having a 20 per cent increase in ESB charges and we are told it is because the price of oil has increased and that is beyond the control of the Government.  The Government will have to consider seriously subsidising this increase.  They have no choice so far as the less well off sections of our society are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Economic Planning and Development tells us there is no problem and that the people are very happy.  Of course they are not, and they could not be, because inflation is running at a very high rate at the moment despite the promises made in the manifesto to control and stabilise the cost of living. That has not happened and is not happening.</P>
    <P>The people I move around with, ordinary working class people, people on social welfare, people down on their luck, cannot meet these charges.  The Government in Opposition made no allowance for the Coalition Government. They exposed them everywhere they could.  I am sure that is what they were in Opposition for and they did a pretty good job.  They never once made allowance for the world recession at the time which was far worse than the effect of the current oil increases we are now faced with.  Despite that the Minister and the Government told the people in their manifesto that if returned to power they would control the cost of living.  The people gave them a position of trust and returned them with a massive majority. What have they done?  They have let things run completely out of control. They have made excuse after excuse and the reason for the cost of living increase, oil.  I do not accept that.  Oil is a contributing factor but it is not the whole reason particularly from a Government who promised the people that if returned to power they would wave a magic wand and everybody would be all right.</P>
    <P>When did the Minister receive the application, <Col N="743" /> when did he put it before this Cabinet and when was it approved?  The people want to know the answer to that question.  The Minister is obliged to let the country know.  If the Minister does not answer this question I and the people can only assume that he had them well before the European and local elections and that the reason he withheld them was to deceive the people.  I hope that was not the position but I want to know the answer to the question.  There is an obligation on the Minister as the person responsible to the public to let them know.  These are important questions and I would like the Minister to answer them truthfully as he is obliged to do.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition were in power and had a similar situation in regard to increases outside of their control they tried to do something about it.  They removed VAT from certain essential commodities including electricity and town gas.  They also brought in subsidies for basic foodstuffs.  The present Government made many promises, but after two years in office what have we? A situation which is worse than one can possibly imagine.  There is nothing but mismanagement.  The cost of living has gone completely out of control.  The Government, who made what appears to be now so many false promises, are responsible.  They were given a clear mandate by the people to do what they promised they would do.  The Government are failing miserably to produce the goods.</P>
    <P>Can we blame oil for the increase in home-produced cabbage which is costing in the region of £1 per head? Can we blame oil for the increase in home-produced potatoes?  What has oil got to do with those?  The price of these commodities is way beyond the means of working class people.</P>
    <P>We find ourselves in a situation where we are discussing a savage increase imposed on the people which will have serious repercussions on the economy throughout the whole spectrum.  The Minister boasts of reducing the unemployment rate, yet as a member of the Cabinet, he has allowed this increase which will have nothing but serious effects on employment.  One does not have <Col N="744" /> to be a professor to know that a 20 per cent increase on ESB charges will have a serious effect on everybody.</P>

      <P>I am speaking about the savage increase on the poorer sections of society.  The Minister is obviously doing nothing to alleviate their position.  I am trying to remind him of the promises he made.  I should like the Minister to say when this application was received. When was it put before the Cabinet and when was it approved?  If it was received at the time I am informed it was and was not considered and disclosed, it is nothing short of deception.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLipper" hpid="Mr. Lipper Mr. Lipper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a 20 per cent charge.  We should not have to put down a motion.  The Minister should know he will have to do something to alleviate this position with regard to these people but the way he has been speaking one would imagine we were living in a Utopia and everybody was doing well. In my circle the people cannot meet these charges and something will have to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of people want to know when the Minister received that application. How the Minister will try to avoid the question I do not know but it is one that must be answered.  There were two important <Col N="745" /> elections and if the application was received in advance of those that should have been made known to the public.  They are the people expected to meet the charges and who will suffer because of this savage increase.  The Minister, as a public representative and from mixing with people on whose behalf we have put down this motion, should realise that it is not possible for them to meet that charge.  We have outlined certain categories he can assist. The Minister is obliged to help out those people, some of whom he has referred to as living so well.  I am not talking about those on social welfare but about those who have jobs, working people who will find it impossible to meet this increase in the price of electricity.  I recall my schools days when I returned in the evening to find my mother outside in the yard washing clothes in a tub.  Washing machines were not available then but if the Government continue to allow increases of the order of 20 per cent the people will not be able to pay for electricity with which to operate such appliances as washing machines.  We hear of cases of old and sick people dying because of lack of sufficient heating. Yet the Government are prepared to allow this savage increase of 20 per cent in the cost of electricity.</P>
    <P>The credibility of the Government depends largely now on their response to this motion.  If their response is not positive the promises they made to the people may very well be said to have been false.  Those people on social welfare&mdash;the unemployed, the widowed, deserted wives and so on&mdash;will not be in a position to meet this increase in the cost of electricity but I am making a case for those working-class people who, through no fault of their own, are to be faced with ESB bills for a six-month period or, to judge from the way the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is handling the Post Office dispute, with bills for a 12-month period.  One cannot be blamed for wondering whether that Minister is aware at all that there is a Post Office dispute.  Ministers, and Deputies too perhaps, will be able to pay their bills but we are here to talk about those people who sent us here to represent them, those people who have the <Col N="746" /> power of the ballot box to send us here. The Government are here on the basis of false promises because they have not done anything since their return to office to control prices.  In those two years the cost of living has soared and it cannot be said that inflation has been kept down. The removal of food subsidies has affected most the ordinary working-class people and those on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Having regard to these facts it is vitally important that the Minister lets us know this evening when the application for the 20 per cent increase in ESB charges was received and brought before the Minister for approval.  Also, we should be told when the increase was approved. If the Minister fails to answer these questions, his silence will be taken by the people as an indication of deceit on the part of the Government in the interests of political expediency and that would be a dreadful reflection on any Government.  What the people wish for most is that the Government go to the country.  We must be told, too, if further increases are to be announced or if there are applications in the pipeline for increases in the prices of other commodities or services.  We want the answers to these questions now so as not to have a situation in which the workers will be encouraged to accept a 7 per cent increase in incomes as part of a national understanding and, having accepted that level of increase, to have foisted on them further price increases.  I have been asked by the people I represent, the working-class people, to put these questions to the Minister.  Like any of us here, the Minister has been sent to this House by the people to do a job but his tenure of office is for a short number of years.  Luckily that is the situation that prevails, because if it were not for the democracy of the ballot box, matters would be even worse and there would be total contempt for the people.</P>
    <P>The Government won an election on the basis of a manifesto that was prepared for that election but forgotten about soon afterwards.  If it is the case that there are no applications with the Government for further price increases, we should be glad to hear that from the Minister.  If he fails to assure us on this <Col N="747" /> point we may only assume that we are to be faced with further increases of the order of 20 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lipper is utterly confused.  In our manifesto we did not state that we would prevent price increases but we did say that we would reduce inflation.  We said we would reduce inflation and we did.  I would like to quote some figures to make my case. Inflation was lower each year since Fianna Fáil came back than in any year the Coalition were in office.  It was down to 7.6 per cent last year compared with 14 per cent in 1977 and, even with the higher oil prices this year, inflation is estimated to be in the region of 11.5 per cent towards the end of the year.  This will still leave our inflation rate less than any year during the Coalition Government. That is a fact.  Nobody is happy about the price of oil going up.  As the Minister stated, the Fine Gael and Labour parties recognise that there is very little one can do about the increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy talk about 1979?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can make his own contribution later.  I would like to read the Minister's amendment so that other people will be aware of what the Fianna Fáil case is.  The amendment states:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;notes the problems arising as a result of increased energy costs, especially for lower income families and individuals, and also notes the need to <Col N="748" /> achieve greater economies in energy use, and approves of the steps taken by the Government to improve living standards for lower income groups.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What are the steps that have been taken by the Government?  The Government gave an increase in the last budget of 16 per cent to long-term social welfare recipients.  This is equivalent to just over £2 per week.  We must add to the 16 per cent the £1 a week which was proposed under the national understanding and which, if the Government have their way, will still come into effect on 1 October next.  I would like to refer the Deputy to the national understanding in regard to social welfare which states on page 10:</P>
    <P>Social Welfare and Health.</P>
    <P>The parties agree that policies for development should embrace social welfare and health elegibility improvements. The Government are already committed to maintaining the living standards of social welfare recipients by regular adjustments of the level of payments at least in line with the cost of living.  The Government are also considering the possibility of some improvements in the social welfare schemes which are specially designed to assist those in greatest need during the winter months.  Pending the outcome of this consideration, the Government will provide for an increase of £1 per week on all adult benefits, with <i>pro rata</i> improvements for dependants from 1 October 1979 until 31 March 1980.</P>
    <P>That will work out at an extra 6 per cent. The total increases this year to social welfare recipients will be of the order of 22 per cent.</P>
    <P>The estimated increase in the cost of living this year will be in the region of 11½ per cent, which includes food. Electricity is going up by 19½ per cent so that, even with the 22 per cent increase and forgetting about the 11½ per cent increase, which will be over the general items of food, clothing and so forth and just taking electricity, this increase will be more than offset by the increase in the social welfare benefits I have spoken about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> The consumption of electricity by the lower income groups tends to be lower than average.  From the data in the household budget surveys and from ESB figures the average consumption of lower income groups in 1978 is shown to have been 2,600 units compared with an overall average of 3,450 units.  The annual cost of electricity to the lower paid groups is £74.50.  The application of the present increase in electricity prices will result in an extra £2.40 on each two-monthly bill or £1.20 per month, that is an average of 30p per week.  That 30p should be added to the figure of over £2 a month, which has already been given in the Budget and the further 6 per cent which will be given on 1 October next, plus the fact that the Government are considering changing the fuel system whereby the people who get vouchers for a hundredweight of turf can change them at the post office.  I know the Government are giving active consideration to this and I will not be the slightest bit surprised if they come up with a favourable decision.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation made representations to the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Cluskey, now the leader of the Labour Party, to do this. There was plenty of sympathy but nothing was done about it.  I am quite optimistic that the Government will do something to help the people in the lower income groups.  This will be a big help to them.</P>
    <P>Another item I would like to refer to is the actual increases in ESB costs since 1977.  The most recent increase in ESB charges was more than two years ago, which was a 10 per cent increase.  Since then the charges were reduced on two occasions, the first being a decrease of 2½ per cent in October 1977 and a further 5 per cent in April 1978.  It is not very usual to pass on those reductions to the consumers.  This was done because of the favourable exchange rates prevailing and because fuel was paid for by dollars, which had fallen considerably.  The present increase in electricity charges will increase the consumer price index by 0.36 per cent.  The actual rise in the index from November 1978 to May 1979 was 7.1 per cent, which was still a <Col N="750" /> lot lower than any year during the Coalition Government.  That is expected to rise in the three months to mid-August by 2.5 per cent.  Nobody is happy about increased fuel costs.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to introduce a subsidy for low income families and individuals towards the cost of their ESB charges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When they refer to individuals I gather that they are referring to the lower income people.  The Government, with the increases they have given, have more than allowed for the increased electricity charges, which they are not happy about but which are out of their control.  We know that 40 per cent of the cost is wrapped up in higher fuel costs and other costs are built into it such as increased labour costs and depreciation. The real value increases in social welfare payments amount to nearly three times as much in the period 1977-1979 compared with the period 1973-1977.  This Government have always emphasised their concern for old age pensioners, who have done better under Fianna Fáil than under the Coalition.  It will continue to be our policy to give these people increases in excess of the cost of living. The income of a non-contributory old age pensioner increased in real terms by more than 5 per cent a year in the period 1977-1979 while the single contributory pensioner's rate of increase was marginally below that.  These figures show an improvement in the standard of living of these people whereas their standard of living was declining under the Coalition.</P>
    <P>We are conscious that the dissatisfaction is not because of increases in the cost of living, which people can bear as long as their incomes keep up.  The real dissatisfaction and annoyance relates to problems like the dustbin strike in Dublin and the postal strike which prevents people from getting British pensions and money from America.  I can understand the anger of the people and I know the Government are aware of it. But we are also conscious that, if we give in to unrestricted demands for huge increases beyond our ability to pay, we <Col N="751" /> will start a round of inflation that will be reminiscent of the days of the Coalition and we will end up by being rejected. People might say that we were elected with a majority of 20 but we were not elected with a majority of 20, the Coalition were rejected by a majority of 20. Governments are not elected but rejected.</P>

Deputy O'Donnell must have nearly died when he heard Deputy Ryan introducing these savage increases giving as his reason that he wished to reduce the number of cars on the road.  By so doing the Deputy was ensuring that only people with money could afford to drive around.  Deputy Ryan put 35p on to a gallon of petrol as against the 12p put on by the Arabs.  Deputy Ryan was known as the greatest Arab of them all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of just under 5 per cent which I indicated as an increase in real terms in the non-contributory old age pension compared with just over 2 per cent in 1977, which was the last year of the Coalition.  In this year's budget the Government increased children's allowances by 23 per cent.  We know that people have not got the money yet due to the postal strike, but it is in the pipeline.  The national understanding, which unfortunately was rejected by the trade union movement, provided for a minimum flat rate increase of £4 and £2 over two phases in order to improve the position of the lower paid.  That compared with an average increase of £2.40 for two <Col N="752" /> months or 30p per week for the electricity being used.  That is putting it in perspective.  However, I know that this will not be reported by the media. We have learned to accept that that side of the story is never given.</P>
      <P>Free electricity and free television were introduced by Fianna Fáil for old age pensioners living on their own without a supplementary income.  The Deputy threw out the figure of £1 for a head of cabbage, but this was because last winter's frost destroyed three quarters of the cabbage crop.  It was the worst winter in years.</P>
      <P>Following the rejection of the national understanding we will need a certain amount of discipline.  Nobody on this side of the House wants a whole spate of increases coming in which will start a spiral of inflation necessitating among other things further ESB increases, because they will be looking for increases as well.  We must exert self discipline.</P>
      <P>A question was raised about why we are unwilling to subsidise fuel for the lower income groups.  One of our reasons is because by subsidising fuel we could encourage people to use more.  It is far better to give money so that people can decide whether to use it on fuel or on other items.  The Government are making grants available for insulation and so on and are trying to educate the people to conserve fuel.  Advertisements have already been appearing in the newspapers in relation to various types of heaters for homes and I note that the old-fashioned pot-bellied stove is coming back.  The people should be educated in relation to fuel conservation and perhaps RTE will be called on to do something constructive for a change in relation to putting on a programme advocating the proper use and conservation of fuel. Perhaps they could have a member of the IIRS on a programme which would regularly inform people about how to cut down on fuel costs.  Fuel is a big item now not only in the budgets of lower paid people but also in the budgets of middle income people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of free electricity allowances is in the region of £6 million annually and if we were to extend the scheme to all social welfare groups it would be about <Col N="753" /> £25 million, which would have to come out of the pockets of the hard-pressed taxpayers at a time when we have the PAYE people rigorously complaining about unfair taxation and on the other hand people hammering even harder at the Government to give subsidies for this and for that.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out to the people to conserve energy, and cheaper electricity would encourage more and wasteful use of it at a time when we all know the importance of conserving fuel. We must cut out waste of energy and if people do that their electricity bills will be reduced.  For instance, if they go out of a room and leave two bars of an electric fire switched on their electricity bills will be higher than if they had turned off one bar.  I am satisfied that this increase can be absorbed by average households through conservation.  I operate a budget system of payment and I therefore will not get huge electricity bills when the postal strike has finished.  I will now increase my budget by £2 or £3 a month, making it £15 a month instead of £12, and if I get my 7 per cent increase it will more than offset the ESB increase.</P>

      <P>I am afraid Deputy Lipper was confusing his manifesto with ours.  During the Coalition time their leader said at the Curragh that 50 per cent of the inflation increase was caused in the home.  As I have said, there is enormous pressure on the Government to increase subsidies.  We have been concerned to control the cost of living so that it will not rise as steeply as it did under the Coalition.  We are naturally concerned about oil supplies.  God only knows what we will be using for fuel in place of oil in 1990.  Of course, necessity is the mother of invention and I am optimistic that the human race will survive current difficulties.  It is our greatest concern to protect the less well off section <Col N="754" /> and we have managed to do so much better than the Coalition.  On many occasions during their term I saw people with blankets around their shoulders because they did not have electric fires.</P>

I suggest that we should involve the IIRS and the media, particularly RTE, in a series of programmes at certain times each week on methods in regard to fuel conservation, different methods for different types of houses.  This is very important because we have been told by the chairman of the ESB that he envisages the possibility of electricity cuts next winter.  We should be concerned particularly about conservation because it is no use giving money <Col N="755" /> to people to pay for energy which does not exist because of wastage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire him a lot but I have sympathy with him in his trying to make a case, as the Minister for Economic Planning and Development here last night tried to make a case by quoting figures and statistics which were completely out of touch with life and the country.  Irrespective of what figures are quoted a large majority of the 83 Deputies on the far side of the House are in touch with what is happening and I am sure that all of them are alarmed at what they see.  People trying to lead ordinary, everyday lives find that costs are mushrooming around them and they are unable to meet the increases with which they are being hit daily.  The Members of this House and of the Seanad recognise that the duty of every person elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas is to endeavour to treat all the citizens on an equal basis, to endeavour to obtain fair treatment for every person in this country.  If there is a more major responsibility on the part of the people elected to these Houses it is to try to look after people who are not in a position to look after themselves, to help the weaker and poorer sections of our community and the sections who find that they are not able to cope.  I am talking about widows and people on disability benefit, unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  I am talking about people who are working on low incomes with large families.  All of these people are being hit day in and day out with different price increases.  This 19.5 per cent increase in ESB charges after all the other <Col N="756" /> increases is something that people cannot meet or cope with.  Yesterday we were told about an increase of 15 to 20 per cent in CIE fares.</P>
      <P>This motion that has been put down by the Labour Party is a simple one and I am sure that the majority of the Deputies on the Government side would be fully in favour of adopting it.  They know that it would be necessary to subsidise these ESB charges.  The increase amounts to one-fifth or 20 per cent of these charges.  Even before this increase came in many consumers were barely able to pay their ESB accounts every two months.  This major increase of 20 per cent lumped on top of the existing charges will be the straw that will break the camel's back for many people. Deputy Briscoe talked about people putting on one bar of an electric fire.  He spoke of people with blankets on their shoulders.  He spoke about different rates of social welfare, different prices, the CPI and so on.  All of this is interesting but it is poor comfort for people facing the coming winter.  Many people then will be left freezing in their houses because they cannot pay their ESB accounts.  It is a serious and sad fact that this comes from a Government who saw fit to abolish the wealth tax which affected only really wealthy people. They saw fit to abolish rates on the biggest mansions in this country owned by the wealthiest people.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> The ESB charges will affect not only the weekly budget of a family.  They will lead also to increases in the cost of other household goods and items right across the board.  The charges will not end after payment of the account.  They will lead to increased costs in production for industry. They will lead to increased labour costs and to increased costs in supermarkets.  All of these are a spin-off of the increase in ESB charges.</P>
    <P>The Government's amendment is an interesting amendment.  It notes the result of increased energy prices and the need for greater economy in energy use. We must bear in mind that there is a scarcity of heating oil which has led to a sizeable number of people turning to electric heating and solid fuel.  The Government should take note of this fact in their efforts to deal with the energy problem and endeavour to increase production of peat briquettes.  I know they are making moves in this direction.</P>
    <P>At present it is almost impossible for Bord na Móna to acquire bogland for development because they are restricted to paying a figure in the region of £70 per acre.  Unless they can pay the market price they will meet widespread opposition in their efforts to acquire more bogland.  There have been sizeable petrol queues in Dublin but I should like the Minister to see the huge number of lorries which arrive on Sunday evening at Garryhinch near Portarlington and wait to collect turf the following day.  Such is the demand that some of them must wait until 5 o'clock on Monday evening. Solid fuel will be unbelievably scarce during the coming winter and we should at least accelerate the supply of baled briquettes.</P>
    <P>The Government should subsidise ESB charges and I would also urge a subsidy towards CIE charges.  It is reported in today's edition of <i>The Irish Press</i> that the Irish Petrol Retailers' Association have experienced a drop of 25 per cent in petrol sales and CIE have experienced a 25 per cent increase in passenger numbers on expressway buses and mainline trains since the petrol crisis.</P>

      <P>I wish to reply briefly in support of our motion.  The central issue is that there must be a reallocation and realignment of social resources towards the cost of heating the homes of low incomes persons.  It is a bit odd that we could have gaily allocated in the past few years massive relief to taxpayers. We handed out £90 million of taxpayers' money to ratepayers.  It did not matter whether they had one house or 20 houses in their possession; the more houses they had the more they benefited from rates relief.  Individuals in my constituency can have a house worth £50,000 or even £90,000 on which they enjoy total rates relief, and they can own a house on the shores of a lake in County Mayo&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a glaring social contrast in the fact that the Government and this House had no difficulty in the most profligate distribution of taxpayers' money when giving massive relief to families throughout the country whether they needed it or not. This includes our own families.  In the <Col N="760" /> proposition put forward this evening we ask for a miserable £2 million or £3 million out of the State's expenditure of about £2,500 million in the budget to subsidise electricity charges for those in greatest need, in dire need, and in the coming winter in ever-increasing need, and the Government say blandly that there is no more money left in the kitty. We want to draw attention to that situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe assured us it would cost something like £25 million to implement this motion.  We say it would cost £2 million or £3 million.  As of now the free electricity scheme costs about £6 million and benefits 132,000 people. That excellent scheme gives a subsidy of about £45 per person.  Next winter the breadwinners of about 30,000 families will be unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about 3,000 or 4,000 deserted wives in this country.  About half of them live alone with their children.  They could qualify for the subsidised electricity.  There are tens of thousands of people on low incomes between the ages of 65 and 66 years who could be brought within the net.  Perhaps the Government will do that in the next budget.  At the moment they are excluded.  There are a large number of widows under the age of 66 years who live alone on the miserly, miserably low rate of social benefit applied to widows by successive administrations. In government we did our utmost for them.  This Government are trying to do their utmost for them but, whether we like it or not, a widow living alone gets about £18.50 and out of that, if she is under the age of 66 years, she has to pay her full electricity bill.  Many Deputies know from the Euro campaign that £18.50 would not go half-way towards paying for a round of drinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My central point is that the money can be found quite easily if we are seriously concerned and if we have a social conscience.  I do not accept the endorsement by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development of the view <Col N="761" /> of the IEA that domestic energy prices should be allowed to reach a level which encourages energy conservation.  That is laudable enough in theory but in practice, if energy prices were allowed to reach that level, it would not be a question of conservation but a question of stoppage of use by persons on low incomes. I do not regard that as a realistic alternative policy.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by the Minister as well that the Government would press ahead with a more selective conservation programme designed specifically to help the lower income groups.  I would welcome that.  It would be an identifiable assistance to persons on lower incomes but between now and next winter, and between now and the next budget, the Government should try to bring in a feasible and effective scheme.  It has taken the Government something like two years to even think about doing something about the so-called free fuel scheme.  That could be of major benefit and I hope it will be amended as anticipated <Col N="762" /> by the Minister.  He indicated that the Government are looking at it again and I hope it will be amended in the light of the situation which will face us next year.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole made a sensible suggestion about the abolition of VAT on insulation material which is currently subjected to a rate of 10 per cent VAT. At the moment one has to spend between £50 and £100 to qualify for minimal tax relief.  A warm cardigan is about the most a poor person could rise to, not to speak of spending £80 or £100 to insulate the attic.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept our motion. I favoured the national understanding, and the money which would have been allocated next October under that scheme could be set aside to subsidise ESB costs which will be increased by 20 per cent.  I regret that we are not able to accept the Government's amendment to our motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise with the Government the alternative arrangements they have made in respect of our Presidency of the EEC which commences in ten days' time, having regard to the absence of a functioning postal and telecommunications system.  I have raised this matter before and I quote now from what the Minister for Foreign Affairs had to say in introducing the Estimate for his Department on 31 May and as reported at column 1904 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>... I must stress the importance of presenting a favourable image of Ireland to the world in the highly publicised period of our Presidency.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>The prospects are indeed great but the alternative is too tragic to contemplate if in the full glare of publicity we were to choose instead to advertise self-interest and irresponsibility in our country.</P>
      <P>In stressing the Government's concern for the positive image this country should display during our Presidency, the Minister said, as reported at column 1906:</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputies, as I did the Commission, that the Irish Presidency will at all times be conscious of the interests and aspirations of the entire Community and that we are determined to conduct Community business in a well-organised and consistent fashion.</P>
      <P>That is the Government's intention as enunciated about 20 days ago but there is still no settlement to the Post Office dispute and neither has there been any solution in the meantime to all the other problems to which the Minister referred both implicitly and explicitly.  We attempted to vote a lot of money in presenting the image of Ireland abroad but that image is now at risk seriously as a result of the full glare of publicity to which we will be subjected during our Presidency.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy dealing with the postal strike or with the question of alternative arrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the alternative arrangements while stressing the importance of those arrangements <Col N="765" /> having regard to the Minister's definition of how important the Presidency is to us. While I understand that the talks in progress tonight are very hopeful in terms of a settlement to the dispute, I should like to hear from the Minister of State as to the arrangements that have been made with the Army to establish a radio broadcasting system based in Iveagh House with direct radio contact with the other eight capitals in the Community. If that is the case I should like the Minister to state exactly what is the role of the Army in this instance, what the nature of the communications is likely to be, whether these arrangements have been discussed with the ICTU, and whether this action, if it is being undertaken provisionally by the Government, will not be construed by the ICTU as a major strike-breaking measure.</P>
      <P>In recent months the Army have been used in this context in a number of other areas which do not concern us here, but if they are to be used in this instance in the way I have outlined we will be creating the additional precedent of using them as a strike breaker.  Therefore, it is important that the Minister clarifies what is going on in that area.  I should like the Minister to assure the House also that there is no question of our being deprived of the Presidency in ten days' time because of our not having an adequate telecommunications and postal service in operation.  I have heard, but obviously this must be only in the nature of rumour since the sources concerned cannot be quoted, that the French have raised the issue of retaining the Presidency until such time as the Post Office dispute here has ended.  I should like the Minister to clarify that position also.  If this line is being adopted by the French what is the attitude of the Government to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Government's assessment of the load that will fall now on the telex section of the telecommunications system assuming that, even if the dispute is settled, there will be a disruption in the postal services because of the backlog of material that is in the post?  What additional provision has been made by the Government to augment the telex service, telephone lines and so on?  We know that the difficulties in the Department <Col N="766" /> of Posts and Telegraphs have been in existence for many years and during the terms of office of many administrations. These difficulties will not be resolved easily.  The Government have seen fit to promote very strongly the importance of the Presidency and I, deputising for our spokesman, Deputy Kavanagh, stress our support for the Presidency, but we want to see the evidence of constructive action from the Government benches.</P>
    <P>For example, in the context of the Presidency I should like to hear what plans and contingency arrangements are being contemplated for the summit of the heads of State which presumably will take place in the autumn and during our term of the Presidency.  These are matters that must be raised because the reality is that for the next six months this capital city of Dublin will be in effect the capital city of the EEC.  Perhaps it is not realised by most citizens that this will be the position.  During this time the volume of communications, whether by way of the diplomatic bag or by way merely of letters seeking hotel accommodation, will be centred on Dublin if it relates in any way to the EEC.  What arrangements are being made by the Government to give effect to the claim made by the Minister that we are determined to conduct Community business in a well-organised and consistent fashion?  Ten days from the beginning of our term of the Presidency and 17 weeks into a disastrous postal dispute which, irrespective of whether it is resolved tonight, will still leave a large backlog of post, we should like to see the measure of that organisation.</P>
    <P>The points, then, that I am raising are: are the French attempting to retain the Presidency until such time as our postal dispute is resolved?  I trust that we will have an assertive answer to that question. Are the Army establishing radio communication with the capitals of the other eight member states and, if so, what is the nature of that communication and what is the perceived role of the Army in this instance?  What is the estimated increase in the load on the telex system and what is our capacity to handle that increase?  What provision is being made in terms of telecommunications <Col N="767" /> for establishing the summit which presumably will be held in the autumn?</P>
    <P>Finally, what assessment, if any, have the Government of the likely backlog in terms of delayed post that there is now throughout the world and which is destined for this country?  How is that likely to affect our postal services in the context of the Presidency over the next six months?  What provision have the Government made for ensuring that the claim made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to conduct committee business in a well-organised, consistent manner can be achieved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn asked what were the alternative administrative arrangements the Government have made to deal with the Presidency of the EEC in view of the postal and telecommunications dispute.  I am not making any special point about this but this question was received at very short notice.  If I were making any point about this I would be questioning the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle.  It has never been my practice in this House to do anything like that and, on this occasion, it is also not my intention to query the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle.  It is entirely a matter for the Ceann Comhairle whether or not he allows a question at late notice, short notice or long notice.  The reality of the situation is, as Deputy Quinn has stated, that he raised this matter before.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is out of the country on national business at this time and that is the reason why I am standing in for him tonight.  I make no apologies for that as that is one of the many roles of a Minister of State.  I wanted to get on the record the reason for the Minister's absence from the House and the reason for him not being able to reply to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn raised the matter before and the Minister for Foreign Affairs stressed, in reply to that question, the absolute need&mdash;I am not quoting the Minister exactly&mdash;that a favourable view of the country, the people and the Government must be sent abroad.  I believe the Deputy will support that <Col N="768" /> view.  His party leader and the leader of the Fine Gael Party have supported the need for Ireland to present a favourable national image during the currency of the Presidency.</P>
    <P>The other point raised by the Deputy in relation to the aspiration of the Government to serve the entire community is also an achievable aspiration by a Minister who has distinguished himself in his role as our Minister for Foreign Affairs since taking office in 1977.  I have no doubt, having regard to the Minister's dedication, integrity and his proven ability that he will be able to project a favourable image of this nation abroad.  I believe each side of the House shares the aspirations of the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked me to reply unequivocably to a series of questions.  A number of the queries he asked me to reply to, as he stated, are based on rumour; consequently, the questions which are based on rumour will receive no reply from me because it is not my practice to reply to questions based on rumour.  I would like to make it very clear to the Deputy that the Department of Foreign Affairs at this moment and in the past have never been guilty of strike-breaking. It is equally false to suggest that the French president expressed concern about the possibility of this country not being in a position to discharge its duties as the presiding nation of the Community.  There is no basis in fact, or, by definition, in rumour, in relation to that.  It is absolutely without foundation.</P>
    <P>Ireland, during the term of the last Presidency, had a very high reputation, both through its representatives and through the civil service.  I am quite satisfied, again without any equivocation whatever, that the Government can do as good a job if not better, despite the problems, than the Coalition.  I am not entering into the argy-bargy of politics; I am not denying that I have in the past entered into the argy-bargy of politics; I am a politician, and I am very proud of that fact and I will never, under any circumstances, deny the profession of politics.  I do not want to enter into a controversy, despite the provocative questions based on rumour posed to me <Col N="769" /> by the Deputy, requesting me to answer them.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Department of Foreign Affairs have been improving their communication facilities in line with developments in telecommunications generally and with arrangements among our EEC partners.  Those facilities, by definition, by the progress of modern technology, include radio communication.  I am satisfied, and the Minister is satisfied, that it should be possible for us to discharge our obligations absolutely when we assume the Presidency of the EEC on 1 July.  While the position is that if the Post Office strike should continue we would not be able to provide all the facilities we would have wished&mdash;I am sure Deputy Quinn shares with me the wish to provide the maximum amount of facilities possible in the circumstances&mdash;nevertheless the arrangements we can make, and are making, will be adequate.  Like the Deputy, who has referred to hopeful developments in the postal strike, I am not without hope that the post office strike will end in time to enable us to provide <Col N="770" /> all the facilities we have planned.  This, in a sense, is an unreal debate in that we are dealing with a hypothetical question and also questions based on rumour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one question based on rumour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>

      <P>There are no measures in operation which are specifically designed to prevent chemical pollution in agriculture.  In so far as normal usage of pesticides is concerned I am advised that there is no evidence to suggest that the use of pesticides in Ireland has given rise to problems in this sector.  However, in view of the number of new products coming on the market and the increasing use of pesticides generally my Department have been considering the introduction of a pesticide registration scheme under which pesticides would require prior approval before being marketed.  In addition, EEC directives which will come into operation on 1 January 1981 will provide for the prohibition of sale of some pesticides and will lay down elaborate labelling and packaging requirements for dangerous pesticides.</P>
      <P>Regarding the aerial application of chemicals, my Department co-operates with the Department of Transport and Tourism in prescribing the conditions under which these operations may be carried out, bearing in mind the possible danger of pollution.</P>

    <P>The Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, prohibits the use of a dipping place for sheep if such use would injuriously affect the water in any stream, reservoir, aqueduct, well, pond or other place constructed <Col N="680" /> or used for the supply of water for drinking or other domestic purposes.</P>
    <P>There are also regulations which provide that where there is on any land a place used for dipping sheep the owner or occupier of such land shall, after each occasion on which the place is so used, cleanse the place and so dispose of the sheep bath used that no river, well or water supply is thereby tainted or poisoned.  When dossiers are submitted by manufacturers with a view to having particular chemicals authorised for use as additives in feeding stuffs it is customary to seek information regarding the possible residual aspects of the chemicals concerned.</P>
