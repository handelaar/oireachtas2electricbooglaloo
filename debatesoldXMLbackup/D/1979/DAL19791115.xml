    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £13,381,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1979, for the salaries and expenses of the Garda Síochána, including pensions, etc; for payments of compensation and other expenses arising out of service in the Local Security Force; for the payment of certain witnesses' expenses; and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The additional funds are required to meet extra expenditure arising on the Garda Vote which was not foreseen when the original Estimate was prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An extra £10,966,000 is needed for salaries, wages and allowances&mdash;subhead A&mdash;£2,216,000 for superannuation &mdash; subhead I &mdash; and £599,000 to meet increased costs under the headings of travelling and incidental <Col N="1751" /> expenses&mdash;subhead B.1.&mdash;and transport &mdash;subhead G.  These extra sums add up to a total of £13,781,000 but the net amount required is only £13,381,000 as there are anticipated savings of £300,000 on clothing&mdash;subhead D&mdash;and an expected increase of £100,000 in appropriations-in-aid from contributions towards the Garda Síochána Widows and Children's Pension Scheme.</P>
    <P>The gross cost of additional payments in respect of salary and allowances, including pay increases, which were not provided for in the original Estimate is £14,396,000, but that amount is offset by anticipated savings on the original Estimate&mdash;due partly to overestimation and partly to unforeseen delay in filling vacancies&mdash;and increased deductions from pay in respect of official quarters and pensions, leaving the net additional sum required at £10,966,000.</P>
    <P>The main pay increases involved are those granted on foot of the recommendations of the Garda Síochána Committee of Inquiry, which was chaired by Professor Louden Ryan, and those arising under the National Understanding, 1979.  The cost in the present year of implementing the pay recommendations of the Ryan Committee is £9,611,000 and the cost of the increases under the national understanding is £2,907,000.</P>
    <P>I should explain that in this context pay and allowances includes payments for unsocial hours, overtime, and rent allowances.</P>
    <P>In addition to what is needed for pay increases, extra funds totalling £1,352,000 are required to meet the cost of additional overtime and unsocial hours worked by the Garda Síochána in the course of the year.  Additional expenditure on the salaries subhead arises also in respect of social welfare (employer's) contributions, the application to the force of the interim award of the Devlin Review Body and the payment to clerical and other staff employed in Garda offices of increases in pay granted under the Civil Service Conciliation and <Col N="1752" /> Arbitration Scheme to general civil service grades.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £499,000 is needed on subhead B.1.&mdash;Travelling and Incidental Expenses&mdash;to meet expenditure arising from increased travelling as well as from increases in rates of subsistence allowance and motor mileage allowances which have been granted to the Garda Síochána in common with other public servants.</P>
    <P>Increases in the price of petrol since the original Estimate was prepared are expected to give rise to an additional expenditure of £100,000 on subhead G of the Vote&mdash;Transport.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of superannuation&mdash;subhead I&mdash;additional funds amounting to £2,216,000 are required this year in the following circumstances. First, public service pensions are increased each year as from 1 July to take account of the pay rates applying to serving colleagues on that date.  Accordingly, arising from increases in pay granted to members of the force, there will be consequential increases in superannuation payments.  These consequential increases are estimated to cost £1,550,000.  A further £450,000 is needed for improved superannuation benefits announced by the Minister for Finance in this year's budget.  As well as that, the current trend of expenditure on pensions this year indicates that there could be a shortfall of about £216,000 on the original Estimate.  The total extra sum required for superannuation is, therefore, £2,216,000.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I would like to avail of the opportunity to express in this House my thanks to Professor Ryan and his colleagues for agreeing to serve on the Garda Síochána Committee of Inquiry and my appreciation of the speedy, efficient and courteous way in which they carried out their task.  Their report was presented on 19 April last, just five-an-a-half months after the Committee were appointed.  I am happy to say that the speed with which they completed their work was matched only by the promptness with which the Government <Col N="1753" /> agreed to implement the recommendations on pay&mdash;just over two weeks after the date on which the Committee submitted their report.</P>
    <P>The Committee's recommendations on other matters such as recruitment, training, promotion and civilianisation require more time to consider.  Discussions on these matters were initiated some months ago in the Garda Conciliation Council and I am hopeful that we will be able to make progress in dealing with the recommendations on these items.</P>
    <P>In commending this Supplementary Estimate to the House I am sure Deputies would wish to join with me in thanking the members of the Garda Síochána for the services which they continue to perform so loyally and efficiently for the whole community.  A special word of praise is due for the exemplary way in which they responded to the challenge presented by the recent visit of His Holiness, Pope John Paul II.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Supplementary Estimate on the Prisons Vote.</P>
    <P>On the Prisons Vote the excess occurs mainly in subhead A of the Vote&mdash;salaries, wages and allowances. The additional amount required for this subhead is £1,985,000 and is made up of £1,228,000 excess in respect of pay increases not provided for in the original estimate plus an excess on overtime&mdash;excluding the excess on overtime due to pay increases&mdash;of £1,431,000. This total excess is partly offset by an anticipated saving of £674,000 on the non-overtime element of subhead A, mainly savings arising from unfilled vacancies.</P>
    <P>The pay element in the excess results mainly from adjustments of the pay of prison staff in accordance with general adjustments of pay in the economy and from adjustments of their pay and allowances under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards the overtime element, provision was made in the Estimate for 1979 for an expenditure of £1 million on the Prison Service.  As already mentioned <Col N="1754" /> this Estimate will, in fact, be exceeded by £1,431,000.  The reasons for the excess are mainly the need for higher manning levels to provide additional security and the incidence of unfilled vacancies.</P>
    <P>Between the time of taking up office and January this year I created 444 additional posts in the Prison Service and since then I have arranged for the creation of a further 200 posts to meet additional security needs.</P>
    <P>Recruitment for most of this year has been slow, mainly on account of the postal strike and vacancies remained at a relatively high level during the year.  Effectively there are 385 vacancies at present. It is not expected that this figure can be reduced by very much between now and the end of the year.  In the Prison Service vacancies cannot be carried.  They must be filled by recalling staff from their rest-days on an overtime basis.  It is estimated that for the full year 1979 the total expenditure on rest-day overtime will be about £1.25 million.</P>
    <P>The main part of the balance of the estimated overtime expenditure in 1979 is to service evening recreation for persons in custody.  Offenders in the closed institutions are allowed out of their cells between roughly 5.00 p.m. and 7.30 to 8.15 p.m., depending on the institution, for recreation purposes.  This recreation period has traditionally been serviced by some of the day staff remaining over on an overtime basis until final lock-up time.  The total cost in overtime of this service in 1979 will be close to £1 million.</P>
    <P>The balance of overtime expenditure could be regarded as routine unavoidable overtime on, for example, clerical work, trades work, escort duties and so on.</P>
    <P>The additional sum of £20,000 required for subhead B&mdash;travelling and incidental expenses&mdash;is needed to cover the cost of increased subsistence rates and reclassification for subsistence purposes of prison officers so as to bring them into line with general civil service classifications.  It is anticipated that this amount will be offset by a corresponding <Col N="1755" /> saving which, on the basis of present trends, is expected to arise on subhead E&mdash;Prison Services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of discussing issues relating to prisons and the Garda Síochána, and all that that implies, under the two Supplementary Estimates before us.  This area of ministerial responsibility and governmental action or inaction is of fundamental importance.  Indeed, on the degree of success which the Minister has, hinge the hopes we have for improving the stability of our society and the harmony thereof, because a system of justice is fundamental to achieving the kind of peace which is real peace based on a society which is at peace with itself. From the evidence to date it appears that we have a long way to go to achieve that.</P>
      <P>An Estimate is obviously a great deal more than a fiscal statement.  Perhaps it is time we began to think of an Estimate of proposed expenditure as a social statement.  It implies some basic accepted philosophy of what one believes to be right and how one believes one should act.  It is far more than a simple accountancy exercise and sometimes we are a little too ready to assume that that is all there is in it.  I would have hoped, for example, that we might have in the Minister's remarks a little more of the reasons why this expenditure is as it is and whether or not the Minister expects it to be successful in terms of achieving the goals which I am sure he has set for himself and his Department.  In other words, I thought he would have had a more fundamental approach to the expenditure than this accountancy exercise which occasionally occurs in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the success of a prison system and of Garda Síochána involvement <Col N="1756" /> in the whole security operation is frightfully important.  There is evidence to indicate that we are failing lamentably and I hope to be able to show the evidence of this.  A previous Attorney General of the United States, Ramsey Clarke, said:</P>
    <P>No activity of a people so exposes their humanity, their character, their capacity for charity in its most generous dimension, as the treatment they accord persons convicted of crime.</P>
    <P>This reference is in a paper by Ramsey Clarke.  I have no further reference for it but I can provide it to anyone who is interested. Allowing for a certain hyperbole in the statement it is a good summary of the degree of Christian commitment which a society such as ours would expect to have to people who are at least unfortunate and who could do with more attention than they have had heretofore.</P>
    <P>Also in relation to expenditure such as thus we have to analyse what its purpose is, what goals it was designed to achieve. Would it be too much to ask that we could look forward to a society where crime rates would be diminishing, where there would be need for fewer security forces rather than more, where we could set our children the aspiration of living in a society which is free from the division, free from the mutual envy and the greed which is there at present and which would therefore be a more peaceful society?</P>
    <P>I believe we can work in that direction. I am not saying it can be achieved overnight, but it is possible and it is our duty to work in that direction.  That being the case, we should look at the elements of the present security structure to see to what extent it is successful.  If we look objectively at the present system it can only be said to have failed.  It has failed by any of the objective criteria which one would apply to it.  It has failed for the regular inmates of those institutions, for the staff of those institutions and for the society in which those institutions stand.  Again, the challenge in this respect is a major one and there are no easy or convenient answers to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1757" /> I do not pretend to have a monopoly of wisdom here, but it is time we took stock of the present situation.  If we have only been containing the situation, if prisons are at present in some way out of sight, and therefore out of mind, then we have something more to do than what has been done.  Crime is not a mystery; at this stage it is quite a predictable phenomenon.  I could predict quite positively there will be certain kinds of people&mdash;in some cases I could predict their very names&mdash;in prisons next year or in two or three years' time, because of the overwhelming evidence in relation to the social and cultural origins of crime. When such evidence is readily available to us it is perhaps regrettable that we do not apply ourselves more fundamentally to the origins and roots of the reasons for crime and work at that level as well. If we did that we would at least be investing in the hope that on a future occasion we would be able to look forward, not to increasing staff in institutions, not to encouraging the apparent growth industry of building new prisons which exist at the moment, but looking forward to the reverse.  Surely that would be a healthy aim and a good objective for our society.</P>
    <P>In order to do this meaningfully we must have some basic tenet or philosophy on what the prison system is supposed to do.  For example, is it supposed to be essentially a weapon of retributive justice?  Is it supposed to be a forum where people can be rehabilitated, where they can be socially-orientated individuals? I am not sure there is certainty about this.  I have read extraordinary conflicting statements from gentlemen who should know better.  If we consider what some of the people who have dealt with this issue have said we will see that they also were uncertain. However, there may have been some excuse for some of these statements, because they go back centuries to a time when we had not the benefit of a more modern approach to the problems.  In a work entitled <i>The Philosophy of Punishment,</i> a collection of papers edited by H. B. Acton there are a number of papers dealing with this theme.  For example, F. <Col N="1758" /> H. Bradley set himself against what he said was J.S. Mills' view that punishment is justifiable only as a means of benefiting the offender and protecting others.  T.H. Greene discusses punishment by the State in the context of State action generally and says that &ldquo;punishment is justifiable on account of the wrong-doer's violation of somebody else's rights&rdquo;.  He holds that this distinguishes punishment in principle from any sort of private vengeance or retaliation. Bernard Bosanquet deals differently with the matter.  He contends that punishment in the context of State action in this regard is essentially the State's maintenance of rights by the use of force.  He presents a view much like that of Green except that he is at pains to attack the idea that punishment is a sort of therapy.  He is quite clear about what he wants; that is, that this is a means of punishing those who do wrong.</P>
    <P>The impact of that approach on whether the people who have done wrong will eventually come to do right is not clearly expressed and is not his concern. It is the same with other writers.  A man called Hastings Rashdall maintained that retributive justification of punishment was an unsatisfactory basis. He argued in the first place that if pains are to be matched with sin or moral guilt there must be some means of equating an amount of one with an amount of the other.  However, he says this is quite impossible. According to him there is absolutely no commensurability between the two things.  For him it is not adequate to say a man has done wrong and therefore the punishment shall fit the crime.  It is deeper than that.  A.C. Ewing develops a similar theme.</P>
    <P>I am asking where we stand in relation to the question: what are prisons meant to achieve?  I belive we have come to a stage in our civilisation where prison is no longer the mere incarceration of a man about whom we have come to admit failure, that the prison system must be so animated that it is a process whereby people are shown the error of their ways, are made to become members of society, to see that certain norms <Col N="1759" /> and values are right for that society and to accept them voluntarily.  It is a big challenge and a major goal but I think it is what the Minister would wish prisons to be and what most civilised people would wish them to be.  Unfortunately, that is far from the situation at present and the evidence is there to show that.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to respond to that challenge.  A man called Reinhold Niebuhr who speaks on matters like this said &ldquo;The sad duty of the political system is to establish justice in a sinful world&rdquo; He went on to say &ldquo;There is no way to establish or maintain justice without law, that the laws are constantly changing to stabilise the social equilibrium of the forces and counter-forces of a dynamic society and that the law in its totality is an expression of the structure of government&rdquo;.  The reference there is a book entitled <i>Government as good as its people</i> by a person called Jimmy Carter.</P>
    <P>The point, therefore, is there must be a philosophical base for our approach to prisons.  If we look at patterns of expenditure it is reasonable to say there has not been any fundamental review at any stage of whether prisons are successful, whether the ratio of expenditure should be changed to match our aspirations in this regard and whether there is any reconsideration of the degree of success we are having.  I think that is a challenge and not so much the capacity of any Minister to manage to wheedle out of the Department of Finance the extra money to deal with staff or conditions.  Those matters are important but they are symptoms of something much deeper.  I believe that serious-minded politicians must apply themselves at that deeper level.</P>
    <P>If we try to develop the theme of what is the function and purpose of prison and the purpose of justice in a society like ours, to quote Joseph Fletcher in a book entitled <i>Situation Ethics,</i> we will see that &ldquo;We have been speaking of justice as a moral principle, not as something settled and static, transfixed in laws.  The root <i>jus</i> means many things: law, both written <Col N="1760" /> and unwritten; rights; and standards or ideals but the basic distinction to be grasped is between moral justice and legal justice.  The two, of course, are not antithetical, but it must be fully recognised that legal justice (law) always threatens to suffocate and cheat moral justice.  Statutory laws, both civil and criminal, and the common law or custom, as in the Anglo-American tradition and most cultures, are in the situationist's view a necessary danger but not, note, necessarily evil&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The question of the relationship between legal justice and moral justice comes in here.  I would sum up what we need to aspire towards by saying that perhaps we need less law but more justice, because as long as we have laws that are static in relation to sections of the population, that are static in relation to their immutability with the passing years, there is an injustice.  Presumably it is not possible to devise a system whereby law is such that is can reflect adequately the individual response it should have to an individual's circumstances, but certainly there is need for some regular review of legislation, and this of course would include the prison system.  We need to have an inbuilt capacity to analyse regularly the degree of success we are achieving within the framework of the security system and we need a process which would allow the necessary evolution to take place so that we will be up-to-date rather than lagging years behind, introducing the appropriate response so late that it is outdated and newer demands have replaced the first demand.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote the following words which sum up the view of one man in relation to prisons.  He says:</P>
    <P>.... prisons are monuments to a justice which is the antithesis of true justice.  We proclaim our belief in one justice and practice its opposite under the same name.  We enshrine in pomp and ceremonial a justice which is so deficient as to be the contradiction of the justice we are committed to by our faith.  And that justice is a loving and saving one.  Love cannot be enshrined <Col N="1761" /> in prison.  For the essence of prison is rejection.  And men come there because others have long before failed in their regard to practice the Christian law of love.</P>
    <P>Those are not the words of some radical and tormented ex-prisoner.  Those are the words of the Reverend John Byrne writing in <i>Social Studies</i> in June 1972.  At that stage he was chaplain in Mountjoy Prison.  I think his words are very fitting.  They sum up the frustration of a Christian man with a system which seems to have lost its way.  He mentioned the word &ldquo;love&rdquo; and he was right to do so.  I hope it is not considered too gauche or naive to speak in those terms.  If we are to achieve the kind of harmony and stability in our society which is fundamental we must do so on the basis of mutual respect which can grow into mutual love.  The truth is that many of the inmates of our institutions would give a rather derisory laugh if the word &ldquo;love&rdquo; was described to them as being a phenomenon which society imparts in their direction.</P>
    <P>If we really want to rehabilitate these men and women, if we really want to restore and heal our society in respect of the breach which their incarceration means, then we have got to speak about how we rebuild the norm of love in the system.  To do that we should bear in mind that the only force that unites people, without mutilating or destroying them, is love.  That principle, if applied not merely in this context but generally, could have great effect.  We can only win these people who have broken the law, who have committed criminal acts, by winning their hearts.  I know it is not easy to try to do this because I detect that our society today is ready for a hostile, anti reaction to such language and thinking.  It is easy to respond much more harshly to people who are criminal. Sometimes it can be politically popular. Undoubtedly there would be a mass response in favour of such an approach, but I would reject it.  I believe we must be far more level-headed, serious-minded and give far more leadership to people <Col N="1762" /> who would seek to have an emotive response to rising crime.  That is not to say that one can accept lightly the growth in crime which is a particularly obnoxious phenomenon of the so-called civilised, developed western world.  It is not a problem merely for this society. But the problem in our society is increasing in direct proportion to certain other social phenomena such as the growth in material affluence and the continual underlining of material welfare as being the primary goal, aspiration and norm of our society.</P>
    <P>We must endeavour to see that the fundamental way of making progress here is by getting to the hearts and minds of these men and women, and that is a difficult job.  But is it not a marvellous job, a marvellous challenge and vision to have, if that is the one we should have? And the success we could have will pay enormous dividends&mdash;even if we want to be mercenary about it&mdash;in terms of the saving later in relation to the costs which would otherwise accrue from generations of, we will call them, criminals spawning other generations of criminals. That is not the goal.  The goal is a deeper one&mdash;to give to men and women the opportunity of being fulfilled, of becoming what they are entitled to become and what they can possibly become.  That is where the satisfaction lies and where our job rests.  Therefore, vengeance and retribution for its own sake, hatred or any passionate and emotive response to crime&mdash;no matter how objectionable the crime&mdash;does not have any place in a system of justice.  It does not have any place in our thinking and, I am sure, in the Minister's.  If we want to pin that principle to sound philosophy we can do it by quoting any number of people, whether we quote Christ who spoke simply about forgiving people seven times seventy or whether we want to quote any of the other more current philosophers. There are many good people&mdash;indeed people a lot better than I&mdash;who could be looked to for guidance in this respect.  I believe very firmly that that is the approach, to get rid of these feelings which are too often uppermost, indeed uppermost in the minds&mdash;and I have heard <Col N="1763" /> it&mdash;even of people on the bench in some cases where I believe, mistakenly, the use of the words of &ldquo;retribution&rdquo;, &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; or even &ldquo;vindictiveness&rdquo; for their own sake creep into what should be the enlightening and rehabilitating process justice is supposed to be.</P>
    <P>Then we must ask ourselves what practical remedial steps does all of this entail.  Obviously it is fine to have an ideal but we must distil it into some practical course of action, and there are such steps.  We inherited a system form the past.  Some of the trappings of that system are not easy to throw off or even to review objectively but I believe that we can show that change is needed. Therefore, we are talking here about a qualitative approach.  I am somewhat disappointed sometimes when I hear various Ministers and spokesmen in various areas talking about progress being impossible or difficult because there is insufficient money.  Obviously that is important and I am sure every Department could use more money.  But what about the immediate job of asking how well utilised are the moneys that the Department have already?  Is there something there for us to look at?  I think there is.  We could ask what we get in exchange for the present investment in the panoply of security forces, we will call it the security framework in general, embracing its various elements.  If I might say so with respect, the Minister might very well take a fresh look at this to see if progress can be brought about here, progress which would not occasion enormous increases in expenditure.  I hope to point to one or two of these in a moment which I hope will be of constructive help.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that the present system has failed us.  It is arguable to what degree it has failed us, but it has failed us, because crime is rising in society.  In my view there is no conviction in society that prisons are a way forward for rehabilitating criminals. Rightly or wrongly the prison system is seen as being a reflection of a class-based system of justice.  That is really what I meant by the predictability of <Col N="1764" /> crime.  We know, the Minister knows, anybody listening knows who is going to be in prison, give or take a street or two, give or take a generation or two, and it has always been that way.  I do not think it need always be that way and I would hope that we could work to ensure that it would not be.  For the criminal himself, for the inmates of these institutions themselves, it has failed.</P>
    <P>Recidivism is a major problem.  People are habitual; the majority of people in our institutions are habitual returnees, if I may coin a phrase, to the prisons. Therefore, it is not working.  For the victim of crime, about whom very little is often thought, there is no degree of solace or comfort in the system.  On the contrary, the victim of crime is usually fearsome of the return to society of the person who committed the crime when, if we were doing our job properly, he would not feel one way or the other about it but would assume that the person was now a changed man or woman, if that is not asking too much.  In fact that is the extreme rarity but I am sure it does happen.  Sometimes perhaps it happens through the goodwill of individual people in the system, and sometimes despite the system.  But the facts are that, for the majority of the victims of crime&mdash;who are largely forgotten, about whom research is never done, that I am aware of, and who in many cases suffer enormously for the rest of their lives in a variety of respects whether it be enonomically, psychologically or indeed physically&mdash;the system has failed.</P>
    <P>For whom has it succeeded?  I do not know of any class for whom it has succeeded. Even the staff in those institutions are disgruntled and the Prison Officers Association time and again expressed their dissatisfaction about a variety of things.  Sometimes that dissatisfaction is epitomised by requests for more money and other things but, basically, it is rooted in a frustration with their job, a frustration which sees the same men and women returning almost monthly.  It must be very frustrating to be told that one's job is to return men whole to society and to hope that one <Col N="1765" /> can do the job but yet the same men return time and again.  Sometimes that happens for reasons completely outside the capacity of the prison service to deal with.  It is a major problem.  The origins of crime and the capacity to heal crime have little to do with the prison.  Those origins have to do with the environment, deprivation, bad housing and inadequate jobs and the hostility of the environment to the ex-prisoner.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in some cases the immediate response of the ex-prisoner is almost to ask to be returned to the prison because he is at least assured of certain things in the institution.  Until recently a man or woman when released was on his or her own with the exception of a tenuous link with welfare officers who are too few in number.  The transition to the community is too dramatic and drastic and, of course, it does not work.  People leave prison without money in their pocket or a job to go to.  I am not pretending that the Minister can get jobs for everybody, but a gentler return to society would be helpful. Therefore, major and radical reforms are necessary.  Some of them would not cost much money.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the origins of crime and the reasons for it one will see that the predictability of it is rather tragic.  In this connection I should like to refer to a number of surveys of ex-prisoners and young people.  One can see in those surveys, in case it is necessary to convince anybody, that there is strong evidence of the socio-economic background of the men and women and a lack of education. A survey carried out by Rev. Brian Power and published in <i>Social Studies</i> in 1971 was based on a sample of people aged between 16 and 19.  A question about literacy rates showed that 40 per cent of the sample were totally illiterate; 22 per cent had a low standard and 56 per cent of those from substandard areas were totally illiterate.  The survey showed that 20 per cent of those questioned never worked; 8 per cent of them had steady jobs; 54 per cent had bad home relationships while 8 per cent had apparently good relationships; 40 per cent <Col N="1766" /> were in degrading need of money; 46 per cent needed money for enjoyment because they were on subsistence and 14 per cent had no marked dependence.</P>
    <P>A depressing aspect of that survey was that in relation to what one might call the moral attitude of those surveyed 68 per cent considered that stealing was quite permissable if one did not get caught or if it was in a case of necessity, something which was open to a looseness of interpretation.  With regard to the recidivism problem&mdash;this is depressing also&mdash;the survey found that 86 per cent of the people questioned had been previously institutionalised.  A similar kind of picture emerged in a survey carried out in Ilfracombe.  The obvious factors were extreme deprivation in relation to social, economic and educational environment.</P>
    <P>In a survey of young people in the Sean McDermott Street-Summerhill area of my constituency carried out in May 1978 on boys between 12 and 16 years of age we found that the same type of statistics recur.  If one was to tot up the summary one would find that the average number of criminal charges against some of those people was in the order of 27; they were regular offenders. The average one of those surveyed had been in court 52 times and the average conviction rate was six.  The kind of criminal charges were averaging, per person, nine in relation to thefts from vehicles; eight in relation the thefts from shops, three in relation to thefts from houses and one in relation to assault of persons.  One of the most significant figures that emerged from that survey was that the average number of childern in a family was eight.  The same depressing and predictable statistics emerged when it came to employment of the mother or father.  I do not believe there is anything new in that for the Minister, but those statistics serve to remind us that there is not any mystery about crime, it is as predictable as tomorrow's sunrise.  That is what makes it so imperative that something should be done and makes us believe in the possibility of being able to do something about it.  It is not as if it was all elusive or evasive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" /> I should like to pay credit to the work of the Prisoners Rights Organisation in undertaking a survey of 200 ex-prisoners. As they are not professionally trained social scientists we have to allow for a margin of error one way or another, but the general pattern of the survey is quite acceptable and bears out one's own research and the research of other professionals in the field.  In the survey of the 200 ex-prisoners 60 per cent of the respondents were 20 years or over and under 30 years; 24 per cent were 30 years or over and under 40; 53 per cent resided within the inner city area and 27 per cent resided in working-class suburbs.  In other words, 78 per cent of them resided in areas where, to put it as charitably as possible, social and other amenities were not as readily available as they are elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In a small quadrant of inner city Dublin between 4,500 and 5,000 people live on one street, a figure which would make up a fair-sized town in rural Ireland.  Yet, in spite of the fact that it is regularly the subject of odium in relation to the alleged law breaking capacity of some of its younger population, there are not in that street the most meagre facilities which any town would have a revolution about if they were deprived of them.  I am referring to such facilities as cinemas, community centres, or shops.  It is hard to imagine that in the complex there is not a shop or a Garda station. There is no crèche for mothers to put their children in.</P>
    <P>We accept an incredible intensity of deprivation which would not be accepted anywhere else.  Imagine building a town somewhere like Naas, and suggesting that we build wall-to-wall housing and nothing else.  Not alone every politician and every planner, but every responsible person, would throw his hands up in horror and the scheme would be thrown out.  What is not accepted in what we will call certain areas of society is, however, quite acceptable for people about whom our expectations are not very high.  That is an important element.  We must begin to renew our hope that crime is <Col N="1768" /> soluble&mdash;despite the mass of international evidence that it is on the increase&mdash;and must do something about it.  The other way leads only to despair and pessimism and I do not choose to go that way.</P>
    <P>In the survey of these 200 ex-prisoners 76 per cent did not go beyond primary school, and in relation to the quality of the primary schooling, about one-third of the respondents could not read or write on leaving school; 85 per cent of their fathers were unskilled labourers, casual workers, while 28 per cent of their mothers frequently worked, mostly at cleaning work.  Of the respondents themselves, 65 per cent were seldom or never in work.  It is extremely unfortunate that the State does not give the example which it exhorts on private and commercial companies.  I recently heard of a young man who, after an altercation with some mates&mdash;a fist fight, involving no weapons&mdash;lost his job in the Army but, nevertheless, got a glowing reference testifying to his outstanding qualities as a soldier.  This man had never been in any kind of trouble before, as the saying goes.  Yet, Governments have the gall and the neck to ask others to do what they would not do.</P>
    <P>I stress that there is no security implication here.  When I asked the Minister for the Public Service last year in this House how many people employed in the entire public service might have had a record of being an inmate in one of these institutions, his answer was couched in such terms that my only interpretation was that there was not even one.  In other words, there was no definite information and when I opined that there was none, it was not vehemently protested against.  I am not blaming anybody, but asking how can we expect people to be rehabilitated, to be normal members of society, when we do not do something about jobs for them?  Perhaps we could give some example here.</P>
    <P>In relation to those ex-prisoners, 51 per cent were first convicted between the ages of 11 and 15 and years later, hardened ex-convicts, they are still committing crimes; 22 per cent were first <Col N="1769" /> convicted for offences against the person, while 46 per cent were convicted for offences against property, without violence; 55 per cent were sentenced to reformatories on their first conviction&mdash;that is now probably not much more than an historic footnote, thanks be to God&mdash;77 per cent were sentenced to imprisonment on their last court appearance; 41 per cent were currently involved in crime while 26 per cent said &ldquo;No comment&rdquo;, 63 per cent of the respondents had served in juvenile institutions; 92 per cent had been to adult prisons.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the majority of these ex-prisoners had been reared in the most deprived areas of inner Dublin, mostly in corporation dwellings.  In effect, that was the first of a series of punitive measures that our society bestowed on a category or class of people, because they were not able to match with skills, expertise, or more probably, with monetary buying power, the standards of the slightly more fortunate people in our society.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to lessen the importance or impact of crime, or the seriousness with which it must be taken. All I am asking for is a level-headed, forward-looking and somewhat idealistic view to be taken of the degree to which we can cope, not with the symptoms of this terrible social problem and malaise but with the roots of it, and perhaps we could look forward to the day when we could rid our society totally of crime.  I also stress that I do not over-emphasise the role of the prisons or the Garda in this area.  They are, unfortunately, dealing with the curative end of it, but the cure is not as good as it should be, even on its own terms.</P>
    <P>The predictability of all of this has been borne out in many surveys.  I do not intend to dwell on them, except to take one example from <i>The Economic and Social Review,</i> volume 7, No. 4, July 1976&mdash;an article headed &ldquo;Towards the Identification of Educational Priority Areas in Dublin&rdquo; by Agnes Breathnach. It is clear from that article that there are certain areas likely to be catchment areas for crime and other types of <Col N="1770" /> problem and they are relatively easily identifiable on a scientific basis.  There are criteria which can be applied to an area which, if fulfilled in certain respects, indicate that that is a crisis area.  We can, therefore, say &ldquo;That is an area to which we must give a different type of attention&rdquo;. We do not do that.  I know it is not the responsibility of this Minister to get involved in the regional policy, in Irish terms, of his Government.  But if the evidence is before us, if the likely potentiality of an area is clearly evident to us as being one from which crime will undoubtedly come with enormous weight, then our responsibility is all the greater and the opportunity all the more missed, if we do not take advantage of it.  I would ask for a preventative approach to crime by tackling, trans-departmentally, all of the criteria which enhance the prospects of people becoming criminals.  I am not suggesting that people are totally socially engineered.  I am sure there are people who, by nature, genetic impulse, or chance, or original sin, may be more prone to crime than others.  I know, and the Minister knows, that the overwhelming numbers of people involved in crime are not natural criminals; they are created criminals.  They have been created by society and society must try to undo this wrong and, more importantly, to change the areas from which these people have come so that there will not be a continuation of a cycle of crime. This rise in crime is an enormous international challenge&mdash;a sociologist or a physical scientist would probably talk about a massive decline in confidence of democrative systems&mdash;but we are only putting our finger in the dyke.  It is on the cards that we will not be able to contain this rise.  Perhaps a new approach and a more fundamental view should be taken of our difficulties.</P>
    <P>We see from the Garda Commissioner's report, for example, statistics which are awful in the literary sense of the word, which show the depth of the challenge to which we must rise.  How do we cope with our prisoners?  Do we meet with generally accepted standards throughout the world?  Could prison conditions generally be said to accord <Col N="1771" /> with the sentiments put forward in the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and related recommendations of the United Nations' Department of Economic and Social Affairs, New York, 1977 or the similar Resolution (73) 5 Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners by the Council of Europe Committee of Minister both of which are similar documents?  These documents refer in detail to standards which we would find acceptable and which we would probably say publicly are in operation in our institutions.  It is clear that in many respects these minimum rules are not being applied in our institutions.  The basic principle in Part I of these rules says:</P>
    <P>There shall be no discrimination on grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.</P>
    <P>There is discrimination on the basis of social origin, property, birth or other status and the evidence is there for us to see.  On the question of the distribution of prisoners the rules say:</P>
    <P>Young prisoners shall be detained under conditions which protect them from harmful influences and which take account of the needs peculiar to their age.</P>
    <P>People with any knowledge of this area know that the separation of the various categories, classes and ages of prisoners leaves a lot to be desired.  The Minister from his recent announcement in relation to new institutions is trying to do something about this, but the fact is that today the minimum conditions laid down by the UN are not being accorded with in many of our institutions.</P>
    <P>The sanitary installations shall be adequate to enable every prisoner to comply with the needs of nature when necessary.</P>
    <P>Yet we have the spectacle of people having to use hygiene facilities which are unacceptable. The rules also say that <Col N="1772" /> collective punishment shall be prohibited.  I am aware of cases where irregular conduct or breaches of rules has resulted in whole categories of prisoners being dealt with summarily and similarly.  I know that in the management of a prison it is not always possible to be individually sensitive to every case, and I do not suggest that there is any malign or malevolent influence in operation.  The necessary resources are not being injected into these institutions at present, thus many of these minimum standards are not being accorded with.</P>
    <P>The limited success that the prison system has had is due largely to the work and the commitment of the prison officers.  I am biased on this, perhaps, because my father was a prison officer for 32 years.  Now and again I meet an ex-inmate of an institution who has a nice word to say about him.  I am glad of that, as it would be unpleasant to come up with another reaction.  The prison officers down the years were in most cases men of common sense and sound judgment. My only regret is that in some cases they had not the regular retraining, and in other cases they had not the resources and the investment by Governments which would allow them to do their jobs better.  People like the Prison Officers' Association which only came together in recent years should get the ear of the Minister fairly regularly.  I would also like if the Minister would ask his Department to at least respond to the letters of the Prisoners Rights Association. I understand that, whether by dictate or by accident, I am not sure, there is in operation a system whereby the correspondence of the Prisoners Rights Association is ignored.  I am not aware that this group are involved in law breaking or are in some way under a cloud of suspicion.  If they are, I can understand the Minister and the Department's attitude, but if not, the Department should at least acknowledge letters and respond to them with the standard of courtesy for which the Minister is well known.</P>
    <P>There has been progress in recent years in the institutions and at the heart <Col N="1773" /> of this, where it is undoubtedly most needed is education.  The Minister will agree that we have a long way to go before we get the right kind of educational framework in the institutions. Obviously there is a difficulty about utilising an educational system based on the presumption that people are free and able to respond in a cyclical way to terms of schools, teachers, conditions and so on, when the people we are talking about do not have much of a choice about whether they will knock off for the summer holidays or not.  The Department of Justice in a letter dated 26 October 1976 to the Vocational Educational Commission of the City of Dublin said:</P>
    <P>The policy document on the education of offenders in custody has now been completed and is with the Department of Education for their approval. I hope within the month to forward a copy to you and to arrange a meeting to discuss the policy.  I am still awaiting sanction from the Department of Finance for transfer of money from the Department of Education Vote to the Department of Justice Vote so that this Department can reimburse directly all those educational authorities who provide a service to the Department.</P>
    <P>The snail-like progress of educational reform in the institutions must be superceded by a much more hard headed approach. Education, properly structured with the right kind of course content and the right personnel, is at the heart of rehabilitating inmates of institutions, and no effort should be spared to try to speed up the measures presently in existence.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say that in the regime of the Minister's predecessor, Senator Cooney, significant improvements were initiated in the medical and educational training and welfare services provided for prisoners.  The appointment of educational officers, the full scale library service made available to offenders in custody in Dublin, and the welfare service which has continued to expand, have all helped.  The introduction in 1974 of a full-time induction and training <Col N="1774" /> course for new recruits to the prison service was also a good thing.  All this showed that there is goodwill and the intent to do good.  I would ask the Minister to take stronger steps and to accept that the public will not be hostile to enlightened reforms when they see them as being an investment in our future and not merely a response to a set of circumstances which are causing a nuisance to society by virtue of the crime impact on our community.</P>
    <P>With regard to the library system which still leaves a little to be desired, it is only appropriate that one should pay tribute to Miss Maureen O'Byrne, Chief Librarian in the Dublin area, who is very concerned about this, and also to the Minister in that in the last week or so he has sanctioned the appointment of new personnel to deal with the library facilities in our institutions.  That is a breakthrough also, and not before its time.</P>
    <P>I will quote from a letter from a female ex-prisoner with regard to the library facilities in Mountjoy.  She says:</P>
    <P>Mountjoy female prison library facilities do not appear to have changed to any degree in the last ten years since I first was admitted as a prisoner.  I will go further and say that nothing has changed in approximately 20 years if the condition of the books are anything to go by.  The library is situated in the workroom, one glass case on either end.  On one side of the room there is a glass case containing very old religious books with a sprinkling of history books.  One day I actually succeeded in getting an officer to find a key to same.  When we opened the door a musty odour hit us. I found most of the books decaying with damp, a considerable number of history books written in French, and I also noticed that almost all in this case bore Her Majesty's Prison Service stamp on the flyleaf.  On the other side of the room is a double glass case of small dimensions and this contains mainly fictional romance novels, Denise Robbins, Barbara Cartland and so on.  One shelf approximately <Col N="1775" /> 20 books devoted to art and crafts, needlework, cookery, knitting and soft toys.  In view of the fact that none of the above-mentioned crafts are permitted for female prisoners to engage in even these are absolutely of no value.  Being an avid reader, having also regard to the fact that the female prisoner has absolutely nothing else with which to pass the long hours of boredom, I systematically went through every book in the double glass case and found that with the exception of about 30 books I had read every one in 1975.  Of the remaining 30 all were romantic fiction.</P>
    <P>I know that improvements are coming about now to the library system.  I have had a look at some of these libraries and they did leave a little bit to be desired.  In view of the illiteracy of many of the inmates one can understand why there is a certain lethargy in regard to bringing about reform here.  I trust that the new officer approved of by the Minister's Department, who presumably will be responsible for the liaison with the public library system in respect of how it is going to operate in the institution, will have every success.  His appointment is a good step forward.  If we can encourage interest among prisoners in self-education and self-teaching and in ability to lift themselves out of the rut into which some of them have fallen, this will be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>There have been improvements in other directions.  For example, I have heard criticisms about the diet in the institutions. I make no bones about the fact that I would be very happy to exist on the prison diet, and I wish now and again that I had the same time or leisure to enjoy my meals as prisoners have. There is no question but that the improvements brought about in the prison diet over the years are very good.  The regret is that the same standards are not maintained when the inmates leave.  If the same implicit standards were enjoyed by people in their environment outside the prison, not only in dieting matters but in others also, perhaps there would <Col N="1776" /> not be enough people in the institutions. The diet sheet is extremely satisfactory. Visiting committees pay attention to that as also do the medical officer and others, and I am not aware that diet is any longer a cause of concern.  I understand that it is nutritious and varied.  That is an area where there has been progress.</P>
    <P>There are more fundamental issues about the prison system which we could look at.  One that troubles me somewhat which I would ask the Minister to consider seriously is the following: if the concept of a prison is to try to rehabilitate offenders, if the idea is to be able to restore to the community the inmate who has fallen by the wayside, it is going to be very difficult to do this if the institutions are, in effect, closed-off units or islands cut off from effective communication with the society of which they are or should be an integral part. There is a risk here in that if you open the doors or go in for more open prisons, undoubtedly you will have people abusing that system, but I am not talking about that.  I am asking the Minister to consider a new structure of management for prisons which would have a board of directors, appointed by him, of people interested in the concept of justice and drawn from presumably all walks of life with the commitment and the time to devote to it, to whom would be answerable a chief executive officer, that job presently being exercised by the governor.  If the role of governor as we now see it were to be replaced by a more open system which would have people answerable to the Minister who were members of the community appointed by him and to whom the CEO exgovernor would be answerable in respect of how the policy of the Minister's Department would be carried out, a lot of the suspicion and concern, some of it unnecessary, some of it not warranted, would diminish.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary and disturbing that the primary characteristic of our institutions is their closed, cut-off, insular nature, carried in some cases to obsessive and paranoid extremes.  I have had complaints repeatedly of difficulties <Col N="1777" /> of communication and of eliciting from the Department the most rudimentary information about conditions and about inmates.  This does the Minister and the Department with the fine body of people involved there a gross disservice.  It is probably no more than what might be called a kind of administrative paralysis, and if the Minister had a chance to look at it he would agree that some of its more obnoxious aspects are unnecessary. I will give one example of what I mean.  The Minister will be aware that there was a difficulty in St. Patrick's in October 1978.  One of the mothers speaks as follows about her son who was in St. Patrick's at the time, and I quote from her letter:</P>
    <P>At the end of October I was listening to the radio one day and heard that there had been a riot in St. Patrick's.  I went up at 11.00 a.m. that morning when visiting started and asked to see my son.  The prison officer at the main door refused me a visit and refused to give me any information about Joe.  I contacted my son's solicitor as I was worried that he might be hurt.  I visited the prison that afternoon and was refused a visit.  A large number of other parents arrived and were also refused.  The officer said that they were contacting the Department of Justice to see whether they should be let in.  I and other waited until nearly 6.00 p.m. and we were then told that there would be no visits until further notice and that the parents would be contacted by post.  A few days later I got a brief letter to say that he had been transferred to Mountjoy.  I went straight up to the Joy and the prison officer in charge of visit told me that all his visits and privileges were suspended for a month.  A priest came to my home after two weeks to say that I could visit my son again.</P>
    <P>There is the torment of a mother expressed fairly clearly.  The letter from the Department on the following day was a pre-printed form saying that the son had been transferred to another prison.  We could do better than that.  I am not <Col N="1778" /> suggesting that in the aftermath of a riot, where presumably tough, hardened criminals were involved and where physical injury was done to officers and perhaps to prisoners, we should have a welcoming party of visitors.  I am suggesting that it is not unreasonable that in 1979 a mother who wants to enquire about her son should not have to wait two weeks, in anxiety presumably, to get the most meagre details about his welfare.  Is it not possible that somebody could give an answer, if not that day then the next morning, about the physical conditions and the welfare of an inmate to a person such as a mother? After all, the mother has done no wrong as far as we know; she has not been convicted of any wrong anyway.  The response that I have talked about is unnecessarily harsh and punitive and is not a symptom of the compassion and caring system which I believe is essential and that I would like to see.</P>
    <P>Surely there is not an official in the Department of Justice who in his heart of hearts would not prefer to see a better system than that in the prisons.  If that is the case all we need is the will to make it happen, and perhaps the Minister could do that.  There are ways and means of doing this.  It may mean more staff.  I believe it is unnecessarily harsh that a person who wants to make a basic inquiry about a son or daughter in an insitution has to be deprived of that information for weeks.  That is one side of the story, and there may be another side to it, but that is the kind of attitude which one gets directed too often at the Department of Justice.  It is a disservice to the people in that Department.  The closed nature of prisons should be looked at again.  The paradox of people being made ready for return to an open society in an institution so closed off as to be virtually an island obviously leads to a breakdown.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reasons for crime and the growth of crime there is evidence to show that we could be doing a little more about this.  I would like to quote a letter from a young man, one of a family of 14, who has been in trouble almost since he was able to walk, who has said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1779" /> When I was seven I was sent to Clonmel school by Justice Kennedy.  I was in it for nine years.  The brothers and priests were very nice to me on my first day.  A few months went by and things began to get rough.  At that time I had a habit of wetting my bed. Myself and a few of the lads were told that if we wet the bed we would be put into girls' dresses.  It happened that myself, my brother and a few of the lads wet the bed and were put into dresses and told to go to school in them.  We had no choice or else we would get slapped with a leather strap. This kept going on for a while and we would not stop wetting the bed so they started putting us to bed at six o'clock in the evening as well as being slapped. We got no pocket money at the end of the week.  That was the junior group.  I got a bit older and was put into another group which was called Group B.  This was worse.  If you wet the bed you were given a thousand lines for every day you wet the bed.  If you ran away from the school and got caught you would then be brought to a small room and you would get kicked all over the room.  After that you would get your head shaved and made kneel in the middle of the yard.  I got older and I was put into Group C, that is the senior group.  It was not too bad but I got a job on the farm.  There was a fellow there called .... who used to be in the school but now was outside.  He was head man on the farm.  May I say he was one big .... When you were down on the spud field picking spuds and missed the spuds he would come right behind you with a stick and bash you with it.  I left when I was 18.  I got no job from them, no money at all so I got into trouble and was put into jail four times.  I think in future anyone that leaves school should be fixed up in a job or something.  That is all I have to say.</P>
    <P>That is a garbled cry from the heart from somebody who, through no fault of his own, had to suffer in this institution and <Col N="1780" /> was not given much chance to make good.  If he makes good it reflects great credit on him and on those who seek to help him.  That is probably now only a historical anecdote, although it is not that long ago.  That letter was written this year and that young man if not in his late teens is only in his early twenties. We are not talking about the last century. Is that the kind of society the wild geese fled for?  I do not believe it is.</P>
    <P>I have been reading during the week tributes in the papers to the memory of Pádraig Pearse, much of them filled with wise sayings.  If there could be some practical action in relation to matters like this perhaps the public might listen a lot more to the words being said.</P>
    <P>Some of the major rights of prisoners need to be looked at.  I know that the balance of management and control of an institution is a very difficult one.  I have a lot of sympathy with the people who have to run those institutions.  They are working in an environment that is very unsympathetic and receive very little award.  They are dealing all the day with difficult people, and the job of prison governor and prison staff is very difficult.  I do not wish to add to their difficulties.</P>
    <P>Do we often take short cuts in relation to some of the rights which the inmates of those institutions have?  We do not think very clearly in relation to some of those rights, in relation to the degree to which constitutional rights are suspended when somebody is convicted and there is a long legal discussion at home and abroad about that aspect of it.  To what extent does a prisoner retain constitutional rights?  To what extent could those rights be pursued through the legal process?  There are many examples of conflicting evidence in relation to that.  I would like to see the Minister taking up that issue in a fundamental review of the system.</P>
    <P>The rights and remedies open to prisoners in pursuance of a stated charter or rights or at least the rights of human beings enshrined in our Constitution leave something to be desired.  There have been some very conflicting comments <Col N="1781" /> by a number of judges and eminent legal people in relation to the possibility of pursuing those rights.  The question of probation and bail also seems too arbitrarily interpreted.  There seems to be an unevenness of interpretation which seems to give way to the belief that there is a lack of certainty on the part of the Government with regard to how those rights should be enshrined and how they should be circumscribed.</P>
    <P>The question of legal advice and the ability of an inmate to be represented at an internal hearing are important matters, and deal with the rights of prisoners.  We could learn a good lot from the American and Swedish approach to those problems.  I do not pretend that Sweden has the answer to all problems, but it is folly if we do not make the best use of the expertise gained in other systems.  The American system of justice, which is more advanced in some respects than ours, may have pointers for us in this regard.</P>
    <P>When talking about the rights of prisoners I am reminded of one particular one, the electoral right.  I understand that a prisoner has the constitutional and the legal right to vote and the only reason it does not happen is because the facility for such voting has never been bothered with.  I have not heard that there is any great demand for voting rights for inmates, but they either have or have not a right to vote.  As far as I am aware it is not said anywhere that they have not a right to vote.  If they have a right to vote they are entitled to vote and facilities should be made available.  This could possibly be done by a postal vote.</P>
    <P>The same can also be applied to mental health and the degree to which people can be incarcerated on the basis of allegations against their mental wellbeing. The monitoring process, which could allow people to get the second or third vital opinion which might save them from a life of incarceration in an institution in which they are labelled insane, is very unsatisfactory.  We all know of cases that have a ring of questions about them as to the reasons for some of <Col N="1782" /> these people being in certain institutions. There have been some very disturbing stories, not necessarily about prisons but about some mental homes.  The same kind of thinking applies.  Therefore, there is need for more clarity in these areas. There is need for the clear writing down of human rights for these people, and human rights must not vary in importance. They must be the same for a law abiding member of society as they are for someone whom we might refer to loosely as being a member of the criminal classes.  Each category in our society is entitled to know exactly where it stands.  Should those people be kept in ignorance of these rights, whether by accident or design, they are being deprived of those very rights.  It would be a good day's work to have some review in that area.</P>
    <P>It is time, too, that we considered the question of how to make these institutions useful.  Very often people who have been the victims of crime have a grievance in that there would seem to be little thought given to them, but we have an opportunity here for the Minister and the Government to say that from now on the situation will not be all one way, that we will turn our places of detention into productive units.  I see nothing unacceptable in the commitment to turning places of penal servitude into what might be regarded as commercial enterprises.  It is the opposite of all we hold to be important in the area of the rehabilitation of people to lock them up for many hours because every hour during which they are locked up represents a further admission of our failure to deal with them.  There is much work that could be tackled by the inmates of these institutions and I would not be faint-hearted about committing the resources of these institutions to such work on the basis that the people concerned are detained because they have taken from society. Consequently, we would be giving them an opportunity of making good that debt.</P>
    <P>The kind of work that might be undertaken is a subject that could be <Col N="1783" /> developed at some length.  I shall not go into detail on that now because it is an area that needs a fair deal of attention. However, it is no longer good enough that we would hold to the concept of people being incarcerated in an institution and let out on a leash, as it were, for recreation.  Instead, we should concentrate on using the services of these people in areas of agricultural, social or commercial need.  Any such system would have to be operated on a voluntary basis and with incentive and reward. In this way we would be allowing people to rediscover the value of productive work.  We would be shortening their days in these institutions and helping them to regain the dignity and self-respect that is fundamental to rehabilitation.  In addition it would be their way of saying to society &ldquo;we were wrong in what we did and this is one way in which we are trying to make good.&rdquo;  Unfortunately, we are far from such a situation now and some of the sounds I have heard from trade unions in this regard have been very lacklustre.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the work done by people on a voluntary basis, by members of visiting committees and indeed by prison staff, in endeavouring to find work for inmates or ex-inmates.  In order for any such scheme to be successful the support of the trade unions would be necessary, but at least some of those bodies have been lacking in enthusiasm in this regard.  Perhaps this is understandable should there be competition for a job. However, the political responsibility for this aspect of rehabilitation rests with the politicians while the moral responsibility for the wellbeing of our society rests with each one of us, regardless of which category we are in.  We need to have a committed role on the part of the trade unions if the Department are to be successful in the area of rehabilitation. Therefore, there would not be anything wrong with the idea of a commitment to a work programme.</P>
    <P>While the conditions in these institutions are improving all the time, there is still much to be desired.  In this regard I <Col N="1784" /> would refer the House to a letter I received from a Mr. Gerald Masterson, a former prison officer who resigned in 1978 after eight years' service.  In a lengthy letter he referred to some practices that are being continued but to which he would object.  He says, for instance, that the pot-carrying practice whereby prisoners empty their chamber pots morning, afternoon and evening is unhygienic and could be ruled out by inhabiting only every other cell in these places and fitting the empty cells with toilets and wash basins.  I know what the response to that will be, but the point is valid.  Another point made in this letter, and which is not foreign to my own way of thinking, is that the woodyards be phased out or at least curtailed and retained only for those prisoners who break the prison rules of discipline.  Mr. Masterson refers, too, to the question of offences and punishment within an institution. As an ex-member of a visiting committee I am aware that these committees, like the governor, have certain powers to punish in respect of the infringement of rules and regulations. Might it not be possible to introduce also a system of credits and rewards for people who do good and who go beyond the mere call of duty, because it seems to me that if we are willing to punish for what is wrong we should be willing also to reward for what is right.</P>
    <P>In a document published in 1973 by a group who call themselves the Prison Study Group and entitled <i>An Examination of the Irish Penal System</i> there are references by way of a summary of their main observations to a variety of areas in the prisons which need attention. However, it is only fair to say that there have been changes in many of these areas since then.  They make the point about the closed system of administration and say that there is confusion regarding the role of prisons and that the idea of rehabilitation is accepted now by those responsible for running the prisons.  They say, though, that Irish prisons do not rehabilitate and are punitive, that a period of 15 hours daily alone in a cell cannot be regarded as anything but punitive.  This group say <Col N="1785" /> also that, while prison officers are anxious to play a rehabilitative role, according to the regulations their only duty is to keep the prisoner in safe custody. They observe that two out of every three prisoners in Irish prisons are recidivists, that one out of three prisoners has been in prison on at least five occasions and that the vast majority of prisoners serve short sentences.  As an example of this they say that in 1970, 82 prisoners served terms of less than six months.  The figure the group give for prison expenses would no longer be relevant but even then it was very high.  They criticise prison work by saying that it is menial and would not assist a prisoner's chances of employment on release.  It is only fair to say again that there have been improvements in that regard.  There are new workshops and equipment there now which were not there when this report was compiled but these facilities are small proportionately in terms of the prison population.  The group refer also to our prison system being based on a process of degrading the inmates.  While I would not subscribe to that view, I think I know what is intended.  In effect what they are saying is that a system which regiments people, which locks them up for long periods each day and which fills all the gaps in the timetable, with the exception of a small period of recreation which is closely guarded, tends to dehumanise.</P>
    <P>Our penal system is at least 150 years old and during that time there has not been any substantial change in prison regulations or in prison architecture.  Our system is still governed by the Official Secrets Act.  While on this side of the House the Minister said he was concerned about some of these issues and he seemed determined to demonstrate that on his part there was a commitment to reform, we shall not go into chapter and verse on that except to say that some of what could reasonably be expected on the basis of what we said at that time still remains to be fulfilled.  The Minister obviously has plans and perhaps he might tell us more about them at some other stage.  A lot more could be done than has been done so far.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" /> The question of the possibility of the introduction of some sort of independent appeal and tribunals procedure should be considered apart from the visiting committees.  I have my own reservations about the degree to which the visiting committees are enabled to work.  For periods of the year they are not in office. Reports have gone into the Minister's Department from these visiting committees asking for reforms, some of them of a very small nature, for example leaving a visiting committee in existence until a new one is about to be appointed.  I would ask the Minister to refresh his mind and the mind of his Department on some of the sensible proposals from these decent men and women who have given voluntarily of their time to do a fairly complex job and who usually end up being nobody's friend in the end.</P>
    <P>An organisation calling itself Pax Christi has made some interesting comments on the prison system and time does not allow us to go into them in great detail.  It refers to some of the needs which are not being met adequately and they include in that the kind of respect for the prisoner as an individual which is a prerequisite for creating the kind of climate which is essential to him, proper counselling to help the prisoner to see that it is his responsibility to effect change within the law.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now about to create some new institutions.  I would ask him to stand back from that, to consider the possibility of introducing what I would call a hierarchy of these institutions with varying responses to different types of crime.  He should consider the open prison system which is there at present, small home-type residential units for people, varying levels rather than the idea of the big barracks-type prison being created in central points which is an outdated concept.  This is one thing that would allow some development and I stress that I am not advocating opening the gates of the institutions tomorrow or anything like that.  I would ask the Minister to have somebody in his Department investigate the use of drugs, not by the inmates, but by the staff in <Col N="1787" /> these institutions.  We hear rumours about over-prescription for inmates which, accidentally or otherwise, help to have inmates relatively subdued and relatively peaceful.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the prison system being used much more flexibly for many other types of crime than at present and not merely for categories of society who have to spend months or years there. There is no reason why people who are caught in certain types of crime which at present are considered to be relatively minor should not meet with the threat of imprisonment for a night or for a weekend if the Minister in his wisdom decided to do this.  Prison is not merely for deprived classes of society who act in contravention of the norms of society.  I would ask the Minister to look again at the Darra O Briain Report and its recommendations and to accept them and to implement them.  I would ask him also to ensure that illtreatment and accusation of illtreatment cannot arise by opening the system in the way I have outlined, by ensuring proper appeals tribunals in the system and so on.  That is very important.  I know the vast majority in the Garda Síochána and in the prison service would abhor any such carry on and therefore the Minister is pushing an open door.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that the introduction of a code of police ethics based on the Declaration of the Hague might be useful and helpful to him.  There are other reforms which, if I had time, I would refer to and there are other aspects of this whole issue which are very important.  Finally, the Garda Síochána aspect of this will be dealt with by my colleagues.  I would ask the Minister to consider finally a small poem by an inmate which I think is a fitting footnote to our discussion.  This was written by a prisoner serving a life sentence. He says:</P>
    <P>I'd love to walk a country road,</P>
    <P>in the silence of the night,</P>
    <P>with the rain falling</P>
    <P>and the birds calling</P>
    <P>I'd love to see that sight</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1788" />I often lay on my bed at night</P>
    <P>and look out at the stars,</P>
    <P>and all that comes to my mind</P>
    <P>are the cold prison bars</P>
    <P>If I could only do the things</P>
    <P>I should have done before</P>
    <P>I'd ask for nothing else in life</P>
    <P>I'd be at heavens door</P>
    <P>The things I took for granted</P>
    <P>are the things that really mattered</P>
    <P>its only now I realise</P>
    <P>my hopes have all been shattered</P>
    <P>Perhaps we could unshatter some of those hopes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me first compliment Deputy Keating on his very well-researched speech here today.  I disagree with much of what he said but he has certainly done a tremendous amount of research into the subject and he has put it across very well.</P>
      <P>My attitude to this is that there are others in the State as well as prisoners. While I disagree also with some of what the Minister says, I am grateful for his courtesy to me on the few occasions on which I approached him.  He is one Minister in the Government who realises that it is possible to be a Minister and be pleasant to the Opposition.  Both in Opposition and in Government I have found him to be that type of person.  The cut and thrust of politics may make him and me and everybody else say things which are hurtful to the other side but having said these things and made our point there should be no occasion to carry a grudge.  Some of the Minister's colleagues seem to carry very large chips on their shoulders.  This bends them down and does them no good.  The Minister does not suffer from that and for that reason it is only fair that at the outset I should make that comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a stand-in spokesman today for somebody else, so my research is not as good as that of Deputy Keating and my approach to these matters will be a spontaneous one which will I am sure not give offence to anybody but will at the same time bring to light a number of points on which I feel very strongly and <Col N="1789" /> which should be highlighted in this House.</P>
    <P>Let me start by giving a quotation with which I and a very large number of people agreed a number of years ago and agree with now:</P>
    <P>The Government will build to ensure that the citizen is free from attack, the homes and property of our people free from marauders, the streets to walk in; that the gardai are given support by financial, technical and manpower improvements so that crime becomes unprofitable and where not prevented is speedily detected; that the conflict between the rights of persons in custody and the necessity of the Gardai to investigate crimes is resolved; and that the administration of the courts be revised and improved on the basis that justice delayed is justice denied.  In the area of family law, the law relating to children, and the punishment and rehabilitation of offenders new concepts are required.</P>
    <P>This coincides with something which George Washington or somebody who felt very strongly about freedom might have said.  The quotation is from the Fianna Fáil General Election Manifesto of 1977.  I read it specifically because they said that and received tremendous support on that basis, but what has happened since has proved that that was like most of the contents of the manifesto, a lot of cod for the purpose of hoodwinking the unfortunates who were foolish enough to accept that Fianna Fáil meant what they said.  The proof of this, if we want proof, is in the replies given by the Minister yesterday to Deputies M. O'Leary and B. Desmond on the number of armed robberies which have taken place this year, the amount of money taken in these robberies, the amount of money recovered, the amount of money taken from banks, post offices and firms in armed raids, the amount of money obtained by means of armed raids, robbery, kidnapping in 1978 and 1979 and the action the Government propose to take to deal with this situation.</P>
    <P>Without reading out fully the contents <Col N="1790" /> of the reply let me say that the Minister said he was informed by the Garda authorities that during the period 1 January 1979 to 12 October 1979 the number of armed robberies, including attempted armed robberies and aggravated burglaries involving firearms, was 203. Particulars of property taken in the course of these crimes and amounts recovered were given in a tabular statement. The Garda authorities say that the total value of all property reported taken in armed robberies and aggravated burglaries during 1978 was £2,303,686 and the corresponding figure for that period from 1 January 1979 to 12 October 1979 was £1,747,766.  So we do not have to work too hard from 12 October to the end of the year to create a figure which would get into the <i>Guinness Book of Records.</i>  Of that sum the amount recovered was £408,277 leaving a balance of £1,339,489 not yet recovered.  I am prepared to state here or anywhere else that the Garda are doing a tremendous job under very severe conditions and that while they have succeeded, particularly in the area in which I live&mdash;and I pay particular tribute to the Garda in the Drogheda district on the number of people they have arrested for robberies of various kinds, particularly armed robberies&mdash;the money being recovered in most of the country is very small.  People are prepared to use arms for the purpose of a robbery, to stash away the money as quickly as they can and take whatever sentences the judge gives.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating referred to conditions in prisons, what should be done for people in them and the circumstances which caused them to be criminals and to be incarcerated in prisons.  I would agree with much of what Deputy Keating said if we were dealing with an ideal society, but that is not the case.  We are dealing with something that has built up during the years and which is rapidly getting worse. The approach of successive governments to the situation has led to the position where day after day certain people are becoming more rawless.  At one time it was something extraordinary to read in the newspapers&mdash;usually in the evening <Col N="1791" /> papers&mdash;a banner headline stating that a robbery had taken place.  If a murder occurred there were large headlines and it was a nine days wonder.  Now newspapers will not even bother publishing a report about a robbery unless the amount stolen runs into four figures, and reports of a murder are confined to three or four lines at the bottom of a column if there is space available. Then we are expected to agree that prison authorities should not be so tough on the prisoners, to agree with the view that they have been put into prison because of their bad home conditions or because the State was not as good to them as it should have been.</P>
    <P>People in prison should be treated in a human way, but they should not be pampered.  We should not attempt to rival the Gresham Hotel in Mountjoy. People who have worked in prisons for a long time should not be subjected to abuse, as is happening, while those who subject them to that abuse are inclined to get more support inside this House and outside than the unfortunate people who are attacked.  Of course the recent trouble in Mountjoy was caused by something.  I find wrong the fact that the Department of Justice do not appear to have come clean with regard to what caused the riot.  It did not just blow up like that.  What caused it?  Who created the trouble and what conditions started it?  I agree with Deputy Keating that there must be some flashpoint.  I am not justifying those who took part in it.  I do not think they deserve to be justified because they would not have been in Mountjoy in the first place if they were responsible citizens.</P>
    <P>I believe there is one way juvenile offenders can be dealt with, particularly those who are prepared to engage in vandalism and robbery.  The responsibility must go back to the parents.  Why should the State have to carry the cost of dealing with children, many of whom go out with the knowledge of their parents to damage public and private property?  I come through Gardiner Street several times a day.  I know that young children <Col N="1792" /> break the windows of cars, particularly when women are driving, steal handbags and terrorise the drivers.  Why should this be allowed?  Why should the State, the ratepayers and taxpayers, be held responsible?  Why are the parents not brought to book because they are the people who have created the conditions which caused this in the first place.  The sooner we realise that the better it will be for everyone concerned, including the children.</P>
    <P>I would include also the question of the itinerant children who beg in O'Connell Street.  They sit down on O'Connell Bridge and in the shopping centres in the snow and frost begging for money.  I have the greatest sympathy for the poor mites sitting on the streets in cold weather, frozen and hungry, begging for money to give to drunken parents.  Why is that allowed?  Why is something not done about it?  We should do something and do it now.  The one thing people from abroad remark on is the number of begging children in Dublin.  It is shocking that it should happen.</P>
    <P>Only a few years ago one could walk through this city or anywhere in the country at any hour of the day or night without being molested.  Now we are prepared to accept as commonplace that even in the daytime one's pocket is likely to be picked if one is not quick enough. Women carrying handbags or shopping bags fall victim to the pickpockets and the elderly are pushed over and robbed. This is not done by adult thugs but by children whose ages range from five to 15 years.  I know of a few ladies who took the correct action by using their handbag to do what is usually done to children who misbehave, by chasing them up the street and giving them a few cuffs around the ear.  It had the desired effect.  The situation has developed where many adults, including Members of this House who have to go to their hotels or to their homes late in the evening, are afraid to go through parts of the city because they may be attacked.  On one occasion I was approached by a young man in his early twenties who did not like the fact that I was a Member of this <Col N="1793" /> House and who had a few drinks taken.  I did what I think should be done with such people.  I used the toe of my boot where he felt it most and he moved away rather quickly.  The trouble is that many people are not prepared or are afraid to defend themselves and they are being attacked and abused.  The number of such incidents is growing daily.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the people who are carrying out law enforcement.  I have the greatest respect for the Garda Síochána and I note the Minister's statement that additional gardaí are being recruited. Before he concludes the debate today and if he has the figures available to him, I should like him to tell us the number of gardaí who have been recruited and the number who have left the force through retirement, death or for other reasons.  I would like the actual figures for the force, going back to about 1970&mdash;if such is available&mdash;up to the present year.  Let us have an idea of whether or not we are being told the actual facts or whether the statistics are being used to prove something which is not correct.</P>
    <P>I note that part of the Supplementary Estimate today refers to the extra money required because there has been a lot of overtime worked both by the prison service and by the Garda.  I would appeal to the Minister to recruit the number of people he says are required in both services for the purpose of preventing the necessity of overtime.  While gardaí may be able reasonable to do a certain amount of overtime it is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that the only way a prison service can be carried on is by having the number of people who are working there for six days of the week coming back on the seventh day, at night, and spending perhaps as much as 17 or 18 hours per day the whole week in the conditions which must operate inside a prison.  It is wrong; it is not fair to the people employed or to their families. Certainly it is not fair to the prisoners who must have to deal with very much shorter tempers because the people dealing with them have to work in such terrible conditions.  If, as the Minister says, there are hundreds of vacancies in the <Col N="1794" /> prisons service, for goodness sake let us have those vacancies filled; there are sufficient people on the labour exchange list to fill those vacancies.  Perhaps they will not be the ideal people who could be recruited if the usual procedure was gone through, when in a year or 18 month those people were found to be available But even if they are taken on on a tem porary basis only do not let us have a condition under which prison service people are being asked to work outlandish hours because apparently there are no replacements available.</P>
    <P>There is the question also of the duties carried out by the Garda.  According to the Minister we have almost the largest number of gardaí there ever was in the service of the State.  If we have, then those gardaí, working all the overtime they are working and with modern equipment, should be able to cover an awful lot of ground.  I am aware that a number of them are tied up on Border duties, something about which we will be hearing more in the next few days.  The Army could be made much more use of on those duties, relieving some gardaí for necessary work elsewhere.  I have been in Opposition, in Government and again in Opposition, expressing the opinion that it is entirely wrong to have unarmed gardaí walking up and down outside commercial finance buildings for the purpose of protecting the money in there, or pretending that it is being protected.  I can see no reason at all why the commercial banks, who are making such big profits on the moneys invested with them, should not be required to do what is being done in other countries, provide their own protection.  There is not a reason in the world why we should be forced to put, very often, a young garda who must be bored stiff walking up and down giving the impression that he is in fact protecting a bank when, if somebody comes with a gun, there is not a darned thing he can do except allow them to do whatever they want.  They are not armed and it is right that they should not be armed in those circumstances. Many of the banks have made no effort whatsoever to protect their buildings inside. Just as the State pay the gardaí outside, <Col N="1795" /> surely the banks could pay to have somebody inside in a protective position where they could see what was going on, could give the alarm and take preventive action.  Those of us who have travelled in other countries know that when one goes into any finance establishment as soon as anybody makes a false move they are immediately prevented from doing anything.  I was in a country recently where a colleague of mine queried the change he was being given for travellers' cheques and, before he could say another word, there was a man standing beside him pointing a gun at him.  I do not suggest that banks should go that far, but I do suggest it is absolutely ludicrous that our taxpayers should have to pay for protection of the moneys in respect of which the banks, perhaps rightly, say they are advised that their staffs should not put up any resistance but rather let such people go.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another aspect.  I believe we have in this country a system of namby-pamby justice in the courts. People are finding it a very good, paying proposition to steal hundreds of thousands of pounds, go to jail for a couple of years, come out and live high. Somebody said Ireland was becoming the richest country in the world, that it must be because there was so much money buried in it.  It must be buried; they must be doing something with the money they are stealing.  I heard recently of somebody who had collected a considerable amount of money in this way who decided to be patriotic and invest it in building societies, when he was very quickly caught.  The others must not be doing that because they are not being caught and, if they are being caught, the money cannot be found.  I suggest that people who are actually caught for committing crimes, particularly for attempting to use firearms, must be dealt with more severely than at present.  And it is no answer to say: bring them into the prisons for a short period, talk nice to them, tell them not to do it again, as is done occasionally in the courts, or subject them to such conditions that they <Col N="1796" /> will realise the error of their ways and let them loose again on the unsuspecting public so that in a short time they will do the same again.</P>
    <P>We may well ask what has brought this about?  We know that the troubles in the North have bred a lot of the bank, post office and other raids taking place.  I am not prepared to agree that they are the total cause.  I believe we have got a lot of private enterprise gents at present who find that simply by pretending they are involved in some sort of a political stunt in Northern Ireland they are given an air of respectability, when they think they can go into a bank, post office or wherever&mdash;particularly in the post offices where poor people not used to that kind of treatment will suddenly find a gun, a knife or even a hammer aimed at them&mdash;and get away with it.  It is quite true to say&mdash;and the Minister will not be offended at this&mdash;it appears that the most successful growth enterprise in this country at present is armed robbery, the one that is successful and continuing to be so.  Indeed I thought it rather unfair that these people even carried out a number of armed robberies right on the Minister's doorstep.  I do not know whether or not that was deliberate.  If there is a large amount of money being transferred from one place to another, whether by the banks or by anybody else, it is entirely wrong that unarmed personnel, gardai particularly, should be put in a position of attempting to defend that operation.  There must be another way.  Having spent a considerable period using arms in the Army I am opposed to the use of arms if at all possible. Something very significant happened recently when an armed robbery occurred near my home, near Drogheda, when the armed robbers were chased by gardai in a car; they were making good progress until one of the gardaí who was armed fired at the other car.  This had the result of those heroes stopping immediately, throwing such machine guns and hand guns as they had in their possession out on the road and running like the dickens across fields until they were eventually caught.  There is a lesson to be learned from that.  When such <Col N="1797" /> heroes are at one end of a gun it is all right but, on finding themselves at the other end, they have an entirely different attitude.  I believe it may be necessary to get tough before things go too far, and they appear to be going that way.  Once the story is spread that it is possible to walk into a bank, carrying anything from an iron bar, a hammer to a machine gun and pick up money the way it has been picked up here, there will be more and more of those people who will chance their arm.</P>
    <P>I will be the first to admit that there are places in this country, not confined to Dublin city, but all around the country, where social conditions are such that there is very little hope for the people living there.  People who find themselves out of employment for the first time in many years and have a big family to support may be tempted to do certain things but there are not so many of that type.  I should like to draw a distinction between those people who make a once-off effort to get money they feel badly in need of and the criminal families who live on crime.  Those families have never done anything else except steal and they do not make any secret of that fact.  We are all to blame that a situation like that continues for so long.  There are areas where people find that it pays them well to have their children involved in petty crime and as those children grow up they will enter more into the spirit of crime. They do so because their fathers, uncles and brothers have been doing the same thing for many years.  We should give a lot more attention to this serious matter.</P>
    <P>Up to now the feeling has been that unless such people do something which irritates at such a high level that it makes news it should be ignored on the basis that it will go away.  However, it will not go away unless something more is done. The question of sheer mindless vandalism must be approached by the Department in a more serious way than up to now.  Every town and village has suffered from vandalism.  It is not always the children who are at fault; very often vandalism is caused by young adults and adults who are not so young.  Some people <Col N="1798" /> consider it funny, after spending a few pounds in a local pub and staying there for hours after closing time to do an endless amount of damage starting with telephone kiosks.  I was told of an old lady who lives alone in a post office being disturbed late at night by noise. Because it was before the European and local elections she thought the noise was caused by people putting up election posters but the following morning she noticed the kiosk had been removed. Those involved could not break the kiosk so they put it on the back of a lorry and threw it into a field some miles outside the village.  The money in the box had been stolen.  There must be some way of ensuring that such vandalism does not continue.  I accept that the Garda work hard and cost a lot of money but the Minister must make up his mind to introduce some kind of local force to prevent such vandalism.  Many areas have threatened to appoint vigilantes to combat vandalism. Sometimes the vandalism is committed for gain but on many occasions they are mindless acts.</P>
    <P>Some years ago in my village, a development association of which I was chairman, succeeded in getting the county council to agree to allocate a number of seats to us to erect along the sea coast.  It took 12 men to move those heavy concrete seats off the lorry but within a couple of months two of them had been lifted away and thrown onto the beach in an attempt to break them. That was not done by a disadvantaged group of people who did not have supper at night or breakfast in the morning but by people who came from good homes. They should have known better, but apparently they were allowed do anything they wished and had reached the stage where there was no correcting them. That is happening all over.  At one time when a kiosk in a village was broken people from a neighbouring village attending a dance were accused of breaking it but that is not the case now.  As soon as local kiosks are repaired they are damaged again.  It transpires that the damage is caused by local brats, sons and daughters of reasonably wealthy <Col N="1799" /> and respectable people.  I do not think they should be allowed to get away with such vandalism anymore than those who come from the slum areas of this city. The parents of such young people should be made pay for such damage.  On one occasion a sign indicating that there was deep water in a local river was taken down a few weeks after it was erected and burned.  I discovered that this was done by two young people who had arrived in the district in advance of their parents who had taken a house for one month in the seaside resort.  I approached the father of the young people and told him that unless he paid the cost of replacing that sign to the county council I would prosecute him.  That decent man paid the cost of the sign.</P>
    <P>The public are not giving to the Garda the co-operation to which they are entitled. One hears that, if there is a row in a city or town and a garda is being attacked, people do not like intervening in case they get hurt.  I should like to remind everybody that we passed an Act here to compensate such people.  We have a situation where many people see acts of vandalism being committed and can easily name the culprits but they do not do so.  They may complain to me or the Minister without giving particulars of the people involved but they would be the first people to make the allegation that nothing was being done about such acts.  A similar situation exists in regard to the number of robberies that take place.  The public could do a lot more in the way of co-operation.  An effort should be made to ensure that such information is given to the Garda.</P>
    <P>We are told that the reason information is not given is because people here never liked informers.  It is a very different thing when one's own property is stolen.  It is strange how quickly one realises that any information which will help to recover it is not informing, whereas if a neighbour's property is stolen, they cannot give information because it would be informing.  The Department of Justice will have to start a campaign to try to encourage people to <Col N="1800" /> give the necessary information so that this type of crime can be stopped.  People would be only too glad to try to ensure that vandalisation of their area is stopped, if they get sufficient support for it from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Where to put people brought before the courts is a very big problem. Loughan House was introduced as a place to help the youngsters of Dublin.  It has cost a lot more than if they had been housed in the Gresham.  It is absolutely ridiculous that, having been given facilities which they never dreamed of, they proceeded to break up and damage the place in the way they have damaged it.  I am not suggesting real cruelty, but there must be discipline.  I am a great believer in discipline.  Nobody suffers from being made to do the right thing, and doing it because they are told to do it, because it is the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister is in trouble again in regard to the proposed women's prison.  We had that problem in Kilbarrack.  He tried it and there was great opposition there.  There will be such a storm built up around Clondalkin that the Minister will not be able to build the prison there, whether it is the right place for it or not.  This question must receive active consideration.  Deputy Keating has described the prison books as having &ldquo;His Majesty's Service&rdquo; stamped on them, which shows that the prisons have been there far too long.  I do not believe that we want luxury prisons. They should be more up-to-date.  A central prison should be erected and this must be given consideration by the present, or some future Government.  A decision must be made as to where it is to be situated and the decision on its location should be irrevocable, irrespective of any opposition from people living nearby.</P>
    <P>When some people come before the court the evidence produced seems, to the ordinary observer, to be such that he is very definitely guilty of the crime, yet some lawyer comes along, finds, due to some minor technicality, that the charge is incorrect and people who have committed appalling crimes have to be <Col N="1801" /> released because of this.  This is wrong and there must be a change in the law. Also, the present bail system is entirely wrong.  This Government, like the previous Government, cannot interfere. It is laid down that even people who have been accused and are known to be responsible for murder, except in very exceptional situations, are entitled to bail.  Those people allowed out on bail after committing serious crimes, particularly of robbing property, continue in their life of crime and when found guilty of their original crime, ask to have the others taken into consideration. Someone who merits 12 months' imprisonment on one count then produces 60 more and perhaps another dozen sentences are imposed, all to run concurrently. That is a lot of nonsense.</P>

      <P>It simply means that he serves only the one 12 months.  This is a racket which must be stopped.  In prisons at present, there is a grave shortage of accommodation, with difficulty in fitting in prisoners, so we have the Curragh.  I am, and always was, entirely opposed to the use of the Curragh military camp as an establishment for holding prisoners. People who join the army to serve as soldiers are not appointed as prison warders and not paid as such and have not the same conditions.  They should not be asked to do this work.  I found it impossible to close the Curragh, and I am sure the Minister would close it if it were possible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of the prisons are being filled by people sent there on charges which I believe&mdash;and I am not a legal man&mdash;could very easily be dealt with by a very hefty fine.  The cost of maintaining a prisoner in one of the prisons is colossal, as appears in the paper.  Those of us who have been knocking around long enough know that if the prison were almost empty, there would still be the cost of maintenance of the services to the prison, the warders and all other staff. The actual cost of an individual prisoner is not what it appears.  Statistics are an altogether different matter, leaving them <Col N="1802" /> aside, I cannot see why somebody who commits a crime cannot be punished much more effectively by a hefty fine, saving the State the cost of his maintenance in prison and his fine going into the coffers, which are sorely in need.  The Minister might consider that.</P>
    <P>There was a recent case of a man who, in a row outside a pub, hit another man, knocked him down and killed him, with no intention of doing so.  The case was taken to court and eventually this man paid £30,000 to the widow of the man killed.  The long prison sentence is still hanging over him and there are people who say that the fact that he can find £30,000 should not absolve him from a long prison sentence.  I have a different point of view.  This man, and many people like him, are not in a position to find the money easily.  All his life, whenever he wants to forget what happened, having to produce that money will be before him, if nothing else.  I do not know what the judge will eventually do, but this is an equitable way of dealing with the situation compensating for this terrible damage done to the unfortunate widow and family.  To find twerps&mdash;and that is the only way I can describe them&mdash;who have done something like driving a car, while drunk and killing some unfortunate person getting only three or six months' imprisonment&mdash;that is a different matter. Somebody else is doing their work while they are in prison.  The stigma of prison might possible be on them but other than that they get away with it.  In these cases there should be a fine of £10,000, £15,000, £20,000 or £30,000 which would be a much better lesson and might help the State as well.  I have given the Minister that for nothing.</P>
    <P>In regard to road traffic offences, the number of people being killed on the roads at present is appalling.  I used to be proud of the fact that during my term of office the number dropped.  Perhaps I had very little to do with it.  I am, and always was, opposed to the compulsory wearing of seat belts because I thought there were enough crimes that motorists could be capable of.  I have been proved right, because very few people wear <Col N="1803" /> them.  Despite the fact that, now and again, someone is fined £5 for not wearing them, most people find an excuse for not wearing them.</P>
    <P>The number of people who drive vehicles under the influence of drink is appalling. There are two main reasons for road accidents.  The first is people driving under the influence of drink.  The second is that so many faulty vehicles are on the road and the reason given for that is that nobody can afford the cost of repairs in a garage.  One man, when asked why he did not have a dinge in the side of his car repaired, told me that he was afraid to even drive slowly past a garage in case he got a bill for £100. Garage bills have gone out through the roof, and the result is that people are taking chances when something happens to their cars.  The third reason why accidents occur is due to bad manners.  People do not have the courtesy to do what they are supposed to do when they come out on to the road.  What gets into a person when he gets behind the wheel of a car nobody can explain.</P>
    <P>While these things are responsible for road accidents, the failure of lorry drivers to light up their trucks adequately is also another cause.  Some years ago the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, introduced a law to ensure that lorries would have to have certain lights and certain fluorescent markings along the sides and the back of the lorries.  At the moment when one meets a lorry on the road, it could be only a car judging by the amount of lights showing.  There is enough light in the front but when one drives about half way down the length of a lorry one is in complete darkness and cannot tell what the length of it is.  Markings or lights should be along the side of the lorry or truck so as to show the length of it.  The back of these trucks should also carry the markings they are supposed to carry, so that when they are parked by the side of a road someone will not run under them and be killed.  These markings are very important especially now in the <Col N="1804" /> darker nights.  Something must be done as the position is getting worse.  The Minister should make a statement on the radio or on the television to the effect that it is proposed to prosecute offenders if these markings are not shown.  The reason this law is being flouted at present is because people know they can get away with it because the Garda are busy doing other things.  So many lives have been lost as a result of the carelessness of lorry drivers that something must be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider issuing instructions to the Garda in relation to dealing with incorrect number plates.  It is not unusual here at the moment to see a lorry bearing one number plate on the front and another on the back, or else a lorry bearing no number plates at all. This is breaking the law and they should not get away with it.  The excuse I got, particularly in relation to articulated trucks, was that the lorry in front had one number, and they might pick up another trailer and haul it away without changing the number plates.  They are paid to do this.  It is illegal not to do it and they should be prosecuted if they do not do it.  Recently, a friend of mine had his car damaged by a lorry which cut him on the corner.  He took the number from the back of the lorry and found afterwards that he could not trace the owner because that trailer had not been registered for years.  He should have taken the number in front, but how could he have taken that number.</P>
    <P>Another factor is that often on a narrow country road one meets tractors, cars, trucks and everything else, with perhaps only one light.  The Minister might also instruct the Garda to watch out for that sort of thing and to deal with it far more severely than it is dealt with at present.</P>
    <P>Another thing that should be dealt with far more severely by the Garda is under aged drinking.  Many people quite obviously under the age are being served with alcoholic drink and publicans have been identified in court as being responsible for serving drink to under age persons. In every case that this occurs a <Col N="1805" /> prosecution should take place.  I do not expect everybody to wear a Pioneer pin, but if children start drinking too early we will end up with far too many alcoholics.</P>
    <P>Garda salaries and conditions have been reviewed from time to time.  They should be well paid and should not have to work overtime just to live.  Excessive overtime is not good for anybody, and I as a trade union official always advocated that view.  Because of their duties perhaps members of the Garda will have to do more overtime than other people, but to expect them to continue it is wrong and it should be stopped where possible.</P>
    <P>The question of Garda conditions is another matter.  Some proposals that were put forward have not yet been put into practice.  From personal knowledge, I know that the barracks or Garda stations are of a terribly primitive nature in many cases.  Deputy Keating talked about the conditions in the prisons, but the conditions in the prisons are in many cases streets ahead of the conditions in Garda barracks.  I do not blame the Minister directly for that.  It was bad in the past but it has been getting worse.  I know money is tight but certain things must get priority.  In Navan the old barracks was a disgrace and now an old school has been taken over as a barracks.  Some effort should be made to modernise it.  Moving the gardaí into bigger quarters and putting tarmac on the front so that the cars can get in is not enough.  They are entitled to more than that.  Barracks such as the one in Navan where there is adequate space for improvement should be modernised.  The time to do this work is now and not in a couple of years' time.  The old Garda barracks in Navan is an eyesore in the town and perhaps I should ask the Board of Works what they propose to do with it.</P>
    <P>In a number of areas young gardaí have taken over the job of youth work.  It does not matter what the job is as long as these young fellows can get along with those young people.  They can do a tremendous amount of work in this area. Maybe their seniors will frown and think <Col N="1806" /> that they are not doing much work and ask why they are not out doing more important work.  That is a mistake, because they are already doing invaluable work and they should be supported in continuing it.  If they can in co-operation with a local authority attempt to get some facilities for youngsters this is also a good thing.  One cannot expect young people in a small area in the large towns or in the cities with nowhere to go and nothing to do except kick tins around the streets, to grow up into excellent citizens. It is difficult to expect them to grow up to be excellent citizens.  Of course some of them do, and that is one of the mysteries, but if the gardaí who take on this work would co-operate in this way they would get respect for the Garda rather than this disrespect which is there at present in most cases, an attitude which has been bred in such people from the time they were small children.  This could be dealt with and the Minister should give every support to it.</P>
    <P>A few short years ago the few murder trials in the State got headlines.  Murder occurred very seldom then, thank God, and everybody wondered what terrible circumstances had caused it.  That has changed and now murders occur very frequently, even political murders, in this city and country.  It is only a few short years since there were only one or two political murders in the whole of Northern Ireland, then the number became three or four or half a dozen in a couple of months and bit by bit we reached the stage that has existed now for several years.  I would link up gang murders with these political murders, and both must be stamped out.  There is no point in saying that the gardaí are doing their best.  Putting a few detectives on a job and letting them find out what they can, and then when they have something else to do allowing them to leave that murder work behind, is not the answer. Murder is the ultimate crime, and when it occurs a task force should be put on who will stay on it if necessary for years, because if the cause of that murder and the person who committed it are not found out the crime can occur again and again <Col N="1807" /> and eventually it will become an epidemic as has happened in other lands. This is so serious that it cannot be left to somebody else to decide, &ldquo;We will do what we can, but it does not appear as if a suspect is coming up and God knows we have enough to do without spending our time going up a blind alley&rdquo;.  There are no blind alleys as far as murder is concerned.  It must be pursued to the bitter end.  I hope that the Minister will make it one of his chief aims that whatever happens the matter will be pursued until eventually the person responsible is caught.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has decided to erect a garda station in Laytown.  I understand that the site has been acquired and tenders are being sought.  The garda station for many years was an old station in Julianstown and, while it is on the Dublin-Belfast road and very useful and excellent work was done from that station which covered a pretty wide area, it was ridiculous that a village with 40 or 50 inhabitants should have a garda station while two towns which grew up from maybe 3,500 inhabitants in the winter to double or treble that number in the summer should have no resident garda and no garda station.  The decision to put the garda station there is the right one, and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that, the decision having been taken, it is not just put on the long finger and in ten years' time we will not be talking about the garda station which is going to be erected while the weeds grow on the site. This requires a bit of push.  I will remind the Minister about it often enough and I hope that, maybe without that push, he will ensure that the thing is done properly.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the points that I wanted to covered today.  The Department of Justice at present have a tremendous task not alone because they are the Department who deal with so many aspects of our lives but also because in many cases the Minister for Justice and his uniformed gardai are the people who represent the public face of Ireland not <Col N="1808" /> alone to the natives of the State but to visitors coming in here as well.  If you go to any country and want to get some information you automatically go to a policeman.  The reputation of the Garda for giving information and for their courtesy is well known.  All right, of course you have the rogues and the people whom you would be a lot better off without and those about whom you often wonder how the heck they got into it, and some who are no credit at all to the force, and such people should be dealt with pretty toughly, but their proportion in relation to the garda force is very small.  Since the formation of the State we have had a police force of whom we can all be proud.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the Minister's speech to the recent visit of the Pope. When President Kennedy was here we could not talk about any garda without quoting President Kennedy.  For years afterwards some little pearl of wisdom which he had dropped was a cliché.  The question of the Pope was different.  At short notice, thrown on the authorities of this country, mainly on the garda, was the necessity to produce an organisation which a lot of people doubted could be produced.  They produced it and they did it well and courteously, and I pay that tribute to them.  They did an excellent job without giving the impression that it was boredom to them and they did their other jobs at the same time.  Some people felt that when the Pope was coming to a particular area all the houses around would be burgled.  Fair play to the garda, they ensured that that did not happen. They had the odd run round in squad cars and this kept people on their toes.</P>
    <P>I will finish with the suggestion that a number of the gardai who are at present employed on the Border might possibly be taken back to where they are very much needed in areas where crime is rampant.  The army with their experience are now well able to do a lot of the work with the co-operation of a lesser number of gardai.  The gardai should be withdrawn also from outside the banks. The banks should get fair notice of when this is to be done and they should be told <Col N="1809" /> that it is their responsibility to look after their money, because they are the people who are making all the money out of it. It would be a relatively simple matter to set up an alarm system which would make most banks almost burglar-proof, and the number of gardaí who would be released as a result of that would be tremendous.</P>
    <P>Finally I refer to my earlier suggestion that the Minister might consider seriously some kind of local organisation who would know local conditions and what has been happening in the area and would be able to assist the gardai and advise them and help to prevent mindless vandalism as well as the major crimes which are occurring throughout this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak in support of this Vote that a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,985,000 be granted to defray the various charges mentioned in the Vote.  Unfortunately, moneys of this type are necessary socially and have to be provided from the pocket of each taxpayer. In a perfect society such moneys could be diverted to other uses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial moves have been made by this State to make sure that our society has improved over the years and that people who commit offences would perhaps be in a diminishing number. However, with the tragic situation which exists in this country today, substantial numbers of people come before the courts for various crimes, some small, some quite substantial.  The crimes that have tended to come into fashion are to a large extent crimes of greed.  They seem to be a product of a society which looks for the easy way out, for easy money and something for nothing.  This is peculiar to the age in which we live, and unfortunately it is costing our taxpayers very substantial sums to keep it under control and to rectify it.  The start of this cycle usually is in the home, caused probably by lack of parental control where youngsters, either through bad example on the part of the parents or through deliberate parental exercise, become juvenile offenders.  Juvenile offenders <Col N="1810" /> take many forms.  There is the youngster out for kicks, the youngster who is out to do something deliberate, the youngster from a deprived home, the youngster who at a very early age may be looking for something, for easy money for himself, or, in very few cases, to bring to a bad home.</P>
    <P>Parent courses are very important at this stage.  We have nothing to worry about in the majority of cases.  The tragedy is that juvenile crime has proliferated in certain areas of the city. One section of our society, itinerants, are much more bound up in juvenile crime than any other section.  When the children of itinerants do something wrong they do not come before the courts.  They do not come within the judicial system because of the nature of their lives.  They do not have a fixed abode, they are very often dirty and impossible to control by even the legal standards.  The vandalism caused by those people is an irritation to all of us.</P>
    <P>Social services and many of the county councils are striving to do something to improve the standard of living of those people.  Unless they do something themselves there is not much possibility of an improvement.  We would prefer to see them being able to produce leaders who would say to the rest of their community: &ldquo;Our way of life in this modern world is a total anachronism and is out of date.  We will have to come into the twentieth century and behave ourselves as responsible citizens.&rdquo;  This is not happening.  It is being left to the settled society to either legislate to improve them or to create social conditions and force them to change their way.  It is impossible to legislate to civilise them.</P>
    <P>We associate with itinerants a very wide range of stolen goods from transistor radios, which apparently fall off the back of a truck, to stolen cars, cars without insurance, cars with no brakes and no safety features of any kind.  Very often when a garda comes to the scene of a crime or an accident and one of those cars is involved he finds a person with no fixed address.  He can do absolutely <Col N="1811" /> nothing with that person.  He just takes particulars and the innocent victim of the accident has to foot the bill for damage done to his car or to himself.  I suggest that any car driven by a person of no fixed abode, which is involved in an accident, should be taken away from that person.  Many of those vehicles are quite new and some of them are in very good condition.  They would be a great loss to the people involved.  There should be some change in the law to protect innocent victims involved in accidents with cars driven by people of no fixed abode.</P>
    <P>The children of itinerants are innocent victims.  They are taught at a very early age that it is acceptable to live off the settled community, to take another person's property and that it is normal to do something wrong.  We have not evolved a way in which this situation can be corrected.  I believe this type of thing happened on a very large scale in Canada and in the USA after the first World War.  The attitude of the Government, particularly in Canada, at that time, was to give a home to the poorest of the various societies in Europe, and itinerants from many European countries were given free access to Canada. They brought their dirty habits with them and they did not respond to a larger and more progressive society. They perpetuated the bad habits they had over a number of generations.  It would be impossible to deal with the matter here in the ruthless way it was dealt with in Canada, but it is interesting to look at what happened there.  It was decided as a matter of urgency that the only way to stop this way of life was to take the children from the parents.  The children of those itinerants were forcibly taken and reared by foster parents at the expense of the State.  This meant that in one generation the problem of itinerant families was totally wiped out.  I cannot see that happening in our free society.  I can imagine the howl of protest there would be at the amount of money involved. It is an indication of what had to be done in one country to civilise one section of the community.  The itinerants <Col N="1812" /> in our society are uncivilised and want to remain that way.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reinforcement of law and order we have to look at the many areas which are influential in the making and breaking of young children. The biggest influence of young people after their parents is the teachers.  We are fortunate that we have a dedicated body of teachers handling our young people. The teaching profession is recognised by everybody as more than a job.  It is a profession where the parents and society demand and expect more than a just reward for money spent in salaries.  The teaching profession is like that of doctors and nurses, because teachers are expected to give more of themselves than merely a return for the money paid in wages.  The influence teachers have on young people has been recognised from time immemorial, from the hedge schools down to the present day.  The influence of teachers on young people is of inestimable value.</P>
    <P>The other force which comes into play in relation to offenders is the Garda Síochána.  We have here the finest police force possibly in the world.  They are well educated and the force is recognised as being a profession of a very high standard. We expect above and beyond the call of duty from our Garda Síochána. We expect them to know the areas in which they operate and as far as is humanly possible the background of the citizens in their areas.  We also expect them to deal on the ground with minor matters in a humane and responsible way. This is happening and it is a credit to the young men who go into the Garda.</P>
    <P>One sector of public service which is not so much in the public mind, but which is very influential where young offenders are concerned, is the prison officer staff.  These people shoulder a very heavy responsibility not alone in making sure that their charges are kept under detention but, where possible, in giving these people an opportunity to be rehabilitated under the various rehabilitation schemes in force.  They ensure that if possible people leaving prisons do not return.  This service is of <Col N="1813" /> the utmost importance to people who find themselves on the wrong side of the law.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to see that the Minister has created an extra 600 posts for prison officers.  This is a recognition that the service is of prime importance not alone to keep people in detention but to rehabilitate them.  Over the last few years we heard many hot words about Loughan House.  At the time of its inception it was criticised right, left and centre. The abuse hurled at the Minister was very vociferous and in many cases it was not very nice, but it has since proved to be totally wrong.  The success of this venture must be of great satisfaction to everybody involved.  This type of detention house is recognised internationally. For the people who need this type of detention we are carrying out a very human and courageous operation.</P>
    <P>The Lusk detention centre in North County Dublin takes in youngsters, and dedicated staff have been working there for years not just with the idea of keeping young people in confinement but with the very definite objective of rehabilitating them as far as is humanly possible.  The staff have house mothers and house fathers to take responsibility for specific youngsters.  On many occasions these youngsters are allowed out under the control of these people to attend sporting functions and other activities.</P>
    <P>A few years ago there was an outbreak of destruction from Lusk to Dublin created by people who escaped from this detention centre.  This is no longer the case, largely due to the work of the dedicated staff of that centre.  It gives me great pleasure to compliment them on their work.</P>
    <P>The dedication of these people might be illustrated by a little story I heard.  A local woman had three of these youngsters at a sports fixture.  She was showing them around and they were enjoying themselves away from the centre. She looked round and they were gone, and so was her car, which was discovered two days later and the youngsters were picked up a week later. <Col N="1814" /> They were still under her care and eventually they left the centre much better people than when they went in.  The point of this story is that the dedication of that officer went far beyond the call of duty.  This is what we look for in our teachers, gardaí and prison staff, and to a large extent we are getting it.</P>
    <P>The most horrendous aspect of life today is the seriousness of adult crime which over the last ten years has reached proportions which were unknown to our generation 20 or 25 years ago.  Who would think that in one year almost £3 million would be stolen in the Twenty-Six Counties?  That was the figure given for last year and apparently so far this year it is approximately £1 million. It seems that in certain cases crime definitely pays.  Apart from the unfortunate victims, the people who pay for this are society at large through our taxes.  Businesses are protected by insurance and in other ways.  The fact that any crime committed has to be paid for by society should be brought home to everybody again and again.  Crimes of this type are very often committed by habitual criminals, people who seem to get away with fantastic liberties even when on bail.  Something will have to be done about this to make sure that the hands of the dedicated gardaí are strengthened so that people of this type will not be allowed to make fools of everybody and go their despicable way causing the State fantastic amounts of money and just thumbing their noses at law and order.</P>
    <P>Prevention is obviously the most important part of any attitude towards crime, and those most concerned with prevention are the Garda.  To a large extent we have done away with gardaí on the beat.  This area should be looked at and we should use the garda on the beat in conjunction with modern methods of crime prevention.  The garda on the beat has a knowledge and feel for an area which nobody in a car or on a motorbike could possibly have.  The garda in the local station who knows his area, is of paramount importance in compiling information which would prevent crimes. <Col N="1815" /> Whether it is that certain premises need to be protected a little better than others, that certain people seem to be living far beyond their means or that certain areas are more vulnerable to crime than others, a man walking around would gain that knowledge.  More gardaí on the beat coupled with local crime preventation officers, rapid communication systems, rapid communication of identity of prisoners, information as regards movement of criminals by computer and other rapid modern communication methods, are an integral force for the prevention of crimes.</P>
    <P>This costs a lot of money.  The money that will have to be spent in garda stations to upgrade them for the use of the Garda and in relation to this type of computer and telecommunications equipment is money which could be better spent in other areas if society were more law abiding.  It is money which must be diverted from housing, health, education, roads and so on.  It is a sad reflection on society that sums of this type, £1,985,000, are supplementary and not just a one off.  Anything that could be done by any member or group of society to minimise this kind of expenditure would be ability well spent.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Supplementary Estimate of the Department of Justice.  There is no ministry more important to the welfare of the State at present or in recent years than this one.  My assessment of the present incumbent is as liberal as the security situation allows.  Generally speaking the Minister is handling his portfolio reasonably well although I have detailed criticisms to make.  It is our duty on this side of the House to criticise but it is our practice not to criticise destructively.  It is also our duty to give credit where credit is due.  It is only fair to give the Minister a certain amount of credit for handling a difficult brief much better than some of his colleagues handle their briefs.  He is not one of the conspicuous failures of this conspicuously failed administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> The majority of us in the House would like the principles of liberal democracy always to prevail.  There are some who would be sorely tempted, because of the national security situation which has prevailed for the last ten or 11 years, to let their adherence to the principles of liberal democracy go.  Indeed there are some who would not be easily tempted who would be tempted to agree with them at times that the principles of liberal democracy should be put aside when certain things happen.  I will return to that later.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with something that troubles me greatly representing as I do a totally working-class urban constituency. In my constituency there is a growing disbelief in justice.  I am sorry that the Minister cannot be here to hear what I have to say but his officials are here and I hope they will note it for him. There is a growing feeling that there is no justice in this country.  I will give the House some examples.</P>
    <P>I have raised before the question of the consistency of sentences in the courts.  The fact is that there is no consistency of sentences.  There are some justices on the Irish bench who bring the law into disrepute&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things we are not allowed to do is criticise the justices or the courts.  I will allow the Deputy all the latitude I can, but the rules of the House do not allow of criticism of the courts or of sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I still have to make this point and I am sure I am not outside the rules of the House in pointing out, as I have raised before at Question Time, the whole question of consistency of sentences which needs attention.  It is basic to the whole question of Justice and security that there is a widespread belief in justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago I raised in the House the question of three constituents of mine who were charged with stealing £57.  It was not an armed robbery.  They were charged with some violence but the violence in this case was extremely <Col N="1817" /> minor.  Somebody was punched and got a slight cut over an eye.  None of the individuals concerned, all of whom were in their late twenties, had been in trouble since their teens.  All of them had held jobs for six or seven years.  One had been in the army and was on pre-discharge leave and had already got another job. All three had the characteristics of stable people who are not criminals.  Two of them were married with children.  For stealing £57, to which they pleaded not guilty and denied their guilt&mdash;however that is a matter for the courts&mdash;they got three-and-a-half years.  In the past year we had a murder where a young man went to a dance with a knife and killed another young man and he got one year for that murder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that what the Chair says is right, but having said what I did say I hope it is taken up.  Can the Department of Justice see the impression that is created in working-class areas, because the person to whom I referred in the murder case was from a very well-to-do area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Deputy, but the Department of Justice would have no responsibility for court sentences.  That is the responsibility of the justices and judges and we cannot, under the rules of the House, criticise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We can suggest changes.  The day after I raised this point in the House the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, who was a Minister for Justice, raised the question of the consistency of sentences when he referred to an old lady who was sentenced to one year's imprisonment for stealing a pound of butter.  He compared the harsh sentence given to the old lady with the freedom of wildcat strikers.  The two cases referred to highlight the inconsistency <Col N="1818" /> which is bringing the law into disrepute.  The word has spread like wildfire in working-class areas that there is no justice unless a defendant is dresses in a nice suit and has a nice accent.</P>
      <P>I have raised the case of the three men with the Department on several occasions but nothing has been done about it. Their jobs were open to them until recently.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that the Chief Justice holds conferences from time to time but I am not sure what happens if the lower courts.  I am pleading with the Department for the introduction of a reasonable and consistent system of sentencing. In case I have created a wrong impression, I should like to say that the majority of our judges are exemplary On my infrequent visits to the courts on behalf of constituents I find the conditions in the Four Courts appalling.  The walls and windows are filthy and it is obvious that they have not been cleaned four years.  All this grime leads to an atmosphere of repression.  The same can be said of conditions in the Land Registry, which is beside the Four Courts.</P>
      <P>Another point which I should like to make relates to complaints against the legal profession.  I know that the majority of members of the legal profession are of excellent character.  The system for dealing with the complaints of citizens against members of the legal profession is inadequate.  The provisions of the Incorporated Law Society do not work satisfactorily in relation to complaints against solicitors.  Six of my constituents have very strong cases against solicitors but they have not been able to get other solicitors to handle their cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed the other Deputies to broader the scope of the debate.  However Deputy Mitchell is very wide of the scope of the debate.  There is limited scope of Supplementary Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Juvenile crime and vandalism in urban areas have reached an unacceptable level.  I know people in my <Col N="1819" /> constituency who are living in fear of children between the ages of 10 and 13. Drink and drugs are responsible for a great deal of juvenile crime.  I have seen young children drinking on many occasions. As it is too easy for them to buy drink in supermarkets, we should seriously consider the law in relation to the licensing of supermarkets.  Most supermarkets will not sell drink to persons who look less than 18 years of age. However, it is true that older persons buy drink for children.  The taking of drink leads more children into the cycle of crime from which they find it hard to escape.</P>
      <P>I believe that the lack of facilities for young persons, especially in new housing estates, leads to juvenile crime and vandalism. It can be said that there was nothing for us to do when we were young and that we did not resort to crime and vandalism.  I represent the constituency in which I was born.  When I was a teenager dances were held in the neighbourhood and there was a local cinema.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to the work of the Garda who now find themselves taxed with so many complaints of juvenile crime and vandalism.  One of the problems about juvenile crime is that once young people get into the circle of crime, it is very hard for them to get out of it.  Some children say to me that they would be considered yellow, that they would be considered to be cowards if they tried to break away from it when they had grown up a bit and got a bit more sense.  Eventually they find themselves in places like Loughan House, and then St. Patrick's, and eventually Mountjoy or some place like that, where they are with hardened criminals and they learn more about crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should consider carefully before we incarcerate young people who may have committed crime.  Is it wise in the long run to incarcerate them?  I am <Col N="1820" /> not one of those who think there should be no Loughan House.  There is a need for some sort of Loughan House.  I would advocate that we should be very careful in assessing whether there is any other more effective recourse for juvenile criminals.</P>
    <P>I agreed absolutely with Deputy Tully when he talked about concurrent sentences. This is one of the great mistakes in the Irish system of justice.  This idea of taking into account 52 or 67 or 43 other charges makes a mockery of justice. Very often what happens is that, when one member of a crime syndicate is caught, and knows he is caught, and knows he will not get off the hook, he asks for other charges to be taken into account.  All his friends inside the syndicate, and perhaps outside it, are then free of the crimes they committed because somebody has already been given a concurrent sentence.  This has become a practice in the courts and I think it should be put right by the Minister.  There should be separate charges and separate trials.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with Garda performance. The performance by our Garda has been very good.  Their detection rate is very good by any standard, especially in the area of crimes apparently connected with national security.  I was absolutely appalled, as I think everybody was, at the outbursts in the British media in the aftermath of the most regrettable Mountbatten murders and the Warrenpoint explosions.  The outbursts in the British media were nothing less than disgraceful and served only to feed support to the IRA by the reaction they caused. There were some fair comments in the British media, but there were also some absolutely unfair and disgraceful ones.</P>
    <P>One editorial suggested that the Irish security forces were riddled with fellow travellers and went on to say that their incompetence was the butt of many Irish jokes.  I do not remember reading anywhere or hearing anywhere that that most outrageous allegation was rebutted by anyone.  There are information services available to the Department of <Col N="1821" /> Justice.  That was a disgraceful comment and it was even more disgraceful that apparently the Department of Justice did nothing to correct that outrageous comment. It was a terrible slight on a Garda force of which we can be rightly proud.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the demand, especially in the aftermath of the Mountbatten murders and the Warrenpoint explosions, for what was referred to in the media as a security initiative. There is no doubt that, if we were not strong enough and wise enough, we could allow ourselves to be pushed into a situation in which we had as many soldiers on the streets, as many road blocks, barbed-wire fences and sandbags, as they have in the North.  In their more emotional moments this is what the British media would have us do.  It would not contribute in the least to lessening violence.  Rather it would probably increase it.</P>
    <P>The British have had a conspicuous lack of success in the North with all their thousands of soldiers and reserve soldiers and police and reserve police. We must be extremely careful.  Of course we must do everything in our power to prevent violence and crime of any sort, and to apprehend criminals of any and every sort.  We must not allow ourselves to be pushed into becoming a police state as, unfortunately, Northern Ireland is today. We must be most careful not to be pushed into that situation by the British.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to a few other matters which concern me.  What is now becoming a great problem in Dublin is stray horses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this Estimate permits the Deputy to refer to everything.  It is far removed from horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, do you know who is responsible for rounding up horses?  The Garda.  They have no horse trucks.  One of the fastest growing industries in this city is the horse breeding industry.  They are breeding horses everywhere and there is no pasture for them.  They have no place <Col N="1822" /> to put them, so the horses are roaming the streets and they are in people's gardens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tunney wanted shooting parties to go out and shoot them on the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is becoming a growing problem.  Some people blame the itinerants.  They are part of the problem, but only a small part of it.  People living in housing estates have their horses in and around the estates, much to the annoyance of their neighbours. Because of a particular problem in one housing estate in my constituency I suggested to the housing department of Dublin Corporation that they might consider building paddocks in future on corporation housing estates.  I want to emphasise that this problem is not confined to corporation houses.</P>
      <P>This has been mentioned on the Gay Byrne Hour on Radio Éireann over the past few weeks.  The Garda have not the resources or the machinery.  In fact, they have no machinery to take away horses. They do not have the trucks or any other facilities for dealing with the problem. One sees stray horses in gardens and in every bit of open space.  Indeed, there are even local derbys being held with some of these animals.  The problem is causing much annoyance.  Perhaps the Department would consider the setting up of a unit on a temporary basis to deal specifically with this problem, which is particularly bad now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tabled a motion to Dublin Corporation seeking the provision of more pounds and perhaps of more pastures for these horses at sites that have been bought by the corporation but which have not been developed yet.  This might be a way of relieving the situation.  Apparently the problem is not confined to Dublin.  From listening to some radio programmes one is given to understand that it prevails all over the country.  I suggest that the Garda be given at least a few trucks so that they might remove those animals from gardens and such places.  Perhaps, too, the Garda could <Col N="1823" /> well do with a little more money in their attempts to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I expect that the main reason for this Supplementary Estimate relates to increases in pay, and in that regard I welcome the provision of these extra moneys.  Regarding conditions of employment generally I have said here before that people employed in the public service here are paid badly.  When wages and salaries in other sectors of our economy are compared with wages and salaries in comparable sectors of the British economy, it is found that, for instance, in manufacturing industry here the pay in general is better than is the case in Britain.  However, in regard to the public service our people earn much less than their counterparts in Britain or Northern Ireland.  That situation is not satisfactory and should not be allowed to continue for very much longer.  I appreciate that if the Government were to decide tomorrow that gardaí and prison officers and all the other categories who make up the public service were to be put on a level in terms of remuneration with their counterparts elsewhere, the cost involved would be exhorbitant, and that, having regard to the state of the Government's finances, any such move would be particularly inappropriate at this time.  However, it is not right that we should ask our public servants to accept lower rates of pay in order to subsidise the number of jobs in the public service. Effectively, that is what is happening. We hear talk of 600 more jobs in the public service.  That is all very well but it must not be paid for at the expense of those already in the public service.  To allow such a situation to continue is to render it inevitable that people would not wish to enter the public service, and consequently we would have difficulty in attracting the type of people that we have been fortunate enough to have been able to attract into State employment up to now.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other points to which I should like to refer briefly.  The first relates to the rights of the child.  In this, the International Year of the Child, <Col N="1824" /> I trust that the Department will bring forward proposals designed to protect the child against domestic violence.  I should hope also that proposals would be put forward to make the adoption laws more child than parent centred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that we have been given a fair deal of latitude.  I can only express the hope that the Department will bring forward proposals before the end of this year to mark suitably the International Year of the Child.</P>
      <P>Another matter of concern, which is within the area of Garda activity, is the practice of begging on the streets.  This practice would seem to be peculiar to Dublin alone.  At least I have never seen anyone begging in any other capital in Europe.  One might ask whether, within the lower economic echelons of our society, there are people who are forced to beg, but I do not believe that to be the case.  The practice is very annoying to people going about their daily business and it gives a very bad impression of our country to visitors.  I suggest that the Department and the Garda reconsider the methods they use to help to prevent begging, but we must try to find the reasons for this begging and endeavour to eliminate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing an estimate such as this I am never sure as to whether I should congratulate the Minister for Justice or commiserate with him.  I say this having regard to the many problems with which he is faced.  I am very conscious of the efforts made by the Minister in the past year to contain the problem of crime, and in this <Col N="1825" /> regard I take this opportunity of paying tribute to the staff of the Department and, of course, to the members of the Garda, both male and female, who are engaged in this work.</P>
      <P>Perhaps much of the work undertaken by the Department in this area should not be necessary in the first place.  If we are to begin to fight crime we must begin where the crime starts and I suggest that that is in the home.  I would not take it on myself to pillory parents for their lapses in regard to looking after children, but it is a strange phenomenon in society today that in many instances children who find themselves in trouble with the law do not come always from homes that could be described as being deprived.  A well-known gang of German origin who are one of the most dangerous political gangs in Europe, for instance, come from good homes and by that I mean homes in which conditions generally are good.  We must make every effort to ascertain why people from such backgrounds should decide to become gangsters, to kill and to plunder.  If some of the money spent in the area of the detection and combatting of crime were to be diverted to family homes, the situation might improve.  I say this because, regardless of what anyone may say, we are all influenced by the environment in which we are reared.  If we created a good atmosphere and conditions for the family we would have far less crime. Although this is not strictly a matter for the Department of Justice it is in a broad sense their concern.  More money should be put into crime prevention than into the cure.  We have a real crime problem in our cities and unfortunately it is mostly young people who are involved. We should try to find and treat the cause rather than merely take punitive measures.</P>
      <P>The gardaí are very often attacked by self-appointed people in this city who organise protests and sit-downs in the streets.  Instead they might offer some constructive thoughts on helping young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Loughan House was first thought of nobody liked the idea of <Col N="1826" /> sending young people from the city to Cavan to serve a sentence there, but any reasonable person must realise that something had to be done.  While I feel very sorry for the boys sent there or to any other institution, I cannot erase from my mind the memory of a young girl from my area who was brutally raped in the city by young people.  We heard little mention of that from the people who were protesting.  If they are serious about tackling the crime rate and are truly concerned about the welfare of yound people, I would look for and hope for a more constructive approach to those people.</P>
    <P>There are ills in our society which will have to be removed but that will be done only when we have matters properly organised so that nobody is driven to crime because of deprivation.  A mother should not have to steal to get food for her family.  If such cases exist we must frame our services so that this cannot happen.  Every public representative has come in contact with families that have a good mother struggling and doing her best to rear her family and one of the family goes astray.  Among the causes of this is bad housing.  I am not suggesting the Minister has any say in that but a broad spectrum must be examined if we are going to have a society which will give the poorest boys and girls the opportunity to better themselves.</P>
    <P>There are other matters the Minister might look into in connection with juvenile problems.  I am convinced that excessive drinking is one of the causes.  I do not drink and I am not going to preach at the people who do because I believe alcohol is a gift from God.  But I deplore the abuse of it.  In a small nation that spends £5 million a week on drink there is surely something wrong.  The Minister should examine the licensing laws to see where the weaknesses are.  I am convinced also that licences are abused at night.  One only has to drive through the city any Saturday night to see what time people are leaving public houses.  I have had a complaint that in one part of my constituency when all other public houses are closed one public house is only starting to do business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point.  The general efforts of the Garda to combat crime in the city are often criticised. Criticism would not be necessary if we gave the gardaí the facilities they need. Deputy Mitchell mentioned stray horses in the city.  I know that in his area it is a problem and he feels justified in raising it here, but I understand there are no vehicles available to the gardaí for taking these horses to the pound.  I know of only one vehicle near my area and it works very well but the point is that these horses wander in many parts of the city and they are a grave danger to cyclists and cars on the road, so the Minister should look into this.  It is a growing menance and the gardaí should have the necessary equipment to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gardaí are to be congratulated in these days of crime when they very often have to risk their lives in preventing crime and apprehending those responsible. Nowadays human life is not so valued as it was, so that a garda apprehending a robber is aware that he might be seriously injured in doing so.  I call for the provision of modern weapons or vehicles or whatever the gardaí need so that they can fight the growing wave of crime.  I hate to hear people saying that there are no-go areas in Dublin.  If there are such areas they are so called because a few thugs live in the areas and the people who live there resent their <Col N="1828" /> neighbourhoods being regarded as no-go areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the disciplinary action, if any, taken following the internal Garda inquiry into the death of a young boy, following his release from Rathfarnham Garda station in July 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am concerned about some aspects of the manner in which a number of members of the Garda Síochána discharged their duties in relation to the detention of the boy in question, I think it is particularly important that I should first draw necessary distinctions between the different issues that have arisen.</P>
      <P>I have already stated, in reply to the Deputy's questions on 8 March last (volume 312, col. 1136 of the Official Report), that there is no question of any Garda inquiry, internal or otherwise, being held into the death of this boy.  The death was already inquired into, having been the subject of a sworn public inquiry in the form of a coroner's inquest, which is the method prescribed by law for such an inquiry.  Accordingly, the reference in the present question to an &ldquo;internal Garda inquiry into the death&rdquo; is not correct.  The question also refers to the boy's death as having taken place following his release from Rathfarnham Garda station.  If that is meant to imply that the death was the result of his detention, I have to point out that there is no evidence of any kind that that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the matter was last raised here, on 8 March last, the suggestion was made by one Deputy that a coroner's inquest is precluded from apportioning blame or exonerating anybody.  That observation is correct as far as it goes, but it is incomplete for it is clear that the jury <Col N="1829" /> would be perfectly free, while not pointing the finger at any individual, to draw attention to any failures on the part of the Garda Síochána, collectively, that the evidence would show to have been a contributory factor.  In this case, the question of their doing so could not arise because the medical evidence clearly established the cause of death as meningitis and it established also, not as a certainty but as a matter of high probability because of the incubation periods involved, that the virus must have been picked up before the boy was taken into custody.  Even if the virus had been picked up while the boy was in Garda custody, it would be unreal to suggest that that would imply culpability on the part of the Garda.</P>
    <P>A related issue is a suggestion that, if the gardaí had been more alert and had sought a medical examination, the boy's life might have been saved.  It is impossible, in the nature of things, to refute completely speculation based on what &ldquo;might have been&rdquo; but I suggest that the reasonable way to look at it is to bear in mind that, after a court hearing, the boy was sent to the assessment centre in Finglas in the early afternoon of Monday, 10 July, and that the people responsible for receiving him there obviously did not from the opinion that he needed any medical attention at the time of his reception or throughout that evening or that night.  It was not until the following day that he was attended by a doctor in the assessment centre and, even at that stage, meningitis was not diagnosed or, apparently, even suspected.  In those circumstances it seems quite unreasonable to suggest the symptoms must have been apparent to the gardaí who were dealing with the boy at an earlier stage in the incubation period.  The gardaí say that, while in their custody, the boy did not complain of any illness nor did they notice any symptoms other than a cough which the boy himself led them to believe was not a new development because, when they commented on it, he said it was due to smoking.</P>
    <P>Another issue that was raised was that of allegations of beatings with a stick, <Col N="1830" /> and punchings, and so on.  The suggestion was that the boys were beaten in order to force them to admit to crimes. Some allegations of this kind are said to have been made by the boy concerned to his mother, but the main allegations were made by another boy who was arrested and charged with him.  This other boy was legally represented in court.  The allegations were not repeated there and he pleaded guilty to the charges.</P>
    <P>Putting the matter in its most unfavourable light from the Garda point of view, it can safely be said that these allegations have not been substantiated. In fact, this issue was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions because, of course, if there was evidence to prove the allegations, the members concerned would not only have been guilty of breaches of discipline but of criminal offences. The Director found that there was no evidence that would warrant criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>At this point I would also explain that I am deliberately refraining from commenting in any way on allegations by Deputy Browne that the boys were illegally detained.  That is a legal question and it is not a matter for me to sit in judgment on legal issues.  If any relevant point about illegal detention could be made, the place to make it was in court where all aspects of the matter could have been argued.</P>
    <P>I now come to the only remaining issue, which is what the Garda inquiry to which I referred earlier was about, namely whether any member or members of the force were guilty of breaches of any internal Garda regulations that would warrant disciplinary proceedings. By &ldquo;Garda regulations&rdquo; I mean confidential internal instructions to the force, which are designed to ensure that the gardaí will act at one and the same time with efficiency and with due regard to the rights or reasonable needs of the detained person.  I regret that the answer to that is that there were, in fact, several breaches of those regulations.</P>
    <P>A number of members&mdash;13 in all&mdash;have been found to have been in one way or another, and for the most <Col N="1831" /> part in more ways than one, negligent in complying with approved procedures or in checking that those procedures were being observed by members under their control.  As Minister for Justice, it is not my function, under the disciplinary regulations or otherwise, to pass judgment on the precise degree of culpability that arises in relation to individual disciplinary charges.  That has been done internally, within the force itself, and it has never been the practice for Ministers for Justice either to seek to be involved in such decisions or to publicise what the particular decisions have been.  I have, however, been given to understand that the failures in some of the cases were mainly formal rather than substantive and that in no case were they very serious failures considered individually and in the light of a number of mitigating circumstances.  Nevertheless, the cumulative effect is, to say the least, disconcerting. I think it necessary to say publicly, here in this House, that it is a matter of very serious concern to me that a situation could have arisen in which 13 members of the force&mdash;of whom ten were above the basic rank of garda&mdash;have been found to have failed to act as they should have done, in connection with the detention and charging of these two boys.  I have conveyed this concern of mine to the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>Finally, to complete this statement and for the record, I would refer to the undertaking which I gave to Deputy Browne, in the course of a reply to supplementary questions on 8 March, to communicate with him as soon as I had information about the disciplinary inquiry. I was not, in fact, in a position to communicate with the Deputy in the matter because the inquiry was completed only very recently, by which stage notice of the Deputy's current question had been received.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his very comprehensive reply and for having taken so much trouble over what was obviously a case with <Col N="1832" /> a number of very disquieting features.  I cannot deal with all of them now but I should like to ask one question that I hope might arise out of this boy's tragic death, namely, about the judge's rules of evidence to which he referred, the confidential rules about the interrogation of juveniles in Garda custody.  In view of the fact that there was a delay between 8 and 10 July, between the time of taking the child into custody and calling the parent&mdash;I understand that was in breach of the confidential regulations of the Garda&mdash;what is the Minister's attitude to attempting to issue some rules of evidence, judge's rules or creating some rules, rules which are known to all of us publicity, about the whole question of the interrogation of juvenile suspects in custody, in particular in regard to the presence of the parent, the guardian or a solicitor before evidence taken can be admissible in court?  I hope I have made myself clear.  Would the Minister not feel that, arising out of this case, we should try to advance to the present British Home Office position in regard to which there is a Home Office circular about to issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy I should like to say that I have asked that senior officials of my Department would consult with the Garda authorities to see what can be done in the way of tightening up or improving existing regulations.  These confidential regulations are issued by the Garda Commissioner to members of the force.  I have asked that these be examined and, if they need to be up-dated or improved. I will be quite prepared to go along with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give any kind of undertaking that these rules&mdash;whatever rules or whatever circular is made available&mdash;should not be subject to confidentiality?  I fail to see, and I suspect the public will fail to see, why the rules should not be made public. What is the reason for the maintenance of confidentiality in respect of them? Would it not be in the interests of the Garda that we all have access to these, <Col N="1833" /> particularly in relation to children who are so vulnerable, helpless and impotent in a situation of this kind?  Would it not be wiser, particularly in this Year of the Child, to make even this small contribution to seeing that they are given every possibility of getting justice when in custody in our Garda stations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question raised by the Deputy in his last supplementary is one of the aspects which will be examined by senior officials of my Department in conjunction with the Garda authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice in relation to the payment of legal fees from his Department to barristers and solicitors the average delay in the making of such payments, the total amount of fees currently estimated to be outstanding and the reasons for such delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The average length of time between the lodgment of a claim and payment is somewhat less than two months.  It is hoped that arrangements can be made to reduce the period.</P>
      <P>When a claim is received it has to be examined in the relevant court office and then transmitted to the accounts branch of my Department for payment and, where payment to Counsel is involved, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has to be consulted.  Not infrequently queries arise either in the court office or in the accounts branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that a number of claims from a solicitor in the Deputy's constituency <Col N="1834" /> were the subject of query and the payment was, unfortunately, delayed for a considerable period but that it has now taken place.</P>
    <P>A check in court offices throughout the country would be needed to ascertain the number and amount of the claims currently being processed.  There are about 700 claims in the accounts branch at present, involving a total of £36,000. It is expected that, save where queries arise, those claims will be paid by the end of the week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if the report on the prison service and allied matters commissioned by him and carried out by the Institute for Public Administration in 1976 is publicly available, if copies are in the Oireachtas Library and, if not, if it is proposed to make the report publicly available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The report was commissioned in 1975 and the findings were presented to my Department in May 1979.</P>
      <P>It is still being examined and it is likely that some of the findings will be of use in the management of the prisons and places of detention.  It was never intended that the report, as such, would be published and, in fact, some remarks expressed by some identifiable persons and groups which are quoted in the report were franker than they would have been had there not been an understanding that the report would not be published.  The report will be available on a confidential basis within the Institute of Public Administration for future research work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider that the usefulness of such reports is diminished somewhat by the closed nature of the circulation list?  Allowing for the fact that this may have been drawn up in circumstances in which confidentiality was understood, might I ask him if he would be willing to have a <Col N="1835" /> precise of the report published in the public interest and for public consumption which would not breach that confidentiality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something I would be prepared to consider.  Perhaps I could get in touch with the Deputy on it. I do not want to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the Deputy's request now.  I should like to examine it and, if it can be done, I should like to give the reasons why it cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's attitude generally to the publication of such documents and reports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If a report was commissioned, as it was, in my predecessor's time, if it was being carried out on a confidential basis and if the people who were being asked to help in regard to the gathering of information for the report were given an assurance that the report would be confidential, then it is a very serious matter to break that confidentiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody would want to break that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but that is part of the dilemma in which I am caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the purpose of such reports is to elicit some sort of systematic finding or some new insights which would be useful?  It would seem to me to be logical and would it seem to Minister to be logical that the widest possible circulation consistent with standards of confidentiality would be required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If at the particular time it was the intention of the Government or of my predecessor to publish the report&mdash;had he cleared the way at the start it might have made things much easier, although, I am not blaming him for it&mdash;probably I would do the same thing.  However, I will investigate the <Col N="1836" /> Deputy's other request and, if I can, I will accede to it and, if not, I will tell the Deputy why not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the nature of the research projects commissioned by his Department in relation to prisons recently completed and currently under study by him, and if it is proposed to publish the findings of such research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the research project completed by the Institute of Public Administration, I refer the Deputy to my reply just now to Question No. 3.</P>
      <P>A survey report prepared by the Irish National Council on Alcoholism, which is a very large and technical report in three volumes, deals with the incidence of alcoholism among prisoners.  The report is not suitable for publication in its present form.  The feasibility of publishing a summary of the report is at present under consideration.</P>
      <P>A survey is being carried out at the Training Unit, Glengarriff Parade, to assess the performance in outside employment of offenders who have completed training courses in the unit.  The survey will not be completed before the end of next year.  The purpose of the survey is to measure for training purposes the effectiveness of the course.  It is not envisaged that the findings of the survey will be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from research on issues related to alcoholism and the rehabilitation of ex-inmates of the Glengarriff Centre, are there any other research projects under way by the Minister's Department&mdash;for example, in the areas of recidivism, or any other area of the whole penal system, or does this constitute the total of the research at present being undertaken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say very briefly&mdash;for fear the Deputy would draw wrong conclusions&mdash;these are the only <Col N="1837" /> two areas in which reports are on hand at present.  Nevertheless, the Department of Justice have access to research projects undertaken in other countries and by the Council of Europe.  Of course some of these would be of limited value because national conditions and characteristics have to be taken into account. The organisation division of the Department of Justice&mdash;and the Deputy is now spoiling my reply to the Supplementary Estimate which I hoped to get in today, next week or whenever&mdash;are currently taking steps to establish a research and statistics unit in the Department.  The establishment of such a unit was recommended by the interdepartmental committee on mentally ill and maladjusted persons, that is, the Henchy Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is good news.  But, apart from that, are there no other research projects at present commissioned by the Minister's Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the institutions of penal servitude which still have wood-yards; if it is intended to phase out these and, if so, when.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are wood-yards in Mountjoy Prison, Limerick Prison and St. Patrick's Institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An extensive programme of prison building and redevelopment is in progress at present and an important part of this is the provision of new workshops and the development of new industries and work activities.  The cutting and splitting of timber in wood-yards is decreasing according as suitable alternative activities become available.  It must be said, however, that the wood-yards have been useful in providing employment <Col N="1838" /> for offenders serving sentences of such short duration or whose aptitutes and interests are such that it is not feasible to provide work with a training content for them.  The need to provide unskilled work for some persons in custody is expected to remain.</P>
    <P>Considerable advances have been made over the past few years in providing employment and training for those in custody.  Already a wide range of employment activities has been introduced custody.  Already a wide range of employment activities has been introduced and developed to suit various abilities and interests.  Activities such as printing, joinery and gardening provide a commercial standard of product and give valuable training opportunities for the people working at them.  In the Training Unit at Glengarriff Parade the courses are equivalent to those available at the AnCO training centres and in addition, offenders are helped to develop social skills.</P>
    <P>Some form of work training is now available to any offender serving a sentence of 12 months or more who shows reasonable interest and who appears to have the aptitude to benefit from it.</P>
    <P>Plans for further developments in this area are now well advanced.  On the employment side there will be an expansion predominantly in the engineering, timber and textile activities.  In the industrial training area courses in construction and catering will be introduced.  These developments will take place in all of the prisons and places of detention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister expect that the wood-yards will cease operation?  Will the Minister confirm that he is aware not just that there are problems relating to the question of the usefulness of such work or toil but that there are risks to inmates and staff arising out of the kind of implements used in those wood-yards?  They have been the focal point of many problems in the past and I should like the Minister to tell us when we are likely to see the back of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Deputy understands well the problem we <Col N="1839" /> are discussing and I should like to tell him that considerable progress was made by my predecessors and myself in bringing about an expansion of facilities needed to provide outlets for the people in prison.  I cannot give the Deputy a date, as to when I will say that from that date onwards wood-yards will not be available.  If I am allowed to build the new prison at Wheatfield in County Dublin&mdash;that is another problem for another day&mdash;that will be a step closer to the day when, as far as St. Patricks is concerned, wood-yards will no longer be a part of it.  There are many problems over which I do not have any control that would affect ultimately the type of time schedule the Deputy has asked me to impose.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the disturbance which occurred in St. Patrick's Institution on 31 October 1978 which is over a year ago.</P>
      <P>I gave the House an account of these disturbances, based on the facts then known, in reply to a parliamentary question on 1 November 1978.  A more detailed internal inquiry was subsequently carried out.  It is not the practice to publish the results of such inquiries&mdash;and I am satisfied that there are good reasons for this practice, mainly the fact that the facts are more likely to be revealed on that basis&mdash;but I can say that the inquiry did not disclose anything that was either inconsistent with or that added materially to the account I gave the House already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also add that allegations were made that, while dealing with the disturbance and, even more so, after the disturbance <Col N="1840" /> had been quelled, prison officers seriously assulted a number of prisoners by way of retaliation.  As such allegations amount to allegations of criminal offences on the part of the prison officers concerned, the Garda Síochána were asked to carry out a separate investigation.  They did so and submitted their report, which includes the statements of the persons who made the allegations as well as those of prison officers, to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The director found that there was no evidence to warrant a prosecution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be any changes in the system of administration in St. Patrick's arising out of those inquiries? Will they have any concrete effect? Will the Minister reconsider the general attitude to the publication of the whole or part of such reports in order to quell sometimes unnecessary concern in the public mind, sometimes justified, and remove the cloud of suspicion which on occasions hangs for a long time in the wake of such instances?  Will the Minister consider a more open approach to the idea of publishing such reports which ultimately are paid for out of the public purse?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say what the findings of that report were.  However, the findings did not bring about any change in the statement I referred to, which was issued on 1 November 1978. It is not the practice in this House to comment on matters such as changes within the prison administration.</P>

      <P>I cannot say.  I would need separate notice of that question so that I could consider the implications of it.  With regard to the idea of making available reports of Garda or other inquiries to quell unnecessary concern, I do not believe that all the concern that is being voiced is necessary or genuine, as the Deputy thinks.  The Deputy mentioned an organisation this morning <Col N="1841" /> which my predecessor and I have had difficulty with.  We will have an opportunity during the course of the debate on the Vote for the prisons to thrash that out.  I agree that there is concern but not the great concern the Deputy speaks of.</P>

      <P>The Minister admits that there is some concern.  I am not asking the Minister to consider publishing a verbatim report of an internal inquiry but he should consider publishing a statement, as comprehensive as possible, making allowances for questions of libel and confidentiality, which would help to clarify the matter in the public mind.</P>

    <P>7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the reasons for the deterioration in the situation in St. Patrick's Institution which has led to requests by the prison officers to have the institution closed and if his reply to questions earlier this year on conditions in St. Patrick's Institution are consistent with recent reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any deterioration in conditions in St. Patrick's Institution in the last 12 months.  On the contrary, work has been proceeding in St. Patrick's on the provision of additional facilities, for example, the extension of the educational unit, the adaptation of workshop areas and the <Col N="1842" /> planning of a replacement kitchen.  These measures are, of course, interim ones.</P>
      <P>I am on record as saying that I do not consider St. Patrick's Institution as a suitable place to accommodate juveniles and I have never said anything inconsistent with that.  Planning is well advanced for two new institutions, one in Dublin and one in Cork, to replace St. Patrick's. At a recent meeting with the Prison Officers' Association, policy in regard to the eventual closure of St. Patrick's was clearly explained.  The Deputy's question suggests that what I have said is inconsistent with recent statements made in an article in the association's magazine.  I accept that it is inconsistent with that article. However, what I have said is factually and provably correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister address his mind momentarily to the inconsistency between what was said by his Minister of State on 27 June in the House in reply to my questions and what he has said now?  The Minister of State indicated then that there was complete harmony, light and reason, and all kinds of hope that peace and stability would prevail in this institution but within a matter of a few months the prison's officers requested that the place be closed. The Minister publicly acceded to that request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to give the Deputy a lesson or anything like that but he is incorrect in his facts.  I made known to the association who represent prison officers my views on St. Patrick's and my plans for it a long time before there was any call for its closure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of prosecutions which have taken place in this country in relation to bigamy over the last five years and the evidence, if any, to suggest that such a situation is being facilitated by the utilisation of divorce in England by such alleged bigamists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if reports of bigamous marriages are investigated by the Garda, if so, if the results of such investigations are communicated to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the result of such communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>Complaints of bigamous marriages are investigated by the Garda Síochána and, if the investigation discloses any evidence that might possibly justify a prosecution, a report is submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions who decides whether criminal proceedings should in fact be instituted.  Of course, if it were quite clear to the Garda that the available evidence could not possibly sustain a prosecution, as would be the case if, for instance, no evidence of a previous marriage could be found, the Garda would not normally submit a report to the director as it would be pointless to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that during the five-year period up to 31 December 1978 proceedings for bigamy were instituted in four cases.  For clarification, may I <Col N="1844" /> say that, due to a clerical error in Garda Headquarters where those statistics are compiled, Deputy Keating was informed in a recent letter from my office that the number of prosecutions in that period was five.  As now stated, the correct figure is four.  I regret that this should have occurred.</P>
    <P>As regards the second part of Deputy Keating's question, I have no function in relation to decisions to prosecute or not to prosecute and accordingly I am not in a position to comment on his reference to English divorces.  However, in case the matter is in fact linked to some extent with the wider question of the recognition of foreign divorces, I would mention that the Law Reform Commission are examining various aspects of the law relating to marriage and matrimonial causes and proceedings, including this question of the recognition of foreign divorces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister, first, how are statistics on this question kept, how comprehensive are they and how satisfied is he with them?  Secondly, does the Minister accept that there is a problem in relation to marriages annulled by Churches but not, obviously, the subject of a civil annulment, and the difficulty arising when such Church-annulled marriages are the basis for re-marriage, if the separated parties re-marry, although they are already married civilly, in the eyes of the State?  Is that a problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's supplementary question is that the Garda Síochána keep the statistics.  I apologise for the mistake in the statistics given to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the second part of the Deputy's supplementary question, the following relevant aspects of the law are at present under examination by the Law Reform Commission; the recognition and enforcement <Col N="1845" /> of foreign marriages, annulments, legal separations and divorces; the concepts of domicile, of habitual residence, the law relating to the nullity of marriage; application of foreign law in cases in which the courts of this country have jurisdiction to grant a decree of nullity of marriage; the substantive and procedure of law relating to matrimony and causes and the nature and basis of existing matrimonial proceedings generally and the law relating to the domicile of married women.  This is an extremely complex series of topics, I am sure the Deputy will agree, which is presently being examined by the Law Reform Commission and the results must be awaited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice, in respect of Loughan House, (1) number and position of permanent staff, (2) number and position of temporary staff, (3) number of young people <Col N="1850" /> imprisoned there since its opening and the average sentence given, (4) average monthly number of prisoners there, (5) weekly cost of keeping a delinquent there; and if he will make a statement on the future of the prison and on the possibility of the use of fostering as an alternative for young offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, Loughan House is not a prison.  It has been certified by the Minister for Education under section 45 of the Children Act, 1908, and fulfils the same role as the other schools so certified.  The boys sent there by the courts are the kind that will not be accepted by any of the other schools or that cannot be kept in them.</P>
      <P>The total number and grades of staff employed in Loughan House is 84 as follows: Director, 1; Assistant Director, 1; Care Supervisory Staff, 6; Care Staff, 51; Clerical Staff, 3; Trades Staff, 3; Farm Staff, 2; Welfare Officers, 2 (1 post vacant); Chaplain, 1; Nurses, 4; Domestic Staff, 10.  In addition eight teachers employed by Cavan Vocational Committee work in the school.</P>
      <P>The number of boys sent to the school since it opened was 40 and the average sentence was two years.  The average number of boys in custody in the school has been 20 and the number of care staff on duty at various times during any 24 hour period ranges from five to 32, as follows: 8 a.m.&mdash;1 p.m., 20; 1 p.m.&mdash;2 p.m., 32; 2 p.m.&mdash;4 p.m., 27; 4 p.m.&mdash;5 p.m., 30; 5 p.m.&mdash;10 p.m., 15; 10 p.m.&mdash;12 midnight, 7; 12 midnight&mdash;8 a.m., 5.</P>
      <P>A high ratio of staff to boys is absolutely necessary if control is to be maintained in as relaxed an atmosphere as possible.  As will be clear, the need for 24 hour attendance by staff necessitates a high overall staff allocation.</P>
      <P>The annual cost of running the school is in the order of £500,000.  The running costs would not vary significantly whether the number of boys was 20&mdash;the present population&mdash;or 40 or ten.  It will be possible to increase the number of boys being catered for when the construction of a services courtyard is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1851" /> The intention is that Loughan House will revert to use as a place of detention for youths in the 16-21 age group.</P>
    <P>The boys in Loughan have been sent there by the courts having been convicted of offences, in some cases very serious offences, and, in any case, anything in the nature of fosterage would hardly be feasible for them at the ages at which they are convicted by the courts. The courts have, of course, power to commit young persons to the care of fit persons but, in general, the boys in the other certified schools would be more likely to be considered for that alternative to commital in custody than the boys in Loughan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the steps, if any, intended in relation to the release of Dr. Rose Dugdale, in view of her young son's position and the promised amnesty for prisoners during the recent visit of the Pope to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In conformity with a long-standing practice of which I approve I do not make public statements about the affairs of identifiable individuals who are in custody.  The reference to an amnesty is not in point. The release of persons in custody to mark the visit of the Pope took place on 1 October, and included only persons who would be due for release in 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that we forget about the Pope and think about Christmas.  Will the Minister agree that there are special circumstances in so far as this child is deprived of both parents and in addition to that there appear to be difficulties in relation to his present guardianship, and in all these circumstances, in the interests of the child if not in the interests of the mother, will the Minister consider this case sympathetically?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that all the circumstances of all the <Col N="1852" /> prisoners eligible for parole or for mitigation of sentence will be considered by me before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the immediate steps he proposes to take in the light of the Mrs. Josie Airey case; the proposed regulations which will govern the free legal aid scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 18, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Airey judgement is being studied but it is not possible as yet to say what action may be necessary.</P>
      <P>In so far as the introduction of civil legal aid is concerned, the Government had already taken the necessary action in implementation of the commitment contained in their pre-election manifesto. On 2 May 1979 the Government announced that they had decided to introduce a scheme of civil legal aid and advice&mdash;on an administrative basis initially&mdash;and that the aim is to have it in operation by the end of the year.  It is expected that the scheme will be put in legislative form in due course.  The scheme is now almost completely drafted, negotiations with the legal profession are at an advanced stage, and I expect that it can be brought into operation by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the introduction of simpler and less complex court procedures is <Col N="1853" /> concerned, appropriate steps have also been in train quite independently of the Airey case.  In this regard I hope to bring my proposals concerning the recommendations made by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in its twentieth interim report before the Government in the near future.  These recommendations deal with the financial limits of jurisdiction of the lower courts and the conferring on these courts of additional jurisdiction in family law matters. In addition, the Law Reform Commission have on their published programme the question of the appropriate court structures to deal with family law matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that this will be in the form of legislation to come before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is, as I already announced, a scheme of civil legal aid and advice.  It can be introduced on an administrative basis initially but if at a later stage legislation is necessary we will have to have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be nothing to stop the Deputy or any other Member of the House from arranging a discussion on this.  We have already had a discussion on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the proposals which the Minister outlined on 2 May, has the Minister under consideration submissions which came in as a response to that, and if so does the Minister hold any hope that such submissions might bring about changes in the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that all submissions will be examined before the scheme is finalised and put into operation.  Quite a number of them are already being considered.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister look at the financial element in the scheme, the £10 for people who wish to avail of the scheme and will he make special provision for people in the social welfare categories who may be debarred from availing of access to justice because of the financial commitment involved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the total number of gardaí of each rank stationed at garda stations in the borough of Dún Laoghaire for each year from 1969 to 1979 and if he has any plans to increase the number of gardaí allocated to these stations in view of the general increase in crime in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Particulars of Garda strength in the four stations in the borough of Dún Laoghaire as at 31 December 1969 to 1978 and as at 30 October 1979 are given in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities state that in the case of each of the four stations the current strength is the maximum that can be provided at present having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services.  The question of increasing the strength at these centres will, however, be further considered according as additional manpower becomes available for assignment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1855" /> While it is not of any great significance in the present context, perhaps I should make it clear that the <Col N="1856" /> area served by the four stations in the borough is not co-terminous with the borough itself.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the recent census of population has disclosed that there has been a very substantial increase in the population of the Garda district concerned, that great pressure has been brought to bear on the force in the area to deal particularly with motor vehicle situations, and that new gardaí are being recruited, would the Minister agree to allocate some additional staff to the stations in that area? An extra 60,000 people are now living there.</P>

Having regard to increases in population, and if the crime rate warrants it, they will have to be given preference over other areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLipper" hpid="Mr. Lipper Mr. Lipper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting it as a question. The Minister's predecessor gave at least the patrol footmen in the area and, while it was not adequate, he did something to try to improve the situation with regard to the crime rate.  It has not reduced in any way and now the Minister tells us that the Garda authorities&mdash;and the Garda station is two miles at least from the area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever promise I gave could not have been a promise that I am aware of that I would put a Garda station in South Hill because that would have been a very foolish thing for me to do.  If I were to be Minister, which I did not think I could have been at the time I met those people, even then I knew that it was the Garda Commissioner and Garda authorities who decide what areas are to have police barracks.  They, and only they, do that.  I would like to correct one or two impressions which the Deputy has because it is well that he should know the facts.  There has been a dramatic decrease in crime committed in the South Hill area in 1979 right up to this week in comparison to last year.  It has been almost cut in two, the reduction is nearly 50 per cent.  I hope that that trend continues and I believe that the fact that an extra number of policemen, nine in all, have been made available to Edward Street Garda Station, which looks after the policing of the South Hill area, is producing good results.  If there were to be a Garda station in South Hill and it had to be staffed, just to keep the front door open right around the clock would take five of those nine men who would be inside doing nothing but keeping the door open and the light on.  I share the view of the Garda that the people they have there and the additional manpower which they have been given are better employed on the streets in South Hill, and the proof of it is there.</P>

      <P>The Minister's information is not correct.  In no way has the crime rate in that area reduced.  Whoever told the Minister that gave him incorrect information.  In 1974 we attended a meeting and we both pledged our support to the siting of a barracks in that area.  The situation is still as bad and we need a station there.  The Minister has an opportunity now to fulfil that promise.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he has been approached by ACRA regarding the holding of a referendum to abolish existing ground rents, whether such a course of action is feasible, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I received a copy of a resolution adopted by ACRA calling for a referendum on the question of ground rents.  In reply I have indicated that the Government's considered response to the ground rents problem is reflected in two Acts that were passed during 1978, <Col N="1862" /> that is, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978 and the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978.  The former Act effectively prohibits the creation of new ground rent leases of dwellinghouses.  Under the latter Act a special scheme is in operation which enables ground rent tenants of dwellinghouses to acquire the fee simple on very favourable terms in as much as that, for a nominal fee, the State undertakes the legal work involved.  I have no further proposals for legislation in this area.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I do not think that there would be much point in my giving my views as to the feasibility of holding such a referendum.  I should like to make it clear, however, that what is called for by ACRA is an amendment of the Constitution which would provide for the confiscation of the property of certain citizens.  There is no question of the Government's supporting such an amendment of the Constitution.</P>

    <Col N="1864" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 to 29, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In 1976, as a result of representations received from the National Council for Travelling People relating to problems affecting itinerant children, the Garda authorities issued instructions to the force in the Dublin Metropolitan Area to the effect that, when an itinerant parent was detained, and had or was believed to have one or more children who might be in need of care, the garda responsible for the detention should notify either the local itinerant settlement committee or their social workers, the child welfare service of the local health board or the local ISPCC inspector so that the interests of the child or children could be looked after.  Some two years later, that is last year, further representations were received suggesting that, where an itinerant woman comes before a court and the situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> child dependants is not known, the garda should request the court to grant an adjournment of the case until the domestic situation could be properly ascertained.  This was agreed and, on this occasion, the relevant instruction was issued to the entire force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following recent discussions between my Department, the Garda Síochána and the Department of Health, the Garda authorities will now be issuing revised instructions to the force.  Briefly, these revised instructions will be to the effect that, where any adult itinerant is detained in any part of the State, the director of community care of the local health board should be informed immediately, to enable him or her to ensure that itinerant children whose parents are detained are not left at risk.  The effect of this is to substitute the Director of Community Care for the various other agencies who have heretofore been notified.  It will be for the Director of Community Care to deal with the matter from that point onwards and to decide what other agency, if any, need be notified in the particular case.  No distinction is being made in the notification between men <Col N="1865" /> and women who are detained and the Garda will be giving the notification irrespective of whether they have reason to believe there are dependent children or not.</P>
    <P>The question of arrangements with local authorities or other outside agencies to ensure that the Garda comply with instructions given by their own authorities would not arise.  The Garda authorities will make their own internal arrangements, as is normal, to check from time to time that their instructions are carried out.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed, at present at all events and until further experience has been gained, to ask for adjournments as a matter of course in respect of all adult itinerants, as this is not considered to be necessary and could in other respects be seriously detrimental to the administration of justice.  Such requests will be made primarily in respect of women, but will also be made in respect of a man if the gardai know or have reason to believe that he has dependent children who might be at risk if he is imprisoned. I should make it clear, however, that any instructions of this kind are intended to apply only in what I might call normal situations.  The Garda could not undertake to ask for an adjournment, leading to a release on bail, if the accused person is thought to be unlikely to turn up for trial, at all events if the crime with which the accused is charged is a serious one. In such circumstances, some other appropriate <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements would have to be made.</P>
    <P>The adjournment of court proceedings is solely a matter for decision by the courts and it would not be appropriate for me to communicate with district justices in the manner proposed in one of the questions.  The legal position is that a court is asked for an adjournment, not told.  It may be taken, however, that in seeking adjournments in situations such as those I have outlined, the garda will arrange that all the relevant circumstances are brought to the notice of the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is satisfactory and <Col N="1866" /> is a marked improvement.  In relation to the little grey area, where the Minister indicated there would not be an automatic request for an adjournment, is there some other way whereby there can be an automatic copperfastened procedure that, regardless of what an itinerant parent tells a garda about the existence of children there is an inquiry about whether or not there are children in existence rather than a presumed belief on some information which the garda has got?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I earlier spoke about the relationship between drink and crime.  If we remember that we spent last year £1.2 million per day on drink and we spent less than half that on housing it shows there is something wrong with our priorities.  I do not believe anybody will deny that excessive drinking is a contributory factor in crime.  We must bear our share of the blame for some of the crime.  We must remember that a large section of the population do not drink alcohol.  The excessive drinking, therefore, among a small section of the community must be colossal.</P>
      <P>Are we doing enough to prevent the abuse of alcohol?  I am not trying to preach on this subject.  I am talking about the abuse of excessive drinking.  It is a great indictment of us that we spend so much more on drink than on housing when so many people are waiting for proper housing.  It is unfair to associate the Minister for Justice with the housing shortage as it is not his job.  I believe that if we could change the licensing laws to prevent the abuse of alcohol we would be doing a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have to consider how easily wine can be bought by many unfortunate people in this city and throughout the country whom we see sitting on the city streets drinking cheap wine.  I believe the situation is getting worse because <Col N="1899" /> every day we see more of them.  Could the Minister devise some way to tighten up the sale of wine to those people?  They can be seen early in the morning and late at night clutching a bottle of cheap wine. Those people probably need treatment. They are really breaking the law.  I believe that eventually the Minister will be forced to take action.</P>
    <P>I believe it is necessary to take action in relation to the sale of drink in supermarkets. They display the drink very temptingly.  It is hard to see, without a change in the law, how the supermarkets can stop selling drink to those people. The checkout girls are so busy that they would not be able to identify whether the people buying the wine are over 18 or under it.  Those girls at the cash registers with long queues of customers can do very little.  They can only take the money for the drink from those people and let them go on their way.  The Minister will eventually be forced to tackle this problem in the interests of the prevention of crime.</P>
    <P>Bank robberies in recent years have become a factor of everyday life.  The Minister yesterday gave some startling figures in relation to this.  I know he is concerned about this because I have been in touch with him about it several times during the year and making suggestions as to how they could be curbed.</P>
    <P>Most people say the banks should provide their own security, but I do not agree with that.  The banks have a duty to do what they can to prevent robberies and to safeguard their staff and customers.  This year several bank customers have been killed, staff injured and money taken.  We now have bank managers' families being kidnapped and held hostage while the manager goes with the gangsters to open the bank.  I suggested some time ago that bank managers should not be allowed to take the keys of the bank home each night.  I suggest the keys might be kept in a garda or army barracks.  The garda may not be prepared to take on this onerous job but the keys could be left in the army <Col N="1900" /> barracks.  In the morning they could be collected by somebody known at the barracks.  If we do this I am convinced kidnappings will stop and there will be a reduction in the number of bank robberies.</P>
    <P>Post offices and people in their own homes are being robbed.  The gardaí are doing their best to cope with this problem, which is not confined to this country; it is worldwide.  These gangsters rob banks and then take a holiday in the Middle East while they plan their next robbery.</P>
    <P>Private security firms are involved in crime prevention.  I am not very happy about these firms because I understand they do not need a licence to set up in business and I do not know if there are any standards laid down to which they must adhere.  It could happen that a man would start such a security firm with the intention of carrying out a number of robberies in the future.  Therefore, I suggest these firms should be licensed to operate and should conform to certain standards.</P>
    <P>Many of these firms are doing a very good job.  Such firms have been established in most countries but Ireland is one of the few places where they are not armed.  When I was abroad recently I was amazed to see members of private security firms carrying machine guns. That did not make me feel very happy. In America in the local drug store I noticed a private security man on duty carrying a machine gun.  We do not want that here.</P>
    <P>Our crime preventers are the gardaí backed by the people.  We do not want members of private security firms going around carrying loaded machine guns. The Minister should look into the whole question of security firms to see what can be done to improve their services and to ensure that nobody will be able to use a security firm to further his own ends by possibly planning robberies.  I realise the men working in these firms are running a risk every time they collect or deliver money.  It is in their interests that I ask that we ensure that these firms <Col N="1901" /> operate under the highest standards possible and that they must be licensed.</P>
    <P>I am tired preaching about vandalism. I do not know if it is on the increase or the decrease.  I believe vandals are mentally sick.  There must be some little kink which makes a person smash a telephone kiosk.  A telephone could be the means of saving a life.  Life belts along the rivers are stolen or the ropes are cut.  This means that an unfortunate who falls into the river is denied a chance of rescue. Psychiatrists should look into this.</P>
    <P>If the garda worked in co-operation with local residents' committees and people interested in preserving their area we would have a very happy organisation.  I was at a recent residents' meeting and a garda gave advice on drug addiction&mdash;and a very good job he made of it. I do not know if we have a very big drug problem, but the biggest drug I know of is drink.  We should encourage people to co-operate with the gardaí because, in the long run, they are the guardians of the public.</P>
    <P>In this city there are many young people terrorising old people.  Even if the old people know the names of these culprits they are afraid to name them because of possible retaliation.  In this city where we have a housing shortage a number of houses had to be closed because they were vandalised by unthinking vicious young people.  We might have a special section of the Garda to deal with that type of crime.  In some cases the housing authority have to put up wire mesh on windows of the old people's flats so that they will not be robbed.  There was one case where these brats stole the keys and charged ransom money for them.  These people are anti-social and are much worse than some people convicted for robberies.</P>
    <P>In the last ten years there has been a lot of political crime.  I do not know how we should tackle this.  Public representatives have a duty to ensure that by our every utterance we would not encourage anybody to use violence.  People must be educated that we can achieve our aims by peaceful means.  At the same time we <Col N="1902" /> must bring home to those responsible for a part of our country that any social injustices there must be removed.  If in our society we have certain injustices, it is our duty to remove them and to show people that we will not tolerate violent methods.  We can, with the brains God gave us, have a better society with social justice by peaceful means.</P>
    <P>The sufferings of people over the last ten years have been frightful.  The strain on the Garda has been colossal.  A number of our gardaí have died as a result of this type of crime.  We owe it to them and to the future of the country to take all possible steps against people who use violent means to achieve any aims. There are many degrees of violence. There is institutionalised violence which denies a person their rights, but a person shot dead callously in the street is something which cannot be taken lightly. John Donne said &ldquo;When any man dies I am diminished, because I am part of mankind&rdquo;.  In that he was expressing a feeling that we all share.  We back the Garda in their battle against these people. They must be given every means to combat all crime in the best way possible. People must be educated to see that crime does not pay.  I do not mean in the ordinary context that they will be punished for it but that it will not pay to hurt a neighbour, friend or relative. Crime must be seen as being abhorrent to us all.  We must prevent it, because prevention is better than detection. However, if we cannot prevent it we must have every possible means available to detect the people responsible.</P>
    <P>Young people are influenced by many things, particularly films and television. At home if a family are watching television and things become too bad they can switch it off.  However, I was at a cinema recently and was appalled at the film being shown to over 18s.  Films are made which would corrupt youth and drive them to crime.  If they commit crime and are caught they are sent to prison. Should the people who make these films not be sent to prison?  Should the people who show them not be admonished in <Col N="1903" /> some way?  I know we have a censorship board but, while the censor does his best, he can only delete the very worst parts of the film.  I do not condemn the youth but rather the people who are making money from these films shown both on television and in the cinema.  We must educate the youth to ignore the rubbish shown on the screens.  If these people do not have an audience they will stop making that kind of film.</P>
    <P>Another matter is that of vice in the city.  People generally laugh when one mentions prostitution.  The sordid side is that, at a time when we hear so much about women's liberation, we are faced with the situation where we may have the start of a female slave trade.  How many of these unfortunate women are there because somebody is making money out of them and terrorising them on to the streets?  There is no glamorous side to it.  I saw in a paper recently a statement from one of these people that one of their members had been murdered. In my constituency a resident told me that he had to leave his house at night to rescue one of these women who was being strangled by the person with her.  It is no joke and there is nothing glamorous about it.  I hope the Minister will provide a full Garda patrol in these areas.  These unfortunate women&mdash;I do not condemn them&mdash;may end up strangled in a gutter.  This happened not long ago.  One was found and I am told there was also a second person.  Let us get after the godfathers of prostitution&mdash;I am told they are there, although I have no proof of it&mdash;and put them where they should be, in prison.</P>
    <P>One often reads in the newspapers of a person charged with a crime and then remanded in custody for a long time.  If that person is innocent we are doing him a great injustice by allowing him to languish in prison for a long time before trial.  I appreciate the difficulty of the courts in this and the difficulty of bail in all cases.  I know a case where, if bail had been refused, a terrible tragedy would have been averted.  I queried the case and was told that the judge could not refuse <Col N="1904" /> to give bail.  The person involved was afterwards convicted of a hideous crime. The Minister should examine ways to shorten the remand period for a person before the courts and ways of ensuring that bail is only given in cases where it is fully warranted.  We must ensure that no innocent person will suffer either by being refused bail or being incarcerated in a prison for a long time before his trial comes up.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether our welfare officer service is up to scratch or not but I deplore seeing a ban-gharda on duty when she could be engaged in the sphere of crimes against women and children.  I was one of the people who campaigned for the creation of the force of banghardaí. We had in mind at that time that they would deal with women and children in trouble.  I urge the Minister to increase the force of Ban-Ghardaí and put them on this essential work.  I know the Minister and the Garda have had a tough year and I hope that when we are discussing the Estimate next year we will have made further strides in the prevention of crime.</P>
    <P>The prison system in other countries is causing great concern.  It may be that there are so many prisoners.  We will also have problems in that respect.  A few years ago I visited some of our prisons and found them very unlike hotels.  To deprive a man of his liberty by imprisoning him is a harsh measure but some men have to be imprisoned for the good of their fellow men.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister success with the proposed reforms and hope that they will result in a reduced crime rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Our committment to reducing the rate of crime has not been met.  In order to ensure that our citizens are free from attack, that their homes and properties are safe, and that our streets are safe, crime must be made unprofitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a great deal today about problems in the city.  I come from an isolated rural area and I can assure the House that people in this area live in fear of attacks by gangs who break into <Col N="1905" /> homes, sedate the dog, and then proceed to pull the house apart.  To combat that type of crime we would need to recruit more men.  I believe that the sight of a squad car in rural areas is essential.  The closing of the small rural stations has only added to the problem as the gardaí in these areas knew all the locals and where they could find them.  The grouping of gardaí in the larger towns is not effective. In view of the increase in crime in rural areas I appeal to the Minister to consider the re-opening of the small rural stations.  In my area recently two groups swooped on all the farmhouses and stole everything they could lay their hands on and they are still at large.  If the local stations were operating and were provided with squad cars we would be in a better position to combat this type of crime.</P>
    <P>I noticed in a recent report that the amount of money taken in armed raids in 1977 had doubled by 1978 to the frightening figure of £2 million.  Nineteen hundred homes, businesses and other premises were broken into and burgled in 1978.  I shudder to think what the 1979 figures will be like.  The impetus established by us in Government has been halted.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Garda Síochána on their work.  They are an unarmed force who have to deal with brutal criminals.  Their hours of work are anti-social and they have to deal with many difficult cases.  Regardless of the cost, we should increase the membership of the force so that people can live in peace.</P>
    <P>In regard to recruitment, I believe that there is too much emphasis on academic qualifications.  The quality of a man is more important that his ability to obtain a leaving certificate.  Another aspect of recruitment which should be reconsidered is the condition relating to height. I believe that we could lawfully bend the rule relating to height.</P>
    <P>In order to combat armed criminals the Garda should be provided with the best technical aids.  I would even suggest that selected members of the force should be trained abroad.  We should also provide refresher courses in dealing <Col N="1906" /> with armed crime for all members of the force.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to people who conspired to commit crime. They are not in the same category as the ordinary offender.  I agree with the previous speaker and I would support the Minister in any action which he takes to ensure that people who conspire to commit armed crime are not given bail as further serious crimes are often committed by people who have been allowed out on bail.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to latenight drinking.  Our licensing laws are controlled by Acts which date back to 1825.  The drink industry generates consumer spending of about £1 million per day.  The number of special exemptions granted last year was more than 40,000. Many of them may be for genuine dinners and clubs, but most of them are just excuses for late night drinking.  There is exploitation of the young in our society because of late night drinking facilities.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, including the spread of under age drinking which, as we were told, is very difficult to control in a busy licensed premises, the spread of late night clubs with wine licences, the increase in the number of pubs registered under the 1904 Act, about which many of our district justices have expressed their gravest concern, I would urge the Minister as a matter of urgent public importance to set up a commission to inquire into the whole area of our licensing laws.</P>
    <P>I have noted for some time the wonderful work being done in one of our institutions about which I made some inquiries, St. Patrick's Institution.  I should like to compliment them on the work being done there for the 16 to 21 year olds. The majority of these are young people very often from broken homes&mdash;not necessarily poor homes, because there are broken homes in the very well-off sector as well&mdash;and from bad housing conditions and usually they are unemployed. They are material which can be worked on.  They are not hardened criminals.  They are young offenders. <Col N="1907" /> The fact that the unit is comparatively small helps it to be a successful unit. They have wonderful workshops and educational facilities up to the leaving certificate.  That is what those people need and that is what they are getting.</P>
    <P>When they are let out into society they report back to the social workers who take a serious interest in them. More and more effort should be put into that sort of work.  Once they become hardened later in life, there is very little we can do.  A lot of work is being done but a lot more could be done.  We need more small centres.  In Mountjoy, where there are 400 or 500 prisoners, that unit is too large.  We should get away from the American type of herding operation where the really hardened prisoner is in with the ordinary person who may have committed a smaller offence.  There are the bullies, and so on, as we see on television, although that is probably exaggerated. I see a great case for smaller units, small workshops where there is personal supervision and an intimate knowledge of the prisoner and his problems.</P>
    <P>When the time comes for the young person to be released, society has a big part to play in offering him employment. No stigma should be attached to a young man because he has served a short time in prison.  Employers should be encouraged to help them in every way possible even to the extent of giving them a small grant to help these people to rehabilitate themselves.  We hear of cases where these young people are not accepted in their homes.  When that happens, flats or some sort of accommodation should be found for them.  We must ensure that they are not thrown back on to the streets and that they are gainfully employed.  There is an old saying that the devil tempts the idle hand and the idle mind.  If a man is employed, he is less likely to create problems for the State and the Garda.</P>
    <P>The clergy, the Legion of Mary, Alcoholics Anonymous, and so on, are doing tremendous work in this area.  I should like to see more assistance given <Col N="1908" /> to them.  In cases like aid for Biafra or Concern, the same few people seem to do whatever has to be done to help their fellow men.  I should like to see much more involvement on the part of the community in helping our teenagers who unfortunately find themselves locked up, because locked up they have to be.  We must have the rule of law.  It is not sufficient to leave everything to the clergy, the Legion of Mary, and other societies. Everybody should be involved and concerned to see that these young people can live a normal life and that the rate of crime is reduced.  Crime should be projected by the media as a very serious matter.  I am convinced that, were it not for the amount of voluntary effort by the clergy and the various societies, in Dublin especially, the volume of crime would be much greater than it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an unenviable job in trying to control armed robberies and the general violence which seems to have taken hold of our society.  I wish him well.  I would support him in any measure he might take to control armed crime.  The people who engage in this sort of activity seem very often to go unapprehended. They appear out of the blue, as it were, and terrify anybody they choose to terrify.  The lives of the members of our unarmed police force are put at risk daily in their efforts to deal with these people.  They are a bunch of people who are a blot on our society and should be ashamed to refer to themselves as Irish men and women.  I appeal to them to stop this crime.</P>
    <P>The forces of the State are having difficulty in dealing with them but the Minister can rest assured that he will have the full support of this side of the House in any effort aimed at dealing with this problem.  These marauders of the night will not be found calling to a house where there are a number of teenage sons, for instance.  Instead they go to the homes of widows or of old people who are living alone and terrify them. The amount of damage and destruction they cause to shops and other business premises such as co-operative societies in efforts to lay hands on whatever cash <Col N="1909" /> may be available is incredible.  What sort of mentality must these people have?  I would class them as our public enemy number one.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Garda for the excellent job they are doing.  I trust that the recruitment campaign will be continued so that it will be possible to have Garda presence in any place that it is necessary. There have been references today to the vandalism that is so prevalent especially in regard to telephone kiosks and to cars. Recently, I saw a line of between 20 and 30 newish cars that had been damaged by some sort of sharp instrument. Perhaps the damage involved was to the extent of £1,000 or so and it could have been caused within a matter of minutes. In Cobh recently five telephone kiosks were destroyed.  I suggest that the community generally are not doing nearly enough in co-operating with the Garda in the prevention and control of such crime.  I am a firm believer in the concept of the fear engendered by the peak cap. In most cases the young people who are engaged in acts of wanton destruction are terrified of the Gardaí.  Locking a car nowadays is merely a joke.  Some time ago I happened to be in the Shelbourne Hotel with a former colleague from the Beat Growers Association.  He had parked his car in front of the hotel but when we came out after about an hour-and-a-half, we found that the car radio had been stolen though the bolts that had been removed in the first place had been put back.</P>
    <P>The work being done in dealing with juvenile offenders is excellent.  These young people should at all times be kept separate from the hardened criminal. Again, I compliment the Garda but we need more members in the force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to thank the Minister in regard to the courtesy extended to me on the various occasions on which I have made representations to him and to wish him well in his fight against crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall refer first to the Estimate for the Garda but I trust that I will be forgiven if, at times, I combine both Estimates <Col N="1910" /> in my remarks.  This Estimate is for the purpose primarily of meeting the cost of the new rates of pay for the Garda.  As most speakers have remarked, the Garda are doing a fine job.  They are deserving of any extra remuneration that we may be able to give them.  People in such a trustworthy position as gardaí should be free from the sort of money difficulties that most of us experience.  In so far as possible they should be free from financial problems.  Consequently, they should be very well paid.</P>
    <P>Much of what I have heard today from all sides of the House would seem to be lacking in some respect.  I agree that the crime situation is bad but it would not be fair to expect the Minister to make specific promises in regard to solving the problem.  All any Minister can do in a situation such as this is to express the hope that the measures being taken will prove successful.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the kind of society we have built up&mdash;perhaps this is true also of other countries&mdash;in terms of differences in the strata of society has contributed to this kind of situation.  It would appear that many of those who indulge in crime, whether individually or in gangs, have had a chip on their shoulders from childhood.  Consequently, any examination of this whole area of crime must involve an examination into a person's life from long before the time when he was apprehended.  We must ask what are we as a society doing to change the kind of environment that would appear to produce a preponderance of criminals.</P>
    <P>If we take crime as our criterion it appears that we are developing the kind of society that produces this person with a huge chip on his shoulder.  If that is so we have a duty to examine the situation to find out why this is happening and why people in certain areas&mdash;and it is not confined to our bigger cities but happens in small rural towns as well&mdash;gang up to do things because it gives them a feeling of power.  There must be something wrong with the various social areas of education, housing and so on <Col N="1911" /> when this kind of thing happens even in small villages.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána and the leaders in society have not the same contact with or influence over the youth in our society as they had some years ago.  I am not blaming anyone for that but despite what the previous speaker said about the squad car it has not helped in rural areas.  The previous speaker said the squad car was a deterrent but we need more than a deterrent.  A word of advice from a local garda might be better than squad cars flying up and down the road.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago the smaller police stations were run down and depopulated in such a manner that some of them are now a farce.  The gardaí in these stations are expected to compile a whole lot of statistics, to act as a labour exchange and so on and some of them are operating with a one man team.  If we are going to have police stations at all there should be local stations.  Towns should not be serviced by a station 20 miles away which will send squad cars.  This will not improve the relationship between the police force and the ordinary individual, particularly the young people.</P>
    <P>We need to examine more deeply than can be done under this Estimate the causes in our society that produce the situation I have been talking about.  If a person has a chip on his shoulder there must be a reason for it.  He might have inherited it from his parents or he might have it as a result of an inferiority complex because of the section of society he comes from.  There may be a reason for this chip and we have to remove that reason for grievances aganist society and against the Garda authorities.  There must be respect between these people and the Garda.  The Garda should have respect for the problems of young people. I have found by and large that young people are very excellent people that one would be proud to associate with.  If some of them are going wrong it is not in any bigger proportion than hitherto.  Young people seem to have more of a grudge against society than they did formerly.  We should be doing <Col N="1912" /> more than sending squad cars into their areas to make them afraid of committing crime.  If they feel they have a grudge against society they will commit crime.  I could go on for a long time on the grudge these people have against society but I will not because I will have many other opportunities in many other areas to talk about that.</P>
    <P>Many Garda barracks&mdash;and I can give examples in my own constituency&mdash;are reduced to one member of staff and some of them close at 12 midnight. One can ring up Carlow Garda station which is 12 or 15 miles away and a squad car is sent.  As a result hardened criminals can come from as far away as Dublin in cars stolen at various stages along the way to commit crimes.  They know that after 12 midnight, although someone will ring for a squad car, they are safe because the squad car will have to come such a distance that they can carry out their crime and be many miles away before the squad car arrives.  Centralising Garda activity is not the way to deal with problems.  The gardaí and squad cars should be available on the spot and right through in all these towns to provide the kind of service that is vital and necessary.</P>
    <P>The present Minister has been working in the direction of increasing the force just as the previous Minister was. In some of the smaller towns in my area two gardaí are expected to provide a service, to know everything that is going on in the area and to act as an employment exchange and so on when the full complement is four gardaí plus a sergeant. Let us either have police stations in those areas or not.  If we are not going to have them let us take the consequences and let us not fool ourselves and the public by saying that we have a Garda service in these small towns when we really have not.  Most of these gardaí spend most of their time doing office work which is not really police work at all.  It is about time we realised that if we want protection from crime and if we want a police service that will do justice to our country and to our people who need and have a right to protection we must double or triple <Col N="1913" /> the number of gardaí we have at present and give them proper equipment. All sides of the House agree that there must be trust between the Garda Síochána and the people.  I have the greatest admiration for members of the force.  In my constituency a young garda, at great risk to himself, faced a large smuggling gang&mdash;not from this part of the country&mdash;and tackled them on his own.  This was appreciated by everyone in the country.  I refer to the drugs operation in Naas.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána are pilloried by some people.  There is an impression in the public mind&mdash;I do not know if it is because of newspaper reports or by way of some other medium&mdash;that methods that were foreign to the Garda Síochána in past years are being used to extract statements from people.  If there was a good public relations job carried out on behalf of the Garda Síochána, if the Garda officers have in the taking of statements, if certain guidelines were laid down that were known to everybody, there would be a much better relationship between the force and the public.  The Garda force or the Department of Justice might consider carrying out a public relations job to let the public know about the situation.  If there was no doubt in anybody's mind about what was involved there would be no room for allegations that people were kicked and badly treated while in custody.  I do not believe that such things happen but immense harm is done when such allegations are made.  It is in the interests of the Garda Síochána that the public know the situation.</P>
    <P>This Estimate gives increases to members of the force.  They should be well paid.  Some of the younger gardaí complain that their increase will be a tiny fraction of the average amount being paid to the force.  These young officers have commitments and they should not have to suffer financial embarrassment. They cannot carry out their duties adequately if they have financial worries of their own.  I have heard that young gardaí coming out of the depot have <Col N="1914" /> received only a very small increase and that is not desirable.  They are the people who must uphold the laws.  They should know that they have the backing of the Minister and all the forces of the State, that they can fearlessly impose the law irrespective of the people who come to their notice.  Some members of the public have a chip on their shoulders so far as society and the law are concerned.  We must ensure that the law is administered fairly and equitably and we must get that point across to the people to whom I referred in my opening remarks.  If we do not do that we are putting a barrier between the various strata in our society. That is bad for the Garda Síochána and for the community in general.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling that society is against certain classes of people.  I am not saying the people in custody should live in the lap of luxury but they should be looked after in a proper way.  Our prisons are old, some of them very much out of date.  It is terribly frustrating for anybody committed to prison for any length of time to find themselves so restricted from the point of view of space, facilities and so on.  It is impossible for them to feel anything but frustration and they are bound to build up, during their term there, a chip-on-the-shoulder and anti-society attitude.  We would be doing a good day's job were we to set about having such people treated decently.  If such people have committed serious crimes, I know they must be punished in some way, taken from society, in order to bring home to them that they cannot carry on in that way.</P>
    <P>In the case of long-term prisoners, in particular, the parole system could be used to better advantage.  When a prisoner is well behaved in prison, if encouraged, afforded some facilities and allowed out over weekends to return to his family it might overcome the possibility of his building up resentment against society during his period of detention.  Furthermore, it would lessen the possibility of his being rejected by his family, which happens in many cases, nor would he find it so difficult to get employment on leaving prison.  If such <Col N="1915" /> prisoners could be given an incentive to further their capabilities during their period of detention, by undergoing training in some trade or other, and being allowed integrate in society periodically, this would be immensely beneficial to them.  This is something we should be endeavouring to do.  Very often also the relatives of prisoners become anti-society because they discover on visiting the prison that the visiting facilities leave a lot to be desired.  The security problem cannot be overlooked, but certainly better facilities could be made available especially with regard to the privacy of such visits.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to mention a famous prison in my constituency&mdash;I do not know whether it is a prison or a military camp&mdash;I think it was opened as a detention centre, what was known as the Curragh Detention Centre.  I have been on its visiting committee for the past few years.  It is not a suitable place to have a prison located; the building itself and the overall size of the compound are not what they should be.  It was opened, I think, in 1972 in peculiar circumstances as a result of disturbances at Mountjoy Prison where a wing was destroyed and rendered unfit for use for some time.  The Curragh Detention Centre was opened during the period of office of a Fianna Fáil Government and indeed it was continued by the Coalition and this Government.</P>
    <P>I have made appeals to various Ministers to have this centre closed.  I think an undertaking was given that its lifetime would be as short as possible and that, as soon as Mountjoy Prison was restored to normality, it would be closed.  I think it was intended to be a very temporary measure.  In the beginning there were prisoners there&mdash;and I do not want to give them any status&mdash;who were considered to be political in one way or another&mdash;provisional IRA people and representatives of other organisations <Col N="1916" /> who, at that time, broke up Mountjoy to such an extent they had to be transferred to the Curragh.  At present there are 25 or perhaps fewer prisoners in the Curragh.  I feel they are not the kind of prisoner to whom I have just referred.  As far as I can ascertain&mdash;and the Minister admitted this here in the House&mdash;the people there now are those who have had difficulty in every other prison around the country and are not what we might call political prisoners.  These are long-term prisoners, apparently people who have given trouble in other prisons who were all gathered together and dumped down in the Curragh, which was a mistake.</P>
    <P>The Minister agreed with me before that he would like to close this centre as soon as possible; I think that was his attitude. I know nothing about Mountjoy Prison and whether or not it has been restored to normal since 1972 but I feel strongly that the Curragh is not a fit place to house such people.  I know Army people will do whatever requested by the Government; that is what they are there to do.  However, I feel such personnel did not join our Defence Forces to be prison warders.  While I know Army people are known not to complain about any duty assigned to them, the very smallness of the area breeds a kind of dissension between the prisoners and the military police there acting as warders. The conditions under which these people have to operate are not those one would expect in a prison.  The previous speaker spoke about smaller prisons, yes, smaller prisons, but certainly not what has been used traditionally and known as the glasshouse in the Curragh to house for a very short term people who were in breach of Army regulations or something of that sort.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. J. Ryan</b> asked the Minister for Finance the progress made in the recruiting of the engineers required for the commencement of the arterial drainage scheme for the Mulcair river affecting lands in Counties Tipperary and Limerick and if he will confirm that this latter scheme will commence at the conclusion of the Maigue scheme; the number of engineers employed in his Department in 1979 as compared with 1978; and the progress, if any, since he received a deputation earlier this year, in the preparation of sketch plans for the Mulcair scheme.</P>

      <P>The engineering strength of the Commissioners of Public Works increased by ten from 123 to 133 during the last year but a number of vacancies still remain to be filled.  The increase though not meeting the commissioners' requirements has enabled a number of projects to be advanced.  These include the design of arterial drainage schemes for a number of catchments including the Mulcaire, work on which is proceeding. However, at this stage, having regard to other commitments, I could not say exactly when a scheme for the Mulcaire might commence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main projects undertaken by Aer Lingus in 1978 were as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  <i>Nature of the Projects</i></P>
      <P>(i)  Algeria: A maintenance management contract with Air Algerie and subsequently component overhaul and training including B737 pilot training on the Aer Lingus simulator.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Cameroons: Aircraft leasing and subsequently B737 component overhaul.</P>
      <P>(iii) Egypt: Aircraft leasing, component overhaul, computer time leasing (Egyptair).</P>
      <P>(iv) Libya: Training at Dublin for Libyan airline staff.</P>
      <P>(v) Morocco: Secondment of engineers, training and aircraft maintenance.</P>
      <P>(vi) Nigeria: Secondment of engineers plus aircraft maintenance.</P>
      <P>(vii) Sudan: Component overhaul training and simulator.</P>
      <P>(viii) Zaire: Aircraft leasing, workshop development and component overhaul.</P>
      <P>(ix) Zambia: Comprehensive contract including aircraft leasing, management and other training, secondment of staff.</P>
      <P>(x) Kenya: Management services and part time aircraft leasing.</P>
      <P>(xi) Southern African Countries: Training programme at Dublin Airport for personnel of Namibia and other Southern African States.</P>
      <P>(xii) Swaziland: Assistance to Royal Swazi Airlines.</P>
      <P>(xiii) Lesotho: Assistance to Lesotho  Airways.</P>
      <P>2.  <i>Funding of Projects</i></P>
      <P>The contracts are all paid for directly by the airlines receiving service from Aer Lingus, with the following exceptions:&mdash; the training programme for personnel of Southern African countries was funded mainly by the United Nations; assistance to both Royal Swazi Airlines and Lesotho Airways was made available from the Bilateral Aid Programme of the Department of Foreign Affairs; and, in the case of Lesotho Airways, however, the project was mainly funded by EEC Third World Development Aid.</P>

      <Col N="1871" /> 3.  <i>Total Costs Involved</i></P>
    <P>In view of the commercial considerations involved, it would not be appropriate to publish information on the costs involved.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Terms of Projects</i></P>
    <P>For the reasons given in paragraph 3 above, it would not be appropriate to publish information on the terms on which the projects were undertaken.</P>
    <P>5.  <i>Number of Aer Lingus Employees involved in each Project</i></P>
    <P>It is not possible to define the number of persons involved in a meaningful way. Some of the contracts involve locating staff abroad for varying periods but the greatest staff involvement is at Dublin Airport in the training and maintenance field.  In the maintenance field Aer Lingus estimate that up to 700 staff are engaged in work for other airlines but this, of course, includes work for developed as well as developing countries.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy when he proposes to implement the decision of 15 May 1979 by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers requiring domestic appliances to show bright orange labels giving details of electricity consumption in kilowatts and if he will extend this requirement to include space heating and water heating appliances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that this question relates to the directives adopted by the Council of the European Communities on 14 May 1979 on the indication by labelling of the energy consumption of household appliances.  Under the provisions of the directives member states are required to bring into force the provisions necessary to comply with the directives within a period of two years and it is my intention to comply with that requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1872" /> The provisions of the directives have not yet been applied to space heating and water heating appliances.  The question of extending the provisions to these appliances will be considered if and when the necessary implementing directives are adopted by the European Communities.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in respect of the first ten months of 1979, the assistance from the bilateral aid programme that has been (a) allocated, and (b) spent, through semi-State, governmental and non-governmental organisations, specifying in the case of each project (i) the nature of the project, (ii) the organisation involved, (iii) the total cost, (iv) the share of the cost borne by the bilateral programme, by the organisation in question and by other sources, (v) the commencement and completion date of the project, (vi) the project-holder involved in the developing country, (vii) if the Irish organisation is involved on a commercial or a non-profit basis and (viii) the benefits judged to accrue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the bilateral aid programme, projects are identified in consultation with the appropriate authorities in our partner countries.  After a joint assessment of the project requirements, an Irish organisation, where the project does not involve the direct transfer of financial assistance to the partner country, is sought by my Department to undertake its implementation on our behalf.</P>
      <P>Projects in the non-governmental sector are submitted to my Department by the organisations concerned for funding under our co-financing scheme.  They are normally funded up to 75 per cent of the cost of a project.  The total allocation to this scheme this year amounts to £1 million and it is estimated that the full allocation will be taken up by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Answers to (a) and (b) (i), (ii), (v) and <Col N="1873" /> (vi)  for governmental and State-sponsored organisations are given below in tabular form.  Regarding the total cost of a project, this is difficult to ascertain as in many cases projects are part of larger schemes, undertaken or financed by other donor countries or agencies. These costs are not readily available to me, nor are the back-up costs of the local co-ordinating authorities.</P>
    <P>The expenditure under the co-financing scheme is listed separately and shown on a country basis.</P>
    <P>Government Departments and non-governmental organisations are involved in the programme on a non-commercial basis.  The basis on which State-sponsored bodies participate in it is a matter for their respective boards and/or Ministers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1874" /> In replying to an omnibus question of this kind, it is clearly not possible to set out for each individual project the &ldquo;benefits judged to accrue&rdquo;.  It might be helpful to point out, however, that the primary purpose of the overall programme is to channel official Irish aid in the most effective way possible to the poorer countries of the developing world and the poorer populations in them.  Within this broad strategy, there have been to date four primary recipients of aid under the programme, Lesotho, Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia.  The projects listed below, therefore, should be seen within this general framework.  If the Deputy wishes me to set out in detail the aims and objectives of any particular project, I shall of course be happy to do so.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the local authorities, if any, involved in projects in developing countries or in projects located in Ireland involving nationals of developing countries, and in the case of each project (i) the nature of the project, (ii) the local authority involved, (iii) the total cost, (iv) by whom the cost is borne, (v) if the projects are being carried out on break-even, semi-commercial or commercial terms and (vi) the number of local authority employees involved in each project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have for some time been looking at the possibility of utilising the potential of the local authority sector in our development co-operation activities, and this has therefore been under examination recently by my Department, the Institute of Public Administration and the County and City Managers Association.  As part of this examination, a team drawn from IPA and the County and City Managers Association visited Kenya, the Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia in July of this year, and their report is at the moment under active consideration in my Department.  The total cost of this visit was £13,036.23.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any involvement in development co-operation, other than the above, on the part of local authorities.</P>

      <P>Almost all of the information <Col N="1887" /> sought by the Deputy, in so far as the Bilateral Aid Programme is concerned, is contained in my reply to Question No. 342 above.  The outstanding information, which relates to the staff involvement, is as follows: two staff from the Department of Agriculture are employed full-time on the ground in Lesotho on the Basotho Pony Project, while four vocational teachers are involved in the full-time implementation of the secondary schools technical education diversification programme in Lesotho.</P>
      <P>In addition to the full-time staff employed on the ground, officials of Departments are assigned, as required, on a short-term basis to projects.  It would be extremely difficult and timeconsuming, however, to quantify these short-term assignments.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware, only one Department are involved in a project outside of the Bilateral Aid Programme. This is the Department of Labour which make an annual grant towards the International Labour Organisation Training Centre in Turin.  This grant covers the cost of fellowships for students from developing countries in Africa.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the plans, if any, for the implementation of the European Council's resolution of 16 June 1977 calling on governments to set a good example by using solar energy in the construction of public buildings for ambient heating purposes or for the partial replacement of oil heating of public swimming pools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a resolution of the European Parliament dated 11 July 1977 which states, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows: &ldquo;The European Parliament believes that solar energy could be usefully applied by Member States in the construction of public buildings.&rdquo;  The construction of public buildings for Government purposes is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  Insofar as public buildings and public swimming pools under the control of local authorities are concerned no plans have been made up to the present for the use of solar energy for heating purposes in connection with them.  However, in July, and again in August this year, I informed local authorities of the Government's concern that effective measures should be taken by them to reduce energy consumption by eliminating waste and encouraging conservation as much as possible, both in their day-to-day operations and in the public buildings under their control.  At the same time I asked them to take great care where new buildings are proposed, to ensure that adequate insulation and the most efficient and economical means of heating and lighting are provided for in the design.</P>

I have been informed by my Department inspector that the work has not yet been completed in either case and, as I cannot indicate when this will be done, it would not be possible for me to state on what date the grants will be paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Bray Urban District Council recently wrote to my Department indicating that they proposed to instal storage or space heaters in Fassaroe Park flats and to meet the installation and running costs out of moneys provided for repairs and maintenance of their rented estate.  My Department informed the council that a decision to take action on these lines would be primarily a matter for the council, subject to the constraints placed on them by their obligation to ensure that sufficient finance is available to maintain all their tenanted houses in good repair, as required by the Housing Authorities (Borrowing and Management) Regulations, <Col N="1896" /> 1974.  Local authorities are allowed to retain all rents and miscellaneous receipts from their rented housing operations and up to 50 per cent of the proceeds of sales of dwellings to tenants to enable them to meet the costs of maintaining and managing their housing estates.</P>
      <P>Due to the necessity to conserve available housing capital moneys to provide urgently required local authority houses and to finance local authority house purchase loans, I regret that I cannot make special allocation of funds to enable Bray Urban Council to finance their proposed scheme.  Subject to the considerations I have mentioned, it is a matter for the council to decide when the heaters may be installed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the closure of the Youth Encounter Project in Cork.  The project was originally organised in 1977, under the auspices of Ogra Chorcaí and the Cork Youth-At-Risk Committee, to provide non-residential communitybased facilities for children between the ages of about ten and 15 years who had become persistent truants or had become involved in minor delinquency or were at risk of becoming involved in delinquency. The general aims of the project were to improve the ability of the participants to cope with their environment (home, school and community), to develop scholastic and vocational skills and aptitudes and to foster positive attitudes towards themselves and their communities.  The project consisted of an integrated school and out of school programme conducted by a board of management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1897" /> The project was accommodated in a premises rented from the Cork City Vocational Education Committee.  The staff consisted of a principal and two assistant teachers, whose salaries were paid by my Department.</P>
    <P>The project included both an educational and an out of school programme with particular reference to the need of the children for remedial and compensatory education.  The out of school programme included recreational and training elements.</P>
    <P>My Department received a request from the board of management last September to close down the project to give an opportunity to the board to review all aspects of its work to date, taking into account the experience learnt from the operation of the project.  I acceded to the committee's request as the small number of children attending the school did not justify the continuance of the project in its present form.  The question of the future of the project will be considered when the board of management completes the review which it considers necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tuition fee levels in the university colleges are set by the authorities of each of these institutions.  These colleges increased their tuition fees for the 1979-80 academic year by 25 per cent for first year students and 10 per cent for students in the second or later year of a course.</P>
      <P>As far as repeat students are concerned, the question of the rate of increase to be charged is one for decision by the authorities of the university college involved.</P>
