    <Title>Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1979: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1979, </P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on 24 May, 1979. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, defines the investments in which trustees may invest trust funds unless expressly forbidden by the instrument, if any, creating the trust.  Equally, the trust deed may confer wider powers of investment but many trusts and <Col N="1656" /> analogous funds are restricted to the investments authorised under the Act.  The Minister for Finance may vary the authorised investments by order.</P>
    <P>The list of authorised trustee investments is kept under active review and changes are proposed as the need arises. As part of this process I am now laying before the House a draft order which would add three non-associated banks and one building society to the list of authorised trustee investments.</P>
    <P>Following consultation with the Central Bank, their recommendation has been accepted that the three non-associated banks named in the draft order be included in the list of authorised trustee investments.  The addition of these banks will bring the total number of licensed banks on the list to 28, comprising all the major domestic and foreign banks in the State.  This increase will improve the range of investment opportunities open to trustees.</P>
    <P>The Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1977, added building societies to the list of authorised investments for the first time.  On this occasion I propose to add one further building society to that list.  I am satisfied that this building society is suitable for inclusion having met the criteria to be observed by building societies qualifying for trustee status.  This brings to six the number of building societies qualifying for trustee status and they represent the vast bulk of the resources of the building society movement.  The inclusion of building societies as trustee authorised investments also emphasised the important function played by these institutions in helping finance the community's housing needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is obliged under the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, to consult with the following persons in regard to the terms of any order he proposes to make to vary the list of investments.  A judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Public Trustee, the Chairman of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee, the President of the Incorporated Law <Col N="1657" /> Society of Ireland and the President of the Stock Exchange&mdash;Irish Unit.  All the statutory requirements in this regard have been complied with.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the additions now proposed to the trustee list are secure and suitable for the investment of trust funds and will improve the range of investment opportunities open to trustees. I therefore commend the motion for approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to this motion.  I know that the four institutions should be added.  This order has been before the House for a number of months now.  About a fortnight ago I inquired why it had not been taken.  I was told it was because of an appeal against a decision regarding one of the institutions. The Government had taken an action against one of the institutions which the Government lost&mdash;I think that is correct&mdash;and they appealed against it. Pending the result of that appeal, even though it had no effect on the status of the society involved, and no effect on the legality of the order if confirmed by the House, it would not be taken in the House.  I want to know from the Minister whether that has been cleared up or whether there has been a change of mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that after some considerable delay this order will now have the approval of the House.  It will broaden the general prospects of the investment of trustee funds and give an opportunity to the three non-associated banks and the additional building society to avail fully of the prospects of further investment.  There may well be some truth about the situation referred to by Deputy Barry although I think it was the reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe it was.  I am not absolutely sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The bank took an action against the Government rather than the Government against the bank.  I doubt that the bank concerned will proceed with the appeal.  The matter under <Col N="1658" /> investigation has been clarified.  I have no doubt this will be a valuable instrument because there is a need to broaden the general prospects of trustee investment funds.  It will help to strengthen the overall usage and availability of trustee funds, and the four institutions concerned.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank should keep a very close eye on the situation.  We now have a large number of such authorised institutions on the trustee list, a total of 28 in all coming on to the list.  That requires a fairly substantial degree of supervision by the Central Bank.  I have no doubt that supervision will be rigorous.  It is absolutely essential that all the criteria should be met, particularly when we have three new non-associated banks and an additional building society coming into the process.  The Labour Party are pleased to support this new order.  I gather it has gone through the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies who have wished me well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to thank the House for its readiness to expedite this matter this morning because, as Deputy Desmond has said, this was approved by the Seanad some time ago.  I should like to <Col N="1659" /> confirm for the benefit of Deputy Clinton that the ACC are on the approved list.  Deputy Desmond expressed understandable concern about whether the Central Bank would keep these matters under review.  The Deputy will be aware from my opening statement that stringent conditions will be applied before the Minister can add any banks or building societies to the list.  I indicated that this has been gone through as required.  Over and above that, the House will be aware that the Minister for Finance at any given time, for reasons which seem to him to be necessary, may vary the lists contained in the order, that is if it seems to him to be desirable, in the interests of the trust funds, to do so.</P>
    <P>On the first point made by Deputy Desmond, that matter has been resolved satisfactorily and I do not think there is any need to go further.  The banks are quite satisfied with the position.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1979. - Vote 43: Industry, Commerce and Energy (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding £13,139,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December 1979, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, including certain services administered by that Office and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid. &mdash;(Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.) </P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had begun to reply to the debate on 6 December when the Dáil adjourned.  I should like specifically to reply to points made by a number of Deputies who had expressed appreciation of the work of some of the bodies for which additional funds are being sought in the Supplementary Estimates. Deputy O'Toole referred to what he called the recent attack on the work of IIRS.  I presume he was referring to some articles which had appeared in the newspapers, reporting on a study published by a US professor stating that the IIRS were failing in their task of aiding Irish industry.</P>
      <P>The first point I should like to make in that respect is that nobody wishes to stifle constructive criticism of the IIRS. When it is valid, such criticism should be made; but there are certain matters in regard to the study which make it difficult to accept the sweeping generalisations in this report.  I do not wish to give that report any status that it does not deserve by discussing it in detail.  Suffice it to say that the research on which the report is based is years out of date.  The study concentrated on a limited range of industries and a limited number of firms. Two big industries in an Irish context were not surveyed, for example, the engineering and construction sectors, in which the IIRS were very active.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IIRS provide a broad range of 66 different services to industry.  If one is in any doubt about the services which they provide he need only look at the IIRS Annual Report in which details of instances <Col N="1661" /> are given where the institute have successfully aided both domestic and foreign industry.  I do not doubt that they will have to continue to extend their services.  They have been doing that in recent years and I will encourage them to go on in that way so that a fuller service can be given to industry.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the impression conveyed by Deputy O'Toole in his references to the recent IIRS Bill, the purpose of that Bill was not to place the institute at a disadvantage in borrowing <i>vis-á-vis</i> other State bodies but rather to give the institute powers to borrow which they do not have at the moment, and a flexibility through this borrowing which they also have not got.  This will enhance the powers of the institute to carry out their functions.  The Bill will strengthen rather than weaken their position.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the availability of credit for small industries.  Deputy O'Toole may not be aware af the global loan facilities which have been negotiated with the European Investment Bank for small manufacturing industries. Since the original loan of £2.5 million was arranged in June 1978 three further loans totalling in all £20 million have been obtained from the bank.  These moneys are lent by the Industrial Credit Company to small manufacturing firms at a fixed rate of interest over a period of up to ten years.  The provision of these very attractive facilities and their rapid rate of take-up are convincing testimony of the Government's concern to ensure that the financing of small manufacturing firms will be secured.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole referred to the difficulties, both domestic and external, which have affected manufacturing industries here.  I am pleased that notwithstanding these difficulties manufacturing industries have performed excellently in 1979.  The March 1979 industrial inquiry report published by the Central Statistics Office shows that manufacturing employment was 8,300 higher than 12 months previously. The associated increase in manufacturing output was a healthy 7 per cent.  This rapid pace of expansion was not alone <Col N="1662" /> maintained but intensified during the June 1979 quarter.  Manufacturing output was 8 per cent higher than in the June 1978 quarter.</P>
    <P>In 1979 the IDA for the first time carried out a mid-year employment survey the result of which indicates that by the end of June employment in manufacturing industry was about 6,600 up on the end of December figure.  I am talking about December 1978.  That increase almost matches the increase shown in the full year, 1978, and must be regarded as extremely encouraging.  This figure of 6,600 is the net increase in manufacturing employment after all redundancies and losses of employment had been taken into account and allowed for.  It is by far the highest figure that we have ever known in the history of the State, not just by a few percentage points or anything of that kind but in terms almost double the best that has been known for a long time, or indeed ever.</P>
    <P>The IDA now expect to exceed by a significant margin their 1979 job approvals target of 30,000 which will make 1979 the best year ever for the promotion of new industrial projects, reflecting the buoyant level of activity in the industrial sector.  Manufactured exports increased by over 25 per cent in value terms during the period January to September 1979.  The position generally, therefore, in relation to manufacturing industry in this current year is extraordinarly good, notwithstanding difficulties which Deputy O'Toole and others pointed out and which are clear for all of us to see.  It is not easy to envisage just how good the position would be if we were not subjected to these difficulties, both external and internal.  There is no point in complaining about the external ones because we can do nothing about them. They do have a major influence. However, there may be some point in making reference to the internal factors which are inhibiting industrial development. Some of them are under our control as a people, and surely enough has been said in recent months to have made it clear to everybody what the dangers <Col N="1663" /> are, but, unhappily for all of us, certain courses of action seem to continue.  If these internal inhibitions on growth, employment creation and so on did not exist we could almost certainly now or in the very near future have full employment here.</P>
    <P>I am beginning to get complaints from industrialists in certain parts of the country about the inability to recruit workers. I would not like it to be thought that that is a general complaint throughout the country as a whole.  Clearly, there are many areas still which need further employment creation and some of them need a good deal of it but there are areas in the country where it is not possible to create any more jobs because there is no one to work in them.</P>

      <P>It is surprising because our official figures for unemployment are still in excess of 80,000, but the experience of some industrialists is that in certain towns it is very difficult to get anybody.  This matter needs careful investigation. In particular I do not want to give foreign industrialists the impression that there is a shortage of labour in this country.  There is not.  I must be careful in what I say to ensure that I do not give that impression.  Nonetheless, I am told that in certain places there is great difficulty in getting people to take up employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> Deputy O'Toole asked for an explanation of the increase from £700,000 to £1,450,000 in subhead J.2.  This subhead is in respect of grants to industries in the Shannon Industrial Estate.  The increase of £750,000 in the original Estimate is the result of a more rapid pace than was anticipated earlier at which industrialisation has taken place on the estate this year.  Most of the additional money represents the payment of grants to new, incoming industries.  The number of new industries coming into Shannon was about double what was estimated last year.  I am glad to say that the quality of the industries which have come in there in the past year is extremely high.  I welcome particularly the investment in three plants at Shannon by Westinghouse which is an especially valuable acquisition for this country. They are indeed one of the most valuable customers we have had in terms of industrial investment in this country and I believe they are committed to five plants here and the possibility of even more is not to be ruled out.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole criticised the inaccuracy in the Estimate for subhead K.2 which relates to export credit finance for capital goods exports.  It is impossible to estimate these things accurately 18 months in advance and in no sense am I critical of anybody for getting it wrong. This figure was underestimated for two reasons.  One is that our exports of capital goods are far higher this year than anybody could have expected last year.  The second is that interest rates are much higher this year than anybody could have expected last year.  Through this Vote the State has to pick up the difference between the AAA lending rate for banks and the preferential concessionary rate of interest at which this money is made available.  The concessionary rate is very attractive.  It varies between 7.5 per cent and 8 per cent and the gap between that and the AAA rate is much bigger this year than could have been anticipated when the Estimate was prepared in the middle of last week.  Also, of course, the rate of exports is very high.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly referred to the alleged <Col N="1665" /> shortcomings of the advice that I get on energy.  In particular he is perturbed about the number of officials in my Department dealing with energy.  As I informed him previously, the number of officials of HEO rank and upwards dealing with energy in my Department on 1 January last was 17.  In the course of a year that figure has been increased by nine which is an increase of 53 per cent.</P>

      <P>The total number of civil servants employed in the sections dealing with energy matters has increased from 35 on 1 January 1979 to 55 at present, an increase of 57 per cent. This is all happening at a time that Mrs. Thatcher is reducing the British civil service by 15 per cent.  Since September last my Department have also had the full-time services in relation to energy matters of a senior technical expert seconded from the IIRS.  Also in that time the Irish National Petroleum Corporation have been established and their achievements to date are well known.  The practical benefits of what they have done can be seen already.  They are in the process of recruiting staff.  I would like to take the opportunity to thank the directors of the company for the work they have done since their formation last July.  Several of them have devoted an enormous proportion of their time to doing the work of that company because full-time employees were not available in the company. It should be acknowledged here that several of the directors have given more than generously of their time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to energy conservation and I have pages of notes as to <Col N="1666" /> what was done this year in regard to that, but I do not propose to go through them because I have already given that information to the House.  There is no saving of money, as I pointed out, in relation to energy conservation; there is simply the transfer of part of the funds from one subhead to the other.  That gave the impression of a saving which is not correct.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly asked for the reasons for the cash flow problems being experienced by National Film Studios of Ireland Limited and Deputy Bruton asked about the introduction of legislation dealing with the development of the film industry in Ireland.  The serious cash flow problems at NFSI are due to unforeseen additional trading losses during 1979 and the necessity to pay pressing outstanding creditors.  A grant of £150,000 to meet administration expenses has already been paid to the company in 1979.  However, this has proved insufficient to cover the company's operating losses due to difficulties in attracting a suitable level of film-making activity.  At the time the 1979 Estimates were originally framed, it was anticipated that the level of film-making business at the studios would have been much greater than, in fact, has turned out to be the case.  This is due, in part, to the lack of financial incentives to encourage film-making in Ireland.  It is hoped that the two film Bills which I introduced in the House on 29 November will go some of the way in rectifying the financial position of the studios in the immediate years ahead.  The Irish Film Board Bill will result in the setting up of a film fund which will encourage an increased level of film-making activities in Ireland.  The National Film Studios of Ireland Limited Bill will give the company a proper share capital structure which will enable the company to liquidate some of its borrowings with consequential changes in interest charges.</P>
    <P>This will give the studios their final chance to prove themselves.  If, after a number of years, they cannot do so and are still losing money very heavily we will have to think again about them.  I am <Col N="1667" /> prepared to give them one final chance but not more than one.  I do not think I would be justified in the public interest in allowing the existing situation to continue indefinitely.  The Committee of Public Accounts has commented very strongly, and unfavourably, on this company, so much so that I had some doubts as to whether I should proceed with the Bill.  I have decided to do so and give the studios one final opportunity.</P>
    <P>The film industry generally of its nature is not one for which a public type State board is necessarily the most suitable.  It is an imaginative, innovative type of business where artists and people of originality get strokes of genius and tend to come to the top rather than people who want a steady 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job with a pension at 60 or 65 years of age.  I see the film board, however, being a long-term operation which will be of considerable importance to the whole question of the film industry here.  That industry is by no means confined to the NFSI at Bray.  One must look at it in much broader terms than simply the physical studios which are located at Bray.  Much of the modern film making can be done without any reference to a studio at all.  Techniques available nowadays are such that the traditional dependence on studios is becoming increasingly less.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asked for an explanation of the size of the saving of £900,000 for industrial housing.  As I explained in my speech, there is no saving; it is paid under another subhead.  The total amount, in fact, has increased to £1.25 million.  That is now spent through the NBA who build the houses at the request of the IDA.  This scheme is only a standby for emergency cases for key workers where they are unable in an area to get housing facilities from any of the more usual sources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It may in some areas. Deputy Bruton asked for a report on the work of the Irish Productivity Centre. Copies of the centre's annual report are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and the centre has informed me that they sent a copy to each Deputy. The centre is an autonomous body established jointly by the FUE and ICTU. Its primary objective is to raise productivity in Irish industry.  To achieve this end the centre caters for firms, particularly the smaller firms, firstly by helping them to become financially stronger and more competitive, and, secondly, by developing more effective human relations at work.  The centre is not in direct competition with private sources because the centre's work is concentrated on smaller firms which cannot afford the services of commercial consultants.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton asked for further details in relation to the saving under shipbuilding subsidies.  The original sum was £500,000 and an interim payment of £350,000 hase been paid in respect of the loss incurred by Verolme Cork Dockyard Limited on the construction of a vessel which was covered under the loss-subsidy scheme for shipbuilding.  It will not be possible to determine the actual final level of subsidy payment due in respect of this vessel until the financial accounts of Verolme Cork Dockyard for 1979 become available next year. Arrangements will be made then to provide for the balance of the subsidy payment out of my Department's Estimate for next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton suggested that there is considerable potential for trade with Hong Kong and on this point I can say that Córas Tráchtála constantly assess markets for Irish exports worldwide.  A country ranking list is prepared annually from this research which is based primarily on market potential and factors including political stability, market size, import propensity, rate of economic growth, origin of imports and degree of economic development.  Since 1973, when Córas Tráchtála opened its Tokyo office, Hong Kong has been serviced <Col N="1669" /> from that office.  In 1973 and 1975 trade missions visited the market and over the entire period Córas Tráchtála's Tokyo office introduced individual companies to the Hong Kong market.</P>
    <P>While Hong Kong, indeed, is a great trade centre it has not proved the most important Asian market for Irish exporters. It has been a difficult market for Irish consumer exporters because of market requirements, competition from other Asian countries and, if dealing at the top end of the consumer market, the need for an internationally known brand name.  Because of Hong Kong's relatively small population, other Asian markets such as South Korea are currently showing more promise for Ireland's producers of industrial goods. South Korea was recently the target for a successful Irish trade mission.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála will shortly open an office in China and the potential of other areas such as Hong Kong is constantly under review.  This market was visited earlier this year by the chairman and the chief executive of Córas Tráchtála.  In view of Córas Tráchtála's increased concentration on the South East Asian region the organisation will be researching further the most appropriate form of representation in the area.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell spoke of the IDA allegedly creating difficulties in the way of small firms getting grants.  I would point out that the IDA has recently simplified very much the application form for assistance under the Small Industries Programme.  A number of other measures are being taken to accelerate job approvals under this programme. The upper limit on fixed assets for qualification under the programme has recently been increased from £300,000 to £400,000 and there is an extensive programme of construction under way of advance factory units for small firms. There is every expectation that the IDA's ambitious job approvals target for small industries of 6,000 will be exceeded by about one-third.  Of course, in the mid-western region SFADCo's efforts over the past 18 months in regard to small industries has been especially successful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1670" /> I have endeavoured to reply as fully as possible to the points raised in the debate and I conclude by again thanking Deputies for their interest in, and understanding of, the role and functions of my Department and its affiliated bodies and their comments in relation to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £269,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December 1979, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of certain services administered by that Office, including certain grants-in-aid. </P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate is required to meet additional expenditure arising on three existing subheads in the Vote&mdash;for salaries, travel and incidental expenses and for the grant-in-aid for cultural relations with other countries.  The amount sought under these three subheads is partly offset by an anticipated increase in receipts under appropriations-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The increase required for the salaries subhead arises from the award of special salary increases to the civil service generally and from the national understanding for which no provision was made when the Estimate was being prepared last year.  The anticipated excess of £31,000 on the subhead for travel and incidental expenses is due to the increased costs of the services provided for in this subhead because of our Presidency of the European Communities. This increase is very marginal and represents only a slight additional provision over the original Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> The additional £60,000 proposed for the grant-in-aid for cultural relations is required to enable a contribution of that amount to be made to finance a festival of the Arts of Ireland which is to take place in London in February and March next year.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Sense of Ireland&rdquo;, as this festival is called, is one of the best possible ways of showing aspects of the arts and culture of this country, north and south, which seldom get headlines.  It will comprise the largest number of Irish artistic events ever held simultaneously outside of Ireland&mdash;over 90 exhibitions, performances of classical, traditional and modern music, theatre, ballet, readings by Irish writers, showings of Irish films, lectures and seminars with participants from both the Republic and Northern Ireland, at over 40 London venues.  It is estimated that it will cost about £290,000.  The Government enthusiastically endorse the festival, which we see as having a very special importance for Anglo-Irish relations as a whole.  We therefore propose to make a direct contribution of £110,000 towards the costs. Additional assistance is being given by semi-State bodies.  The Arts Council of Northern Ireland and other bodies as well as individuals in the North are also co-operating fully in the arrangements. The organisers are actively seeking support from potential private and commercial sponsors in both Ireland and Britain and I understand that this amounts to about £60,000 at present.</P>
    <P>Since most of the private sponsorship will not materialise until next year the continuation of the practical arrangements for the festival&mdash;for example, reservation of venues, preparation of publicity material and catalogues&mdash;requires funding from the Exchequer and it is estimated that £60,000 will be required by the end of this year.  The balance of the official contribution will be included in the Estimate for 1980.</P>
    <P>The additional sum required for the three expenditure subheads already referred to will be offset to the extent of £100,000 because of additional receipts <Col N="1672" /> arising from consular services, mainly passport fees.  It is not possible to forecast with any great accuracy the demand for passports but on the basis of passport issues so far this year it appears that the receipts have been underestimated to the extent of £100,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a provision here for an increase in the amount for salaries.  It should be noted that this is common to all Supplementary Estimates. Approximately 80 per cent of the expenditure of the Department of Foreign Affairs is represented by salaries.  Since the Government came into office the amount provided by the Exchequer for salaries in the Department of Foreign Affairs has increased by about 47 per cent, that is 11 per cent faster than the rate of increase in the GNP in the same period.  Staff salaries in the Department of Foreign Affairs, as in every other aspect of Government activity, must be paid for out of the GNP. If there is a rate of increase in staff costs in excess of the GNP this is a long run trend which cannot be sustained.</P>
      <P>The situation in the Department of Foreign Affairs is by no means the worst.  There are other Departments where the increase in staff costs has exceeded the rate of increase in GNP by a far greater amount.  I believe that any excess must be a cause for concern because it is an indication that as far as staff costs are concerned we are tending to live more beyond our means than we were.  This is at a time when the Government had their declared objective of a reduction in the reliance by the State on borrowing.  The increase in staff costs in excess of the GNP should, therefore, be noted.  It should also be noted on this occasion that the original Estimate at the beginning of the year has proved to be insufficient and more money has had to be sought for staff costs this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs to a very great degree is to do with personal and human relations and that staff is of the essence in foreign affairs activities.  I would like to pay a tribute to the work of <Col N="1673" /> our diplomatic representatives abroad.  I have had many occasions in different parts of the world to come into contact with the officials who represent this country often in difficult and unseasonable climates.  They do this with great integrity and intelligence and nothing I have said in relation to the general issue of staff costs should be interpreted as any reflection on the officials, for whom I have the greatest regard.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the provision relating to cultural relations with other countries.  I have one point of view, which may appear to be a small one, but it is one which I believe in very strongly and which I put to the Minister on a previous occasion.  I take this occasion also to ask if his successor will consider the promotion of cultural relations between this country and the province of Newfoundland in Canada?  I am sure that Deputy Deasy is aware that Newfoundland has the closest ethnic relations with Ireland of any part of the world and that even includes the parts of Britain which have a very large Irish population.  There are parts of Newfoundland which I have visited which are wholly Irish.  Even though the ancestors of those people went to Newfoundland before the Act of Union they still have a mode of speech which is recognisably Irish.  They have preserved many aspects of Irish culture which we have lost here. One can still find in Newfoundland the house parties where people sing, tell stories and so forth, a practice which was common here 100 years ago but is not, for various reasons, common here now.  This is a direct descent from the traditions which those people's ancestors left behind in Ireland in the latter part of the eighteenth century.  There is a very rich area of fruitful cultural co-operation between Ireland and that part of Canada.  I realise that it is not possible for our Government to deal directly with the provincial government of Newfoundland because that government is not a sovereign one and they must deal through the Canadian Government in Ottawa.</P>
    <P>More than 18 months ago, I raised <Col N="1674" /> this matter and at that time the Minister indicated his sympathy with the general idea.  Could he now give the House some report about what has happened in the meantime since he gave these favourable indications of interest in the matter? Could the Minister also give an indication of his plans in relation to the negotiations for further cultural agreements? There is a cultural agreement with France which has been in being for a long time and cultural agreements with practically all the countries of the EEC are in process of negotiation.  Cultural agreements are a valuable asset for any country in promoting understanding.  My only worry is that if we engage in too many cultural agreements a dilution of effect will occur if the funds are not increased to a sufficient degree.  I note that there are some increases provided here but if we move from having, for instance, as has been the case until very recently, only one cultural agreement, namely, with France&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's brief is the Minister's brief and has no more status than has my speech.  The determinate of relevance is what appears in the Estimate document.  There is nothing in that which constrains the debate and, with respect, I am entitled to speak about matter germane to what is in the Estimate document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we seek to have, say, six, seven or ten cultural agreements and increase the funds only twice, obviously the amount available for the individual agreements will be less than that available for the first agreement with France, which was provided with a certain amount of <Col N="1675" /> money.  There will also be a dilution of effect in that the cultural agreements and the links with particular countries will not be felt as strongly as they have been in the past.  In my limited experience of the matter cultural agreements with other countries tend to reach only a certain section of the community, namely, the well-educated, they are the people who tend to benefit.  Most of the money is spent in personnel exchange which, because of the qualifications required to participate is confined to the well-educated. Education is a privilege and should one add privilege to privilege?</P>
    <P>There should be far greater emphasis in cultural exchange on the area of sport. Sport is open to everyone.  It is a cultural activity which is not confined to people who have a particular educational qualification.  When I speak of sporting exchange, I am not talking of exchange of people of international standard.  I am thinking, for instance, of the exchange of young athletes, or young people who may not necessarily have a high level of sporting competence but represent a particular part, say, of the city of Dublin which is not as well-endowed financially as are other parts of the city.  Cultural moneys should be used to provide exchanges between, perhaps, youngsters from the north centre city area of Dublin&mdash;teams of young football players benefiting from cultural agreements, in being allowed to travel to play in games with other people in other parts of Europe.  In terms of social justice and in regard to the overall objects of a cultural agreement, which is to promote understanding, the returns there would be as great as, if not greater, than those which might obtain from providing a university professor with an opportunity of spending a year away from his students in some polite discussion in a foreign language with colleagues in another university. The multiplier effect there would not, in my view, be any greater, and would perhaps be less great, than the multiplier effect from sending a football team from Seán MacDermott Street to play in Paris for a few days and return <Col N="1676" /> home.  I sincerely believe that that would be a better use of the money in many cases.  This aspect has been neglected in the past.</P>
    <P>Regarding the cultural agreement with France, I sought to promote exchange in sport in a small way, while I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education.  I did not get as far as I should have liked, for a variety of reasons&mdash;not all of which were other people's faults.  However, I made some progress.  I set up structures to form a special committee to devise the particular projects for sporting exchange within the country of the agreement.  I should like to know what has happened in that respect, and, also, if such exchange arrangements will be made in respect of the new cultural agreements which are being entered into.</P>
    <P>In relation to subhead I, in which there has been an increase in the appropriation-in-aid for passports, what progress, if any, has been made, in relation to the idea of a European passport? When the Minister came to office in 1977 I understand that there were proposals then in being for having a European passport which would enable people to move throughout Europe and be represented on a European basis.  This passport would be particularly beneficial in the light of the entry into the Community of two of the countries to which most Irish people go on holidays, namely, Spain and Greece.  Passports for entry and any provisions which would reduce the formalities involved in our people going on holidays should be negotiated.</P>
    <P>I regret that there is no provision in this Supplementary Estimate for additional relief to Kampuchea.  We are all aware of the very serious situation there and a separate subhead should be set up in the Estimate for that purpose.  I would also like if the Minister would give some indication of his long term plans for the admission of more Vietnamese refugees.</P>

I would like to know something about the provision of diplomatic representation in China.  I understand that our embassy there is operating from an hotel room, and that is not satisfactory.  I understand that the Chinese authorities were anxious that we established our embassy there, that when the people arrived they had to operate from an hotel room and are still doing so.  Has the Minister made any representations to the authorities there to improve that situation?  I would also like to know if there are plans for the opening of a Chinese Embassy here?  In relation to our representation in eastern bloc countries, I have expressed concern about sentences meted out for religious activities to people in Rumania and Czechoslovakia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is quite familiar with the Labour Party's Foreign Affairs matters on the general range of policy, so I propose to confine myself as tightly as possible to the Supplementary Estimate.  The items which focus certain attention on the activities of this House this morning relate to the extra moneys required for the grant in aid for cultural relations.  I must declare some kind of personal interest since the firm in which I am a partner will participate in the exhibition in London next year, which we regard as a major event.  I am pleased that the Government have responded in this way.</P>
      <P>I recently had contact with Irish people from Britain, from every sphere of life, and the stories they told of the new level of prejudice and discrimination against Irish people in Britain are, to say the least, disturbing.  Any effort or undertaking by this State to remedy the situation will be welcomed.  In an article written by Donal MacAmhlaigh in last Saturday's <i>Irish Times</i> about being Irish in Britain there is evident a disturbing breakdown in the relationship and the regard that the British people have for Irish people, to the extent that some people have left Britain as they no longer feel welcome because of recent events in this land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of this has been fostered and certainly was not discouraged by responsible authorities in the UK.  I hope that within the confines of diplomacy the <Col N="1679" /> Department of Foreign Affairs, having regard to the workings of diplomacy, will recognise that this is a growing problem. Irish people in Britain are made to feel decidedly uncomfortable just because they are Irish, even those who have been there for many years.  The deterioration in traditional interpersonal relationships of this kind is extremely disturbing.  The &ldquo;paddy&rdquo; joke is no longer a joke; it is denigration of an entire nation of people, North and South.  Perhaps Deputy Harte with his unique insight into Northern Ireland, may be able to add a dimension of this phenomenon.</P>
    <P>This disturbs the Labour Party because it attacks one of the fundamental principles of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, which is a respect for the intrinsic dignity of individuals, of nations and of cultures.  The last part of the last century saw an outburst of Punch-type anti-Irish cartoons with all their grotesque symbolic imagry.  I am not exaggerating when I say there is an element, albeit a more sophisticated element, of such a prejudice creeping back into Anglo-Irish relations.  I regret to have to say, because I have many personal and family connections with citizens of the UK, that I am directly aware, personally and politically, of a deterioration in our relationship.</P>
    <P>There are far too many Irish people living in Britain with regular contact with Ireland who for reasons of choice, but originally for reasons of necessity, sought economic refuge in Britain because of our failure to provide them with a living here.  We have an obligation to rectify the position to the extent that we can counteract some of the very negative and highly racist anti-Irish imagry that is being allowed to be portrayed in the British media.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party always welcome expenditure on cultural relations because it is one way in which knowledge of each other can be fostered and developed.  The Sense of Ireland Exhibition will be a major festival, unprecedented in the scale of its undertaking, initiated largely by voluntary effort outside the State and <Col N="1680" /> semi-State sector.  But, to give credit to the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, he responded to it quite generously.  I hope that in allocating this sum of money due regard will be had to the need for positive advance publicity and that the whole area of public relations will be professionally developed to counteract some of the negative publicity that is forcing decent Irish families out of areas and districts of Britain because of the constant anti-Irish feeling that regrettably has surfaced in the British media.</P>
    <P>We all know some of the reasons for that anti-Irish feeling and they are deplored by all sides of this House.  The effects are suffered by people in Britain who regard themselves as Irish.  If this exhibition does anything, it should reaffirm their faith and confidence in this country and themselves.  More important, it should aim at reducing some of the ignorance and lack of understanding that exists in too many British quarters.</P>
    <P>The Irish people in Britain are not the only cultural group who suffer from a certain degree of discrimination but if the same degree of harassment and discrimination was expressed to people from the Indian sub-continent, from Jamaica or the West Indies generally, there would be an outcry because of the anti-social and socially divisive impact of such outbursts.</P>
    <P>The Sense of Ireland Exhibition is a positive step.  I hope it will not be confined to the Irish community in Britain but that extra special efforts will be made to reach other members of the British community so that they will get a sense of modern Ireland and have their distortions and prejudices of an Ireland that is thankfully long since gone replaced by an image of a modern and sensitive State that is attempting to cope with the 20th century with energy, enthusiasm and self-confidence, qualities which appear to be sadly lacking in Britain.  On that subhead the Labour Party welcome this expenditure but question whether it is adequate. We hope sufficient funds will be made available in the areas of advance publicity and in public relations generally to meet the objectives to which I referred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1681" /> On the question of cultural relations generally reference was made to bilateral cultural arrangements with member states of the EEC.  Some agreements have recently been confirmed by the Department, in addition to the long standing agreement we had with the Republic of France.  This is not the time or the place for the Minister to attempt reply because it is to early for any kind of assessment.  With the new Fianna Fáil administration, I hope clarification will be made at an early date between what I regard as the split responsibilities for culture within the present administration and structure, between the Department of the Taoiseach and the Arts Council and the Cultural Relations Committee of Foreign Affairs.  The more cultural relations agreements we have the more pressure will  on those responsible for their administration.  A very clear line of communication should be established and this House should be reported to regularly on the progress of these agreements, an assessment of how effective they are in achieving the diplomatic objectives set for such agreements and attempting to ensure that the mutual bilateral contact that should flow from these agreements will filter its way across the Community and encourage such things as the twinning of cities with realistic funds, the visitation of groups from one city to another, of a cultural or sporting group with another or from one region of a country to a parallel region in another country.  Since the Minister was involved in his former capacity in finalising some of these agreements he might report to the House on the procedures for assessment on the effectiveness of these agreements.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are concerned about salaries and staff relations generally.  We want to ensure that the personnel requirements for both our diplomats and their families are adequately measured and sympathetically responded to.  There has been a rapid increase in the number of diplomatic missions abroad.  Some diplomats were forced to live and operate out of an hotel room, and sometimes out of a suitcase. Regrettably our capacity to respond <Col N="1682" /> through the Office of Public Works is not as quick as this House would like. We suffer from the same lack of quick response in this building.  We at least have alternatives but for a diplomat who is forced to live in an hotel&mdash;as has happened in Greece who was forced to operate from the Hilton Hotel for just under one year&mdash;it is not a satisfactory arrangement.  Some of the delays are understandable because they may be outside the control of the people directly involved but the end result is that they are counterproductive to our diplomatic efforts overseas.</P>
    <P>The standard of accommodation for new missions in countries with whose culture we are not familiar, where only a few of our diplomats know the local language and where their families would find it difficult to operate and function reasonably normally, should be very high and extra attention should be given to these matters by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This is a growing problem and it will not get any easier.  In all probability it is likely to get worse.</P>
    <P>The pressures on modern families, in terms of husband and wife relationships and relationships between parents and children, are different from those that existed ten or 15 years ago.  This is a reality we must all recognise.  This is a reality that we, as politicians with unsocial working hours, recognise in our own personal lives and it is no different for diplomats stationed in countries which are not easily understood in cultural terms.</P>
    <P>For people who have been stationed abroad and who return there should be more understanding of the pressures they have undergone.  The Department of Foreign Affairs should be able to respond with the degree of autonomy they have not yet obtained from the Department of the Public Service.  Conditions of civil servants in the Department of Foreign Affairs are different from every other Department.  The present Minister for Finance with his insight into those pressures will be in a position to respond and say that the problems and working <Col N="1683" /> conditions of diplomats are <i>sui generis</i> compared to those of other civil servants. Potential claims for relatively and comparability will not and should not arise and the hand of the Department of Foreign Affairs should be free in responding to the problems, pressures and difficulties that have, and will arise.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody in this House would disagree with that response because our diplomats are Ireland overseas. We owe it to those people and their families to get them the best possible conditions to ensure that the task which they were sent out to do can be done without disruption of their family lives and their own sense of who they are and their well-being.</P>
    <P>This is a comparatively small Supplementary Estimate in addition to the major Estimate we have already discussed. Perhaps the Minister for Finance who is here on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be able to respond to the points I have made if such information is available to him or will make provision in future for clarification of the points I raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Estimate, narrow thought it may be.  I listened with interest to the contributions of Deputies Bruton and Quinn.  In view of the restrictions those contributions were intelligent, articulate and to the point.  The Minister's statement dealt largely with cultural activities in respect of Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Anything that improves such relationships is to be lauded.  It is important that the different cultures on this island be moulded together in the best way possible.  Far too often, we are told that one of the barriers to reunification is the fact that there are two cultures, one for the Protestant majority in the North and some in the South, and the Gaelic culture of the Catholic population, north and south.  The moulding of the two cultures is a prerequisite to unity by peaceful means.  In a recent debate I advocated a practical line which would go a long way towards achieving that.  We can hardly expect one side to understand the other side's culture if they do not have first-hand knowledge of what the other group are doing.  I put to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that we should make an effort to ensure that everyone in the Six Counties had our television and radio services available to him.  Surely they are the best methods for propagating our ideas and culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Estimate the Minister talks about spending £60,000 for cultural relationships with Britain and £290,000 for setting up festivals or exhibitions of different cultural activities such as classical, traditional and modern music, ballet and readings by Irish writers.  The message could be got across more effectively and to a greater audience if the exhibitions were televised and broadcast not just to a few dozen but to hundreds of thousands of people.  Deputy Bruton rightly pointed out that the unfortunate thing about such exhibitions and festivals is that they are patronised by very few people.  Those involved are <Col N="1685" /> usually highly intelligent who already have a good standard of education.  We would like if these could be made common to the masses so that not just elite groups would benefit under these schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister should state if he holds out any hope for reciprocal arrangements whereby broadcasts, both radio and television, are beamed from here into the North and <i>vice versa.</i>  The northern counties can receive our programmes but the reverse is not true. The Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs gave a statistic which surprised me in relation to the number of people in the Six Counties who can receive our radio and television services.  It was only 15 per cent.  He should enter into negotiations with his counterpart in Britain to see if such an arrangement would be allowed.  I know it has been allowed in the past with regard to sporting fixtures.  The all-Ireland hurling and football finals are normally televised in Northern Ireland and on certain channels in Britain.</P>
    <P>Much play is made of cross-Border co-operation and a figure is mentioned for it in the Estimate.  I do not know how effective it is at present.  We have it in certain fields such as security but not in any other fields.  It may have been carried on in a certain way in other spheres prior to the present troubles but seemingly a lot of trade relationships and the energy link-up between the North and South have ceased since the troubles started.</P>
    <P>There is an area under the heading of culture that the Minister should explore. It could be very productive.  It would appeal to the masses and not just the few. It is in the field of sport.  We are all very anxious to see that the country is proud of its sporting activities.  I know moves have been made to set up a joint all-Ireland soccer team.  This type of cultural co-operation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When we were discussing the Arts Bill in this House we were allowed to discuss sports under that heading.  I suggest that the Minister might, with his counterpart in Northern Ireland or in Britain, consider making available whatever finances are <Col N="1687" /> necessary because I understand and believe that part of the problem in this regard is financial and he might smooth the path in that direction.  I wonder if he has ever discussed the matter with his counterpart.  Perhaps he would ask his successor, Deputy Lenihan, to do so because it would be an effective cross-Border exercise in co-operation.</P>
      <P>Politicians here are good at making use of sport whether they come up through the ranks of politics through the medium of sport or whether it is merely getting their faces in the picture on All-Ireland day.  But we should use our status to promote that type of national effort.  It would be greatly appreciated not by the elitists, the arty types, but by the public at large.</P>
      <P>In this Estimate allowance is made for salaries, wages and allowances for the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and for the staff of our embassies and for our diplomats.  I would hope that they will continue, under the recent changes, to operate at the same level of efficiency.  We have a wonderful diplomatic service and I would like to see it continue with the same good work and with the same good graces.  I was disturbed to read in recent days that as a result of changes in Government here there may be changes abroad, particularly in the United States.  It would be a retrograde step if people were demoted because they backed the policy of the previous Fianna Fáil Cabinet or the policies of the National Coalition Government.  That would really be counter-productive.  I would ask the existing Minister to ensure that no such purges take place in the diplomatic service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made here to the treatment of the Irish community in Britain.  I join with Deputy Quinn in deploring that type of racial discrimination, if it can be called racial discrimination. It is a discrimination of a type which has been steadily growing against the Irish community in Britain in recent years.  The Government have a duty to protest to the British Government at the <Col N="1688" /> manner in which a certain section of the media in Britain, what we commonly refer to as the gutter press, seem to delight in making a laughing stock of the Irish community in Britain as a way of kicking back at the failures of their policies in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There has always been this prejudice by a certain section in Britain but attempts are being made in recent years to broaden this discrimination.  There is legislation in Britain which is intended to stop this sort of thing.  There was a racial discrimination Act brought in some years ago.  Our Government should point out that they will not tolerate any such evil doings.  The legislation in question was brought in to stop abuse of the coloured people who had come into the country over the past 30 years but that very same type of prejudice which operated against the coloured community is now, in many ways, being directed against the Irish community in Britain and the Government has a duty to see that the legislation is implemented to stop that type of abuse.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to delay the House and I will be very brief in my contribution. First of all, I would like to avail of this opportunity to praise the Arts Council for the kind of work they are doing in both parts of Ireland.  I do not believe there is any other group of people who are so dedicated and so attuned to the relationship between North and South and who work with so much devotion to bring the cultures of Ireland to a proper level and to exclude, in a very proper, generous and sympathetic way, the narrow, bigoted definitions of certain cultures which are masqueraded and paraded as being Irish cultures when they are really the cultures of a section of the Irish people; there lies a story of wrong identification by political parties in this House and by people, no doubt well-intentioned, who are equally devoted and equally committed to the promotion of their ideas of what Ireland is.  Very often in fact I have committed the sin myself.  But far too often people in very high places wrongly identify what is Gaelic culture and what is Irish culture. <Col N="1689" /> If we extend that definition we can very well see that those people who promote Gaelic culture for the very best reasons exclude one quarter of the Irish nation. While their basic reason is to unite Ireland in fact what they are doing is dividing it.  They are ignoring the cultures and traditions of a quarter of the Irish people thereby causing a political vacuum where one in every three in Ireland is locked in the political section of the North which causes friction between the different peoples of Ireland. The results have been too tragic for me to recount.  They are too well known and too often repeated in the newspapers.</P>
      <P>What I am saying is that the Arts Council are trying to elevate political thinking on the different traditions of this island to a level which is acceptable to all Irish people.  I take this opportunity to congratulate them.  It is about time that the present Government, starting off with a very fiery baptism a couple of days ago, realised that Northern Ireland should not be treated under Foreign Affairs. Surely it is a contradiction to say we seek the unity of Ireland and in our Constitution claim the territory of Northern Ireland and at the same time deal with it under the head of Foreign Affairs.  I know the outgoing Minister for Foreign Affairs has made a very good contribution during his term of office and perhaps he has been sensitive to this as well.  I hope he will whisper in the ear of the incoming Minister or the ear of the Taoiseach that it would be desirable to have a special section in Foreign Affairs exclusively for North-South relations or have it dealt with by the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies mentioned cultural relations between this country and other countries.  I am not terribly interested in cultural relations between here and France.  Really it is only the well-heeled, fur-coated brigade who get to know each other.  While that is important in itself, it does not interest me.  What does interest me was touched on by Deputy Deasy and Deputy Quinn, that is, the cultural relationship between Britain and Ireland, and I mean Ireland in the broadest sense, <Col N="1690" /> but very particularly this part of Ireland. This relationship should be promoted on all occasions.</P>
    <P>We have so much in common with the people of England, Scotland and Wales that public representatives should always try to lead in the right direction.  I have made the point over the past nine or ten years that we have many things in common with the English, the Scots and the Welsh.  If we keep talking about what we have in common, we will get away from the narrow arguments which separate us on this island.  There is an anti-British feeling that we should oppose everything that is British.</P>
    <P>When you ask somebody: &ldquo;Who are the British?, do you object to the Scots, the Welsh or the English?&rdquo;, they do not know what to reply.  The abstraction of being anti-British is popular.  If you ask people what does &ldquo;republican&rdquo; mean, they cannot tell you because there are so many versions of it.  I welcome every effort by any government to get away from that attitude.  If this party are returned to government after the next election, I will continue to work for a good relationship between North and South. That cannot be achieved unless we look at the broad picture.</P>
    <P>There are people on this island who want a British relationship and a British identity.  Some of them say they want to be British, just as some people in this part of the island say they want to be Gaelic or republican.  If you ask people why they want to be British or why they want to be republican they scratch their heads and cannot tell you.  If you ask them do they want to be Irish they say yes.  We can identify with each other if we broaden our views.</P>
    <P>Many Irish people have gone to Britain, married and settled down in different parts of England, Scotland and Wales.  At this moment there are offspring of Irish people from the west who feel British, Scottish or Welsh.  They are proud of the fact that their parents or their grandparents came from Ireland. But they are now English just as the offspring of the Ulster Scots who came to Ireland 300 years ago are Irish.  We <Col N="1691" /> must keep that point very much to the fore.</P>
    <P>I have heard some criticism of the way in which the Irish community are treated in Britain.  I cannot accept that. Some people do not see the picture clearly.  The way the English, the Scots and the Welsh have accepted the Irish community in Britain is a tribute to their tolerance.  We must appreciate that.  Let us reverse the coin.  If the English, the Scots or the Welsh were shooting our soldiers, shooting our sons, or brothers, or cousins, or fathers, I wonder how many English people would be allowed to live in Ireland.  I know I am broadening the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is part of the question of culture.  There have been wrongs between the two countries.  It is now openly admitted by the British Government and their representatives that they have sinned against us, but they have not affected directly any Member of this House or many Irish people living on this island.  They may have hurt our ancestors but, if they are prepared to confess publicly, it is time that we were prepared to forgive publicly and get down to living together.</P>
      <P>I should like the cultural relationships about which the Minister spoke to be broadened to such an extent that we would start to communicate with England, Scotland and Wales.  We should spend more money on cultural relations between North and South.  I hope the culture which is often trotted out as being Irish culture will be seen quite clearly as being Gaelic culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should note the multiracial attitude of the English, Scots and Welsh people and the way they deal with British Asians and British Africans. They have shown tolerance in the way they have allowed the integration of coloured people into their community. Admittedly there are those on the right <Col N="1692" /> who are not helping.  By and large, human rights in Britain have developed much faster than they have in this little island where we think we have a very high standard of civilisation.  I do not want to develop that point too far because we are now coming to the end of the business of the week.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest threats to the Irish community in Britain is not a threat from the British, Scots or the Welsh but from the IRA in Northern Ireland shooting their soldiers.</P>

      <P>There have been calls for the withdrawal of our Ambassador from the USA.  I know the Minister has a personal relationship with that Ambassador.  No organisation, for whatever reason they operate, should take it on themselves to speak for this Parliament in any foreign country.  Fred O'Brien, Father McManus and Rita Kelly may be acting for good reasons and may think they are doing what is right, but they are a voluntary organisation who do not represent the views of this Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The views of this Parliament must always be expressed by the ambassador who represents us.  I have a personal regard for Ambassador Donlon and I have a personal relationship with him. During the term of office of the Coalition Government he worked very hard.  I mention that period because it is the period with which I am familiar.  He worked before we came into office and he worked equally well after we left office. He is a dedicated person who articulates the views of whatever party are in office.  I doubt that there is any civil servant&mdash;and I say this with the greatest <Col N="1693" /> respect to all civil servants working in the Department of Foreign Affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputies for their contributions.  As you pointed out, Sir, and as the House realises, the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate is limited.  It deals particularly with increases in salaries on foot of the national understanding. It also involves increased costs due to our EEC Presidency, travelling and other expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of salaries generally, Deputy Bruton seemed to have the impression that there has been a very considerable increase in respect of salaries. <Col N="1695" /> In this Supplementary Estimate the increase is in the order of 3.5 per cent, which is reasonable in view of the extent of the activities of this Department in this year.  I should like to say that the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, on whose behalf I have moved this Supplementary Estimate, is privileged to have the level of staff ability, commitment and dedication that I have had during my period in that Department.  That applies to all serving officers in the Department here and abroad.  Despite the great expansion in the activities of the Department, which will be continuing in the interests of promoting externally our national interest, there has been but limited expansion of personnel. During our EEC Presidency period right up to now instead of recruiting extra people, we have been bringing people from one embassy to other embassies where the pressure was on, and those who were left in embassies from which others had been taken simply increased their workload, working extra hours beyond the call of duty.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to all the staffs of Foreign Affairs&mdash;of course this applies to other Departments as well&mdash;for the manner in which they have taken on the extra work burden during the EEC Presidency period.  Were it not for this dedication and hard work, the amount I am seeking today would be considerably more than the actual increase of 3.5 per cent.  Therefore, I should like to join with the Deputies opposite in paying tribute to the officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs at home and abroad.  I acknowledge the major contribution they are making towards the promotion of Irish interests abroad.</P>
    <P>Last year, personnel expansion was very limited having regard to our widespread activities in the EEC, in our embassies and in new developments.  It is one of the matters I look back on with considerable satisfaction&mdash;the new areas we have launched out into in our embassies.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a point raised by <Col N="1696" /> Deputies in regard to accommodation in new embassies, particularly China. There is nothing unusual about our representatives in Peking living in a hotel.  This is a pattern not only in Peking but in other places.  However, in particular reference to Peking, a number of missions there are in the same position. Accommodation has to be made available in areas which one might refer to as embassy centres, and we have no peculiar cause for complaint in that respect.  It is a matter for the Chinese authorities to designate the appropriate accommodation.  In the meantime, that is a matter for negotiation, and so far we have got every co-operation from the Chinese authorities.  A number of other countries who recently opened relations with China are in the same position.  I do not anticipate any great delay.  I repeat that this has not happened in Peking only.  It has happened in several countries when new missions were opened.  It seems to be assumed that as soon as we open a new mission we can immediately walk into a new embassy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that but I do not think there is any reason for concern in this respect.</P>
      <P>On the cultural aspect generally I endorse everything that the Deputies, particularly Deputy Harte, have said in relation to our understanding of culture and the cultural mix between North and South.  Deputy Harte, with his awareness of what makes the cultural mainstream, has always been sensitive to this and has expressed a broad opinion that many people could adopt to the great advantage of both North-South and British-Irish relations generally.  This festival is being launched to promote a sense of all of Ireland and not any part of Ireland and will represent all these elements of North and South, on an unprecedented scale.  For that reason the Government have been very anxious from the start to indicate their support by making this money available this year with further moneys to follow next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ways it is a joint promotion.  I am not saying that we can pay them directly, but one thing that has been most welcome in recent times has been the joint liaison between the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and our own Arts Council.  When they are involved in joint promotions to take place here we each make our appropriate contribution. The presentation and preparation of this, raised by Deputy Quinn, is being undertaken on the most professional basis to ensure that it will be beamed out not just to England but to all parts of Ireland and beyond Ireland as well.  This will bring to the people of Britain generally, whether they be of Scottish, Celtic, Welsh, Cornish or Anglo-Saxon extraction, another, more enlightened sense of Ireland and of all parts of Ireland.  For that reason the Government have been very happy to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were some questions generally on cultural relations and I want to mention one general point.  The agreements that we have entered into are the original ones with Norway and France.  We have now entered into agreements with Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece and Spain and are in the process of concluding one with the Federal Republic of Germany.  I am sure that the officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs will take note of the points that have been made&mdash;it is not my function now to reply to them&mdash;in respect of the definition of &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; and the areas in which it might operate.  I am very much in sympathy with much that has been said but I say to Deputy Bruton in particular that this is not confined to the fur-coat brigade.  We have a very narrow definition and the Cultural Relations Committee <Col N="1698" /> do not have that narrow preception of culture.  In all these agreements to reach out the cross-section of the people of Ireland to the cross-section of the people of Britain or France as the case may be, the cross-section themselves might be immediately aware of what makes the obligation and the challenge all the more important.  It is not confined to, say, conferring further privilege on those who already are privileged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of exchanges of even primary school level courses of that nature are being promoted through language programmes and cultural visits, and these are not confined to the element about whom we are talking.  I cannot go into all the details. This is very much a matter for the particular agreement and the implementation of it.  From the knowledge that I have, not only of our embassies abroad but of their embassies here, those countries and their ambassadors and staff are very conscious of the need to reach right out through all elements of the Irish people. I am referring particularly to Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece and Spain in addition to those that are already there.  This cannot be achieved overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be able to see examples in practice when these agreements get under way.  I want to signpost what will be a major development in our culture over the next year or two, and I am glad to have this opportunity in what in a sense is my swan song.  During my last visit to the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers I had discussions with the Director of Cultural Activities, and I think we can look forward within a year or two to seeing the Council of Europe sponsoring Ireland's contribution to Europe, particularly during the high point of our <Col N="1699" /> cultural contribution to Europe, as being the theme of the Council of Europe at that time.  This will be a major opportunity for us in Ireland to present ourselves and our deep cultural inheritance and to show what it has contributed to Europe.  It will be done, not by taking our treasures out of Ireland, but rather by promoting in Ireland, where they belong, to the rest of Europe and the rest of the world these beautiful treasures which are part of our inheritance, North and South.  My successor will pay particular attention to this because it will be one of the most dramatic and effective contributions we can make to cultural relations and the presentation of Irish culture.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with one or two final matters within the limitations which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has mentioned. There have been some references by Deputy Harte criticising generally the attitude in Britain towards Irish people.  I hope the House will understand me when I say this.  This cultural programme will do a lot to ensure that those criticisms will not be seen to be true.  There are prejudices in England as there are elsewhere and there are certain prejudices in the English press just as there are in the press here.  I want to ask a question which perhaps is rhetorical but which is worth asking.  For instance, if yesterday, or more particularly the previous day, some British media gave some prominence to certain of the things that were said in this House, to whom do we complain?  Is it to the British media?  I do not think so.  I will leave it at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £14,907,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December 1979, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid. </P>
      <P>The main Estimate for Agriculture for 1979, amounting to £132,815,000, was passed on 17 July.  This Supplementary Estimate brings the total net provision for the year to £147,722,000.</P>
      <P>I should now like to refer briefly to some of the main items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subhead A.1 provision is made <Col N="1703" /> for a further £3.2 million to meet the cost of the relevant pay elements of the 1979 national understanding for economic and social development, as well as some other miscellaneous increases in pay and allowances.  The increases under subsidies B.1, B.2, B.3, B.4, B.7, B.9 and J amount to over £2 million and these also are mainly due to the implementation of the national understanding by the agricultural faculties at the universities, the agricultural colleges and such bodies as An Foras Talúntais and the county committees of agriculture.  An extra £250,000 is being provided under subhead A.4 to meet the cost of increases in travelling and subsistence allowances which were decided on during the year.</P>
    <P>Originally, provision was made for expenditure of some £4,000 in respect of animals slaughtered because of leukosis infection.  Tests had disclosed leukosis in a number of herds which contained either imported Canadian Holstein stock or animals which had been in contact with such stock.  In all, 13 herds were found to have a total of 55 infected animals.  All these infected herds have been restricted and because of the nature of the disease the period of restriction has had to be prolonged for two years or more.  In these circumstances it was necessary to make special arrangements with a number of herdowners who had serious problems of overstocking.  At subhead C.4 an extra £300,000 is being provided as compensation in respect of animals slaughtered to relieve this overstocking situation.  All the infected herds have been subjected to regular testing and the latest results seem to show that any leukosis infection traceable to imported animals has effectively been eradicated.  There is continuous surveillance of carcases at meat factories and down through the years no evidence of the disease has been found in the indigenous herd.</P>
    <P>The additional sum of £0.8 million required for the consumer subsidies on milk and butter is made up of an excess of £1.4 million on the milk subsidy, partly offset by a saving of £0.6 million on <Col N="1704" /> the butter subsidy.  The excess on the milk subsidy is due to higher than expected consumption and a carryover of payments from last year.  The butter subsidy saving is due to some fall in consumption compared to the very high level in 1978.</P>
    <P>The increase of £4.9 million being sought for the M.6 subhead is due to the higher interest rates being paid by the intervention agency for its funds since the middle of the year as well as to higher levels of intervention stocks.  The increase is to an extent offset by a related increase of £2.75 million in the receipts under subhead N.19, leaving the net increase at £2.15 million.</P>
    <P>In the area of animal health there will be a saving of about £500,000 in the amount provided for the eradication of bovine TB.  The round of testing which commenced at the beginning of May 1979 got off to a slow start because of the postal dispute and did not get fully under way until around the middle of the year.  This resulted in payments for reactor cattle and fees to veterinary surgeons being somewhat less than expected.  Payments under the brucellosis scheme, where there is a saving of £5.5 million, were also affected by the late start on the full programme of testing.  However, the greater part of the saving under this heading arises from a lower than estimated level of participation in the voluntary pre-intensive brucellosis scheme which was aimed at encouraging herdowners to get rid of brucellosis infected animals before full compulsory eradication measures are extended to all areas of the country.  The previous voluntary scheme has now been terminated and, with the recent introduction of a compulsory element into the pre-intensive scheme, I am confident that significant progress will be made in reducing the disease incidence in the counties covered by the scheme.</P>
    <P>The original Estimate envisaged receipts of £9.5 million from farmer contributions towards the cost of eradicating bovine diseases.  This was based on farmer contributions being collected over about ten months of the year.  However, because the necessary legislation was not <Col N="1705" /> enacted until August, receipts under this heading in the current year are not now expected to exceed £1 million.</P>
    <P>The shortfall of £200,000 in receipts under the Fresh Meat Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Acts can be attributed to slaughterings at beef export premises in the early part of the year being lower than expected and to collection difficulties due to the postal dispute.  The shortfall of £175,000 in respect of fees payable by creameries and pasteurisers to meet the cost of the inspection service provided by my Department is due mainly to the fact that the necessary legislation increasing the fees was not enacted until July.</P>
    <P>We are providing for shortfalls in respect of receipts from the EEC in respect of the farm modernisation scheme, aids to less favoured areas and certain other schemes.  Most of the money involved has in fact been approved for payment to us but it is not expected to be received until after the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a very bad year for farmers and for agriculture.  It has been estimated by the Agricultural Institute that there will be a fall in farmers' incomes this year of about 9 per cent.  I wonder if there is any other sector of the community which would accept with equanimity a fall in their incomes of 9 per cent.  If there was a sector of the community under the charge of any other Minister who suffered such a fall, would that Minister be able to sit as quietly as the Minister for Agriculture has been sitting in face of such a large decline in real incomes of the people who are supposed to be within his authority?  It has been estimated by people carrying out research in this matter that the gains of the farming community as a result of EEC membership <i>vis-á-vis</i> other sectors of the community have by now been completely eroded and that farmers are now back in exactly the same position as far as income is concerned <i>vis-á-vis</i> other sections of the community as they were before we entered the EEC.  Few people have realised that. It is also something which many of the <Col N="1706" /> farming community have not yet realised, but it is a fact.</P>
      <P>We have been told by successive Ministers for Agriculture that brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication are among the most urgent priorities in our agricultural policy.  I believe it is evidence of nothing short of incompetence by the Minister for Agriculture, for whom the House voted £13 million for the eradication of brucellosis, that he now has to hand back £5,500,000, particularly when one bears in mind the inadequacies of the implementation of the eradication scheme and the hardships imposed on farmers by the methods used.  The Minister early this year introduced what is known as the 30-day test under which before farmers move their cattle they have to have them tested for brucellosis and TB.  An indication must be given that they are free of both those diseases before they can be sold to anybody.  From the date that test is administered they have only 30 days within which to sell those animals.  If they fail to sell them they have to wait for another 30 days before they can have another test and they cannot sell the cattle on the open market until they are clear of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice the operation of this scheme has caused great hardship this year, particularly to the owners of store cattle in the latter part of the year who were trying to sell them in an oversupplied market in relation to demand and the credit available to potential purchasers and prices were falling as a result.  The way in which the scheme is operated meant that farmers who had animals tested did not get the results of those tests back until perhaps 25 days after the original test took place, and in some cases did not get the results back until after the full 30 days had expired. Instead of having 30 days in which to sell their cattle, all they had was five days.  There might be one or two marts in the particular area in those five days and if those people did not get a good price at either of those two marts they either had to sell them at a bad price or <Col N="1707" /> take them home and face the prospects of not being able to sell them again for up to another 60 days during which prices could fall still further.</P>
    <P>This imposed a very considerable hardship on farmers.  It was not caused by the 30-day test but because of the inadequacies of the administration of the test, because the results of the test were not reported back to farmers for such a long time.  All the tests for the entire country of blood for brucellosis are carried out in one laboratory in Dublin. Samples of the blood of animals have to come all the way from Malin Head to Dublin, from Clifden to Dublin and from other far away places to Dublin and are returned to those places.  It was inevitable that delays would occur.  They were particularly acute in the month of September when there was a very large rush in the sale of animals.  This laboratory during that month was incapable of coping with the workload on it.  What was needed were more staff and the opening of facilities for testing for brucellosis in all the regional veterinary laboratories, which are situated in about six or seven regional centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The cost of establishing facilities for the testing of blood for brucellosis in those regional veterinary laboratories would have been very little.  The equipment involved would have cost only £5,000 for each laboratory.  Only about four or five assistants, who would not need very high qualifications, would have been needed for this work.  People with the normal leaving certificate standard, with a very small amount of training, could be employed in doing this work.  The reason for this delay and for the hardship that farmers have faced in the operation of the 30-day test is because the Government would not provide the equipment in the regional laboratories and would not provide the staff in those regional laboratories to operate the testing of blood for brucellosis in a number of centres rather than concentrating the testing in one centre where, from the point of view of <Col N="1708" /> distance and the bureaucratic procedure involved, delays were inevitable.  It is all the more ironic when we consider that under the precise subhead for this work the Minister is able to hand back £5,500,000 unspent.  He had the money but he would not spend it to make the 30-day test system work.</P>
    <P>This is an indication of the grave incompetence of the Minister who bears responsibility for making that money available to ensure that the 30-day test system would work instead of being a cause of great hardship to many who could not sell their animals when they wished.  The Minister should provide immediately testing facilities for brucellosis in all the regional veterinary laboratories.  He should set up a system whereby an officer would be available in each of those laboratories to deal directly with complaints lodged by farmers where there is a delay of anything more than four days in dealing with blood samples which have been submitted. There should be one officer responsible in each laboratory to deal directly with the farmer and with the people who have these samples on their shelves awaiting the carrying out of tests.  There should be an action system to eliminate all delays.</P>
    <P>There is a strong veterinary case for allowing the carrying out of a further test for tuberculosis 42 days after a previous test, which would make it much easier for farmers to get their animals resold, having failed to sell them within the first 30-day period.  At present, no test for tuberculosis can be carried out unless a period of 60 days has elapsed since the earlier test.  The reduction to 42 days would allow a much more rapid turnover of tests and ensure that if a farmer had no opportunity for selling his cattle during the period provided by the first test, another test would come along much sooner than at present.  I am advised, by veterinary people competent to advise me, that a 42-day lapse of time between one tuberculosis test and the next is quite sufficient.  I urge the Minister to consider that matter immediately.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to note a saving of £5½ million unspent for brucellosis <Col N="1709" /> testing and which is matched by a saving of £½ million unspent for tuberculosis eradication.  The Minister last year, also, failed to spend the money voted under these two headings.  We were told last year that arrangements were in train and that the same thing would not happen again, but it has.</P>
    <P>I note also that of the money voted for socio-economic information services&mdash;£43,000&mdash;no more than £7,000 was spent.  Money is available, from the EEC, to match any money that we spend on the provision of these services.  These are advisory services, particularly to older farmers who are thinking of transferring their holding and unable to see how best to go about it&mdash;what type of family settlement they should make to ensure full security for themselves in their old age and an opportunity to bring a younger man into the running of the farm and thus ensure that the farm is run more efficiently.  This EEC money has been available to us for the past five years to provide advisory services for farmers to precisely this end.  We have been unable, for reasons which should be explained, to avail of it.  In this year of 1979, we made a modest attempt to do something about it, by voting £43,000 for these services, but only a miserable £7,000 of this sum was spent.  There has been a saving of almost half of the amount provided for schemes under the Food and Agriculture Organisation.  We all know that there are serious problems of hunger and hardship in the world and that the Food and Agriculture Organisation are making immense efforts to improve the situation of the starving millions throughout the world.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one more sentence on that subject.  It is remarkable, in this year, of all years, of the Cambodian tragedy, where people are dying of hunger, that £55,000 was voted to the Minister for Agriculture to spend on assistance to schemes being sponsored by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, almost entirely to the Third World and he comes back to this House and announces that he is handing back £21,000, because he cannot spend it.</P>
      <P>I note the increase of £3 million or more under the heading of salaries, wages and allowances.  There has been a tendency, in recent years, for more and more of the money voted to the Department of Agriculture to be absorbed in staff costs in the Department itself.  This is a trend of grave concern.  The Government will seek to convey the impression that the bulk or all of the money, being voted under the heading of Agriculture is going to the farmer.  The present situation is that almost 15 per cent of all the money voted under that heading under Vote 40 is, in fact, being absorbed in staff salaries within the Department.  One might say that is a normal situation; Departments must employ staff and must pay them; of course they must.  It is not the normal situation in the case of the Department of Agriculture, because in that Department, in 1969-70, they only needed just over 2 per cent of their entire money to pay their staff, when they were operating in times of much greater stringency economically and in agriculture.  At that time only 2.6 per cent of their budget was required for staff, this year 14.5 per cent is required for staff.  This is a sevenfold increase in ten years in the proportion being absorbed by staff costs.  This money is not going to the farmers or into direct economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the utmost respect for the officials in the Department of Agriculture. Any Minister who operates in the Department would be served by <Col N="1711" /> amongst the best, if not the best, civil servants in the entire public service, but that is not an excuse for such a huge increase in the proportion of the budget going to staff costs.  What has gone wrong that there could be a sevenfold increase in the proportion in barely ten years?  The same situation has occurred in relation to the Department of Lands. The Department of Lands, the Department of Forestry and the Department of Agriculture are the only Departments in the Government in which this phenomenon of a dramatic increase in the amount being absorbed by staff costs has occurred.  It is not something that is happening throughout the public service. In many Departments during the last ten years the proportion of the budget absorbed in staff costs has fallen&mdash;for instance, in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Department of Tourism and Transport and the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  How could such a trend in the opposite direction have occurred in the Department of Agriculture?  An explanation is owed to the House by the Minister.  It is not the blame of the new Minister, but he can offer an explanation.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy MacSharry on obtaining this very important post.  From what I know of the Deputy he has the capacity to do a very good job.  The Deputy has been responsible on behalf of the Government for work in relation to the EEC budget and has shown in that work a very high level of capacity. The Minister has the qualifications to do a very good job here, but whether he does or not remains to be seen. Everybody interested in agriculture will watch his performance with great interest. I hope the Minister does a good job.  I do so for the sake of agriculture, because it certainly needs something to lift it from the pit of despondency into which it has fallen in the last two years.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provision for private agricultural schools and agricultural schools on farms, I note that there is some increase in the amount provided.  I would draw the attention of the House to <Col N="1712" /> the fact that these schools are packed out at the moment.  Young people wishing to take a course in these agricultural schools are finding it very difficult, if not impossible, to find a place.  This is very different to the situation that obtained three or four years ago when these schools had so many places available that they were able to take people who had no direct prospect of ever returning to the land or whose interest was not great.  Now it is virtually impossible for people who will definitely return to the land to find places in an agricultural college.  While I welcome the additional provision in the Estimate, it is quite inadequate in view of the existing demand for extra places.</P>
    <P>If I were to single out one area in agriculture which will need special attention in the next two years, it is the area of agricultural education and training. The farming community need skills to cope with an increasingly complex industry, and our existing arrangements are not sufficient to provide them with those skills.  Decisions will have to be taken quickly in relation to the expansion of training.  Training is completely inadequate for farm workers.  There are many openings, particularly in the south, for young men who want to become involved at a highly technical and well paid level in farm work.  From speaking to dairy farmers in the south I know that in Cork they are finding it next to impossible to get men to work in the management of dairy herds and in the carrying out of milking operations.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why the deliveries to creameries now are just about at 80 per cent of what they were last year is that many dairy farmers are getting out of the business because of the very steep increase in costs, because of the freeze in prices that has taken place due to the negotiations of the Minister in Brussels, and also because they find that the seven day week type of work that they must do is impossible from a social point of view and they cannot get people to work for them in the management of dairy herds. There are immense opportunities for skilled workers in the dairy industry and, <Col N="1713" /> despite a large level of unemployment, these opportunities are not being taken up because people are not properly trained to take them up.  Action should be taken as an urgent measure in relation to training on that front.  The existing arrangements are insufficient.  All the resources at the moment are concentrated on training for farmers and none is available to cater specifically for the farm worker, for whom there is a great demand and good wages.</P>
    <P>I note that there is a very large increase in the amount of money provided for the Agricultural Credit Corporation. What is this far, and why an increase from £9,000 to £168,000?  I am not decrying the increase, but it requires an explanation.  Also, on what basis is compensation being made available for leukosis reactors?  Perhaps Deputy Donnellan, who has special experience of this, would be able to add to the knowledge of the House in this matter.  A number of farmers are having trouble with leukosis and are not able to get information on the basis on which compensation is made available.  We should have more information on that.</P>
    <P>Why has there been a saving of about £60,000 in relation to horticulture and aids to horticulture producing goods? Last year money voted for horticulture was not spent either.  Is there a policy of not spending money voted for horticulture, or was it just an accident?  If it was just an accident it might have occurred last year, but it would hardly recur this year.  For the second year running money voted for horticulture has not been spent and I would like to know why.  We must realise the immense potential of horticulture, but it cannot be realised without resources.  In relation to horticulture it is recognised that the Dublin fruit and vegetable market is very unsuitable from the producer's point of view.  It is operated by the Dublin Corporation, who, for all their merits, have no direct interest in the producer or in horticulture.</P>

Everybody is losing out by the present inefficient arrangements for horticultural marketing and the Minister should do something about it, particularly in relation to the Dublin fruit and vegetable market.</P>
      <P>Although I had hard words to say about him on this and previous occasions I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the outgoing Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Gibbons, for the courtesy he showed me on many occasions. Publicly, as I have already done privately I wish him well in the future.</P>

      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to this very important post.  If we feel he is doing a good job we will say so but if he is not living up to what we expect from him, we will be ready to criticise constructively the policies he is adopting. While I generally disagreed with the previous holder of this office, I want to pay tribute to his courtesy at all times.  I disagreed with many of the things he did, but he knew agriculture.  His views were different from mine but that was probably because he was in power and I was not.  I wish him well and I hope he gets everything he desires as a backbencher and in his private life.  I would like the present Minister to give his views on the general structure of land because coming from the west his outlook might be different from that of the previous Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but if it is not he will be hearing many harsh things from me.  I was amazed to hear that all the <Col N="1715" /> money provided for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis had not been spent.  Many excuses were given.  It was said they could not get it going in the early part of the year because of the postal strike.  I am sick hearing the postal strike being blamed for everything.  In my view there must have been a lack of dedication somewhere along the line.  I believe the previous Minister tried his best and made unpopular decisions about the eradication of these diseases.  I do not know what went wrong but more than the postal strike must have been at fault to account for the fact that this amount of money was not spent on the eradication of these diseases.</P>
      <P>The 30-day tests introduced last year had a very serious effect on many people who sold their cattle at marts.  These tests were necessary and nobody tried to resist them.  Many people found it a hardship if they had to sell within five or ten days in a very limited area.  In the case of many small farmers they had only one or two beasts to sell and they had to sell them through agents or cattle jobbers.  Those people were particularly hard hit by the 60-day regulation.  If they could not sell within 30 days they had to keep the cattle a further 30 days before they could be retested.  If the period of 60 days could be shortened it would give these people an opportunity of reselling. Getting one or two cattle tested is an expensive business and only affects smallholders.  I am not advocating that there should not be a 30-day test or that farmers should not be compelled to have their cattle tested, but if there is any way the Minister can alleviate that expense on these farmers I ask him to consider it seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that the increase in salaries and wages is of the order of 14 per cent.  That may not be a bad thing. The Department of Agriculture have to pay the national understanding.  If this increase in staff means a growth in the service areas of the Department of Agriculture, then I accept it.  Over the years the Department have expanded <Col N="1716" /> their services and, therefore, I do not agree with the attitude that we should not increase the number of staff.  We should provide the money to increase staff.  If they are providing extra services and if the Department are expanding they must have extra staff.  It is only natural that more money would be needed for such staff.</P>
    <P>As regards agricultural education I agree with the previous speaker who said that there was no practical agricultural education facilities available to farmers. I do not know of any great jobs with high remuneration which are available in my area.  It is not a big dairying area. Farm workers in my area are badly paid. Farmers must be skilled in all areas of agriculture, whether in dairy or machine management or whatever.  It is unfortunate that there is so little agricultural education available to them.  Classes are run by some committees of agriculture. However, such people are excluded from some of them.  Not enough use is being made of regional colleges.  Some colleges have agricultural faculties but there should be more than there are.  There should be a greater emphasis in regional colleges on agricultural education.</P>
    <P>Any money spent on An Foras Talúntais is money well spent.  They have developed farms for the Land Commission and others and have handed them back worth three times more than they were worth previously.  They are doing a wonderful job in the limited area of their operation, in testing and farm development.  They should be involved in agricultural production.  They have the potential, know-how and proven ability to develop and improve farming.  They supply information to farmers and that should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to deal with a few points.  Is the extra amount for An Foras Talúntais, £855,000, for expansion or is it to keep them ticking over? When the Minister is allotting money again he should try to get more money for that area and expand it in the directions I have mentioned.  As regards changes in the composition of the county committees of agriculture&mdash;it is perhaps <Col N="1717" /> unfair to ask the Minister this as he is only one day in office&mdash;when will he implement the Bill which we passed recently and the changes in the composition of the various committees?  A sum of £521,000 is required for the committees of agriculture.  Some of it is made up in removal expenses, pay for officers and so on.  Will extra money be needed when the Bill is implemented?</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his office. He will never fail to get money for progressive things here but we will be ready to oppose him if we feel he is not doing the job he should be doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to this very high office.  I consider that the Minister for Agriculture has the most important office in the land.  At least 50 per cent of our people, directly or indirectly, are concerned with agriculture.  Deputy MacSharry has come up along the line like a lot of us.  I do not know him very well other than we stayed in Brussels for a short time when we were first elected in 1977.  I wish him the best of luck and look forward to his operation.  I am a little nervous that the Minister has no real, practical colleague in the Cabinet.  In gatherings of people and where decisions have to be made it is important to have friends there.  From what I have heard the Minister is a good fighter and that is important.  The Minister has taken over agriculture in difficult times and he has a difficult task. He can expect co-operation from this side of the House but we will also expect co-operation from him.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with Supplementary Estimates and this gives an opportunity to look at the overall situation.  Under every heading there are small or big increases. Under the headings of practically every Department there are increases from 1 per cent to 165 per cent. As far as the Agricultural Estimate is concerned, the increase over 1977 to 1979 is 1 per cent.  This was in an answer given to Deputy Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a report from the Agricultural Institute which states that there is a <Col N="1718" /> decrease in incomes of those engaged in agriculture somewhere in the region of 9 per cent.  On top of that we must look at 1980.  If my figures are accurate the cost of production increase for 1980 will be in the region of 12-14 per cent.  The Minister said that he hopes to win back the confidence of the farmers.  They have suffered a loss of 9 per cent in their incomes, and costs in connection with production in 1980 will have increased by 12 per cent to 14 per cent.  Something must be done about this matter.  Farmers cannot continue with the present system whereby their profits are being eroded while, at the same time, everyone is calling for increased growth in production. It is rather interesting to see advertisements on television on behalf of the Department encouraging farmers to keep extra cattle on the land.</P>
    <P>The one way to get increased production is to ensure that there is a fair margin of profit available for agriculture. There have been bad mistakes made in the past few years and we have seen the results.  I farm extensively and efficiently. I come from a county where people farm efficiently and where they try to get the maximum production from the land. There will be further reductions next year if the present conditions continue.</P>
    <P>We were getting a growth rate in agriculture of between 4 and 5 per cent. The latest figures are not available but we hear that the growth rate will be in the region of 1 per cent for 1979.  This will affect the whole nation because any increased production from agriculture is usually for export.  When we export we help our balance of payments.  This year we exported agricultural produce at a value of £1,100 million.  Any increase in this figure will be of considerable help to the economy.</P>
    <P>If farmers were given a reasonable profit it would be possible to get an increase in production of from 3 per cent to 6 per cent per annum.  The Minister knows better than I do that so far as agriculture is concerned we are achieving only approximately 55 per cent of our potential.  We have 12 million acres of good productive land and it is dreadful <Col N="1719" /> to think that we are using it only to the extent of 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>Certain factors are responsible for that.  Ministers in different Governments have tried to increase production but if we are to reach our full potential so far as agricultural production is concerned we must ensure that the young people who are involved in the industry have a basic knowledge of agriculture.  This brings me to the area of education in agriculture.  When we look at the Estimate we see clearly some explanations why we are not achieving our full potential in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The figure in the Estimate for agricultural schools and farms is £2,625,000.  This is completely inadequate. Unfortunately the agricultural colleges are unable to accommodate more students.  In Wexford we had 80 applicants for 25 scholarship places. Parents came to me and inquired how they could get their sons into agricultural colleges.  I could only give them the names of the colleges but there were no places available.  This is a hopeless situation. If I were asking a son&mdash;some day I hope I shall do so&mdash;to take over my farm, I would not do so if he did not have a good basic knowledge of agriculture.  This matter has been talked about at all levels but little has been done to remedy the situation.  Now we have a new Minister and I hope this will be one of his priorities.</P>
    <P>I referred to the sum of £2,625,000 in respect of agricultural schools and farms.  According to the Estimate travelling and incidental expenses for the Department amounted to approximately the same figure.  Let us compare the two items and their importance.  I have tried on numerous occasions in this House to get people to listen to me on this matter but I have failed.  I hope the Minister will forgive me if I labour the point because I think it is important.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is our national asset.  People are always saying that.  How do we make that national asset produce for the benefit of the nation?  We must educate the people who are using the asset.  I appeal <Col N="1720" /> to the Minister to look at the figures and to analyse them.  He should consider where improvements might be made.  I have always believed that the Department of Education should not be the authority responsible for agricultural education.  Certainly no progress has been made in this matter.</P>
    <P>In County Wexford there is Johnstown Castle with approximately 2,000 acres of land.  This should be used for agricultural education.  There are several other agricultural farms belonging to the State that could be used for this subject.  I believe that Johnstown Castle is ideal for the purpose.  They have the scope, the personnel and the good land.  All that is necessary is that the Department would make available buildings that could be used for residential or non-residential purposes.  In the regional college in Galway the school is used for non-residential purposes.  So far as the residential aspect is concerned, that is catered for in the city.  The same applies with regard to other areas. Johnstown Castle is near Wexford town and the necessary accommodation would be available there if Johnstown Castle were turned into a proper agricultural college.  This could be done at very little cost.  Research is carried out there by the Agricultural Institute and that is important.  It is vital where agricultural education is being taught that there is research in the same area.  I am horrified to see that there was a handback of £5.5 million from the eradication of brucellosis.</P>
    <P>Before discussing brucellosis I should like to refer to leukosis infection.  There are 13 herds in the State infected with leukosis as a result of imported Canadian cattle.  The 13 infected herds should have been slaughtered in order to ensure that we did not inherit another disease. For the past 15 or 16 years, bovine disease has cost the State and the farmers a great deal of money.  It has been reported that the disease is under control, that all infected herds have been subjected to regular testing.  The latest results show that leukosis infection has been <Col N="1721" /> eradicated.  I sincerely hope that it has been eradicated.  Unfortunately, there are a few infected herds near my herd.  I spoke to the person concerned and it took some pressure from me to get the Department to compensate him for the slaughter of his calves.  Great care should be taken that calves from the 13 infected herds are not sold on the public market.</P>
    <P>I have spoken publicly and privately about the damage caused by the 30-day test.  This test has not achieved the desired result.  A 60-day test would have achieved the same results as the 30-day test.  Many farmers who applied for the 30-day test had to wait 15 days for the results.  The cattle market has been unstable since last July.  A drop in price of £3 per cwt. means that a farmer would bring his cattle home rather than sell them.  The short time available to the farmer to dispose of his animals is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to ask his Department why the 30-day test cannot be changed to 60 days.  It is my belief that the Department introduced the 30-day test in order to make the farmers test their own cattle for TB and brucellosis. However, the farmers were quicker than the Department in that they sold their cattle privately.  There is evidence to show that, as a result of the 30-day test, there was a significant drop in the number of cattle sold at marts.  If I sell cattle to Deputy John Donnellan tomorrow morning and he shifts them to Galway, it would not be possible to prove whether I sold them on 1 July or on 1 December. The Department made no attempt to close the loophole.  The farmers took advantage of the loophole and the disease is still being spread.  I admit that the 30-day test has had some success but it did not have the desired effect.  I accuse the administration of attempting to make the farmers pay for disease eradication.  The cost of the veterinary surgeon was £8, even if the farmer had only one beast for him to test.  After that the cost was £2 per beast.  I have heard that the Department made a deal in Brussels in relation to the 30-day test.  I have also heard that <Col N="1722" /> Brussels are prepared to accept a 60-day test.  I appeal to the Minister to give this matter immediate attention in order to alleviate some of the hardships caused to farmers.</P>
    <P>I note that the general grant-in-aid for An Foras Talúntais is £8,855,000 and that the grant-in-aid for the county committees of agriculture is £5,111,000.  The most damaging piece of legislation passed by this House in the past two-and-a-half years was the AnCOT Bill.  I am not saying that An Foras Talúntais are not doing their work but they should be involved in agricultural education at a different level.  As An Foras Talúntais have the personnel, the equipment and the know-how, it is a great pity that they were divided.  It was a great mistake to set up AnCOT in preference to the National Agricultural Advisory Authority, which was introduced by the previous Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton.  When one considers that their estimate is £8,855,000, An Foras Talúntais should not have the right to be an autonomous body.  The farmers could derive great benefit from the knowledge of this body and it could also benefit the economy.  I have contended, and will continue to contend, that their involvement be at a different level. Their involvement should not be behind closed doors but rather in the fields of the nation, in the farmers' yards just as is the involvement of the people in the county committees of agriculture.  I wish the Minister the best of luck on his appointment and look forward to working with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the case made by previous speakers regarding the 30-day test.  Perhaps the new Minister, without much ado, might change it to a 60-day test; he might look at it in a different light from his predecessor.  Certainly the money has not been provided in order to have this test scheme operate as efficiently as it should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A legitimate point was made by Deputy Bruton in regard to the regional laboratories.  As a representative of a western constituency I contend that the <Col N="1723" /> laboratory in Athlone, for instance, should be used for the 30-day test, thereby eliminating the delays that have occurred.  Perhaps the Minister might state clearly exactly what payments are made to herd owners in respect of every animal in the herd affected by leukosis.</P>
    <P>My final submission is in regard to the county committees of agriculture.  As a result of events that took place in June last I happen at present to be chairman of the county committee of agriculture in Galway.  We feel there is a serious lack of advisory services in our county, that the number of farmers per agricultural adviser in our county is much higher than in any other counties, certainly more than in, say, County Meath.  We have requested the Department to appoint a number of additional permanent agricultural instructors to the county.  We have the right to appoint temporary agricultural instructors if we are given the necessary authority; of course, we do not have much autonomy anyway.  I think we have made application for six additional agricultural instructors.  As chairman of that county committee I would ask the Minister to take note of these representations with a view to granting us at least the number requested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>We will look into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants to increase agricultural production in the State in general, the best, easiest and cheapest way to do so is to authorise a larger advisory service.  In this respect I shall be parochial&mdash;because I am familiar with the scene about which I am talking&mdash; in County Galway one is talking about 700 farmers to each agricultural instructor. There is no way that man could give those farmers the attention they need. Therefore, only a very small proportion of those farmers ever has an opportunity of communicating with the agricultural instructor or of availing of the advisory services.  Lest it be taken from what I have said that I am being critical of the services, I should say that I know most <Col N="1724" /> of the people involved and they are as fine a body of men in the service in our county as is as available anywhere else in the country.  But the Minister's objective as far as the advisory services are concerned in relation to the entire country now should be to have something in the region of 150 to 200 units to each agricultural instructor or adviser.</P>
      <P>We have a problem also regarding office staff in the county committee of agriculture headquarters in Galway, again because, as the county committee of agriculture, we have damn all power. We rely solely on the discretion of the Department of Agriculture in regard to requests for additional staff.  Perhaps the Minister could bring his attention to bear on that matter and see his way to authorising the staff numbers we seek. Again, I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank all the Deputies who spoke for their good wishes on my appointment as Minister for Agriculture.  I want to thank them also for their contributions.  I shall do my best to reply to them in the time available, but I know there are other Estimates to be gone through and other Deputies wishing to make their views known on them.</P>
      <P>I have taken notes of the points raised by each Deputy and I shall run through them briefly.  Deputies Bruton and D'Arcy spoke of the reports of the 9 per cent drop in farm income this year.  All I can say is that our figures and estimates are based on family farm income and that, while they show a drop of three per cent, the income per head will be unchanged this year.</P>
      <P>Deputies D'Arcy, Bruton and Bermingham dealt quite extensively with disease control.  At the beginning I thought Deputy Bruton seemed to want the same type of soft approach which has delayed progress over many years, but I do not think he really meant that. Disease eradication cannot be completely painless&mdash;I think everybody is agreed on that&mdash;and it must go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> Delays in getting results were due partly to the postal dispute and partly also to the huge increase in the number of samples taken&mdash;110,000 per week as compared with 40,000 a year earlier.  This huge increase shows that the disease eradication schemes are going ahead.  All delays in the return of samples have been eliminated in the past month or two.  I think that is also agreed by everybody now.  We are providing new laboratory facilities in Cork and additional facilities at Sligo.  As was requested by Deputy Donnellan, I shall look at the question of the laboratory at Athlone.  Despite what has been said I am sure Deputies will appreciate&mdash;again bearing in mind the huge increase in activity in this area&mdash;that the new facilities cannot be provided overnight.  However, I shall do my utmost to speed up the provision of the facilities required.</P>
    <P>As regards the 30-day test, the question of the 60-day re-test and the suggestion of 42 days made by Deputy Bruton, I am not completely convinced that this would be desirable in every respect. However, I do not have a closed mind in that regard.  It is something which I intend to work on in the Department as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton mentioned also the matter of socio-economic advice.  The Deputy must appreciate that before schemes are put into full swing it is necessary to train staff.  This scheme has been under way and the dissemination of socio-economic advice can be expected to develop more rapidly when the new advisory and training body take over An Comhairle Oiliúna Talamhaíochta.</P>
    <P>Deputies Bermingham and Bruton raised the question of staff costs.  Is it not incongruous to complain on the one hand about staff costs and at the same time to complain about inadequate staff? The figures mentioned by Deputy Bruton ignore totally the fact that the Department handle huge payments of EEC funds.  This year, for example, the amount was £400 million compared with a total vote of £147 million.  The staff costs as a percentage of Vote, plus the EEC fund, is less than 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1726" /> Deputy Bermingham sought further information about staff numbers and he was not disagreeing in regard to increasing staff numbers.  I should point out to him that the common agricultural policy section of the Department is extremely staff intensive.  Perhaps this Department are more involved in EEC matters than are any other Department, even Foreign Affairs.  Consequently, substantial increases in staff have been essential since the beginning of the decade.  This is understandable particularly in view of the benefits we derive from the CAP.</P>
    <P>Deputies made some valid points about the number of places available in agricultural colleges.  Provision for expansion of places in these colleges is made in the comprehensive western package that is before the Council of Ministers in Brussels.  I would agree with Deputy Bruton regarding the importance of training and education.  I look forward to much progress and development under these headings when AnCOT get under way and are in operation.  I cannot say when the western package will be agreed in Brussels but I can say that we will be making our best efforts to bring about a successful conclusion to this matter as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asked also about the increase in the Vote in respect of the ACC which is under subhead F.1. This is to meet the cost of the interest in relation to an ACC guaranteed loan to Clover Meats Limited.  The question of the saving on horticulture was raised also by the same Deputy.  Both last year and this year we provided for funds by way of launching aid to any producer group in the horticulture sector.  This arises under an EEC directive but it is not the fault of the Department if the interests concerned do not come together to set up a producers group.  We encourage them to do so and we make provision for financial help for them in the event of their going ahead, but we cannot compel them to set up a group. However, we can only express the hope that they will decide to come together.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham asked when AnCOT would come into operation.  They <Col N="1727" /> will hold their first meeting on Tuesday next.  Regarding the Deputy's question about An Foras Talúntais, the extra amount sought is to meet the amount of extra wages as provided for in the national understanding.  This has been the case, too, in respect of many other Votes.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies Donnellan and D'Arcy inquired about the exact amount paid to farmers in respect of each animal affected by leukosis.  I do not have the information but I will communicate with the Deputies.  Regarding the points made by Deputy Donnellan in concluding his remarks, the question of agricultural advisers will be one for the new AnCOT. Hopefully, the progress that both the Deputy and I would like to see in that regard will be made.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1979. - Vote 29: Environment.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Sylvester Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1979, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes and grants including a grant-in-aid. </P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate is, broadly speaking, an end-year tidying up of the Vote.  It is for a net amount of £10.  Sufficient savings are available elsewhere in the Vote to meet the extra amounts now being sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The individual amount provided for &ldquo;pay&rdquo; in the original 1979 Estimate did not, in accordance with standing practice, make provision for the extra amounts needed to implement any pay awards that might be negotiated during the year.  A number of such awards have arisen and an extra £916,000 is being <Col N="1728" /> provided for pay in the Supplementary Estimate.  Departmental staff covered by subhead A.1. of the Vote account for £735,000; the grant-in-aid to An Foras Forbartha, £160,000; the National Road Safety Association, £8,000; the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, £5,000; and An Bord Pleanála, £8,000.</P>
    <P>An additional £460,000 is being provided for subhead M to recoup to county councils and county boroughs the expenses they incur on the registration and licensing of mechanically-propelled vehicles and the licensing of drivers.  Those expenses, formerly payable out of the Road Fund, are now payable out of the Vote.  It is desirable to keep their payment up-to-date and the extra £460,000 will ensure that this can be done.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the extra amount being provided in subhead L to meet additional pay costs of the National Road Safety Association and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  A further £46,000 is being provided to the National Road Safety Association for campaigns during the Christmas period on drink and driving and on the use of seat belts.  An extra £60,000 is being provided to meet the expenses of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety as a result of the active enforcement by the Garda of the breathalyser provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1978.</P>
    <P>The expenses of An Bord Pleanála are met by way of a grant under subhead Q. The grant is being increased to defray the additional expenditure in the renting, fitting out and equipment of new offices in which the board and the staff servicing it have been accommodated.</P>
    <P>The subsidy to building societies, under subhead N, allows them to reduce the mortgage interest rate effectively payable by certain borrowers in the Dublin area who have building society loans, the repayments of which were guaranteed by the local authorities.  The subsidy enables the interest payable by borrowers on these loans to be fixed at 9 per cent and so the subsidy reflects the difference between 9 per cent and the current mortgage rate of 14.15 per cent <Col N="1729" /> being charged by the societies.  The result has been an increase of £24,000 in the amount needed for the subsidy this year.</P>
    <P>Under subhead B, £175,000 more is being provided for travelling and incidental expenses.  A further £38,000 is needed for subhead C to defray the cost of increased charges for telephone services and of greater use of the services. The increase of £37,000 in subhead H stems from higher costs for printing and other preparatory work on the register of electors.</P>
    <P>In subhead S&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;receipts are likely to be £185,000 lower than anticipated.  It is expected that there will be shortfalls of £170,000 in receipts from driver test fees and £45,000 in fees payable by the National House Building Guarantee Company Ltd.  The shortfall on these two items will be partially offset by £30,000 more being realised elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if the Minister is aware that there is a great anomaly in the matter referred to in the question.  It may not obtain in all Gaeltacht areas, it may be in only one or two, but I should like the Minister to inquire into it.  I will give an explanation. People could have paid hundreds if not thousands of pounds to have their roads taken over under local improvement schemes and now find they are prohibited by Roinn na Gaeltachta from having those roads tarred.  As a result of recent legislation roads leading to just one house can be tarred at no cost to the householder.  That is a grave anomaly and I should like the Minister to investigate it with a view to putting things right.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The schools at which I have approved the provision of physical education halls are as follows: The Donahies Community School, Dublin; Birr Community School; Springfield Community School, Tallaght; Old Bawn Community School, County Dublin; Bishopstown Community School, Cork; Cabinteely Community School, Dublin; Lisduggan Vocational School, Waterford; Moneenageisha Vocational School, Galway; Knocknaheeny Vocational School, Cork; Monaghan Vocational School; Ringsend Vocational School, Dublin; Donegal Town Vocational School; Mitchelstown Vocational School, County Cork.</P>
      <P>Planning for the construction of buildings is under way but it is not possible to give a precise date for the commencement of the building work at this stage.  I expect, however, that the work will be completed within the next 12 to 15 months.  In view of the fact that tenders will be sought in due course for the placing of contracts I would not consider it appropriate to make a statement in advance in relation to estimates of cost.</P>
      <P>The number of applications for physical education halls received by 1 December 1979 was 117.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that.  The position is that the provision of these <Col N="1735" /> halls&mdash;I prefer to call them physical education halls for very sound and valid reasons&mdash;was suspended in 1975.  There is a big backlog and we are trying to get the best possible value from the contractors in the construction of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>All the secondary schools that have applied have been listed.  They are being considered in the Department and we will have an announcement to make very soon on those that will be given priority in that area.  There are several considerations, including the possibility of community usage of the physical education halls, that have to be taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot put a date for dealing with the backlog because, as everybody is aware, the backlog is substantial. It is my intention that all new schools of a certain size, and where certain conditions are fulfilled, will have physical education halls for the reasons I gave already.  We have physical education teachers, trained in a superb physical education college, and a physical education teacher without such a hall is like a scientist without a laboratory.  That is my thesis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Criteria for the selection of the schools to be provided with physical education facilities and ranking them in order of priority have not been formalised in the manner implied in the question from the Deputy.  Accordingly, the matter of making a document containing such criteria available in the <Col N="1738" /> Oireachtas Library does not arise.</P>
    <P>I may add, however, for information, that, in general, the following considerations are taken into account in connection with the selection of the schools in question: (i) whether construction work was currently in progress on a new school; (ii) size of school; (iii) extent of existing PE facilities; (iv) degree of community need; (v) geographical distribution of halls; (vi) site requirements; (vii) time of application (where application for a hall has been made); (viii) possibility of sharing with other school or community interests or of community or local authority financial support.</P>

      <P>The request of the Dún Laoghaire Vocational Education Committee for the construction of a physical education hall at their Technical Institute, Cumberland Street, has been noted for consideration. The volume of applications for capital allocations for physical education halls has been such that it has not been possible to include this school in the list of those approved for halls in the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking into account the criteria the Minister laid down in an earlier question, does the Minister agree that the Dún Laoghaire VEC, in relation to the Dún Laoghaire Technical Institute, which is a second-level institution in an urban area with a student population in excess of 500 pupils, qualifies for such a provision?  In that context will the Minister give it a high priority and give an assurance to the House that it will be eligible for a sports hall or gymnasia in the near future?</P>

      <P>I have not been supplied with a copy of the speech to which reference is made but I have seen press reports in that regard.</P>
      <P>As I stated in connection with the debate in Dáil Éireann on 31 May 1979 in relation to the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1979, the proposed legislation dealing with university reorganisation will determine the future status of Maynooth College as well as of the other recognised colleges of the National University.  I do not wish to add to that statement at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept that the Cardinal was seeking independent status for St. Patrick's College, Maynooth. Would the Minister accept that in relation to the advertisement placed by the Government prior to the referendum their intentions in relation to the status of Maynooth College were not made clear? Can I take it from that advertisement and a recent reference to the situation that the Minister favours a constituent college position in relation to St. Patrick's, Maynooth rather than an independent status for that college?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows Maynooth College is a recognised college of the National University of Ireland.  It is not an equal case, for example, with the constituent colleges, University College, Dublin, University College, Cork and University College, Galway. Maynooth is a recognised college as is St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, and Carysfort.  The status of these colleges will also be determined in the legislation.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that any Minister preparing a White Paper on any matter would place an advertisement in the national papers <Col N="1746" /> inviting views?  While I accept that he may have written to his known interest groups, there are many private citizens of this State, as well as other groups, who may not be known to him, who would like to have an input into the White Paper?  I am not speaking of groups directly involved in education but the other social groups who might have an input for the White Paper. Does the Minister feel, in view of the fact that no advertisement was placed, that the White Paper may be lacking in input from the socio-educational sector?</P>

We have had submissions from private citizens who are interested in education. There was hardly anybody in the country who did not know that there was a White Paper in preparation.  It was promised in the Fianna Fáil manifesto.</P>

Because a student's father or mother has an income in excess of the limits laid down by the Department, that deprives the student of a grant.

That report showed that on 31 January 1979 only 102 out of 1,334 or 7.7 per cent who qualified for the Higher Diploma in Education in 1978, and who responded to the survey, were still seeking employment.</P>

      <P>The earliest date on which most committees could consider that letter was either mid-August or at <Col N="1754" /> the first meeting in September.  Is the Minister aware that the boards of management in regional colleges determine the level of their fees at their February meeting in order to have the syllabus and prospectus for the various courses published?  Is he further aware that applicants for courses are processed by the end of July or certainly by the time the letter was considered in September? These boards of management had a legal commitment to the students on the basis of their published prospectus. Would the Minister not consider that any indication in relation to increases in fees should go out around March if it is to be effective?  In the obvious circumstances in which many boards of management found themselves, will the Minister withdraw that letter in view of the fact that many boards have rejected it on quasi-legal or legal grounds?</P>

      <P>I would not accept that the 10 per cent increase in fees on a low level for existing students and 25 per cent for new students was excessive.  The vast majority of the committees accepted this and must not have feared that there was any legal difficulty involved.  The committees are experienced committees and know what they are doing.  If they do it they would not be doing it in contravention of any legal contractual provision.</P>

      <P>On the basis of commonsense, if the Government wish to have an increase in fees at whatever level&mdash;the public can adjudicate on the wisdom or otherwise of that&mdash;the intention to seek an increase should be indicated to the committees and boards of management early in the year around March rather than waiting until August when people are on holidays and when such a circular would not be considered until early September.  Is the Minister aware that there is an obligation on the committees and boards to plan forward and settle fee structures?  In those circumstances, if the Government and Minister wish to have an increase in fees, they should be communicated earlier in the year than his last circular was.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that many of the non-university institutions and VEC institutions are covered by the scholarship scheme rather than the grant scheme?

These are <Col N="1758" /> in the same range, that is to say up to £600 with fees, as are the grants.  Some people leave that out of account.

I answered a question from the Deputy about the value of the grant in 1979-80 as compared with the grant in 1968.  I think the Deputy will remember that the figure worked on the CPI was in favour of the 1979-80 amount because the original 1968 grant was a global one incorporating fees and maintenance.  With regard to the other part of the question, as the Deputy knows we have a scheme which is based on the earnings of parents.  It is not related to the actual amount of grant for maintenance or school fees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if a report that the PAYE offices will be shut to the public from Monday next is correct; if so, if he will instruct them that they must remain available, either face to face or by telephone, to members of the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report is correct.  Because of an unprecedented volume of arrears of correspondence and an exceptionally large number of personal callers to their PAYE offices in recent weeks, the Revenue Commissioners have found it necessary to make a temporary curtailment of service to personal callers from next Monday, 17 December, at certain tax offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1764" /> The offices comprise six Dublin offices which deal with PAYE cases and 13 provincial tax offices.  The intention is to concentrate the staff on clearing up the arrears as quickly as possible for the benefit of the large number of taxpayers affected.  It is hoped that the curtailment will be of short duration and that any inconvenience to the public will be minimised.  Queries by correspondence will continue to be accepted and there will be special arrangements for urgent matters such as refunding tax to unemployed persons and providing the necessary certificates for those commencing employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <P>Could the Minister tell the public what the arrangements are for the refunding of tax?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, this problem has arisen because of the backlog which was partly due to the postal strike.  Because the Revenue Commissioners are concerned to take account of the rights of people in the two areas I have mentioned&mdash;refunding tax to unemployed persons and providing the necessary certificates for those commencing employment&mdash;there will be a redeployment of staff within the Revenue Commissioners in the meantime.  I should also like to mention that the training programme which has been going on to enable the volume of work to be coped with effectively will be intensified within this period.  The intention is that the offices will reopen as soon as possible after Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The understanding is that it will not be possible to deal with telephone calls during the period because of the huge backlog of work.  I could give the House some indication of how the backlog has been dealt with over the period.  The priority areas are the refunds of tax and the certificates for people commencing employment.  Tax collection will not be a priority during this period.</P>

      <P>I understand that on previous occasions when the relevant legislation was going through members of the Opposition Parties indicated that it was their view that the Government should not have confined themselves to appointing ten Ministers of State.  It is clear at present that, because of the expansion of work in the various Government Departments and because of the intense increase in the demands made on Ministers on the domestic scene, and especially because of the demands made on Ministers in regard to attendances at EEC meetings, additional Ministers of State are required.  However, I think we can discuss that situation when we come before the House with the legislation when the Dáil resumes.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, first of all, I would like to protest mildly about the disorderly manner in which business is being run.  One recognises a certain confusion at the stage when there is a change of Government.  But the agreement which was made&mdash;and I have it I think in the handwriting of the Government Chief Whip&mdash;was that these announcements would be made this evening at 8 o'clock.  The notice we received of a change of plan in this was at 3.26 p.m., four minutes before 3.30 p.m.  I hope that the arrangements for order in this House will be rather better made and adhered to, and that reasonable notice will be given of changes in future.  I understand the Taoiseach's desire not to withhold information longer than need be.  However, I do think that, when arrangements are made which are to be changed, some reasonable notice should be given.  It might very well have been the case that I and others would not have been here. Four minutes notice of a change of that kind is not sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point made by the Leader of the Opposition and I apologise for the manner in which, unfortunately, business had to be conducted today.  I did not understand that the Leader of the Opposition was left to such very short notice, but perhaps he <Col N="1961" /> would accept that I was anxious to inform the House as quickly as possible of these appointments.  Also, in view of the new arrangements about the debate later on this evening, perhaps it is helpful to the Leader of the Opposition to have this information in plenty of time so that, if he wishes to refer to it in his speech this evening, he will be able to do so.</P>

It is being done in the interests of political pay-off, to try to keep quiet the very divided party the Taoiseach now has behind him.  I do not think we can sit silent if public offices and public funds are to be made available to pay off political debts over the last number of years.</P>

    <P>The position in the Department of the Environment is not exactly satisfactory to many public representatives.  Since Fianna Fáil resumed office two-and-a-half years ago the lists of housing applications have increased substantially, as has also the list of priority applications. Indeed, only the night before last Dublin Corporation had to declare a housing emergency, taking a decision to rehouse the 6,000 applicants, if possible, within the next two or three years.  That is a daunting task because it is obvious to me that there is not on the part of this Government the necessary commitment to ensuring the availability of funds for the building of council houses.  The whole tenor of this Government's policy in relation to housebuilding has been to help the speculator, speculative builders and those builders who supported the party opposite in the last election.  The speculative builders have gained substantially from the £1,000 new house grant.  Almost within a day of the announcement of that grant, house prices increased across the board by about <Col N="1966" /> £1,000.  That was a direct indication that this grant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, I must confine my remarks to subhead M which relates to licensed road vehicles and drivers.  The decision by the Minister to allow current holders of second or subsequent provisional driving licences to avail of full licences has been met in informed <Col N="1968" /> circles with unanimous condemnation. It has been accepted generally that there is a need for a uniformly high standard of driving.  The Minister's decision which arose from incompetence and from an unwillingness to provide the necessary manpower in this area is reprehensible.  If there was a problem in regard to delays, surely the Minister could have employed additional people to cater for the backlog of applications for driving tests rather than set about clearing up that backlog by means which are not likely to lead to a high standard of driving.  Having regard to the accident rate and to the number of deaths on the roads, the need for high driving standards is obvious.  But the Minister's decision has put in jeopardy any prospect of increasing the standard in this respect. Other EEC countries have looked at us askance.  They may even get the impression that we are a banana-type republic, that when we have a backlog of applications in any area, we deal with the situation by scrapping the applications and qualifying those concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the Deputy, there was no driving test in Belgium until less than two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in any way a good reflection on Belgium.  Anyone who lives abroad, especially in either France or Germany, will know what I mean when I say that there is not a very high standard of driving here.  One aspect in relation to driving licences with which I agree is the granting of full licences to holders of full licences in other EEC countries.  This is reasonable and acceptable but if there has not been a driving test in, say, Belgium or if Belgians have not passed a competency test in their own country, they should not be given a full driving licence here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subhead L relates to grants in respect of road works.  I wish again to raise the question of the infrastructural development of main roads.  The White Paper which was published by the Minister <Col N="1969" /> during the year and which concerns the development of roads, was couched in terms of money being available and in the context of the budgetary provision. Major spending, therefore, was being pushed back to the end of the eighties. While the White Paper was worth while in that it indicated that priority could be laid down in relation to the development of a road network, there would not appear to be a very high priority in this area except in respect of major roads linking the major cities.  There would not appear to be a high priority for other roads linking towns and cities.  In relation to my constituency there is an obvious need for the proposed high-level bridge in Waterford and for a whole network of roads around the city but clearly the Minister is dragging his feet in relation to the high-level bridge.</P>
    <P>The only other matter to which I wish to refer relates to the compilation of the register of electors.  Surely a more efficient way could be devised in order to ensure that we have an up-to-date and comprehensive register. The burden on rate collectors and on officials within local authorities in relation to the compilation of the register is too great.  What is involved is a complex and difficult task, especially in areas of new populations or of urban areas into which new populations are moving.  My experience during the elections held this year was that a large number of people in new housing areas who were entitled to vote were not on the register.  That was an indication that the register is not comprehensive or up to date.  I wish to make it clear that I am not in any way blaming the individuals involved in the compilation of the register.  I am suggesting that sufficient resources are not being invested in the proper compilation of a comprehensive register of electors.  The people involved are working on a shoestring budget.  I had hoped to discuss interest rates of building societies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to discuss the refusal by the Minister to introduce proper subsidies in regard to interest rates on house mortgages.  This is vital because of the rapid increase in house prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair wishes to point out to the Deputy that he did not stop him from discussing subsidies on interest rates, because there is a subhead on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, but I am not in a position to discuss housing policy generally.  In relation to subsidies, I merely wish to say there is need for substantial subsidisation of interest rates on house mortgages because of highly inflated house prices.  I am not talking about a new three or four bedroom house costing £10,000 or £15,000.  I am talking about such houses now costing between £30,000 and £40,000.  Even if both young people are working it is impossible for them to approach a building society and hope to complete repayments without being on the breadline for a period of 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government are genuinely committed to the prosperity of the building industry and to priority for private house building they will not succeed unless there is a scheme of proper subsidisation of house mortgage interest rates.  Young couples have many more problems than mortgage repayments.  They have to face the prospect of increases in family numbers and the possibility of unemployment. I have come across families, young happily married couples, who are not in a position to continue mortgage repayments.  They are the new poor of the country and there is a great social obligation on the Government to introduce a proper subsidy scheme.  For instance, the Minister could arrange that repayments in the first ten years would be at a very low level, excluding altogether repayment of capital in the early years.  In that situation the payments would be heavier in the next 15 <Col N="1971" /> years.  It would help young families to face the initial terrible challenge of setting up their own homes.  In present circumstances the £3,500 limit on interest payments for income tax purposes has become irrelevant.</P>

      <P>Twice in the past 24 hours from these benches the Labour Party point of view on the Minister for the Environment has been made clear by me and Deputy Quinn.

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal particularly with roads and to invite the Minister to indicate the policy he has on roads.  During his two and a half years in office there does not appear to have been a policy of any kind.  I am talking about the main roads from here to Cork, from here to the west and from here to the north.  We are getting many more articulated heavy trucks on these roads at all times of the day.  They are becoming a real hazard from the point of view of safe driving and I submit that is why we are having so many serious accidents. There has been a general deterioration in the standard of upkeep of these roads.  I am not satisfied enough is being done.  If we want to open up areas other than Dublin we must have proper lines of communication to them, a proper road network.  Since this Minister took over the Department, the quality of our roads has declined.  I am advocating a ten-year policy on main roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with traffic control.  From the point of view of traffic, Dublin is chaotically congested. There does not seem to be any form of control.  Cars are just allowed on to the streets.  There are various lobbies for and against new ring-roads but this is a matter which will be debated for some time to come.  However, the lead must come from the Department, but they are waiting for the various reactions and <Col N="1972" /> that is their excuse for not doing anything.</P>
    <P>The position in Cork city is the same: conditions are equally chaotic.  They have been demanding that remedial measures be taken by the provision of down-river bridges and alternative routes but the money is not forthcoming.  I would expect a Supplementary Estimate to be for the purpose of doing something constructive but this one does not propose to do anything constructive. Many towns are being paralysed because heavy traffic is permitted to run through them.  The provision of ring roads should be a top priority.  Naas, on the road to Cork, is a major bottleneck, while the road from Dublin to Enfield is so poor that traffic is reduced to a snail's pace.  Ring roads around Dublin would take a lot of the traffic from the centre of the city and relieve congestion there.</P>
    <P>We have all seen the chaos on our roads which occurs because of the absence of proper traffic control.  The Minister should outline his views in relation to that problem.</P>
    <P>A sum of money is provided in the Estimate for the provision of offices for An Bord Pleanála and the carrying out of renovations to existing accommodation. I should like to know if the Minister is satisfied with the length of time it takes to deal with appeals.  Some of the appeals take a long time.  The delays may be for genuine reasons but the Minister should tell us if that is so.  There is room for improvement because there appears to be a breakdown in that service to the public. This is not confined to An Bord Pleanála because, as we learned today, offices of another section of Government are to be closed for a period because of a backlog. That is not the sign of a healthy administration. The Minister should see to it that planning appeals are dealt with expeditiously, particularly in relation to domestic and private houses.</P>
    <P>It was natural to expect that those who benefited under the Minister's order in relation to driving licences were elated, but it should be remembered that the decision to introduce driving tests was to improve the competence of <Col N="1973" /> drivers.  We all know that the number of accidents in recent weeks have reached frightening proportions and it is understandable that people are asking if there is any relation between the decision to grant full licences to those who held two provisional licences and the increase in the number of road accidents.  We are all aware that a person who is injured or killed in an accident may not have been responsible for it.  A careless driver, who may not be aware of his or her guilt, may be responsible.  The Department should re-examine this matter.</P>
    <P>If we are of the view that driving tests are essential to prevent death and serious injury on our roads, we must retain them.  We cannot excuse any number of people from such tests.  The Minister has built up the expectations of many people who are hoping that next year there will be such a serious backlog that they will be given a full licence without having to do a test.  That is not good management. We must look very silly in the eyes of our European partners.  We have a testing system similar to other European countries but, because of a shortage of staff&mdash;I believe that was the reason&mdash;we decided to ignore it.  Is it the situation that we cannot get qualified staff?  I would have thought that if a proper pay scale was offered there would be many people anxious to take up the post.  It was scandalous to suspend the test, and that fact is related in the number of accidents that have occurred in recent weeks.  The Minister should announce that he will never suspend such tests again.  If he does not do that, people will postpone their test in the hope that the backlog will become so great that the Minister will suspend the tests again.</P>
    <P>The amount allocated for subsidies on mortgages, a scheme introduced in Dublin when money was not available from local authorities, not through their fault but because of the action of the Government of the day, has been increased from £74,000 to £98,000.  That is an indication in the increase in mortgage rates.  This will continue to be a serious problem because there is no guarantee that mortgage rates will not <Col N="1974" /> increase.  Bank interest rates are high and the credit squeeze may last longer that we expect.  For that reason building societies may not attract much investment, resulting in an increase in the mortgage rates.  The Minister should ensure that, if an increase takes place, mortgage holders do not suffer.  House prices must be examined because young couples are experiencing great difficulty in procuring a home.  The cheapest house one can buy at present is in the region of £20,000 and, with the interest rate at 14½ per cent, repayments are terribly high.  It is beyond the capacity of most young people to meet such huge repayments. Because of the extent of the repayments young couples live in fear of having a child.  That is unnatural because one of the joys of marriage is to have a child.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have a look at the whole question of finance for houses.  I suggest that the Government subsidise the interest rate in the first year so that repayments are on the capital sum only and that each year thereafter the mortgagee pays 1 per cent until the going rate is reached.  I accept that that would be a costly exercise, but the Government have a role to play in ensuring that society functions in a normal Christian way.  We should not be building up fears and deterrents.  If we do, we will encounter broken marriages; and we all know what that costs society in the long term.  It is important that the Minister examine the question of mortgage subsidies.  It is not new.  The idea of subsidising mortgages took root in other countries.  People with reasonably sound incomes are putting themselves on to the local authority waiting lists.  These people would rather provide their own homes but people earning from £4,500 to £5,000 can get, at a maximum, only a £9,000 loan from the local authority.  A building society just does not want to know a person earning that sort of money if the wife is not working.  There should be some realism in relation to the loans system and if the amount of the loan does not match up, the question of a subsidy should come into it.  The low <Col N="1975" /> rise mortgage scheme is a good form of subsidy and it should be considered for all couples so that they will have an opportunity to buy their own homes without the fear that if they buy a house they cannot afford to have a family.  I will contact the Minister again if I see nothing happening in this area.</P>
    <P>In the Supplementary Estimate additional money is provided for the compilation of the voting register.  I got a draft of the register for my electoral area and it is unreadable.  It would be of no use to anyone and certainly it would not be much good to the people working in polling stations checking off the people who come to vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of the Environment are responsible for this register, the printing of which is only a technicality.  Whether Cahills or the Stationery Office print it is only a point of argument but the Department of the Environment are responsible for this register.  Is this what the Department of the Environment are spending money on?  The register was a shambles in some areas in the European elections this year. At that time the Minister was asked by a number of Deputies what could be done to avoid the sort of thing where some people were not on the register even though they had been living at the same address for 20 years.  The Department must get on to the local authorities to ensure that this job is done well.  This slipshod method will have to be scrapped. The Department should be satisfied that this job was done properly and they should find out what the problems are and rectify them.  The electoral register is a very important document and it lists the people who have a right to vote for or against a Government or a local authority.  This slipshod method creates a lot of suspicion and I would ask the Minister to examine the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1976" /> Those are the main points I wish to make.  We are debarred from talking about money that was over on the housing side.  The Minister should tell us where we can get the relevant information. I was in the unhappy position of telling my local authority that I had been told by the Minister that we were underspending our capital allocation.  The local authority said they spent all their allocation.  I am not saying anyone is telling an untruth.  There is obviously a misunderstanding.  I did not wish to make a political point but would like to know the position regarding underspending and find out where it is.  We have a housing problem and any money we get from the Government should be spent.  If my local authority are not spending it I will chase after them to ensure that they do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The saving on housing is a saving on the subsidy and has nothing to do with the allocation for building houses.  I should like to thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  As regards the register of electors I hope the corporation will do an efficient job.  There is no restriction whatever on funds for the compilation of the register.  Extra money is being made available for this for the reasons given.  At this time of year we advertise extensively to ensure that people are on the register and avoid the kind of mistakes which Deputy O'Brien referred to and which came to light at the time of the local elections.  However, people are slow to fill the forms.  They leave them aside and forget about them. The rate collectors in the area are paid to check the register, put on new people and take off people who have left the area or who have died.  They also have the opportunity at the revision court as well as that of checking the draft register.  There is no restriction on the funds with regard to this.  We must depend on the local authorities to do the work.  We will inquire about the case of bad printing.  That should not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of the issue of a full driving licence to people with more than one current provisional licence.  I <Col N="1977" /> gave a full answer on this on 17 October and explained why it had to be done. Deputy Collins asked why I did not recruit more people.  I have recruited 25 per cent more people into this section over the last year and a half.  There was a backlog of 60,000 applications which was due to the postal strike.  People were waiting up to 11 months for tests.  Many of them were waiting to take up jobs for which they required a full licence.  To recruit more people would take several months because it is a long drawn out process.  I made the regulation primarily to deal with the backlog.  It is dwindling rapidly.  We will revert to the previous procedure when the backlog is cleared. The waiting time for tests will be about four to six weeks at most.</P>
    <P>The state of the roads was mentioned by Deputies O'Brien and Collins.  I shall send them both a copy of the national roads plan, published during the year, which set out in great detail what we aim to do over the next ten years.  It is the first time in the history of the State that any such plan has been published.  It will serve as a guide to the local authorities, who are the road authorities.  It is an achievable plan and covers the period up to 1989.  It not only includes roads but bridges.  Cork was mentioned by Deputy O'Brien.  With regard to having bridges in the Tivoli area, last February we made £50,000 available to Cork Corporation and County Council to come up with a feasibility study.  We are still waiting for that.  We are not letting things go as they are.  The plan is a major step forward and on its implementation we shall see great advantages in regard to economic growth and with regard to convenience for road users.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien mentioned An Bord Pleanála.  They suffered, like many other boards, because of the postal strike.  The board and staff have moved to new premises and better working conditions. Delays will not be as great as they were in recent months.  People like to have oral hearings and they must take a place in the queue.  Matters could be dealt with quickly if people did not want an oral hearing but it is their right to look for it and many of them get no hearing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1978" /> Deputy Collins mentioned the rising cost of housing in the context of a subsidy payable to building societies. Deputy O'Brien asked if we could do something about interest charges.  Under the SDA and low rise mortgage schemes, if one takes the year ended 30 September 1979, the total loan subsidies amounted to £44 million which financed the purchase of 6,200 houses.  People who would qualify for these loans are in the lower income groups.  Building society loan charges were subsidised in 1974 by 1 per cent for the purpose of attracting more deposits in order to provide money for house construction and house purchase.  While bank charges have risen in recent months, building societies have not increased their lending rates.  This should be appreciated.  While they stand at 14.15 per cent they are much lower than other interest rates.  I am glad to say that the deposits kept growing appreciably during the year even though they did not increase their deposit rates.  There is no question at the moment of introducing a subsidy for building societies.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt with all the points raised and I thank the Deputies for their contributions.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £8,300,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1979, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of certain other services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have only just been appointed Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, hopefully Deputies will not expect me to go into detail regarding this Supplementary Estimate.  Therefore, I propose <Col N="1979" /> merely to say briefly why an extra £8.3 million is needed.</P>
    <P>The main Estimate for my Department for 1979 was for a net sum of £117,588,000.  This supplementary Estimate makes additional provision for £16.1 million under three subheads but there will be savings of £2.5 million on subheads D, E, G and L. 1 and increased Appropriations-in-Aid of £5.3 million thus reducing the net additional sum required to £8.3 million.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate is necessary for three main reasons.  First, it provides for various increases in pay for which no provision was made in the original Estimate.  Secondly, it provides for an expenditure of £75.3 million on telephone development in 1979 as against £70 million in the original Estimate. Thirdly, it contains a provision for expenditure connected with the new interim boards for the telecommunications and postal services.</P>
    <P>An extra £12.8 million is needed under Subhead A.  This includes £10,000 for fees for the chairman and members of An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom and for the pay of any special staff these interim boards may need in 1979.  The bulk of the extra provision is, however, due to pay increases, including the cost of the first phase of the national understanding.</P>
    <P>The extra £2.8 million needed under subhead C is for additional sites and buildings for telephone development.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead J, an extra £500,000 is required to meet the higher cost of pensions and lump sums because of the national understanding and other pay increases.</P>
    <P>The increase of £5.3 million under Appropriation-in-Aid represents the recoupment of higher expenditure on telephone development under subheads A and C.</P>
    <P>The only novel provision in the Supplementary Estimate is the £10,000 I have already mentioned for the new interim boards for the telecommunications and postal services.  In effect the additional amount now required is needed <Col N="1980" /> because of the extent to which the public are using&mdash;and paying for&mdash;the Department's existing services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the new Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on his first appearance in the House and I wish him well in his job.  I only wish the circumstances had been somewhat different. I regret the departure of Deputy Fitzpatrick from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the transfer of Deputy Faulkner to the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>We expected that there would have to be a Supplementary Estimate to cater for losses incurred by the two major industrial disputes this year, and in particular the losses incurred by the postal strike.  We also expected as a result of the wage increases that were given, and rightly so, that extra money would have to be provided.  Obviously this Estimate makes that provision.</P>
      <P>The Minister is taking over a most difficult area.  I hope he can help to iron out the considerable problems that have arisen.  I am sure that the two boards mentioned by the Minister, namely, in connection with the telecommunications and postal services, will be effective.  I hope the people who have been put in charge of them, Mr. Smurfit and Mr. Quinn, will be able to bring about the type of efficiency and management that, sadly, has been lacking up to now.  We look forward to an improvement in the areas in question which I am sure will come about as a result of the expertise of the people concerned and the boards.  I know that the boards are only interim boards but it is a step in the right direction. Certainly we do not begrudge any money passed here today if it achieves the aims set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public are asking, do we have to have industrial strife and all this extra expenditure?  The Minister should investigate thoroughly the staff relations section in his Department because obviously there has been a great want in this area during the years.  It has become a symptom of our public services that if a person is old or is not particularly <Col N="1981" /> dynamic, he or she is shunted into the staff relations side of the job.  Probably the public sector has ended up with too many people who are unsuited for jobs dealing with industrial relations.  Far too often the best people are put into the technical side or other areas.  Of course those areas are very important but recently staff and industrial relations have become of paramount importance in every sector, whether public or private.  Far too many people who are dealing with workers have inadequate training and experience to cope with the problems that arise.  The result is militancy on the part of trade unions. We can hardly blame workers for reacting in that fashion if they are not treated with proper respect or if they are not managed in a proper way.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to tackle this problem immediately.  If it means taking people from the private sector, getting university graduates and getting highly qualified people in the public relations area, that must be done.  There is a great lack in our educational system basically and also in the public service because people are not trained specifically in staff and public relations.  It is left to pure chance and, as I pointed out previously, far too often that turns out to be wrong. The situation will have to be redressed and the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>I feel sorry for people in the Post Office and in the telecommunications sector who work hard, who take great pride in their job and who get a very poor return.  They are abused by the public for not providing a good service.  This is very unfair to the dedicated persons in the service.  It is unfair that they should be given a bad public image.  The Minister should ensure that the public relations section of his Department gives these people a chance to explain themselves to the public.</P>
    <P>I should like to compare operations in the public service with operations in the private sector.  The ESB are one of our better State bodies.  They do a good public relations job and their employees are given an opportunity to explain themselves publicly.  In all our cities and <Col N="1982" /> towns the ESB have offices.  One can go into any of these offices and discuss one's problems with the district manager or engineer.  That situation does not apply to the telecommunications area.  If one wishes to make a complaint about the telephone service, one has to make a telephone call to speak to someone one has never heard of in order to make the best possible case.  As that situation can be difficult even for a Deputy, what chance has the ordinary person got?  The impersonal service offered by the Department cannot be tolerated any longer.  I advocate the Department getting into business at ground level next door to the ESB offices or AIB offices. Such a move would reduce the friction between subscribers and staff.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy for telephone operators and for the members of the engineering staff as all they get from subscribers is a litany of abuse.  The area manager or somebody else should be available to take subscribers' complaints.</P>
    <P>Following the recent strike all subscribers were issued with an impersonal letter which was dictated by the then Minister, Deputy Faulkner, and signed by the Chief Accountant.  The letter asked subscribers who had difficulty getting telephone calls during the strike to lodge their complaints and advised them that they would stand a chance of getting refunds on their bills.  That letter may have satisfied some people but I believe that it did not satisfy the majority of telephone subscribers.  A number of my constituents have complained that they are not satisfied with the procedure. The Minister should set up a direct line of communication between subscribers and his officials.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not give us a breakdown of the losses incurred this year during the postal and telecommunications strikes.  The losses due to these two strikes must have been considerable, especially during the postal strike.  During a recent debate the previous Minister told us that there were heavy losses but I have not been given a breakdown of the figure.  People in the telecommunications business tell me that <Col N="1983" /> we should be making a big profit.  One expert told me that he would make a very good living with only one international line at his disposal.  Cities in Europe can be dialled direct from most of our automatic exchanges, yet we are unable to make a profit.  The Minister should tell us how the system can be run at a profit instead of having these two sections being subvented each year by the taxpayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is broadening the debate.  These matters will come up on the general Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not have to pass a Supplementary Estimate of £8,300,000 if the service was run properly.  I am told that the telephone service is not as bad as the letters to the newspapers would lead us to believe.  There have been complaints from industrialists who cannot get telephones installed, from people whose existing service is bad.  I am told that things could be improved if the main exchanges were updated. The exchanges in many areas have been changed from manual to automatic.  This has improved the service considerably, but it appears that in the main exchanges there is outdated equipment dating back to 1940.  As a result of the report of the review body set up by the previous Minister, recommendations have been made for the expenditure of £650 million over the next five years.  I notice that the amount of money being provided for 1979 has had to be increased from £70 million to £75.3 million.  The good work will have to continue, especially in the eight or nine main exchanges.  It is no good to me in Waterford to be able to dial Paris or Brussels if I cannot get through to somebody in, say, west Waterford, five or ten miles away.  Seemingly the method of transmitting calls and the equipment within these main exchanges is so antiquated that there are bound to be breakdowns because of overloading. <Col N="1984" /> That overloading can be rectified only by the replacement of that antiquated equipment by modern equipment and techniques.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the Minister any longer or to give him a baptism of fire.  Certainly, I do not blame him for the faults which have existed in these two sectors to date.  I wish him the best of luck in his task.  I hope that, with the help of the two interim boards recommended, he will do a highly efficient job.  It is probably one of the most challenging Ministries in the whole of the Government. It is exciting to be coming from a 100 per cent State position into a semi-State one where there is private enterprise involved.  I know the Minister has been very successful in his own sphere in this regard and I hope he will be likewise in the service of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister the best of luck in his new position, in which he will need all the luck he can get.  It was one of the wisest decisions of the new Taoiseach to change the Minister in this Department because, whether he was good or bad, the situation is that things have gone so terribly wrong over the past couple of years that a change could not do anything but good.  At least people cannot now blame this Minister for all the things that went wrong in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter which requires the Minister's immediate attention is that of the whole area of telephone and postal services.  It is somewhat irritating to be given the stock answer time and time again, when anything goes wrong in the telephone service, that this and that has been the result of recent industrial disputes.  I know that the proposal of the previous Minister to spend £650 million was accepted by those interested in the telephone service as being something that should be done.  But those of us who know how money is found in this House will realise that the prospect of finding that amount of money to do anything important, or unimportant, is so unlikely that the Minister need not worry unduly about how it will be spent.  If this £650 <Col N="1985" /> million is to be spent on improving the telephone service, I do not think it will be worrying him.  Neither do I think the new boards about which we are speaking will be any worry of his.  This is because whether or not he is successful, it takes so long to get anything like that started.</P>
    <P>However, with what is available to him at present, the Minister can effect big improvements.  He is a successful businessman and knows how things should be run.  A typical example of what I am speaking about was to be found here a couple of weeks ago when I put down a question to his predecessor and when his Minister of State told me that there was a whole area in which seven lines had not been operative for quite some time and that only three of the seven had ever worked.  He told me in this House that he would have the seven lines put into operation.  By the time the question was answered, the seven lines were in operation.  He said also that there were four new lines going up in the area of south Meath, but I had a letter from the Department the other day saying that they regretted that those four lines had not been put into operation because they had been damaged by gunshots.  I do not know whether or not something peculiar has happened there of which I have no knowledge, but that is the response I received from the Department. The Minister himself must take a personal interest in what is happening. Otherwise the same situation will obtain, the situation in which lines will be out of order, in which complaints will be made and overcrowded lines will cause chaos in industry as well as in private lives in the area.</P>
    <P>There is the other matter of where the necessary material or equipment is to come from.  As we are aware, for many years everything used in the telephone services was imported.  A few years ago when we assumed office we found that, although a lot of requirements could be produced here, they were not.  An effort was made by one of the Minister's predecessor to have some of this equipment manufactured here, which met with a certain amount of success.  But we are <Col N="1986" /> still dependent on imported equipment to improve the telephone services.  The money must be forthcoming.  We must keep pace with other countries attempting to improve their telephone services who probably have their orders placed before ours, with the result that we simply do not receive ours for quite some time afterwards.  With the vast experience available to us, with the vast numbers of people at present unemployed, why can we not manufacture some of this equipment here, thereby creating a situation in which it would be readily available?  Indeed, I would take a bet that one of the gentlemen who has been selected to run that service will not be very long in deciding to take that way out of the difficulty, because it is one of the most constant causes of complaint.</P>
    <P>In regard to the telephone service, I am sure the Minister, who up to a few days ago was a backbench Deputy, is aware of the appalling situation, even internally in this House, that the internal telephone system seldom works and that it is almost impossible to make a call outside the Dublin city area.  In my office there are five telephones, only one of which is working.  In my opinion nobody should be expected to accept that kind of service.  It is not because there have not been complaints lodged about it; the situation simply does not appear to be rectified.  Apparently the same situation applies in practically every other office in this House.  It is impossible to make outgoing calls to any place except the city.  Indeed, after a while I am sure such lines as are operative must get red hot because they are being used to such an extent.  But, in fact they also go on the blink and it is nothing unusual to find no telephone at all available in a whole section of this House.  It is absolutely ridiculous that such a situation should obtain at the end of 1979.  I am not blaming the new Minister for it, but it is something of which he will have to take cognisance.  We know there was a telephone dispute, but that was quite a long time ago and that excuse cannot be thrown up for the non-provision of services or not providing additional lines. God knows half the letters I write are to <Col N="1987" /> the telecommunications sections of the Department requesting telephone service in areas where there is practically none at present.</P>
    <P>One other point I would make in regard to the telephone service is that the Department seem to think that if they instal an automatic exchange they can immediately take everybody off that exchange and the whole thing will run smoothly.  This causes a lot of frustration because when a breakdown occurs the complaint goes to the few people who happen to be manning the switch.  The worse the service the more complaints there are to those people endeavouring to operate the system, and so the frustration continues.</P>
    <P>There are just two other matters to which I should like to refer in regard to the postal service.  We are coming up to Christmas now.  I think we will have a new low record of Christmas cards this year because the cost of printing them is so great.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for Ministers though.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am excluding them.  It should have been relatively easy for the State to arrange that the postage on Christmas cards be reduced to a nominal sum, or to, say, 5p, for a card sent in an open envelope.  I am sure that such a concession would be availed of widely. Instead, the postage is almost twice that sum and in addition there are the appalling prices being charged, in the top class stores as well as in the other stores, for Christmas cards which can only be described as rubbish.  It is unfortunate that people are being put in the position of having to say that they are not sending Christmas cards this year because they cannot afford them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each Christmas there is a considerable amount of overtime worked by postmen and sorters.  I appeal to the new Minister to ensure this year that when Christmas is over we do not have once again the unseemly wrangle that has gone on for the past 20 years whereby the people who do the extra work are <Col N="1988" /> promised verbally that they will be paid but find, having done the work, that somebody tries to shortchange them. There is no need for any such situation to arise.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, the Minister will endeavour to arrange that public relations in the Department, particularly in regard to staff, are brought to a level where it will not be possible for the State and a large number of its employees to lose millions of pounds between them merely because somebody fears that a decision taken might have some other effect at a later stage.  This year we experienced a postal strike which should never have occurred but the cost of which will continue to be counted for years to come.  Hopefully, the Minister will not allow anybody to talk him into allowing such a state of affairs ever to obtain again.  Today we have had a situation in which a Minister was able to intervene in a dispute which appeared to be almost impossible of solution.  Though he had to double what was recommended by the Labour Court he succeeded in bringing about a situation in which the people concerned can return to work and in which it appears as if everything is turning out all right.  The new Minister for Posts and Telegraphs might take note of that action on the part of his colleague and might ensure that he does not allow a situation to arise in which people could say that he, as Minister, tried to starve them into submission but failed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House but the subject before us is one that we could debate for a week without saying all that needs to be said.  First, I congratulate the Minister on his appointment. Since his election to this House he has impressed people as one who is concerned with the various issues in society. I am glad that he has been given responsibility at this level for what is a very important Department.  I wish him well in his new appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of whether the Minister's stay in the Department is long or short, I am confident that he will be concerned with the various issues involved, but the <Col N="1989" /> question of how much he will be able to do is a different matter.  Like the rest of us I am sure the Minister has been experiencing representations from increasing numbers of people in regard to the installation of telephones.  If any of us goes to his local for a drink at any time there is every chance of being approached by three or four people inquiring about telephone installations. Perhaps this does not happen to the same extent in the Minister's constituency but it is the situation in my area where there is so much development.</P>
    <P>When I spoke earlier in the year on the Estimate for this Department I made a request to the Minister which I thought was received favourably by him.  I pointed out the large numbers of people who were waiting to have telephones installed in the new housing estates in County Dublin and I asked that where it is not possible to meet applications in a housing estate for a long time, a few public telephone kiosks would be provided as a matter of urgency.  I appreciate the difficulties involved in meeting requests for telephones in vast areas of development, but, though I thought my suggestion was well received, there has not been any evidence of it being implemented.  I have in mind estates in Tallaght, Knocklyon and the general Templeogue area where there are people who have been waiting four years for telephone connections. That sort of situation warrants a crash programme.  I do not expect the Minister to have all the answers but I hope that at least he will have some ideas as to the putting into operation of such a programme.</P>
    <P>I have what I consider to be a serious complaint to make regarding this Department in relation to this question of telephones.  When I receive representations from somebody who has been waiting three or four years for a telephone I find that if I write to the Department all I receive is a stock reply to the effect that my representations have been received, are being looked into and that a reply will follow.  But the reply never materialises.  Because of this I have <Col N="1990" /> given up writing to the Department.  It appears that not only are public representatives and the applicants for telephones being frustrated by the situation but that civil servants are frustrated to the extent that while they acknowledge representations, the inquiries are not followed up.  I have explained this situation to constituents.  The situation is deplorable and the treatment of public representatives in this respect is reprehensible.  I do not know whether the Minister during his time on the back benches had such experiences also. Perhaps people on the other side of the House are treated a little better by the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is doubtful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be interested in hearing from some of the Ministers who have been promoted from the back benches as to what their experience was in relation to representations they may have made to the Department in relation to telephones.  We cannot afford to continue with this cheese-paring attitude in regard to telephones.  There is too much of that attitude in other areas.  If a county council plan a new road to a new area or a new road to service a new estate but find that a fairly long time will elapse before the necessary moneys are available, they usually put a rush job into effect in the interim.  People outside think it is a waste of time and money to put three or four public telephone booths in an estate where in two or three years nearly every household will have a private telephone.  I do not agree with that.  We have had experiences in Tallaght when the lack of a public telephone could have cost lives.  There have been numerous fires in the area and in one instance a person had to go nearly two miles to get a telephone through which to summon the fire brigade.  On another occasion a caravan went on fire and there was not a telephone within three-quarters of a mile.  I am referring to a densely populated new town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully made a point I had intended to make.  It has to do with the posting of Christmas cards.  Our postage <Col N="1991" /> rates are much higher than in most EEC countries.  I think it would be cheaper for me to post a Christmas card from here to Paris or other European cities than to post a card to the Minister.  That should not be the position.  The numbers using the Christmas post are decreasing and that is so for one reason.  It is not because people do not wish to convey Christmas greetings&mdash;indeed in many instances Christmas is the only time of the year when friends contact each other&mdash;but because of the high postage rates.  The Minister should try to reduce the rate on Christmas cards.  The Department would not lose anything by such a reduction because more people would use the post.  It would be worth the Minister's while to make such an experiment. I do not see why our general postage rates should be higher than in Britain, but that is another matter.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the provision of public telephone kiosks, my experience of dealing with the Department is that they expect to have the telephone installed in two years.  That does not happen, to the frustration of all, including the civil servants who, perhaps because of that, do not bother to reply to public representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Deputies who have contributed to the debate for their kind wishes.  I hope I live up to the opinion Deputies opposite have of me.  I will be trying to tackle one of the most difficult tasks facing any member of the Government, to try to set up an efficient telecommunications service and an efficient postal service.  It is what we all desire and the country cannot afford to do without it.  These services have not kept pace with other developments in the Irish economy.  Lack of finance over the years has been partly responsible, but this Government gave a commitment to develop a new communications service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been but a matter of hours in the Department&mdash;I was in the Seanad earlier in the afternoon&mdash;and I would have liked to have acquainted myself <Col N="1992" /> more fully with the workings of the Department.  I know the challenge that is there, I know the job of work that has to be done but it cannot be done without the provision of the proper tools.  In general, I welcome the suggestions made during the debate, I have taken note of them, and in the assessment I will be doing in the Department, starting tomorrow morning, I will bear these suggestions in mind.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties public representatives have had in relation to representations to the Department, but personally I have not had the same experience as Deputy McMahon.  I will look into the complaints he has made in relation to replies to Deputies and to the public.  I agree there is a public relations job to be done in the Department.  The Department is an organisation employing 28,000 people and it is not an easy thing to come in here to try to suggest simple solutions in an organisation of that size.</P>
    <P>Staff relations problems have been referred to but I must give these matters great consideration before I would be prepared to put any comments on the record.  A special committee was established under an independent chairman nominated by the Chairman of the Labour Court to review the Department's rules and regulations, disciplinary and consultative procedures.  The work of that committee is proceeding.  Furthermore, a mediation committee, also with a chairman nominated by the Chairman of the Labour Court, was established to deal with staff grievances which had not been settled in direct discussions.  A number of such problems have been resolved by that committee.</P>
    <P>Although it may appear to many people outside that proper attention is not being given to staff relations problems, from the brief knowledge I have and the information given to me by my predecessor, I appreciate the big job of work that has to be done in that area.  I know I am aware of the great efforts by my predecessors and I can assure the House that I will not be lacking in effort to try to improve staff relations.  I have <Col N="1993" /> worked as an employee and as an employer and I know that if you can get to the root of the problem before it starts to fester it is often easier to solve it.  I will bring this type of thinking to bear in the Department when I begin to examine the whole area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised an interesting point about equipment and the vast amounts of money being spent by the Department on equipment being imported. This has not gone unnoticed in the Department or by my predecessor. Much of the equipment is now being made in Ireland.  In my constituency, Ericsson of Sweden, one of the world's leaders in telecommunications, are manufacturing equipment.  Technicon are also in this work.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House and the Deputy to the fact that the IDA have a section known as the imports substitution section which has been very successful in substituting Irish manufactured goods for imports. The IDA carried out an in-depth study of the imports into this country and have been successful in establishing industries here to cope with that situation.  This will be kept under constant review by me in connection with the purchase of equipment for the Department.  Anything that is manufactured in Ireland will get priority as far as I am concerned.  That is my philosophy and it would be the philosophy of any Irish politician.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies, when referring to my term of office, queried whether it would be a long or short stay.  I do not know what evidence they may have that I might have a short stay, but I hope it is longer rather than shorter, because a short stay in the job that confronts me would not be very good.  I could not hope to produce the results Opposition Deputies expect from me if my stay were short.  There is a long job of work to be done and it will take a concentrated effort by everybody to succeed.  I must pay tribute to the management and staff in the Department on having gone so far in laying the foundations for what I believe will be a challenging task for me in trying to set up the two new boards, An <Col N="1994" /> Bord Phoist and An Bord Telecom. Those two boards are chaired by two successful businessmen who are presently engaged in carrying out their own assessment in the telecommunications and postal areas.  I will have an opportunity of meeting them next week.  I look forward to working with those two very successful Irish businessmen.  Hopefully, together we will be able to push forward the impressive programme the Government have laid out for us in developing a very efficient telephone and telecommunications service.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMahon raised a question about providing telephone kiosks.  I should like to tell him that where an area cannot be served immediately by telephone lines priority is given to the establishment of telephone kiosks.  I have noted the areas mentioned and I will communicate with the Deputy in relation to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy raised the question of the up-dating of the equipment in exchanges and I should like to tell him that that is part of the present programme in progress.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that there are problems in the telephone service.  I would not be foolish enough to deny that.  I am aware that a special committee, under Mr. Michael Dargan, set a minimum time limit of five years to try to bring the service up to an efficient standard.  That does not mean that in the interim we will not be endeavouring to improve the service.  I will be endeavouring to implement the programme as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>We face a major legislative operation in setting up the two semi-State boards. Many of the matters complained about today can only be properly tackled by such boards.  They are not easy to deal with in present circumstances.  This is all part and parcel of the new thinking in relation to the two boards and, hopefully, we will introduce the necessary legislation soon.  I look forward to that move, like everybody in the country, because a proper telecommunications service is the cornerstone of a good viable economy.  As a former industrialist <Col N="1995" /> I am aware that people use the telephone and telex systems extensively. Industrialists want a good service and they are prepared to pay for it, because without it their business, and hopes for expansion, are severely handicapped.  I look forward to the challenge of this new position.  I will give it all the effort I can and, if I fail, it will not be for the want of trying.  I do not intend to fail.  I intend to do the best I can.  With the full cooperation of the management and staff of the Department we can go forward from there.  The foundation stone has been laid and together we can deliver an excellent and competent telecommunications and postal service.</P>

      <P>The main Estimate for Army Pensions for the year ending on 31 December 1979 is for a net sum of £15,774,000. The Supplementary Estimate which I am now introducing is for an additional sum of £1,450,000.  The gross Supplementary comprises £1,635,000 for pensions and allowances, reduced to £1,450,000 by estimated savings of £185,000 including an increase of £50,000 in Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main Estimate included a provision of £118,000 towards the cost of the increases in pensions and allowances <Col N="1996" /> which came into operation from 1 July 1979.  The additional sums now sought are required to meet the cost of the actual increases.</P>
    <P>In the case of Military Service Pensions&mdash;subhead D&mdash;and allowances and gratuities paid to dependants under subhead C, the increase with effect from 1 July 1979 amounted to 21.8 per cent. Deputies will be interested to hear that at present there are about 3,000 military service pensioners in receipt of pensions and there are 4,200 widows of military service pensioners in receipt of allowances equal to one half of their deceased husband's pension at current rates subject to a minimum amount of £188.76 a year.</P>
    <P>Special allowances, which are provided for in subhead G, have been increased three times this year.  In addition to the specific increase of £100 announced in the 1979 Budget, there were two subsequent increases which together amounted to £70.  Effectively, therefore, special allowances have been increased at the rate of £170 per annum from 1 July 1979.  At present there are some 6,000 special allowance holders involved.</P>
    <P>As regards Defence Forces Scheme Pensions&mdash;subhead E&mdash;increases at various rates, depending on former rank, retrospective to 1 July 1978, have been granted.  Effective from 1 July 1979 the increase has been of the order of 10 per cent and a further increase of 9 per cent also effective from that date has been approved.</P>
    <P>As regards savings, these are made up of £6,000 for wound and disability pensions&mdash;subhead B; £69,000 in respect of grants for free travel and so on&mdash;subhead L&mdash;and £60,000 for funeral grants&mdash;subhead M.  In addition there is an increase of £50,000 in Appropriations in Aid&mdash;subhead N.</P>
    <P>Taken together the effect of these savings is, as I said at the outset, to reduce the current requirement by £185,000 to a net sum of £1,450,000.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish <Col N="1997" /> him the best of luck and every success in the future.  I pay tribute to Deputy Molloy, who formerly held the post.  I understand that Deputy Molloy was popular with the Army and that they were very sad to see him go.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Estimate and would appeal to the Minister to grant the special allowance without a means test. The recipients of the special allowance are fewer each year and the Minister should pay attention to the means test.</P>
      <P>In relation to the targets we have set for the services, I understand that the Army target is 15,000 persons, the Navy target is 1,500 and the Air Corps is 700 persons.  This year I understand that 1,000 men have left the Army and that the Navy is 800 persons short.  The reason for this could be the poor pension rights, which would not encourage a person to join.  Pensions must be improved if we are to encourage people to join. Also the same pension rights should be granted to the Womens Corps when it is set up in the Army.</P>
      <P>I paid a visit to our troops in the Lebanon and while I was there tributes were paid to the behaviour of our troops and with regard to the wonderful job they are doing there.  President Sarkis of the Lebanon pointed out that we were one of the leaders in the field of peace keeping and have been for the past 20 years, and he also pointed out the dangerous task ahead of our troops. When I visited our troops in the southern part of the Lebanon I found them a little unhappy about pay and pension conditions. Will the Minister look seriously at the position of pensions with a view to encouraging more people to join the services?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year we were given a list of legislative items that were to be introduced in the House.  One of those items was an Army Pensions Bill to provide for enhanced pensions for <Col N="1998" /> widows or dependants of soldiers killed or who had died from wounds.  This Bill was of personal interest because of a tragedy which occurred when a member of the Army from my constituency was killed while on special duty on a parachute course in Peterborough in England some years ago.  Deputy Molloy, as Minister for Defence, and I had considerable correspondence and discussion about this case.  The outcome of that discussion and correspondence was that the Minister agreed to introduce amending legislation which would cover this case and any similar case that might occur in the future.  As yet, this Bill has not been introduced.  I would ask the new Minister to introduce this amending legislation promptly in the new year to ensure that the family of the late Corporal Michael Rouine, who was killed in Peterborough in 1976, is paid compensation and that any other people who are the victims of tragedies that might occur in the Army at home or abroad are also compensated.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the remarks of Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Ryan in relation to my appointment as Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised the question of the means test.  This has been raised at regular intervals and the Deputy will appreciate that the special allowance is to give a measure of support to veterans who because of age or incapacity are not in a position to support themselves.  Considerable changes have been made in the means test over the years and it is not particularly severe at the moment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned the Women's Corps.  They will be entitled to the same benefits as the men under the Defence Forces pension schemes.  The question of whether it will be necessary to bring in special legislation for that purpose is being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan raised a particular case. The position is that an Army Pensions Bill will be introduced in the near future, which among other things will enable late application such as in the case mentioned to be submitted.  I hope to have <Col N="1999" /> the Bill introduced in the next session. On behalf of the Army I appreciate the compliments paid to the members of our Defence Forces who are serving abroad.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £31,000,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1979, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants. </P>

      <P>I am sorry that the newly-appointed Minister for Social Welfare is not available this afternoon.  I had hoped that we could have a word with him to impress upon him how this Department has been neglected over the last two-and-a-half years.  However, I am sure the new Minister will check up on what was said in the House.  I congratulate him.  He is a most courteous and friendly Deputy.  He appears to be hard working and deserving of the promotion the Taoiseach gave him. Perhaps now social welfare will get the attention it deserves.  It is disappointing that the Taoiseach did not see fit to include in his first group of junior ministers a Minister of State for the Department of Health and Social Welfare.  I would have thought this would have been a priority but reflecting on the Taoiseach's treatment of this Department over the last two-and-a-half years it was a bit much to expect because he did not see fit to give the Department the attention it deserved.  As a result the less well-off people suffered. This is not an easy thing to say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It will affect this Department which has been teamed with another.  The Minister appointed holds office in a dual capacity.  I was not in the House when the announcement was made but I believe two junior Ministers were appointed to two Departments. Here we have a Minister holding two Departments and he has no junior Minister.  It is disappointing that that is the situation.</P>
      <P>With the ever-increasing cost of living, rapid inflation and dwindling value of money life is becoming harder for the old, sick, the infirm and all who live on social welfare payments.  There are people who in some instances are due a miserable payment and have had to wait four, five and six weeks for their social welfare cheque.  That is a deplorable situation for the weakest section of the community who have no trade union or organisation to speak for them.  When the previous Minister took office it probably looked as if social welfare could easily be teamed in with another Department.  Now it has come to a stage where it will require the attention of the Minister who is independent of other duties.  I should like to impress upon the Taoiseach the great need that this Department should get more attention than he gave it.  His thoughts may have been in other directions and he may have thought that what he might do in social welfare would not get him the required publicity or give him the required lift to put him into the position he is in today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department needs the attention of a Minister.  The Taoiseach has made known that he intends to appoint more Ministers of State.  I hope the first and best of these will be appointed to the Department of Social Welfare if he does not see fit to give this Department to a Minister who is independent of all other duties.  I wish to put on record that the Minister for Social Welfare who has just left office was a dismal failure.  I praised the Taoiseach only last week for his efforts <Col N="2001" /> in the Department of Health but I cannot extend those compliments to this Department.  When he was appointed to these two positions he seemed to forget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We had a whole day on this.  The Deputy should deal with the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the treatment of the Department of Social Welfare and it cannot be connected with the debate we had earlier in the week.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to reconsider and if possible appoint a Minister specifically for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>We are living in a time when it would appear that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.  There were miserable increases in social welfare allowances in the last budget. Now that it appears we will be getting a long rest over Christmas from the day-to-day duties of the House, the new Minister will be able to give more attention to this Department and persuade the Cabinet of the necessity for a tremendous financial injection into the Department so that we can see worth-while increases in the next budget.</P>
      <P>There was some talk about electricity units being raised from 200 to 300.  It appears that this was simply talk&mdash;whether in an effort to get publicity or not I do not know.  Nothing has been heard about it since.  No increase has been made in the units of electricity.  The free fuel scheme that the former Minister made so many promises about has been diabolically treated.  We have a free fuel scheme which is in operation since 1942 or 1943.  It was brought in at that time to deal with the situation that existed.  It is still in existence with very little change. The only change is that instead of having to take one cwt. of turf per week those eligible now receive a fuel voucher which can be used in payment for heating, coal or electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that it was raised time and again in the House and that the Minister on a number of occasions undertook <Col N="2002" /> to revamp the whole scheme this is the only change.  I am surprised the Taoiseach did not realise the misery it was causing in the city particularly as he represents a city constituency.  My own constituency comes into Dublin city where the greatest hardship is.  Apart from the hardship they had last winter when it was only possible to exchange the vouchers for turf, very often the turf was not available and that through a long winter of snow and frost.  If the truth were known there were serious consequences but I have not proof of them and so cannot go into it here.</P>
    <P>The people eligible for fuel vouchers had enormous difficulty in exchanging them for turf.  I know that there was a difficulty with a strike, but the problem in obtaining turf supplies extended far beyond the period of the strike.  In many cases old people had to collect the turf in trucks and trolleys, sometimes in prams and on bicycles.  They could not do this during the period of snow and frost and, consequently, they were without fuel.  I know of people who had to pay almost as much in delivery charges as the cost of the fuel itself.  They would have been better off to go to the local store and to pay for the turf rather than use the vouchers because at least they could be sure of delivery.</P>
    <P>The postal strike caused great hardship to those in receipt of social welfare payments, but let us not make that strike the excuse for everything that has gone wrong.  It appears to me that Government Departments and business people are doing this.  I believe that the effect of the postal strike has been over-emphasised. The Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Social Welfare, must be given credit for the action he took during the strike when the voluntary organisations stepped into the breach.  At the time he indicated he was not prepared to have the social welfare cheques delivered by hand.  I am quite sure that if we had another postal strike nobody would object to that.  I am satisfied that the trade unions would have no objection to the delivery of <Col N="2003" /> social welfare payments by people employed by the Department.  I accept that it would be costly, but we have some very expensive schemes for the benefit of people who are much better off and who are in a much better position to look after themselves than those depending on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the new Minister to look into this matter and to ensure that there will not be a recurrence of the hardship suffered by people in the past.  I am referring not only to those in receipt of free fuel but also to those who suffered hardship because of the delayed payment of their benefit due to the postal strike.  In many cases people were six weeks without social welfare payments and this was brought to the attention of many of us during the campaigns in the two by-elections in Cork.  Perhaps the Taoiseach welcomed that; it may have been of assistance to him in his efforts. However, I hope he would not wish suffering on the needy in order to achieve what he has achieved in the past week.</P>
    <P>The new Minister should accept that there has been much suffering among the needy in the past 12 months.  For the aged, the infirm and those depending on social welfare, it has been the worst year for a long time.  In recognition of that I appeal to the new Minister to give a double payment for Christmas.  It would not cost all that much and it would be a nice gesture from the new Government.  A double payment of this kind would be of considerable help to the old, the aged, the infirm, the blind and all those in need.  It might help the Taoiseach in his honeymoon period in office.  It might get him some publicity, but perhaps he is not as anxious today for publicity as he has been in the past.  I should like to hear from the Minister whether he is prepared to consider the suggestion of giving an extra week's payment now.  In order to be of benefit to the recipients for Christmas it would have to be done immediately.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure this is relevant to the Estimate.  I am looking forward to an immediate updating and extension of the free fuel scheme.  I want to ensure that people in receipt of vouchers can get fuel.  Even though people use electricity, many homes still depend on solid fuel.  For the first time in many years, countless homes are using solid fuel; people have switched to solid fuel burners or open fireplaces.  No matter what kind of voucher is given, what use is it if the fuel is not available?  This was the case in the past fortnight. Because of a strike, or for some other reason, Coal Distributors Limited are refusing to take orders from homes in part of my constituency&mdash;in Tallaght, Rathcoole, Newcastle and Saggart. Companies are not prepared to deliver fuel in these areas.  Of course many others are suffering also but today my concern is for those who are in receipt of fuel vouchers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should have a look at the stocks of fuel that may be available to the health boards.  An assurance was given that they would hold stocks for emergency purposes in case the usual channels of supply were cut off.  I am not satisfied that there are adequate stocks available and recently we nearly got to a situation where this would have been tested.  I am glad that did not happen. The strike did not continue, but it was a close thing.  I am afraid the health boards have not taken adequate steps to ensure <Col N="2005" /> that they have fuel for the old and aged. It is a matter of life and death for those people.  We can manage to keep ourselves warm but the aged depend on receiving their fuel vouchers.  Few realise the value of the voucher to the aged.</P>
    <P>The Minister changed the system by introducing a cash voucher but the allowance is still miserable and would not buy sufficient fuel to keep anybody warm.  I have no doubt that many lives will be shortened if we have a period of snow and frost because the allowance will not provide sufficient fuel.  At the time the change was made the new vouchers were welcomed but today the allowance would only provide half a week's heating.  The allowance should be increased by at least 200 per cent.  Even an increase of 200 per cent will hardly meet the heating costs of many people.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish the new Minister a good term in office, whether it be long or short.  As I said, he was worthy of promotion and I have no doubt that he will attend to his responsibilities.  He is a likeable and able man and he performed his duties as a junior Minister in an excellent manner.  I hope it will be possible to continue to compliment him. However, we can only compliment him on his performance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the new Minister well.  I had some dealings with him the other evening before he became Minister and he was courteous to me.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate before the House is for £31 million, which is a large sum of money.  Most of the money has been allocated under subhead E&mdash;payment to the social insurance fund under section 39 (9) of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  The original Estimate was £55,990,000 and the additional sum required is £24,490,000, which is roughly half the original Estimate. The Estimate gives us an insight into the situation of those who are on public assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had dealings on many occasions with the Department and I have found that the staff are generally helpful and courteous.  They will go to endless <Col N="2006" /> trouble to ensure that people get their entitlements. We are told that the extraordinary events this year are due to the postal strike.  When he was Minister for Social Welfare, the Taoiseach made a great effort to ensure that people received their entitlements.  There were some mishaps&mdash;payments for Drogheda went to Mullingar and so on&mdash;but the Minister made an effort for which he deserves the gratitude of the recipients of the benefits.</P>
    <P>Since the postal strike ended people have had difficulty in getting regular payments.  For instance, it is not unusual for someone on disability benefit to be paid regularly for five or six months, to receive no payment for three or four weeks, then for regular payments to be resumed.  For some reason it has been difficult for people to get payment of the arrears from the Department.  In regard to pensioners who first applied for the pension early in the year, it is not unusual for them to have to wait a long time before they receive a pension book with perhaps only three or four payments in it.  It is also difficult for them to get payment of the arrears from the Department.  It is not good enough to tell these people that they must wait until early in the new year for their arrears.  In many cases the arrears have been over £200.  They should be paid as soon as they qualify as pensioners.</P>
    <P>The same situation applies to the payment of unemployment benefit.  If I did not know that the officials concerned are conscientious I would say that the fault lies in the administration of the scheme.  I would ask the Taoiseach to hazard a guess as to the cause of the delays.  A person who has been employed for many years may find that his cards have not been stamped.  I believe that many clever people are getting away with it by showing the social welfare payments and PAYE they have deducted from their employees wages as profits.  There are far too many of them in the country. They come to light only when people like myself investigate cases of people who have applied for benefit and who are informed that their cards have not been <Col N="2007" /> stamped.  This sort of thing is wrong and should not be allowed.  An intense effort should be made to ensure that an employer is forced to stamp cards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No more cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is aware of what I am speaking about&mdash;the stamp content in PAYE, whether it is called PRSI or anything else, is the sort of thing about which I am speaking; that is still deducted from wages and is still not being sent in to the Department.  In the past week I have had representations from somebody looking for dentures, somebody else for optical treatment, two people whose wives had had confinements, three people who had applied for disability benefit or unemployment benefit, all of whom were refused benefit because it was found that their cards were not in order.  When the heat was put on subsequently the cards were put in order.  I understand that the Department have officials in most large towns anyway whose job it is to investigate such matters and ensure that they are properly dealt with.  This must be attended to because it is causing hardship to what might be described as the poorest people in the country, people who can least afford to be treated in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the payments being made causes a lot of trouble also.  For instance, why is it so difficult to have pay-related benefit paid to those entitled to it?  Having filled up all the necessary forms, having paid unemployment or disability contributions, or whatever, why is it necessary to have representations made by a public representative to have those payments properly made. This has to be done in many cases.  We were talking in this House a couple of weeks ago about an ombudsman, when somebody contended that this should be one of his functions.  I do not believe an ombudsman should be required to undertake such a task; in any case the applicant probably would be either reemployed or dead before the payments would be cleared were it left to him.  I resent <Col N="2008" /> the necessity for a public representative to be called on, that somebody has to come and tell all their business to a public representative before they can get what they are entitled to and for which they have been stamping cards or paying contributions for many years.  These are the little things which cause so much trouble.  The same applies to the other benefits administered by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The amount of additional finance sought here for grants to local authorities for the supply of fuel to necessitous families, £780,000, may seem to be a large sum but, when spread over the entire country, it is not so very big.  Again the scheme under which that is administered is anything but satisfactory. There will have to be a big shakeup of that scheme under which coal distributors, not alone in Dublin city but elsewhere, are at present finding they cannot meet orders.  Indeed the same situation obtains in bog areas.</P>
    <P>I come from a country district where people have for generations been getting turf from bogs.  When Bord na Móna went in, instead of cutting their own turf they bought from Bord na Móna, or a small contractor bought and delivered to those people who would be receiving assistance towards the cost of their fuel. I understand that, by Ministerial Order, most of the turf which is cut on many bogs has to be retained in case it is needed by the ESB.  In one large bog I know of, one contractor has received all delivery rights which means nobody else can get any turf.  And the really poor people over that tremendously wide area, who were always dependent on small contractors, cannot now get any fuel at all; they are dependent on the odd coal lorry coming their way, and a coal man who will go into a bog area would need to have his head examined.  This is very wrong and the new Minister must pay attention to it.</P>
    <P>There is then the figure of £200,000 for additional grants for free travel.  I wonder how that £200,000 extra arose. Is it because costs have risen, or does the Taoiseach intend that the system under <Col N="2009" /> which a husband and wife must travel together in order to avail of free travel will be changed?  It is ridiculous because one often discovers the case of a couple where the husband is bedridden and the wife cannot travel into the local town because she cannot use the travel voucher.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that the amount of free electricity allowed is far too little and that something must be done to increase the number of units allowed.</P>

      <P>If I might interrupt there in regard to the £200,000, the Deputy will recall that during the postal strike we removed the peak hour restriction on the free travel to enable old age pensioners to get to centres for their pensions. That is where the extra cost came in.  But it does not affect the Deputy's other point.</P>

      <P>There is another name for that one.  Then there is the figure of £2,292,000&mdash;grants to health boards towards the cost of supplementary welfare allowances, this, with repayment from the Social Insurance Fund of amounts paid initially as social assistance&mdash;am <Col N="2010" /> I to assume that they are repayments in respect of people who are awaiting social welfare benefit?  The additional figure is so big that it illustrates the amount of poverty, of real want there is in the country.  Despite the fact that the Minister's predecessor changed the name from home assistance to supplementary welfare allowance, there are still people who do not want to look for what they call home assistance and they will do so only when they are in dire straits.  I made inquiries yesterday about a person who was due a very substantial sum of money for old age pension.  He had been paid a certain amount of social assistance but&mdash;something I found to be rather unusual&mdash;the entire amount due was paid directly by him back to the health board who had paid the social assistance.  Normally such a person is given at least some of it and allowed to pay it back over a period but, in this case, the whole amount was deducted and that was that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal now with the transfer of people from one type of benefit to another.  For instance, if somebody is drawing disability benefit, and he wants to draw the retirement benefit to which he is entitled because he will be unable to work again, firstly I understand it is not in order for the Department to issue application forms to anybody.  The person is not allowed to get that form because the system stipulates that the application be made in writing and then the disability benefit people are asked: is this person entitled to this?  If they are entitled a form is sent to them, but if they are not entitled they do not receive any form.  This seems to be a complicated way of dealing with the situation.  Very often the person applying for the transfer applies to the disability benefit section rather than to the invalidity benefit section, with the result that as soon as negotiations are begun with the invalidity benefit section the payment of disability benefit is discontinued, especially if it is a benefit that is paid on a long-term basis such as for a month or for a longer period.  This should not happen. The relevant forms should be issued in the same way as any other form is <Col N="2011" /> issued and there should not be any delay whatever in the changeover between the two types of payment.  The changes that occur in this regard are the cause of much hardship and suffering to the people concerned because for the few weeks during which they do not receive payment they would not be likely to be able to buy sufficient food.</P>
    <P>A similar situation arises very often in the case of an application for transfer to an old age pension in her own right from a woman who has just become widowed or in the case of a woman applying for a widow's pension.  There is no justification for any delay in such cases.  These delays are very often the cause of much of the criticism&mdash;perhaps not all of it justified&mdash;that is levelled at the Department.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach to ensure that social welfare benefits are brought up to a level relative to the spiralling cost of living.  Though the Department are now in the hands of another Minister, the Taoiseach should ensure that hardship is not caused to social welfare recipients as a result of the ever-increasing cost of living.  It simply is not possible that the level of payments is adequate to enable people to feed themselves properly, never mind buying clothes or shoes, which are very expensive. Hopefully, we will witness the result of the Taoiseach's social conscience in this regard.  While the person may be all right who is still at work and who is in a position by way of negotiation or, if necessary, by way of strike to be granted an increase of as much as £9 per week, the person who has retired, who has been made redundant or who is out of work for any other reason is expected to cheer if he is offered an increase in benefit of £2 per week.  A loaf of bread costs the same to the retired man as to the one who is working.</P>
    <P>I tried hard to have something done to rectify the situation during my time in office. I believe that, with the assistance of my colleagues then, I had some measure of success, but much more needs to be done.  There is not much point in talking <Col N="2012" /> about a social conscience if there are people who are not in a position to buy adequate food for themselves or to clothe themselves.  When one considers that a pair of shoes for a child can cost in the region of £9, one wonders how social welfare recipients can afford to buy footwear for themselves.</P>
    <P>While it is right that we should pass this Supplementary Estimate, we can only hope that the budget will result in our being able at least to see that the amount of money required is provided in this area, so that towards the end of next year it will not be necessary for us to consider a Supplementary Estimate when the money being asked for is likely to have been spent already.</P>

      <P>My apologies to the Taoiseach.  I do not intend to delay the House for very long.  However, there are some points I should like to make in regard to this very important area in the hope that what I have to say may in some way help the less fortunate among us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free fuel scheme could be improved greatly.  One of the difficulties in regard to the scheme relates to the arrangement whereby the vouchers are collected at the local social welfare office. This means that the people concerned must make a couple of trips, whereas if they could collect the vouchers at the post office at the same time as they are collecting their pensions they would have to make only one journey. Many of the people concerned would be old or undernourished and would have difficulty in attending both at the post office and at the social welfare office on the one day.  As the vouchers are distributed during the winter months, the journey to the social <Col N="2013" /> welfare office often has to be made in very bad weather conditions.</P>
    <P>This scheme should be extended into rural areas.  Though there is provision for this under the supplementary welfare scheme, there should be definite arrangements regarding the scheme itself so far as rural areas are concerned.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this scheme that might be reconsidered relates to the period during which the vouchers are made available, usually from October to March.  This is the time during which there is the greatest difficulty in getting supplies of fuel, even for those who can afford to pay for it.  Therefore, the Taoiseach might consider arranging for the vouchers to be issued during the summer so that those concerned would be in a position to stock up on fuel for the winter.  I appreciate that in some cases there would be a lack of facilities for the storing of fuel, but I am sure that many of the people who qualify under this scheme would be able to stock some fuel.  The adoption of this suggestion should prove to be very helpful.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that social welfare beneficiaries have been experiencing much difficulty in regard to the receipt of their cheques.  Obviously, the postal strike was responsible for long delays during a prolonged period, but that strike has been over for some time and we still find that these people are left without their cheques for long periods. There are delays of many weeks.  When such people do not get their cheques by post on the day they are expected, they dare not go into shops to get credit and they cannot go to a bank to get credit.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the Taoiseach is sincere about this scheme, which affects an underprivileged section, but the policy must be changed in the Department.  The administration should be decentralised. That would save people whose cheques are delayed the trouble of going to their public representatives to try to get what is justly theirs.  They would then be able to go to local offices of the Department to confront the officers.  Decentralisation would improve the entire social welfare system, which at the moment leaves a lot <Col N="2014" /> to be desired.  It is an indictment of all of us that people depending solely on social welfare benefits should be held up in the way I have described.  No matter how valid or justified the Department's excuses seem to be, delays of even one week represent a tragedy to such people. A postal or any other strike should not be held to be responsible.</P>
    <P>The administration of the supplementary welfare scheme is fouling up payment of benefits.  I have knowledge of cases being stopped by the Department because money was due by the would-be recipients where there had been previous over-payment.  Disability benefits can be paid to insured persons only, and nobody in this State has any right legally to benefit unless he is insured, and neither have the Department a right to stop disability payments to any insured person.</P>
    <P>It is the system which is responsible for delays, and therefore, because this involves the less well-off members of the community, the system should be changed.  This Department was set up and reorganised to get away from the home assistance system, but there is something wrong with a Department which is responsible for the tragic delays there have been in paying benefits to those people.  The people I have been talking about are insured people who have been paying for their stamps down through the years.  However, because of something that is happening in the Department they must go to the local office very often to draw a supplementary welfare benefit.  That benefit was intended to improve the scheme, but, in effect, it is doing the opposite.</P>
    <P>I wish the new Minister well in his new post and I hope he will apply himself to the Department of Social Welfare because, as we all know, we could never do enough for the unfortunate people who seek benefit from it.  On the question of free travel it is unfortunate that the person who qualifies must be accompanied by the spouse before the spouse can benefit.  Both of them should enjoy free travel.  One of the partners who holds the free travel permit may be sick <Col N="2015" /> but, because of the restrictions of the scheme, the other partner must pay when travelling on public transport.  That is a denial to both people.  If a person qualifies for free travel the Department should allow the other partner the same concession.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach is anxious to improve the social welfare system he should embark upon a policy of decentralisation. In granting increases to beneficiaries under the social welfare system the Government should allow for possible price rises and a rise in inflation.  In spite of the efforts of successive Governments to control inflation they have not succeeded with the result that increased allowances lose their value often before they are received.  The Taoiseach should do everything within his power&mdash;he is all powerful now and the best of luck to him&mdash;to improve the lot of those people. He must see to it that such people are given an increase that will more than compensate for the increase in the cost of living.  I subscribe to the sentiments expressed by Deputy McMahon in relation to the new Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  We need a change of policy in relation to social welfare but it would be a help if the Taoiseach, when naming the five others Ministers of State, included a Minister of State for the Department of Social Welfare.  Those Departments are very involved with people.</P>

      <P>I will not detain the Taoiseach very long.  I am concerned about the burning question of delays in the payment of social welfare benefits in the last 11 months.  I should like the Taoiseach to tell the House the reasons for those delays, particularly in relation to disability benefits.  In my years in politics nothing has caused me more anguish and concern than the fact that <Col N="2016" /> the suffering people with large families have not received their benefits on schedule.  People have had to endure delays not just of days and weeks but months since the postal strike commenced. I have not been able to explain to my constituents the reasons for those delays.  This is the first occasion when I have had an opportunity to put that question.  People who have been out of work for up to three months had to await payments for more than that length of time.  Several reasons have been advanced for this delay but I am anxious to hear the truth.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the postal strike was the initial reason and it was alleged when that strike ended that there may have been a plan to slow down the outflow of cash because of a shortage.</P>
      <P>It has been a nightmare trying to get in touch with the Department of Social Welfare by telephone.  The telephone number of the Department is 786444 but it is literally impossible to get through.  It appears that there is not sufficient staff to deal with the calls.  If one is successful in getting through one experiences lengthy delays.  I pity those who must use a coin box because after waiting hours to get through they may have to wait for a long time while inquiries are made but before they get a result to those inquiries the time has passed and their exercise is futile.  We are due an explanation. I admit that matters have improved somewhat but I should like to know what was happening during the summer.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I asked the Minister if he would make concessions with regard to widows, the forgotten section in our society.  They have not benefited from any of the extended services which have been given to pensioners and other social welfare recipients.  I got an inkling from the Minister's reply that he was about to announce some increased benefits.  Is there any hope of extending things like the free electricity allowance and the free travel to widows, who find it extremely difficult to exist on the present allowances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2017" /> We were all disappointed that during the past two and a half years no effort was made to reduce the present retirement pension age from 66 to 65.  In the National Coalition term of office the age was reduced over four years from 70 to 66.  The Government could have reduced the age further without any great cost.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the South Eastern Health Board, who sent resolutions to the Department of Social Welfare and to the Minister in relation to why the free fuel scheme was curtailed.  The Minister had also been asked to receive deputations on this matter.  The scheme was sanctioned in the case of the Eastern Health Board and the Western Health Board but apparently other health boards were refused permission to operate and finance this scheme.  Was this because of purely financial considerations or was there some other reason?</P>

      <P>One of the points raised in this debate was the question of the assignment of a Minister of State to either one of the two Departments.  That matter will be considered. I have discussed it with the new Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I categorically reject the suggestion that I neglected the Department of Social Welfare during my tenure of office there.  When I took over the Department <Col N="2018" /> there were three outstanding matters, three major reforms which remained to be undertaken.  The first was to bring the social welfare code up to a reasonably satisfactory modern level by the transfer to pay-related contributions. The second related to the national pension scheme and the third related to insurance for the self-employed.  The changeover to pay-related contributions has been effected, and that was a major administrative change.  It was also a very important change from the social point of view.  It was the biggest single change in the Department of Social Welfare since the Department was founded and it was given effect to by me during my term of office.  In relation to the national pension scheme some form of pay-related scheme on a comprehensive basis is very well advanced and I shall discuss it with the new Minister to ensure that it is pressed ahead with from here on as rapidly as possible.  An enormous amount of ground work has already been done and proposals are at an advanced stage.  Out of three major reforms one has been effected and the other was considerably advanced during my term in office.  The third reform is in a different category and, strangely enough, when we sought public reaction and public opinion on this we found that by and large it was afforded very little priority by most of the groups consulted.</P>
    <P>A great deal of discussion has centered on the fuel scheme.  During the last four days, Deputy Cluskey, the leader of the Labour Party, spent some time deploring my political outlook, my poltical philosophy and particularly my lack of social conscience.  I am prepared to match my social conscience against his any day of the week, and my record in Social Welfare against his.  Both our records can be readily compared.  For four years, approximately, Deputy Cluskey was in charge of the Department of Social Welfare, and in Dublin city the old, ramshackle, despised free fuel scheme was left untouched by Deputy Cluskey.  I, as an Opposition Deputy, often pressed him to do something about it; but he did nothing.  I have at least brought in a coherent, comprehensive, <Col N="2019" /> flexible free fuel scheme for Dublin city.  Not alone that, but I extended it to the whole Eastern Health Board area where there was nothing before. That is one area where our performance can be compared.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a great deal of this, but when I came into the Department of Social Welfare I found it riddled with little petty anomalies and shabby ways of treating people in dire circumstances. In relation to maternity benefit, for instance, in theory a mother was entitled to 12 weeks' maternity benefit but, if by some chance of nature the child did not arrive exactly when it was supposed to, the unfortunate woman was deprived of two or three weeks' maternity benefit.  In relation to the widow's pension I found a situation where a number of widows on reaching old age pension age had their pensions reduced.  In relation to prisoners I found that a male prisoner when discharged from prison would probably have to wait a week or more before he would get any assistance.  Most despicable and shabby of all, and what Deputy Cluskey presided over for four years and did nothing about, is the situation where, if an old age pensioner died and it was found on his death that he had been overpaid&mdash;do Deputies know what happened then?  Under Deputy Cluskey's jurisdiction the Department of Social Welfare went after the widow or some surviving relative to recoup the overpayment from that widow's pension.  These are the sort of things that Deputy Cluskey, with his active, intense social conscience, left untouched for four years&mdash;these pretty shabby little things.</P>

    <P>The free fuel scheme is not perfect, but at least now it is capable of improvement. <Col N="2020" /> The basis is there for improvement. it is a coherent, flexible scheme. The voucher is there and a central committee, consisting of the corporation, the Department of Social Welfare and various other involved persons, monitor it.  I have asked the health board to build up a stock of blankets, electric fires and all those things so as to have them on tap.  I have asked the Dublin Corporation and the health board to have adequate supplies of fuel available and, generally speaking, both the corporation and the Eastern Health Board will get through this winter reasonably well.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was able to improve the scheme in Dublin and in the urban areas where the free fuel scheme has always existed.  I was able to extend it to the whole of the Eastern Health Board area and to some other areas, but I did not have the money to extend it to the south-east.  I wrote to these other health boards and told them that I could not give any more funds this year and asked them to please do the best they could with any adjustments they could make in their existing schemes, and that was the way I had to leave it.</P>
      <P>It is very regrettable that we have not a whole day at least on this Estimate, because I know that Deputies such as Deputy Tully, Deputy McMahon and Deputy Lipper know the social welfare scene very well and that they are dealing with it every day.  It is very important that they be given an opportunity to draw attention to anomalies, to discrepancies and to various other matters. A good discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare is very important and it is a pity that we have not more time to deal with the points raised. I assure the Deputies who have mentioned various important points about disability benefit and so on that these will be noted.  The officials will have a note of them and I know that Deputy Woods will go into them all very carefully.</P>

      <P>On leaving the Department of Social Welfare I wish to pay a tribute to the staff there, who spared no effort in trying to cope with the enormous difficulties that the postal strike presented to us.  I wish also to pay tribute to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for their wonderful work.  Fortunately, we were able to get through but, as has been pointed out, people did suffer.  When the postal strike was over all the applications and all the cases that had been held up suddenly arrived into the Department of Social Welfare.  During the month of August the Department were practically inundated and submerged with the flow of post and work of that kind.  The Department staff involved have been on almost constant overtime, even at weekends. We dispensed with a number of administrative checks in the system and did everything possible administratively to deal with the unprecedented situation. Some weeks ago I issued a statement showing the state of play in every scheme, the number of cases outstanding, how they were dealt with and when it was hoped to be up to date.  The Department assure me that they are practically up to date on all fronts.  I hope that nightmare situation is behind us.</P>
      <P>I apologise to the people concerned for the delays and hardship they were caused.  The supplementary welfare scheme was always there to help out in cases of hardship.  I assure social welfare recipients that the Department staff did everything they could to try to minimise the delays and the hardship caused by the delays.  That is the only contribution I have time to make.</P>

If this cutting back has been done for the same reason the Taoiseach gave for the Southern Health Board not having the free fuel scheme extended to their area, I do not know.  There has been a big cutback in medical cards.  In cases where they have been withdrawn, they have been subsequently restored following representations by me and by other public representatives.  Why do people have to suffer the withdrawal of medical cards when it is obvious that there is no need for it?  Their income and qualifications are such to qualify them for a medical card.  I am sure that in many cases people do not bother going to a public representative or are not aware that by doing so something could be done for them.  They accept the withdrawal of the card and do not have the benefit of it despite the fact that they are qualified for it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give some attention to the building of a new hospital at Tallaght.  This is a pet subject of mine, but it is not so many years since I raised this matter and was told we would not be getting a hospital at Tallaght.  I did not accept that and continued to put down motions at local authority level and make representations regarding the need for a hospital to serve the south city and county area.  I am glad the decision was made to build a hospital at Tallaght. However, there is some great delay.  The Taoiseach got some publicity during his term as Minister for Health.  People in the area were very hopeful.  It is important when one is building a new town to have Government Departments or offices of some importance in it to give it a lift so that it can play its rightful part.  I look forward to the new hospital at Tallaght to give it that lift.  Something has gone wrong.  The site is there and everything seems to be in order, but the Taoiseach chose perhaps to give the hospital at Beaumont preference.  I am not faulting him for that.  There was a need for that hospital.  If there is a dragging of feet with regard to the new hospital at Tallaght we should know about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2024" /> I deplore the absence of a cardiac ambulance service in Dublin.  I am sure, although I have not checked, that we must be the only city of this size without such a service.  When we think people are likely to get heart attacks&mdash;and I am sure they are having them every day of the week, not to talk about the last week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister what progress has been made with regard to the provision of a proper cardiac ambulance service for the city of Dublin.  I know it is envisaged that there will be three or four units. When I inquire about the matter at the health board I am told the reason the service has not been provided is because of the time needed to train staff.  I have been hearing that for too long.  By now we should have trained enough staff to service cardiac ambulances for the entire EEC.  I wish the Minister well in his Department, whether his stay there be long or short.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very substantial sum within a few weeks of the end of the financial year.  I wonder if it is being put in in an effort to lighten the load on next year's budget?  As was the case with regard to social welfare, unless the money has been spent already I cannot see how it could be spent before 31 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister for Health and Social Welfare present in the House.  I have wished him well in his job already.  He must have a look at the way in which the new scheme of payments for health is operating.  An employed person is having a deduction of 1 per <Col N="2025" /> cent from his wages.  If a person has a small amount of land or if he is rated for it, he is notified by the local authority of a sum he must pay.  That is fair enough in the case of an employed person who has some land but at the other end of the scale old age pensioners are getting bills that in some cases are more than their weekly pensions.  Something is seriously wrong with the system.</P>
    <P>My other question is with regard to people who go to hospital.  Up to now, except in some cases, when insured people went to hospital they knew they would be covered for general medical payments and that included consultants' fees.  Now very many people are excluded for one reason or another.  I know of people who were advised by their doctors to go to hospital but who were very worried because they felt they could not pay the bills.  More effort should be made to explain the position to people.  I know that public representatives from both sides of the House are being approached by people who want to know their rights. While the intention behind the scheme was probably a good one, we have reached the stage now where it is working in a way that was not intended.  The new Minister for Health should ensure that this matter is explained as fully as possible.</P>
    <P>Subhead G.1 deals with grants to health boards in respect of net expenditure excluding expenditure on cash allowances and cash grants and payments to the general medical services. There is also provision for an additional sum required for grants to health boards. The amount in question is £41,975,000. Subhead G.4 deals with grants on behalf of health boards to certain other bodies. There is provision for an additional sum required for grants on behalf of health boards to hospitals and homes other than those administered by health boards.  The sum in this case is £22,128,000.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country most of the hospitals are full to the doors.  Some years ago I was a trade union official organising staff in a number of hospitals. I remember on one occasion the staff <Col N="2026" /> had to leave a union meeting because the matron insisted they should go in to say the rosary.  I asked if she wanted them to pray every night that the hospital would be kept full and would pay its way.  Now, they do not have to pray.  The hospitals are full and many people have no hope of getting admission.  Many people require what they consider to be fairly serious operations but their doctors tell them they can do nothing about it, that they will have to wait until a bed is available.  The new Minister must consider this matter.  There must be a better way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>There is another problem that must be dealt with from a Christian point of view, apart from anything else.  In some cases when an old person goes to a hospital in a seriously ill condition and where the illness develops, the hospital authorities send for the relatives to tell them that they can do nothing for the patient and that he or she must be taken home.  I heard of a case recently where a patient was being moved from one hospital to another hospital where there was a more Christian outlook but the patient died on the way.  It is very unfair to treat old people in this way.</P>
    <P>Another problem is developing again, one that Deputy McEntee when he was Minister for Health dealt with during his term of office.  If a person dies on the road, whether as a result of a road accident, a heart attack or whatever it might be, it is unchristian not to allow an ambulance to take that person to hospital or to the morgue.  If a non-medical person rings a hospital to notify them that somebody has died and asks for an ambulance, the reply is that if the patient is dead an ambulance cannot be sent.  The new Minister should give his attention to that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the new Minister to the system operating with regard to medical cards.  When the Taoiseach was Minister <Col N="2027" /> for Social Welfare, certain guidelines were set last January by officers of the health boards.  In my local health committee, I proposed that they be reconsidered. In the budget food subsidies were withdrawn.  I understand that a meeting is being held today to revise the guidelines.  At the moment the figure set is £37.50 for a married man and his wife. In the name of God I ask the Minister to have the guideline revised more regularly than once a year.  People who are on the borderline are being refused by health boards and are being held to the limits.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment. I feel so strongly about this matter that I had to bring to the attention of the Minister that a man and woman living together on £37.50 a week are being asked to do without a medical card.</P>

      <P>I am just giving the Deputy the factual situation.  In any event, I have noted the Deputy's point.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully raised the question of duplication of payment of health contributions for part-time farmers.  There is no double liability.  If a person has paid the maximum contribution of £55 through PAYE and informs the health board of this, he need not pay a contribution as a farmer to the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We will note the Deputy's point.</P>
      <P>A number of other questions were raised of which I am aware at this stage. I should like to inform the House that the Taoiseach, who was responsible for these supplementaries, felt that he would be able to give more information at this time and made himself available for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2028" /> In relation to the number of medical cards withdrawn, a reply in relation to this matter was given to Deputy Donnellan today.  The reply was that the number of medical cards withdrawn or cancelled between 1 January and 30 September 1979, the latest date for which figures are available, was 57,437. During the same period, however, there was a net increase of 4,824 in the number with medical cards.  The total number of persons covered by the service increased by 8,779.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to pensioners. He referred to their liability being as big as their week's wages.  I spend a good deal of time working with old folk and I would be concerned about that sort of incidence.  I would like to ensure that the administrative systems did not allow this to happen.  I appreciate that it is difficult in an administrative sense and I would like to find measures which would overcome such practical and human difficulties. I also accept the point he made in relation to people being ill, particularly where they suffer from heart attacks.  If there are charges due by them there should be a human way of dealing with the situation because it could cause great stress.  The question of elderly people having to go home from hospital is related to the kinds of services available, not only in association with the homes but in communities generally.  There has been a considerable improvement in recent years in the provision of homes for elderly persons.  I would also be keen to pursue that matter.</P>

      <P>I want to pay tribute to the man who was Minister for Economic Planning and Development for two-and-a-half years.  The morning after I became a Minister the American Ambassador called to see me because he wanted the matter of flying into Shannon resolved. At that time, Professor O'Donoghue, as he then was, had been on a trip to the US with the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, and they had been discussing the matter.  I asked Professor O'Donoghue to give me the benefit of his experience and to advise me on the matter.  He was most courteous and helpful to me, a newcomer to politics at that time.  Subsequently, he became a Deputy and then a Minister and has been credited with being the author of a document that brought 84 Fianna Fáil Deputies into this House.  The Deputies turned on him in ones and twos until he was unnecessarily damaged by the backbiting of his colleagues.  As his opposite number, I must say that I found him extremely courteous and helpful at all <Col N="2030" /> times.  One recognises the right of any Taoiseach to change his Cabinet but I suggest that Deputy O'Donoghue is a great loss to the Government.  I hope that he will continue to use his undoubted talents for the benefit of the public.</P>

When he was first appointed I was instinctively prepared to find fault with him.  I have to say that in the years in which I watched him&mdash;I had not the advantage of knowing him personally beforehand as Deputy Barry had&mdash;I found him an absolute gentleman.  He was polite and patient, particularly patient of the barbs which were flung across the floor at him.  I think it a shame that he should be sacrificed to the anxiety to pin on him as being politically expendible the fault which must be carried by the entire Government and by the person who has now been elected their leader.</P>

      <P>We, in the Opposition, have insisted that there be a debate however brief, on the Appropriation Bill&mdash;which is something which has not occurred in the past&mdash;because we <Col N="2034" /> believe it is an important Bill.  In fact this Bill gives the legal statutory authority for the expenditure of £2,700 million.  We are proposing here to agree to the expenditure of this huge sum of money in the course of a mere 20 minutes.  This is very inadequate.  However, the argument may be made that many of the matters contained in this Appropriation Bill have been discussed when the Estimates which are enshrined in the Bill were discussed in the House during the year.  In this case, that is not so.  In fact the vast bulk of the money&mdash;I would say approximately&mdash;£2,000 million&mdash;of the £2,700 million being approved here&mdash;was passed in the form of Estimates on Tuesday, 17 July last, Estimates which were themselves not debated either.  They were passed at that stage because they had to be passed before two-thirds of the year had elapsed.  Had they not been passed in July, they could not have waited until the Dáil resumed after the summer recess.  As a result, on 17 July last, these Estimates, amounting to £2,000 million, or the vast bulk of the £2,700 million we are now approving, were also passed without discussion.  The result of this is that approximately two-thirds of the entire Government expenditure is approved by this House without any discussion whatsoever, either on the Appropriation Bill or in the form of a discussion on the Estimates themselves.  This is a scandalous procedure and one that does this House little credit.  As Members of this House we are legally responsible for the expenditure of this money, and the fact that we should exercise that responsibility in such a cursory fashion is very unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the House has established an inquiry, through the agency of its Committee on Procedure and Privileges, into the method whereby Estimates are considered.  That committee was asked originally to present a report on the subject within six months.  On Wednesday 17 July 1979 they came back to this House and got a further extension of six months for the preparation of their report.  They have not got any further extension on this occasion. Therefore, I presume that the Committee <Col N="2035" /> on Procedure and Privileges will have a report for the House on or before 18 January 1980.  If they do not do so they will not be complying with the mandate they were given by the House to prepare a report on Estimates within six months, which was subsequently extended by a further six months expiring in January next.</P>
    <P>I believe it is vitally important to the proper control of Government spending, which is increasing at a far more rapid rate than the amounts being produced in the country generally, that we have revised procedures in relation to Estimates. I have chosen this opportunity as the most appropriate one to raise the matter and to draw it to the attention of the new Minister for Finance who I hope will be able to use his offices to do something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We associate with the earnest plea of Deputy Bruton that there should be a more effective way of conducting and handling the business of the State in terms of its financial management.  We are approving current expenditure of £2,700 million.  God only knows what that expenditure will be next year; it could be anything up to £3,400 million by the end of 1980.  There will be a situation in which midway through 1980 most likely we will still not have had even the most cursory examination of the massive volume of public expenditure in this House.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the House will resume on 20 February next.  There will then be a very short period of four months of Dáil sitting days.  A great deal of that time will be taken up with the Finance Bill.  In the period of 15 or 16 weeks up to the middle of 1980 the likelihood of this House indulging in any serious, in depth examination of the Estimates, sector by sector, will be somewhat remote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out also that it is envisaged that in March 1980 we shall have an additional plethora of Ministers of State.  I want to ally that to the Appropriation Bill.  I suggest that in anticipation, <Col N="2036" /> the Dáil should give those Ministers of State some work to do.  Let us have Estimates Committees of this House.  Let us give one Estimate to each of the 15 Ministers of State.  I would even concede to the Government, if they want, to let each Minister of State take one Estimate, when each would have £300 million or £400 million in terms of care and custody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when those Ministers of State, under the auspices of the Estimates Committees of this House, can meet their own backbenchers and Opposition backbenchers, when they can sit down and debate the Estimates. At present a farcical situation obtains&mdash;for example to expect, as we did today, the Minister for Finance to come in here, and deal in a very attenuated time with a vat of general current expenditure, admittedly spent already for the most part, in 1979.  There is no reason at all that the new Ministers of State should not have that function devolved on them&mdash;namely, the scrutiny, the examination in great detail, of public expenditure.</P>
      <P>Unless we do this there will be a public expenditure backlash in this country, one with social and economic consequences, because it is popular to oppose public expenditure, to cut it, slash it, and it can be done in a panic political reaction on an indiscriminate basis, which would be a tragedy for the work of this House.  I commend Deputy Bruton for his diligence in this regard.  I can assure him that as a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges we will try to present an early report before the House resumes on 20 February next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister for Finance in his difficulty at this stage, in having to get the money through in this fashion.  Even for a Minister for Finance long established, it would be a most difficult experience; for a new Minister it must be a rather impossible position to be in.  For that reason the suggestions of a new role for the Minister of State could <Col N="2037" /> take a lot of that back-breaking work off individual senior Ministers and give the House a new lease of life.</P>

      <P>Both Deputies Desmond and Bruton have been consistent in regard to the points they have made because they made the same points on the corresponding Bill last year.  They will be aware of the replies given by my predecessor on that occasion.  For the record I should like to state again that this is not the Bill which gives the statutory authority for the spending of the money.  I think Deputy Bruton implied that it has that function.  He will be aware that this statutory authority for the spending of the money comes from the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965.  What we are doing here is appropriating, as indicated in the schedule, funds to the services therein indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, one sympathises with the points made by both Deputies. As a consequence of their having made the same points last year and as a result also of a private members motion in the name of Deputy Bruton, the matter was referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges who are due to report to the House by 13 February in relation to the precedent for debating Estimates. Undoubtedly, they will take account of the matters that have been mentioned here as well as those points made during their deliberations.  It is open to the Deputies or to their representatives on the committee to make the appropriate recommendations.  While there is scope for improvement, what is happening now and which is in line with the consistent pattern down the years, is that the time being made available for Estimates is at least as much this year as has been the case in most other years.  It is understandable that Deputies would wish for the opportunity of a full debate but, as has been pointed out before, if the date for the publication of the Estimates were to be brought back, as suggested by Deputy Bruton in his motion in this regard, the Estimates would be prepared at least six months in advance of the <Col N="2038" /> following financial year.  Obviously, with a time lag of that nature there would not be nearly as much precision as would be expected in relation to the presentation of Estimates.  However, these are matters that the committee are considering. Traditionally, this Bill has been put through the House without debate but is debated at great length in the Seanad in order to enable Senators to express their views on a wide range of matters.  When we hear from the committee, we shall be able to take account of the various points.</P>

      <P>May I indicate, first, that the House will adjourn tonight until Wednesday, 20 February 1980 at 2.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes taking place in the Government provide us all with an opportunity for a new beginning, an occasion for every individual and all the major groups in our society, trade unions, employers, farming organisations, and all those who have a contribution to make to the political, economic and social advancement of our people, to set aside sectional differences so that we can all harness and pool our energies to achieve our common purpose, which is simply the welfare of all the people of this island, North and South.  I was very heartened by the countless messages of <Col N="2041" /> support I received from people from every part of Ireland, North and South and from every walk of life.</P>
    <P>I said on Tuesday in this House that the problems facing us as a nation were many and grave.  Let me deal with the economic situation first.  This year the economic growth in the European Community, of which we are a member, is estimated to be about 3 per cent.  Next year experts think it will be lower.  In Britain where we sell the biggest part of our exports it is, in fact, widely forecast to decline, perhaps by as much as 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>These forecasts are made against a background where the supply and price of oil are likely to move dramatically against the countries of Western Europe and other industrialised economies.  The consequence will be to aggravate what are already serious threats of recession, to increase inflation and to worsen the prospects for employment.  Indeed, the developments on the energy front could well pose some of the most serious threats to stability and growth we have faced for many years.</P>
    <P>Energy problems are compounded by what is happening to the social fabric and stability of government in many countries.  I do not need here to go into questions like the prospects for rearmament in Europe, or the nature of East-West relations which are becoming increasingly fragile, or the experience, so obvious to all, of countries in different parts of the globe where society appears to have broken down completely.  There is evidence enough before us of this disorder, even in the developed societies of Western Europe, in the new laws governments in so many countries find it necessary to enact to protect societies against the effects of terrorist attack. What I am saying is that economic recession is aggravating and being aggravated by political instability.</P>
    <P>How in this troubled world do we fare in Ireland?  We cannot isolate ourselves from what is going on in the world, but we can ensure that our policies contribute to the fundamental objectives and interests of our people.  I will deal later <Col N="2042" /> with the first of these objectives&mdash;the attainment of Irish unity by peaceful means and through reconciliation.  Here, I want to speak of the second objective, which is to promote the economic development of this country in every way, so that our young people can find jobs, so that unemployment is reduced, if not eliminated, so that inflation is brought down and the Irish people can live in security and prosperity, in the simple hope that, as in the past, the next year will be better than the year before. Above all, the economic advance of which I speak will enable us to sustain welfare arrangements for those in our society who live in need.</P>
    <P>Major problems face us now on the economic front.  We will probably have a balance of payments deficit of the order of £650 million this year, which must be reduced.  Government borrowing which helps to fuel both this deficit and inflation is simply too high.</P>
    <P>More than most countries in Western Europe we must rely on volatile and undependable external sources for our energy supplies&mdash;of which we buy approximately 80 per cent from abroad. And this dependency worsens the two most serious problems I have mentioned. It affects our hope of conquering inflation because no country can keep prices generally down if a commodity, as basic to every day life as oil, increases in price by 50 per cent and 70 per cent or 100 per cent in the space of a single year. The effects spread right through every household and through every industry, through transport, agriculture and distribution. And these direct effects can be worsened by attempts by business and workers to protect themselves against the decline in standards which the real transfer of resources abroad must bring in its train.  The consequences for our rate of inflation of these direct and indirect effects could be extremely serious.</P>
    <P>These effects spill over also into our balance of payments.  In 1972, this country spent £53 million in buying oil from abroad or 2.4 per cent of national output. <Col N="2043" /> This year we may well spend close to £500 million or about 6½ per cent of output.  In fact, if one might be fanciful, if oil prices had remained basically stable for us over the period, we would have saved about half of all this year's balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>These facts will, I hope, give some of the background to my decision to put so much emphasis on energy policy in the Cabinet changes I have announced, my decision to set up a new Department of Energy and ask the Tánaiste to take charge of that vital area.  We cannot in the eighties continue to rely, as we have done in the past, on cheap and dependable energy from abroad.  If we solve our energy problem we will have gone some way towards solving our balance of payments and our inflation problems and thereby make a significant contribution to reducing unemployment.</P>
    <P>I say &ldquo;some way&rdquo; deliberately because important as the subject is, it is only part of the picture.  The early years of the eighties will be deeply troubled in most parts of the world.  There is no reason why we in Ireland should seek to add to these troubles.  But that is just precisely what we are doing in an area which affects every man and woman in the country.  We are doing ourselves serious damage by our attitude to industrial relations.</P>
    <P>In 1976 almost 800,000 days were lost through industrial disputes.  In 1977, that figure declined to just over 440,000. In 1978, we lost 624,000 man days.  In 1979, to date, the total number of man days lost through industrial disputes has been over 1,350,000.  Admittedly, 1,118,000 were due to the Post Office strike.  If this loss is omitted, the record, to date, this year has not been too bad, in comparison with the recent past.  This is particularly so in the private sector where there was actually a reduction of about one-third in the number of man days lost in the first nine months of 1979 in comparison with the same period last year.  I do not, however, think that anyone looking at the industrial relations scene in Ireland today can be undisturbed by what he or she sees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2044" /> I do not want here to blame one side or the other.  There are stresses in society which are not the fault of either management or labour.  Inflation is disturbing old relativities.  Communications convey the impression of total knowledge of everyone's pay packet.  It is another matter whether this knowledge can exist without expert analysis and explanation which are impossible in the short space of a newspaper paragraph or a television announcement.  The fact is, impressions are created, that workers and management can be set at odds by the fear of being left behind in the race for material well-being and by jealousy caused by nothing more substantial than rumour or imperfect knowledge.  I do not expect these problems to be solved overnight but tackle them we must.</P>
    <P>There is now, I believe, widespread support among the public for ending the current disorder and establishing some code of practice in industrial relations which is fair to all.  The national good demands that there should be an orderly and disciplined approach by both sides of industry in sorting out problems between workers and their employers.</P>
    <P>As things stand at present, responsibility for industrial relations in the public sector, comprising about 290,000 workers rests with the Department of the Public Service.  Responsibility for industrial relations generally, including the private sector, lies with the Department of Labour.  While this division may have had some justification in the past, I do not think it is helpful now.  If we are to take positive action in this most sensitive of areas, where goodwill is required from unions, management, Government and workers alike, it is vitally necessary to rationalise and co-ordinate, to the fullest possible extent, the State's own approach. This essentially is my reason for proposing to bring together the two Departments I have mentioned, Labour and the Public Service, under one Minister as a fully co-ordinated unit.  I hope that under the Minister, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, in charge of those two coordinated Departments in the future we will be able to create a climate in <Col N="2045" /> which problems in the industrial relations field can be settled and before they get out of hand and disruptions ensue.</P>
    <P>Turning to another area, this year Government expenditure will probably be equivalent to well over 50 per cent of gross national output.  The services provided by the Government are valuable but their cost and their financing have the most profound effects on the economy.  Taxation must not weigh so heavily that extra effort is penalised to the point that it is not worthwhile.  Conversely, it should not drive up prices needlessly and cause even greater inflation. Similarly, the balance between current expenditure and capital expenditure in the State budget can determine whether we will prosper or decline.  If we use too much of our resources for day to day purposes and too little to provide the factories, farm development, communications, the houses and hospitals for the future, it will not be too long before we as a nation feel the effects.</P>
    <P>We now spend well over £1,000 million a year for capital purposes, and most of that is borrowed.  Every £1,000 million spent in this way gives rise at current interest charges to debt service charges running into hundreds of millions of pounds which must be met from current revenue, from taxation in the main.  A picture of this sort of interaction can be built up only by looking at expenditure in all its aspects over a period of years ahead.</P>
    <P>I mention these aspects to explain, in part, the reason for the third of the structural changes which I am proposing in the machinery of Government.  It is essential, in present conditions of uncertainty in the world about us, to knit together all aspects of economic planning, including Government revenue and expenditure, welfare, industrial and personal incentives and the burdens and benefits of taxation so that our approach to economic growth can be coordinated, over time, within the one Department with the one set of priorities and the power, skill and ability to see that these priorities are observed in all the functions and services of Government.  I will, <Col N="2046" /> of course, be dealing in more detail with aspects of these matters when we come to discuss the budget which the Minister for Finance has indicated to the House will be introduced on 27 February next. So much for the economic scene.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to the political area.  I want to emphasise that it will be the constant endeavour of this Government, as it has been of their predecessor, to achieve the unity of the people of Ireland by peaceful means, by agreement, independence and in a harmonious relationship with our neighbour, Britain. We totally reject the use of force as a means of achieving that end.  We will be concerned to ensure full civil rights and equality for all the people of Northern Ireland and to ensure also that security in the area operates impartially through acceptable channels and structures.  I hope to take a keen interest in encouraging and promoting the development of social, cultural and economic links between North and South.  It will be our aim to bring about a condition where all the people of Ireland, regardless of class or creed, can live in peace and harmony under the common name of Irishmen.  Any person who wishes at any time to contribute constructively to that end will find my door open to him.</P>
    <P>Our top political priority is progress towards the coming together of the people of the country as a whole living in harmony and prosperity under the common name of Irishmen, as I said.  The principles of the policies we will pursue to that end will be those which have guided Fianna Fáil since it was founded. These were as stated in our policy statement of October 1975.  There may be changes of emphasis.  The ways along which progress can be made towards reconciliation or political solutions will not remain fixed or unchanged.  Conditions in Northern Ireland have changed fundamentally in the last decade and that process of change continues.  The international context in which we are set has also changed fundamentally and has continued to change.  All these factors affect the application of our policies, but the basic principles remain the same. <Col N="2047" /> Since our 1975 statement has been so often misrepresented let me here repeat the opening paragraph:</P>
    <P>A central aim of Fianna Fáil policy is to secure by peaceful means the unity and independence of Ireland as a democratic republic.  We totally reject the use of force as a means of achieving this aim. </P>
    <P>We are determined that that principle of the rejection of force will be clearly translated into practice.  Our security forces, our Garda and our soldiers will maintain the maximum security on the Border preventing totally, if that is possible, any cross-Border activity of any illegal or subversive nature.  Cross-Border security operations will be maintained to ensure the most effective action against violence within the rule of law.  May I summarise in a single sentence.  My policy and that of the Government will be to encourage by every means at our disposal every development which brings Irishmen and women of both major traditions closer together and actively to discourage and prevent whatever drives them apart.</P>
    <P>Let me now look at the European Economic Community and the developments in that area of activity.  A reduction in the differences between the poorer and the wealthier areas is inscribed as an objective in the Treaty of Rome.  It was emphasised again in the Accession Treaty under which Ireland joined the Community and it was emphasised by the arrangement for Ireland's entry into the European Monetary System.  Yet, despite this long history of aspirations stretching back over more than 20 years regional economies are not moving closer together in relative wealth.  The Community budget, as it is now framed, is unable to do enough to provide a solution. The absence of convergence is one of the most serious flaws in the progress of the Community as we see it.</P>
    <P>The second problem, which is part of this basic difficulty, relates to the British contribution to the budget.  The British claim that as the third poorest member <Col N="2048" /> of the Community, after Ireland and Italy, they should not have to pay to the Community over £1,000 million a year more than they get out of it.  While one can have a certain sympathy with this view it is essential to bear in mind that to speak of any country contributing anything to the Community is to misunderstand the nature of the Community and its finances.  The Community's revenue from duties, levies, and up to 1 per cent VAT belong, under the Treaties to the Community as its own resources. They do not belong to the country which happens to collect them.  And this rule is fundamental to the nature of the Community. While it can be modified in its effect over a short period where an unacceptable situation for any country arises it cannot be set aside without danger to the very foundations of the Community. Our interests, and those of the Community, are to ensure an equitable solution to the problem which will not work against the principle of convergence as far as Ireland is concerned.  That will be my concern at the next European Council meeting to be held early in the new year under Italian Presidency.</P>
    <P>Next we must ensure that any restructuring of the Community budget of approximately £11 billion, of which more than 70 per cent goes on agriculture, does not work against this same principle. Although certain adjustments may be necessary, it continues to be the policy of this party and this Government to ensure that the fundamental principles of the CAP are maintained intact.  These include&mdash;I make no apologies for repeating them</P>
    <P>&mdash;to increase productivity in agriculture by promoting technical progress and rational development of production</P>
    <P>&mdash;to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community,</P>

    <P>&mdash;to ensure that they reach consumers at reasonable prices. </P>
    <P>We must keep clearly in our minds that more than 20 per cent of our population are engaged in agriculture and depend directly on the fair application of these principles.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2049" /> It is disquieting to learn today that the European Parliament, by a very substantial majority, rejected the budget.  This has serious implications from the point of view of the CAP, and it has very real and intimidating consequences for this country and its economy.  It was surprising to learn that members of the Labour Party who are members of the European Parliament voted for the rejection of the Community budget.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, I announced today the nomination of ten Deputies to be junior Ministers or Ministers of State in different Government Departments.  I also indicated that it would be the intention of the Government to increase the number of Ministers of State from ten to 15.  That is something which the situation in Government at present simply dictates to us.  Most Deputies are aware of the enormous expansion which is taking place in the roles, the function and the activities of our Government Departments. This expansion has taken place in the domestic field apart altogether from the EEC dimension.</P>
    <P>All of us in public life are aware that the general public today are much more demanding in the services they require from their politicians, from the Government and from Government Departments. It is essential, if we are to provide effective Government and try to meet the problems which confront us, that we would have available to members of the Government the assistance of an adequate number of Ministers of State in these changed circumstances.</P>
    <P>This Government and the previous Government from time to time have been criticised for perhaps the inadequacy of their attendance, or their presence, at various Community meetings and bodies, and the strain and the demand now made on members of the Government who have European Community functions are enormous.  I believe that a Minister of the Government who is committed substantially to the EEC by reason of his office, or who has substantial EEC commitments arising from his office, finds it essential to have available to him a competent, <Col N="2050" /> energetic Minister of State to help to service all the demands that the Community institutions and organisations make upon him.</P>

      <P>I am encouraged in the decision I have taken in this regard by the comments which Deputy Garret FitzGerald made when the Government were bringing in this legislation.  At that time he expressed doubt as to whether ten Ministers of State were adequate for the purpose of discharging the Government's responsibilities these days.</P>
      <P>This arrangement we have made between the parties in the Dáil about winding up the debate is a very truncated one.  Between us, by agreement, we decided not to have a full-scale Adjournment Debate, and in all the circumstances that was a sensible decision. The leaders of the parties have agreed to contribute for possibly 30 minutes an outline of their respective positions.  I am simply dealing with principles of approach and of attitudes rather than with any major policy matters or any outline of strategy in any one area.</P>
      <P>I have been in my present office a little more than 50 hours.  Most of that time has been spent in this House.  Obviously, therefore, I can touch only lightly on the many problems facing Ireland today.  As I have said, they are many and difficult, ranging from how international events affect us, how we ourselves advance or slow down our social and economic development, the structure of Government, what is happening in and about Northern Ireland, events in Europe to which we are tied by geography, trade and law, and above all by sentiment and feeling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this complex of issues it is difficult to find a common thread, a common policy or combination of policies whose elements hang together for the greater good of Ireland and the world in which we live.  But of this one thing I am sure: that common thread exists, and we can bind the Irish people together in a united <Col N="2051" /> approach to our many problems.  I said when I spoke of the problems facing us that this is also a time of great opportunity. Our economy is growing, although perhaps at too slow a rate.  Our population is young and increasing. Agriculture and industry are only beginning to realise their potential.  New technology has possibilities beyond imagination. But we can grasp these opportunities and realise them to the full only if we take the present as it comes and make the future conform to our needs in so far as it is given to us individually, or as a nation, to achieve that end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach has said, it has been agreed that instead of the usual and very long Adjournment Debate we should have a rather truncated debate.  The reason for this is that over the last couple of days, when we debated the appointment of the Taoiseach and his Government and especially in the latter debate, most of the ground has been covered which would normally be covered in an Adjournment Debate.  The Chair does not approve of repetition and the Chair might have had a lot of it if we had a full Adjournment Debate.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Taoiseach should have an opportunity before the Recess to give an indication of his overall assessment of the situation that faces him and of his priorities.  With much of what he has said on the economic situation I can find myself in agreement.  I note his reference to a new beginning.  They are interesting words and they seem to suggest a distancing on his part from the pretty disastrous economic events of the last two-and-a-half years, but I do not think he can credibly distance himself from them because he shares responsibility for the manifesto which has contributed so much to the economic difficulties now facing us.  Attempts to pretend otherwise are not convincing.  References to a new beginning in that respect will not carry much weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Taoiseach has come somewhat cleaner than the <Col N="2052" /> Government have done hitherto on some issues, on the scale of the external deficit about which there was a lot of hedging up to now, and that the figures which the Central Bank and the ESRI mentioned, which I have cited in this House and outside, are now accepted by the Government. I am glad he has come cleaner on the gravity of the problems in regard to energy, inflation and employment.  They seem to be more fully grasped or more fully admitted than previously, as well as the problems of industrial relations.  I note what the Taoiseách said about the level of Government expenditure, the burden of taxation, the need for a better balance between capital and current account and the problem of excessive borrowing.  In all of that I find much with which I agree.</P>
    <P>In what the Taoiseach said and the emphasis he placed on economic growth I did not hear the corollary: any reference to the need for social progress. Indeed, when dealing with the problems of the younger generation he confined himself to that crucial factor: the creation of jobs for that new generation without referring to the other elements of their basic needs, the need for education before they ever reach the stage of having jobs and the need for housing when they finally get employment and are in a position to settle down and get married and start a home.  He did not refer to the many desperate social problems of this country, partly in the area of housing and partly in the area of the inadequacy of social welfare for which he must bear his share of responsibility by the low priority he gave to it as Minister.</P>
    <P>It is an undoubted fact that even after the considerable efforts of the National Coalition Government who changed the whole level of social benefits and the relationship between social benefits and our national output and income, the level of long term benefits such as old age pensions, widows pensions and so on, are not merely low in absolute terms here but are, compared to all our neighbours, low in relation to our GNP. In the strictest sense of the term, we are meaner than any of our neighbours with the underprivileged.  Nothing in what the <Col N="2053" /> Taoiseach said suggested a recognition of this or a concern to face up to it. Perhaps he was embarrassed to say much about it after his own failure to tackle these problems during the last two and a half years when he concentrated more on certain aspects of the health services, some of them important but, relatively speaking, peripheral to those crucial social issues.</P>
    <P>However, at the end of his speech he referred to the country's potential.  I echo what he said there.  There is no doubt that the country has, in the under-utilisation of its land after centuries of exploitation through cheap food policies of our neighbour, in its ability to attract new industries on the scale which is quite remarkable and is a tribute to talents and skills of those engaged in this&mdash;from the Ministers who have undertaken this task, Deputy O'Malley and his predecessor, Deputy Keating, and those who went before them and the IDA&mdash;a great potential.  We are tapping this potential with more success than is realised.  Much of the successes in this area have been obscured by the fact that we have gone through a period of recession, a period when with the freeing of trade existing jobs have disappeared and when the new jobs had to compensate for redundancies rather than create a net increase in employment. We have a great potential there.  We also have this remarkable potential of our younger generation which the Taoiseach referred to.  The fact that we have so many young people needing education, housing and employment creates problems and, in one sense, it is a burden.  But it also gives us an enormous opportunity to be a vital and expanding community.  The Taoiseach was right to emphasise that aspect.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to what the Taoiseach said about Northern Ireland.  I find it hard to be sure whether in what he said there was, in fact, a change of emphasis.  He referred to the fact that there may be changes of emphasis but I am not certain whether in the words he used he intended to convey a change of emphasis or a continuity.  There will be some parsing and analysing to be done on the text of his speech in due course in <Col N="2054" /> that regard.  On this we must certainly reserve judgment.  I feel sure the Taoiseach will want to contribute to the resolution of the problem in Northern Ireland and I hope his approach to it will be a constructive one.  The emphasis he has placed upon the importance of encouraging contacts between North and South and of his door being open to anybody with constructive ideas is encouraging. Too little has been done by all of us to encourage contacts between the two parts of the country at every level&mdash;personal, human, political, economical and social.  If the Taoiseach put some effort into that area it would be helpful and some of the problems created by events of the past in regard to his making a positive contribution in this area could be diminished if he approached it in this light.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the question of the appointments of the Ministers of State.  The Taoiseach referred to my remarks at a time when the numbers were increased to ten.  He was quite right.  It has been my view that in one sense we are undergoverned. There are too few people of ability engaged in the work of Government.  We need more such people engaged in this work, but the need is for people with a capacity to take on economic and social problems, to have the imagination to tackle them and the willingness to get down to and stay at their desks getting on with the job.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be harsh but I have to say that the appointments so far made do not conform to this need.  I should like to leave aside from this criticism Deputy Moore, whom I know well will undertake this task with dedication and will, like his predecessor, seek to smooth the work of the Dáil.  The remaining new appointments, I am afraid, are too obviously a reward for political services to one section of one party and do not offer any realistic prospect of an improvement in the quantity or quality of the Government in tackling the actual tasks to be undertaken inside Governments Departments. Those appointments which have this characteristic and will be seen by objective observers as having this characteristic&mdash;I <Col N="2055" /> do not think that on this I will be seen as making any kind of political point because it is the view widely shared by people who are not particularly political.  That is a bad atmosphere and background for the creation of new appointments however desirable these may be in principle.  Moreover, the fact that there is another element in this, the necessary deferral because of the need for legislation of appointments for three or four months at least, because of the long adjournment and the fact that it will be followed by the budget and financial legislation, cannot but give rise to suspicion that there may be a hope that leaving these appointments in abeyance may help to damp down unrest in the Government party by leaving to a significant proportion of backbenchers the hope of promotion for many months to come.</P>
    <P>The inadequacy of the Taoiseach's approach in this area is emphasised by his last words where he referred to the need to relieve Minister's engaged in EEC affairs of part of the burdens of their office. I agree with what he said there, but the trouble is that he did not do that.  He put two Ministers of State into the Department of the Environment whose involvement with the EEC is pretty peripheral, as I can recall from my time in Government, and none in the Department of Foreign Affairs which has a very heavy burden in this area.  Were it the case that he was concerned primarily with relieving the burden in this area of EEC affairs he would not have acted in this manner.  While his good intentions were indicated by what he said on this subject, his actions diverge so far from this intentions that they cast doubt on how serious he is in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>We have had several long debates in which much has been said and this is the time for the Taoiseach to have his say and to respond briefly to relevant points. I must raise one matter with some regret, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, which I hope that the Taoiseach will be allowed to answer.  Will the Taoiseach set at rest the deep concern <Col N="2056" /> and disquiet throughout the public service today due to persistent rumours that the deputy Secretary of his Department and the two Assistant Secretaries in his office, the entire top staff, are to be replaced either by retirement or by transfer?  I seek assurance from the Taoiseach that these officials will not be removed and that these rumours, which are very damaging to public service morale and to the reputation of the new Government, are false.  Will the Taoiseach make this clear, because whether he is aware of it or not these rumours are having a very disturbing effect and the sooner they are put to rest the better?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is right, there are many rumours.  It is bad enough if the rumours have some truth in them, but when they are untrue it is better that they be set at rest at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Taoiseach recognises the extraordinary magnitude of the task facing him.  If the Taoiseach wishes to bring people together, as he said at the outset and to try to recreate some of the sense of consensus upon which our society is based, I would urge him to reconsider his almost instinctive lack of emphasis on the social as well as the economic aspect. I am convinced, as are my Party, that economic growth cannot be secured by a singleminded attempt to achieve it without regard to other factors.  At this moment our economic growth trend, which was healthy in 1977 and remained so in 1978 has been disturbed in part because of tensions within our society which showed themselves in strikes and disruption.  This reflects the fact that <Col N="2057" /> there is not a conviction on the part of the people in different sections of society that there is a desire on the part of the Government to create a society of justice as well as a society of wealth.  If the Taoiseach wanted to succeed with economic growth, if that were his sole purpose, he would defeat that purpose if he were to underestimate the importance of the social aspect.  Economic growth, however, is only a means to an end, the end of creating a society that will be healthy, not merely in the narrow sense that a Minister for Health might be concerned with, but healthier in a broader sense.  For that, there must be a feeling that Government is concerned about the quality of life, about the problems, about the underprivileged and about social justice.  If that feeling does not exist, even if at a given moment there may appear to be a certain quiescence in public opinion, an absence of radical movement and even if the unrest shows itself merely in strikes, there are dangers.  I urge the Taoiseach to try to see the broader perspective and not to confine his analysis of the problem to his treatment of it to the purely economic sphere. There can be no success if that path is followed.  It is the conviction of my Party that economic growth and social justice not only can be combined, but while there are tensions between them because one must choose where to spend the limited resources, these tensions can be constructively resolved.  A failure to resolve them will undermine economic growth, which is the means by which greater social justice will be achieved.  I urge the Taoiseach to rethink his approach which in its first statement has been deficient in that respect, although a healthy note of realism appeared in his economic analysis, which is a good sign as far as tacking the problems of the economy is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was somewhat taken aback last night at the end of the debate on the appointment of the new Government when the Taoiseach did not avail of the opportunity to address the House and the people in order to give his views not only in identifying political, economic <Col N="2058" /> and social problems that face the country, but also to give some indication as to how he and his Government intend to approach these problems.  I was glad that the Taoiseach responded, although somewhat reluctantly, this morning and made at least a relatively brief statement before the House rose for an unprecedented long recess for this time of the year, and gave some insight into how he identifies the difficulties facing us.  As he stated, the Taoiseach did not put forward in great detail any course of action as to how they should be approached.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that this was a new beginning.  In some respects that is true, but one would not accept that it is a totally new beginning as it would be after a new election or a new mandate from the people on a new set of proposals. The Taoiseach was a Member of this Government since June 1977 and as such he is responsible as anyone else for the manifesto on which this Government and many Members of the House were elected.  A few days ago on a radio programme we heard extracts from interviews that had been conducted with Deputy Haughey during the 1977 election campaign, and Deputy Haughey strongly defended and advocated the terms of the manifesto, as indeed did the former Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Professor O'Donoghue.  The Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party are still committed to the terms of the manifesto, and if they are not they should say so clearly and unequivocably so as to let the country know where they stand.  It is a little late to depart from some of the approaches in the manifesto, because they have already done incredible damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic approach of the Government over the last two-and-a-half years has not, by any objective assessment, been successful.  There were some indications, although somewhat ambiguous, in the Taoiseach's press conference but there were aspects of economic policy that had been pursued over the past two-and-a-half years which he was not fully in agreement with.  It would be regrettable if the Taoiseach did <Col N="2059" /> not make these aspects he does not agree with known to the people and tell us by what approach he intends to replace them.</P>
    <P>First of all, we should get a clear statement: is full employment still the first priority of this Government?  That should be answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  If it is still the priority how is it intended that it be attained?  Is the emphasis to be put even more on the private sector for job creation?  I would expect that that would be the approach, knowing the political philosophy and views of the Taoiseach. If it is the approach how is it to be done? What further incentives is it intended to give the private sector and what guarantee can be obtained from them, if they are in receipt of more incentives, that they will produce the number of jobs that are required?  Or is there to be an expansion of the activity of the public sector in job creation?  Is, as I understand from some discussions that took place under the national understanding, the National Enterprise Agency to come into being?  If it is, what precisely will its role be?  What will its terms of reference be and what money will be made available to it?</P>
    <P>Deputy Martin O'Donoghue is gone. One would like to know and the people would like an assurance on whether the economic policy he was pursuing on behalf of the Government is also totally gone as he and his Department are.  If there is to be a change what form will it take?  If there is to be a change in the full commitment of the Government, given by him on their behalf regarding the National Enterprise Agency that any shortfall in job creation would be made up by the Government, it should be made known now and in clear unequivocal terms.  If the National Enterprise Agency is to be brought into being when will it be?  What role precisely is it to play?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is facing an extremely difficult task in practically every area of our national life.  I and members of my party have profound differences with the political philosophy of the Taoiseach and obviously of the party which elected <Col N="2060" /> him.  I bear no personal animosity towards any man in this House but I have a strong political philosophy and a deep commitment and conviction of the correctness of that philosophy.  I make no apology to anyone inside or outside the House for advocating that policy and pointing out the incorrectness of the policy that I believe the Taoiseach and his Government will pursue in future as he and his associates have pursued in the past.  Not only is it an incorrect approach but it is an extremely damaging and divisive approach as far as the national community is concerned.  The end product is undoubtedly&mdash;I make no apology for repeating myself&mdash;very considerable hardship and misery which is unnecessary, and that is what makes it an abomination in our society.  There is an urgent need for a real genuine redistribution of the wealth that exists in our society and an assurance that any wealth that is created will be redistributed on an equitable basis.</P>
    <P>I do not expect that approach from the Taoiseach or his party.  I am confident that it is a fact that a large number of Irishmen and women are becoming aware of.  They are becoming aware of this one basic political fact: unless there are fundamental changes in our social and economic structures the evils that manifest themselves in that human misery cannot and will not be abolished.</P>
    <P>At present&mdash;the Taoiseach faces these problems and is mainly responsible for their solution&mdash;we have an inflation rate of 15 per cent.  The Taoiseach mentioned the EEC countries and compared our prospective growth rate with theirs as being encouraging.  It is not encouraging. They have reached a state of development that we as yet still aspire to.  While they may have a lesser potential growth rate next year, the year after or the year after that, the state of development which they are at now leaves them far ahead of us and the quality of life that we enjoy.  Remember this: this Government inherited a growth rate of approximately 7 per cent.  We are now optimistically hoping it will be 3 per cent. They inherited a situation in which the inflation rate was brought down to 7 per <Col N="2061" /> cent.  Now that figure has more than doubled.  The unemployment rate is still approximately 9 per cent.  We have had cutbacks in real terms in all our social services.  Local authority housing, I am given to understand, will not exceed 5,000 houses this year.  These are only some of the problems.</P>
    <P>I am trying to put this into terms that the ordinary people understand.  When we talk about GNP and estimates for this and inflation for that and relationships with something else, a lot of people do not understand that what we are talking about is that they will not get a house, their family will remain in one room next year and the year after and their daddy, husband, son, or brother will not get a job.  Their son or daughter, if they get the advantage of third level education, which only approximately 11 per cent of our population get at present, attained at considerable sacrifice by their fathers and mothers&mdash;the likelihood of them getting a job in Irish society and the way it is developing is diminishing and not increasing.  These are the things that count.</P>
    <P>The Ministers, Tánaiste and Taoiseach will face major problems in the immediate future.  They will face them in the budget.  What will they do about PAYE? What will the Taoiseach's and the Government approach be towards farmer taxation?  Are farmers going to be asked to contribute on the same basis as other earners?  Is there going to be a genuine attempt to have an equitable tax system that will include all people, farmers, professional classes and so on?  Such decisions will not be popular politically but in the interest of the country the right decisions must be made.</P>
    <P>The new Taoiseach and his Government will be watched closely by people in Ireland.  I know that if we are to judge by his record when he was Minister for Finance we could anticipate a sharp increase in indirect taxation.  I know the Taoiseach cannot disclose his intentions regarding the budget but I sound this note: indirect taxation is unjust because it imposes a tax without any regard for <Col N="2062" /> the ability of the individual to pay.  I can tell the Taoiseach that if his Government go down that road trying to avoid facing up to the correct but hard decisions regarding the taxation code, he will meet with severe opposition from this party. We do not intend to allow even greater inequities to be brought into existence between the haves and the have-nots in our society.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach gave only two indications as to what he regarded as his priorities.  He regarded energy, and correctly so, as being an issue that is going to loom very large in the future development of the country.  The decision we make in that area will be extremely important for the future of the country and its people.  Nuclear energy will be an issue, a very controversial issue, in Irish society in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>We understand that Deputy O'Malley gave an undertaking at a Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis that there would be a public inquiry into the question of nuclear energy.  Then, as things developed&mdash;we are subject to correction by the Taoiseach if we are wrong in this&mdash;after giving the undertaking to have a public inquiry it was indicated clearly that irrespective of the findings of the inquiry the Government had already made up their mind to go ahead with nuclear energy.</P>
    <P>The position of my party is as follows. We believe this to be an extremely important issue and one that will become even more important, particularly in a society like ours where there is such a large percentage of young people.  They are more conscious, more concerned and possibly more far seeing than people in an older age group.  Our approach is that there should be a full public inquiry and that all interested groups or parties should be facilitated in giving evidence before the inquiry.  It would stimulate public debate and it would ensure that there was an educated population with regard to this question.  It would take approximately 18 months or two years to go through that process and after that whatever arrangements that are necessary should be undertaken to have <Col N="2063" /> a referendum on the question whether we should have nuclear energy as part of our energy development.  During the course of that public inquiry, all other possible alternatives to nuclear energy could be gone into fully in order to see if they were valid or feasible.  That would be a major contribution.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke about Northern Ireland.  This matter is very delicate.  I do not believe anyone in this House wants to gain political capital out of this matter. I do not believe anyone here would raise issues or ask questions that would be damaging towards furthering peace and reconciliation in that part of our country.  We want to bring an end to the terrible violence that has gone on for the past ten years.  I say this without animosity.  The Taoiseach has a reputation on Northern Ireland which, to say the least, is unhelpful towards those ends.  He must accept full responsibility himself for that reputation because of his silence and because he had allowed other people to appear to speak in his name during the past nine years.  There is a tremendous responsibility on him now to remove that suspicion as fast as he can. If he does not hold those views, if he holds different views, let him make them known.  I promise him that if he adopts an approach that will help towards reconciliation in Northern Ireland he will get the total, unreserved support of this party.</P>
    <P>There is a great responsibility on the Taoiseach.  He did the damage and only he can undo it so far as his image in that area is concerned.  There is worry&mdash;I will not use a stronger word&mdash;in many southern Irish hearts on that issue and on the Taoiseach's image in that area. How much more so must there be on the northern side of the Border?  Let him remove the fear.  If it is a false image, let him remove it fast.  We will help him.  I must be honest if I am to be of help.  The Taoiseach will not remove that fear by quoting the first article of the 1975 Fianna Fáil policy statement.  He will remove it by spelling out and making clear what the second article means.  If it means what I read it to mean and if I am <Col N="2064" /> to take what the Taoiseach said here this evening as being sincere and honest, let him repudiate it.</P>

      <P>The Higher Education Authority is required under the terms of the Higher Education Authority Act 1971 to maintain a continuous review of the demand and need for higher education and to advise me from time to time as required in this regard.  Early this year in consultation with IDA it was ascertained that the programme for industrial development formulated by that body would require a significant increase in the output of skilled manpower in certain key areas. This was confirmed by the Manpower Consultative Committee of the Minister for Labour which by then had identified the categories of manpower shortage in these areas.</P>
      <P>Following a comprehensive examination of the situation I approved a set of proposals for implementation to meet the needs of the situation.  Consequent on this decision special courses are being established or existing courses expanded as from the commencement of the academic year 1979-80 in third-level institutions as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4 University Colleges&mdash;UCD, UCC, UCG and TCD; 1 Institute of <Col N="1768" /> Higher Education&mdash;NIHE Limerick; 6 Regional Technical Colleges &mdash;Athlone, Cork, Dundalk,, Galway, Sligo, Waterford; 4 Institutes and Colleges under Vocational Education Committees&mdash;Bolton Street and Kevin Street Colleges of Technology and College of Commerce, Rathmines, Dublin and the Technical Institute Limerick. </P>
    <P>It is not feasible to indicate the cost of each individual course as more than one course is being provided in an institution and in the case of the Vocational Education sector the additional allocation of money is made to the Vocational Education Committee with due regard to the general financial circumstances of the committee.  The over-all additional cost in 1979 is, however, estimated at £1.725 million.  The provision to be made in each subsequent year will be considered in connection with the requirements of the situation as ascertained at the time of the preparation of the over-all annual estimates for presentation to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The arrangements introduced in 1979 require the employment of about 140 teaching staff and 85 support staff.  The requirements in subsequent years will be determined in accordance with developments and related circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that there are no valid grounds for complaint in relation to the level of fees, grants, teaching staff or general facilities in the case of this college.</P>
      <P>The adjustment in the fees charged in the regional technical colleges as from the commencement of the academic year 1979-80 must be seen in the context that, in general, the fees were at an unrealistically low level, having regard to the level of the educational service being provided.  At the same time the level of the higher education grants and of the scholarships awarded by the vocational education committees, and the conditions of eligibility in relation to means, were improved dramatically.  An illustration of this improvement was the increase from £500 to £600, and corresponding increases in other award levels, and raising the eligibility limit from £5,100 to £6,100.</P>
      <P>The allocation of teachers for 1979-80 is fully adequate to requirements.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Statement by Minister for Education on Report of Board of Visitors of the National Museum for the Year 1977-78.</i>
      </P>
      <P>The Report of the Board of Visitors of the National Museum of Ireland for the year 1977-78 has been presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with statutory requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education has noted the comments of the Board of Visitors and wishes to make the following observations. <Col N="1787" /> Both he and the Minister of State at the Department of Education are continuing to take appropriate action to improve conditions in the National Museum.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has had a number of meetings with representatives of the Board of Visitors regarding the question of accommodation and the future development of the National Museum.</P>
    <P>Specific measures as follows have been taken in relation to the Museum:</P>
    <P>During the past year, additional accommodation at 7-9 Merrion Row was fitted out and these excellent premises have been handed over to the National Museum.</P>
    <P>Following the Government's approval, in principle, of proposals for the provision at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, of conference facilities, alternative accommodation was sought for the National Museum material stored there.  Suitable premises have since been acquired at Daingean and the transfer of the material in question is proceeding. Special arrangements are being made to ensure that security precautions, temperature and humidity control will be up to optimum standards.  The relevant experts with ancillary staff have been recruited to ensure that the collections are removed with maximum efficiency and safety.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made for works to deal with the outbreak of dry rot, leaking pipes, and so on, and these are in the hands of the Office of Public Works.  These works, which include opening up, treatment, reinstatement and redecoration are at an advanced stage and are proceeding satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Thirteen new posts have been created in the National Museum.  Of these, nine have been filled to date and arrangements are being made for the filling of the remaining four posts by open competition to be conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister of State has been actively promoting the developing of a policy in relation to the establishment of museums at selected centres <Col N="1788" /> throughout the country.  A series of meetings has been held with the National Museum Development Committee, an <i>ad hoc</i> body, which consists of representatives of Regional Development Organisations.  Certain locations outside Dublin have been suggested as possible centres for museums.  The implementation of this policy would have the twofold effect of decentralising the museum service while, at the same time, alleviating pressure of space and staff in the National Museum.  The Minister regards the strengthening of the National Museum and the development of a policy of partial decentralisation as being mutually supportive.</P>

      <P>The fares payable per term by pupils who are not eligible for free transport and who travel on a fare-paying basis on special school transport services have been increased as follows with effect from September 1979: Primary pupils: From £2.25 to £3.50 where only one member of a family travels under this arrangement, and from £1.50 to £2.50 per pupil where more than one member of a family avail of the facility.  Post-Primary pupils: From £3.00 to £4.50 where only member of a family travels as a fare-payer, and from £2.10 to £3.50 per pupil where more than one member of a family travel on this basis.</P>
      <P>These increases have been necessitated by the continuing rise in the cost of providing school transport facilities.  I may say that the cost to the parents remains low and bears little relation to the actual cost of providing school transport facilities.</P>

      <P>There has been no change in the present school-year, that is, 1978-79 in the regulations governing the scheme for the transport of pupils to secondary schools. A community school has for the purpose of the scheme at all times been considered suitable for all the pupils of the community in whose area the school is situated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may add, however, that, where for the purpose of the school transport scheme a school transport catchment area has been recognised for a particular <Col N="1791" /> second-level school under Protestant management and a community school is subsequently established within that catchment area in circumstances unrelated to the need to make school provision for Protestant pupils, the existing transport arrangements may be continued for the pupils concerned.</P>

      <P>The realisation of the targets for 1979 as set out in the White Paper &ldquo;Programme for National Development 1978-81&rdquo; was conditional on a favourable international climate and on the necessary domestic support especially in terms of industrial peace.</P>
      <P>Understandably, events in 1979, both domestically and internationally, mean that there will be a shortfall in the growth and employment targets and a deterioration in the rate of inflation. Despite these setbacks, the growth rate is expected to be 4 per cent&mdash;one of the highest in the European Community&mdash;while an employment increase tentatively estimated at 15,000 is expected by the end of 1979.  Progress on this scale demonstrates what can be achieved in the face of difficulties.  They suggest that the correct course of action is not for the Government to alter its strategy, but rather to work for the removal of obstacles to even faster progress.  This the Government has set out to do, through the national understanding.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the review of the Community's Regional Policy including the Regional Fund Regulation was only completed in <Col N="1796" /> February of this year when the Council adopted a resolution on Guidelines for a Community Regional Policy and a regulation amending the Regional Fund Regulation.  The amending fund regulation provides that the next three-year review by the Council will take place before 1 January 1981 on the basis of Commission proposals.  In the period which has elapsed since February last, no useful initiative could be taken by us in expediting such proposals pending more experience by the member states and the Commission with the provisions of the amending regulation.</P>
      <P>I should mention, however, that one of the main innovations resulting from the recent review is the establishment of a non-quota section in the regional fund. This is intended to finance specific Community regional development measures including, as a result of an initiative by the Government here, requests for aid in border areas situated in the poorest regions of the Community.</P>
      <P>The Commission has now finalised its first series of proposals for Non-Quota Section assistance and these were submitted to the Council on 16 October last. These proposals concern five programme areas including, at the request of the Irish and UK Governments, a programme of assistance for the development of the Irish border areas.</P>
      <P>Considering the inordinate delay in getting the Council's agreement to the amending fund regulation, I do not wish to play down the difficulties involved but I can assure the Deputy that during our Presidency we aim to have these proposals examined as quickly as possible and hopefully adopted by the end of the year.  The Deputy will, no doubt, be pleased to know that the European Parliament is being consulted on these proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 to 120, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In reply, I should like to clear up the misunderstandings, deliberate or otherwise, which seem to have given rise to these Questions which were put down following the meeting of the Budget Council on 11 September 1979 when it adopted a draft budget for 1980 and which concerns the effects of the adoption of this draft budget on the Community's Regional and Social Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1798" /> The first point to emphasise is that Council decisions on the Community's budget are taken on a qualified majority basis and the question of our exercising a veto to secure higher figures than are agreed by qualified majority does not arise.</P>
    <P>As the Council proceedings are confidential, it would not be appropriate for me to go into details as to the considerations which influenced member states in their respective negotiating positions, or to reveal these positions, except to say that, for instance, as far as the Regional Fund was concerned the 1980 allocation for the Fund of 650 million EUA (£436 million) established by the European Council in December 1977 weighed most heavily on certain member states. Other member states, including Ireland were seeking substantial increases in the funds, in our case because we regard the sums available as being completely inadequate by reference to the scale of the regional and social problems to be tackled at Community level.</P>
    <P>Long and arduous negotiations took place before compromise figures of 1,015 million EUA and 876 million EUA respectively emerged at the Council's second reading of the budget on 23 November.  These were the highest figures for which a qualified majority could be found representing increases of 7.4 per cent and 13.8 per cent over the 1979 figures of 945 million EUA and 770 million EUA respectively and, as far as the Regional Fund was concerned, an increase of 56 per cent over the figure planned for 1980 by the European Council in December 1977.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must emphasise that the 1980 EEC Budget has not been adopted by the budgetary authority which comprises the Council and the Parliament. The position now is that following discussions between the two institutions on 13 December, Parliament has rejected the draft 1980 budget.  Further discussion will therefore have to take place in the new year with a view to agreement being reached on the budget.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Assistance from the European Regional Development Fund was approved in respect of 73 Irish projects in 1977 and 121 projects in 1978.  A description of these projects together with details of their overall cost, of the overall contribution by the Regional Fund, and the total national contribution will be found by the Deputy in replies (Volume 307, columns 2499-2508) and (Volume 311, columns 1161-1165) to Parliamentary Questions by Deputy Enright on 29 June 1978 and by Deputy O'Connell on 14 February 1979.</P>
      <P>For the reasons explained in these replies it is not the practice nor is it feasible to give the amount of fund aid for individual projects.  This is due to the fact that, under the fund regulation, the Commission determines a single aggregate aid figure for grouped applications, namely grouped projects each costing less than 10 million EUA, or £6.7 million, which account for the major proportion of Irish-assisted projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann <Col N="1800" /> Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>I presume that when Deputy Murphy refers to the cost of living index, he is in fact speaking of the consumer price index. The latest published figures show that between mid-August 1978 and mid-August 1979, the consumer price index rose by 13.6 per cent.  It is expected that the quarterly increase in consumer prices to mid-November will be about 3 per cent as compared with a rise of 4.1 per cent in the quarter to mid-August.  On this basis the average increase in the consumer price index in 1979 will be about 13 per cent.</P>
      <P>The prospects of a deceleration in the rate of increase in consumer prices in 1980 will depend critically on our response to the impact of the oil price rises occurring in 1979.  Attempts to seek compensation for these energy price rises will simply result in even higher inflation rates.  The only practical way of compensating for higher external prices is to raise productivity and accelerate growth.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the confusion or inconvenience to which the Deputy refers.  As he knows, these workers are concerned with taxation under two jurisdictions and consequently their taxation position is not as straightforward as it would be if they were employed within the State.</P>
      <P>The regulations governing the taxation of their remuneration arise out of the Double Taxation Agreement with the United Kingdom, signed on 2 June 1976. Under Article 15 of that agreement, Irish residents exercising an employment in the United Kingdom became chargeable to tax there on their remuneration as from 1977-78.  That tax is deducted from their remuneration under the PAYE system in force there.  As Irish residents, the workers continue to be chargeable to Irish tax but are entitled to double taxation relief, under Article 21 of the agreement, by the grant of a credit for the United Kingdom tax payable against the Irish tax charged on the same earnings.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may recall that, as a transitional measure, in view of the fact that the workers became liable to United Kingdom tax under the PAYE system, special provision was made in the Finance Act, 1978 as a result of which one half year's tax was remitted.</P>

      <P>Stamp Duty is payable on the occasion of a sale or of a voluntary conveyance of property.  In the case of a sale, the value <Col N="1809" /> for stamp duty is the amount realised on the sale, a figure that is determined by the vendor and purchaser.  Where the conveyance is voluntary the value for duty is agreed by the parties concerned with the commissioner of valuation acting on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners. The value for stamp duty in the case of a voluntary conveyance is the value of the property, that is, the amount that the property would realise on a sale in the open market on the date of the transfer.  There are no statistics available classifying sales or voluntary dispositions of agricultural land by value per acre for stamp duty purposes. Therefore it is not possible to indicate the number of cases where values of £4,000 per acre or more have applied.</P>

    <P>NOTE:</P>
    <P>1.  The European Regional Development Fund was established on 18 March 1975.</P>
    <P>2.  Allocations are given in the form of budgetary commitments.  Where a project does not proceed as planned, the member State concerned can request decommitment of ERDF aid for that project: the sum decommitted can then be reallocated to another project in the same member State.  Decommitments do not, therefore, involve any loss to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1811" /> 3.  The figures for 1979 cover the period January to November.  Applications totalling a further £14.09 million in ERDF aid are at present being considered by the Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will give a detailed breakdown on a county by county basis of the apportioning of the 1979 EEC Regional Fund's moneys whether spent or committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Assistance from the European Regional Development Fund is not apportioned on a county by county basis.</P>
      <P>I should like to stress that the amount of money available from the Fund is very small in relation to total public investment. In 1979 for example it has been estimated that receipts from the Fund will only amount to about 2.5 per cent of the total cost of the public capital programme.  This means that of the very many eligible projects being undertaken, only a very small proportion can be submitted for ERDF aid.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Regional Fund assistance is given in the form of commitments, not in outright payments. Before any payment is received, the Exchequer must bear the cost of the investment itself and then seek a recoupment from the Regional Fund.  In a sense, the Exchequer is providing the fund with interest-free loans.  Accordingly, when my Department select projects in consultation with the Department of Economic Planning and Development while they try to achieve an overall balance both in regard to the geographical location of the projects and in regard to the categories of investment represented, it gives priority to projects where commitments can be converted to payments as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is <Col N="1812" /> referring to the estimated payment appropriation of 186 million European Units of Account which the Commission envisages may be carried forward from 1979 to 1980.  Any money thus carried forward will be used in 1980 to cover payment claims submitted that year. There is therefore no question of the money not being used.</P>
      <P>The uncertainty regarding the amount in payment appropriations required to meet payment claims in a particular financial year arises from the way in which the Regional Fund operates.  Decisions to grant fund aid are expressed in multi-year commitments, but the time it takes for these commitments to be paid up depends on the timing of national expenditure on the aided projects.  This in turn is dependent on many factors, some of which are not under the member States' control&mdash;for example, the time taken by industrialists in carrying out grant-aided investments, which will be influenced by market conditions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The delay in the publication of the bound volumes of the Acts of the Oireachtas for the years subsequent to 1975 is due to a number of factors, the main one being a shortage of staff in the Translation Section of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As well, the 1976 statutes are exceptionally bulky and may run to three volumes: however, they are now being printed and are expected to be published within the next few months. Due to the delay in the preparation of <Col N="1813" /> the 1976 volumes, the volumes for 1977 and 1978 will also be delayed.</P>
      <P>(b)  The reprinting of out-of-print bound volumes, by photographic methods or otherwise, has been considered. However, as I indicated in my reply to a similar question on 18 October last, it is estimated that the demand for these volumes would be relatively small and the economic price of the volumes would be substantial.  In view of this, and the fact that all the statutes in the out-of-print volumes are available in single form, and that full sets of the volumes are available in libraries such as the Law Library, Kings Inn Library and University libraries, it is not considered that republication would be justified.</P>
      <P>(c)  An annual Index to statutes is published, the latest one being that for 1978.  The consolidated &ldquo;Index to the Statutes&rdquo; is published at approximately five-yearly intervals.  The latest one covers the period to 1975, and includes a supplement for 1976.  The updating of this volume is scheduled to commence in 1980.  The production of the consolidated Index on an annual basis is not considered justified in view of the existence of the annual Index which can be used in conjunction with the consolidated Index.</P>

      <P>The Commission of the European Communities estimated that if Greece were a full member of the Communities in 1978 the net additional expenditure involved for the Community budget would have been approximately 400 million European Units of Account which would have represented 3.2 per cent of the 1978 budget.  The Treaty of Accession for Greece provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the provisions of the EAGGF Guarantee <Col N="1814" /> Section will generally be applied to Greece on a phased basis during the transitional period up to the end of 1985 and that Greece will be entitled to certain refunds on its payments of Own Resources to the Community during that period.  Taking account of the transitional arrangements the Commission has estimated that the net increase in the Community budget arising from Greek membership will be 80 million European Units of Account in 1981 and 220 million European Units of Account in 1982.  These figures, represent approximately 0.4 per cent and 1 per cent respectively of the total budgets forecast by the Commission for 1981 and 1982.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 to 181, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that, with 179 adult beds and 42 children's beds, there is a degree of overcrowding in St. Loman's Hospital.  However a number of measures are being taken to rectify this <Col N="1826" /> situation.  The conversion of a staff residence to provide an additional 15 places in a new patient unit has been approved and should be ready for occupation by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The provision of a specialised 40-bed children's unit on the Cherry Orchard Hospital site has been approved.  This is in the process of being planned and the eventual transfer of the children to this unit will provide accommodation for approximately 40 additional adult beds in St. Loman's.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above developments the provision of a special unit in the Ballyfermot industrial estate to provide day hospital facilities for St. Loman's catchment areas has been approved. Negotiations are in progress for the acquisition of this unit.  Provision for a hostel at Fonthill for discharged patients from St. Loman's has also been approved.</P>
    <P>There are 117 psychiatric nurses (including seven trainee nurses) employed in the adult service in St. Loman's&mdash;20 psychiatric nurses and six state enrolled nurses are employed in the children's unit.</P>
    <P>A further group of 12 nurses, comprising general trained and mental handicap nurses, are being recruited for a post-graduate course at the hospital, they will also carry out nursing duties.</P>
    <P>The reports I have received indicate that a satisfactory level of nursing care is being provided for patients in the hospital, including those acutely disturbed. While there is a shortage of nurses, it is not such as to significantly affect the level of care of the patients.  There are trained nurses in all wards in the hospital whose services are supplemented by auxiliary staff.</P>
    <P>St. Loman's Hospital is not a nurse training hospital but some trainees from other hospitals undergo practical training there.  I am satisfied that the facilities for this at St. Loman's Hospital are adequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there is a grave shortage of geriatric beds in County Meath.  While there are 36 beds in the County Infirmary, Navan, only 27 beds have been in use for some years past as nine beds on the top floor had to be taken out of commission because of fire risk.</P>
      <P>Thirteen of the 27 beds are used for geriatric patients and the remaining 14 for post-operative convalescent patients from the orthopaedic unit at Navan.  The percentage bed occupancy in relation to those 27 beds for the year 1978 was 89.6, which represents a high usage.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be referring to the position which arose some weeks ago when the beds for the convalescent orthopaedic patients were not being fully utilised as the operation list was curtailed due to the commission of a new operating suite in the orthopaedic unit in Navan.  This work has now been completed and the admission of convalescent orthopaedic patients has been resumed.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to relocate the patients in the temporary buildings at St. Ita's Hospital in renovated accommodation within the hospital or in accommodation which the health board may acquire elsewhere.  In recent months patients have been withdrawn from two of the six temporary buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The air filtering system in the heating installation in the new 72-bed unit has given rise to problems.  The health board are in discussion with the contractor and <Col N="1829" /> their consulting engineer with a view to eliminating the problems which have arisen.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the Parents and Friends Association from the hospital raised certain matters in relation to the cleaning and maintenance services at the hospital.  Subsequent to that meeting the Eastern Health Board have now arranged that two three-man teams of attendants will be assigned full-time to cleaning duties at the hospital.</P>
    <P>In regard to general maintenance works, I am not satisfied with the present level of such activity at the hospital and I am at present considering a proposal from the health board for additional funds to enable a number of urgent works to be undertaken next year.</P>
    <P>The general laundry services at the hospital are not satisfactory and the health board have made arrangements for the installation in the near future of new equipment.</P>
    <P>There are 482 nurses employed at St. Ita's Hospital, which represents a ratio of one nurse to 2.4 patients.  As there is a problem in recruiting nurses for the hospital, the health board have recruitment and the general nursing complement at the hospital under consideration.</P>

    <P>Speech therapy is a developing service, training for which commenced in this country only in 1969, the first graduates becoming available in 1972. Until 1979 students were trained in the Dublin College of Speech Therapy which could only cater for an annual intake of 15 students.  As from the current academic year training has been transferred to Trinity College and the annual intake of students has been increased to 20.  The question of a further expansion of training is at present under consideration by my Department.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the administration of disability benefit, medical supervision is necessary to ensure that only persons who are in fact sick are paid benefit.  This supervision is exercised through medical referees to whom claimants are from time to time referred for examination for the purpose of obtaining independent second medical opinions as to incapacity for work.</P>
      <P>When the examination is being arranged the claimant's medical certifier in all cases is notified of the date and place of the proposed examination and invited to attend if he so desires.  He is also requested to furnish particulars of the claimant's medical history and present condition, and to say whether the claimant is in a fit state of health to attend for examination.</P>
      <P>The medical referee system was introduced after consultation with representatives of the medical profession and there has been no change in the procedure for these examinations over the years.  If the certifier intimates that the claimant is not fit to attend his statement is accepted but there is no reason why a person who is fit to attend should object to examination by a medical referee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1835" /> There is no record of any case in which a claimant has complained that a request to attend for examination by a medical referee has amounted to harassment. If, however, the Deputy considers that hardship was caused to any person by attendance for such an examination the matter will be looked into if he will be good enough to furnish details.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the <Col N="1836" /> Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 to 204, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Normally claims for most of the benefits, pensions and allowances administered by my Department are submitted by post and any necessary inquiries in connection with them are also made by post.  During the postal dispute earlier this year only a small percentage of the claims arising during that period could be processed owing to the absence of postal deliveries.</P>
      <P>On the termination of the dispute the arrears of claims which had accumulated during the months of March to June, inclusive, were submitted to my Department. This large volume of claims, which together with the normal intake of claims created a serious problem, is being cleared as expeditiously as possible.  The staffs which deal with those claims have been working overtime on a continuous basis, including week-ends, since the termination of the postal dispute and a number of administrative measures have also been taken to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>In consequence delays in payment have been reduced substantially in most areas and eliminated in some areas.  In the majority of cases payment of benefit is being made promptly on the receipt of the necessary documents but in cases where inquiries are necessary some delay is still being experienced.  It is anticipated, however, that all payments will be up-to-date by mid-December.</P>
      <P>In the meantime any person in whose case payment has been delayed may apply to the local community welfare officer for a supplementary welfare allowance pending the receipt of any payment to which he is entitled from my Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> Normally any delay in the payment of pay-related benefit arises where the reckonable earnings of the person claiming is not available to my Department. In such cases the persons concerned are advised individually of the position and requested to obtain a certificate of earnings from their employer.  On receipt of the necessary certificate pay-related benefit, if any, is paid immediately.</P>

      <P>Where a claimant for disability benefit receives payment of supplementary welfare allowance pending a decision on his claim the relevant regulations under the Social Welfare Acts provide for the recoupment to the health board of the amount of the allowance received out of the disability benefit to which he may be entitled.</P>
      <P>During the recent postal dispute a small number of claimants received payment of disability benefit as well as supplementary welfare allowance in respect of the same period.  On finding that in cases where disability benefit is still being paid my Department was making weekly deductions for recoupment to the health board of the supplementary welfare allowance overpaid, it was decided that these deductions should be discontinued.</P>

      <P>Due to the postal dispute the renewal pension book was not issued until July 1979.  As she was being paid by the local Post Office on the stubs of her old pension book it was thought that she had continued to receive the increase for the two children.

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the reasons the percentage of total costs represented by staff costs in the Forestry and Wildlife service has risen from 23.8 per cent to 32.4 per cent since 1969-70 and if he expects this trend to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power) Patrick Power">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentages quoted by the Deputy are based on net expenditure, that is gross expenditure less <Col N="1846" /> Appropriations-in-Aid.  Since 1969-70 Appropriations-in-Aid have increased at a greater rate than expenditure because of increased wood production and this would be a contributory factor in increasing the ratio of staff costs to net expenditure.</P>
      <P>In so far as the change is attributable to this feature it is expected that the trend will continue.  There have in addition been staff increases because of the increase since 1970 of 40 per cent in the area managed by the Forestry and Wildlife Service and significantly because of additional responsibilities undertaken by the Forestry and Wildlife Service including wildlife conservation. Future trends in this respect will be affected by the duties assigned to the service and by the service's ability to control other costs.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the European Communities (Road Passenger Transport) Regulations, 1977, which give effect in this country to EEC Directive No. 74/562, persons carrying on a road passenger transport business with vehicles equipped to carry ten persons or more including the driver must, (subject to certain exemptions), hold a road passenger certificate as from 1 January 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under these regulations persons who first held a large public service vehicle licence between 1 January 1975 and 31 December 1977 automatically qualified for a road passenger certificate subject, however, to satisfying the requirements in relation to professional competence <Col N="1847" /> before 1 January 1980.  The undertaking referred to by the Deputy falls into this category, having obtained its first large public service vehicle licence in November 1977.  In this connection I should mention that experience gained in the operation of small public service vehicles cannot be considered for the purpose of meeting the professional competence requirements.</P>
    <P>The road passenger certificate which has been issued to the undertaking in question by my Department will, therefore, cease to have effect on 31 December 1979 if the professional competence requirements are not satisfied by that date.  These requirements may be satisfied by the designation by the undertaking of a manager who has passed the appropriate examination for a certificate of competence.</P>
    <P>Examinations for certificates of competence were held in December 1978, June 1979 and further examinations are scheduled to be held in December 1979. I understand that the undertaking concerned has now arranged for a representative to attend a course leading to the examination in December 1979.</P>

      <P>There is, I regret, a waiting list of over 30,000 for telephones in the 01 area at present.  Approximately one-quarter of the waiting list is for business lines and includes some 2,000 lines at 50 industrial estates.  The remainder are residence applications and include applications at over 200 housing estates with 20 houses or more.</P>
      <P>The big waiting list is due to two factors, namely, a substantial increase in the demand for telephones in 1977 and 1978, resulting from the buoyancy in the economy, the demand in 1978 having been 30 per cent higher than in 1977, the previous highest demand year, and secondly the non-availability of cabling in many areas throughout the city which restricts greatly the number of new connections that can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cabling work in the Dublin area was <Col N="1856" /> affected seriously by industrial action and its aftermath throughout much of 1978.  New cabling works were disrupted later by the need to divert all jointing staff to maintenance work to restore service following servere flood damage to cables last winter and by stores shortages arising from the postal dispute.</P>
    <P>Cabling work in Dublin is being speeded up in every way possible.  The number of jointing staff&mdash;the key group involved&mdash;is being increased by 50 per cent; the way in which jointing work is carried out has been reorganised, and contractors are being employed to supplement the efforts of the Department's staff.  Progress is being closely monitored, and the question of placing further contracts will be considered in the light of progress both by the contractors and by departmental staff.</P>
    <P>Priority in the cabling programme will be given to the needs of newly established industries, but it is planned to accelerate the cabling of residential areas also throughout the coming year.  The expectation is that upwards of 150 of the 200 housing estates referred to will be cabled and that service will be provided to the waiting applicants in these estates by the end of 1980.</P>
    <P>Installation staff resources generally in Dublin are being increased and it is planned to instal up to 25,000 telephones in the 01 area in 1980, much the biggest number installed in any year so far.  The groundwork for a continuing increase in the number of connections in the following years will, it is expected, also be laid in 1980.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy also to the £650 million telephone development programme announced last July which provides for a greatly accelerated pace of development for the telecommunications services generally including the provision of a high quality service promptly.  Progress towards achieving these objectives will, however, be gradual, the time assessed by the Department and by the Post Office Review Group for reaching the programme objectives being a minimum of five years.</P>

      <P>Under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, anyone who has in his possession or uses wireless telegraphy apparatus without an appropriate licence from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is committing an offence.  Citizens' band radio equipment is wireless telegraphy apparatus and in general operates in the 27 Megahertz band which is already reserved in this country for such purposes as paging systems, and industrial, scientific and medical equipment.  The use of citizens' band equipment on such frequencies can also cause serious interference with radio and television reception. For these reasons licences are not issued in respect of the use of this equipment and persons, including radio dealers, who hold or use it render themselves liable to prosecution.</P>
      <P>No reliable estimate is available of the number of persons using the equipment illegally in this country.  A survey for this purpose is not proposed.  I am, of course, aware that citizens' band radio equipment is in use in a number of European countries and in America.</P>

      <P>The campaign to eradicate bovine TB began here in 1954.  The entire State is now deemed to be an attested <Col N="1865" /> or disease-free area.

Apart from this change in emphasis, the existing land settlement policy continues to operate as heretofore.</P>
      <P>Up to 30 September this year the Land Commission had acquired some 6,800 ha&mdash;mostly in western counties&mdash;and I expect that the total intake for the year will be close to last year's figure of 8,700 ha.</P>

      <P>I understand from the company that there has been an unprecedented increase in the demand for coal and that they have supplied three times as much coal in the five months up to November as in the same period last year.  Because of the inability of the company's transport system to cope with the increased demand caused by large-scale, abnormal buying, they were forced to introduce a number of measures including a decision not to accept for delivery by themselves orders from outlying districts such as Brittas, Rathcoole, Saggart and Newcastle.</P>
      <P>The company envisaged that outlying areas not served by them would be supplied by bellmen who obtain their coal from Coal Distributors Ltd.  The company have indicated that recent industrial disputes affecting importation and handling of coal at Dublin port have resulted in the company being unable to give the bellmen the full tonnages they required or to accept orders from new bellmen.  Consequently, the bellmen were unable to provide consumers in the areas mentioned with as full a service as was desirable.</P>

      <P>Following a substantial increase in trade mark applications in 1972 and subsequent years, an examination of work procedures in the Patents Office was carried out.  This led to a reorganisation of the relevant section of the office and the provision of additional staff.</P>
      <P>The full benefit of additional staff resources cannot be realised without a lengthy training period and continuity of service by those trained.  Necessary staff movements makes the achievement of the latter objective difficult.  This and the increasing level of applications has militated against the objective of reducing the arrears.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Kilbarrack site is only six acres in area and it was acquired in 1972 for the purpose of building only one small institution, that is, a new women's prison. For reasons of economy the last administration did not proceed with the planned development.</P>
      <P>Having considered the matter upon taking office, I was impressed by the argument that some at least of the sixacre site in Kilbarrack ought to be made available as a recreation area for local people.</P>
      <P>As it happened, the need for a further site in or near Dublin to accommodate a new place of detention for juveniles had been evident for some time.  The 35-acre site at Wheatfield, Clondalkin, has ample room for a women's prison and a place of detention for juveniles.</P>
      <P>The proposed institutions are needed to replace very old and unsuitable ones. They are best located close to Dublin.</P>
      <P>In November 1979, the Office of Public Works, in accordance with the provisions of section 84 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, furnished information on the proposed new women's prison and place of detention for juveniles to Dublin County Council for their observations. I did not consult with any public representative for the area before making the decision.  On an issue of this kind I regard it as unrealistic not to recognise that local public representatives are expected to represent local interests and, if asked, they could not be expected to do anything other than express opposition to the establishment of a prison or other place of detention in their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is similar to that which arises in relation, for example, to the settlement of itinerants.  A fairly common reaction is to recognise that certain facilities have to be made available but to feel that they ought to be located somewhere else.  In fact, a modern prison with low buildings and otherwise properly planned would do no environmental damage either in the visual sense or otherwise but people living fairly close to the site are understandably likely to <Col N="1884" /> continue to fear that it would.  The Wheatfield site is, in fact, well distanced from residential development. Everything possible will be done to supply information to local representative groups who express an interest in the matter and I hope that in this way any fears will be allayed and ultimately removed altogether.  The same, of course, applies to local public representatives.</P>
    <P>The Wheatfield lands are not zoned as an open square area.  They are zoned for institutional/educational purposes.  The site is two miles away from Clondalkin village and it adjoins the public road leading from Clondalkin to Palmerstown.  It also adjoins the grounds of Cherry Orchard hospital and an itinerant settlement.</P>

My reply, therefore, refers to those who were meant to collect the cargo rather than to the consignee or consignees as such.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda Síochána that they do not know positively why the persons who were meant to collect the cargo did not turn up to collect it. However, it was clear that those people would not in fact turn up once information about the Garda detection was published in the newspapers.  The Garda cannot usefully speculate as to what might have happened if that information had not been so published.</P>
    <P>On the question of a leakage of information, there obviously was a disclosure to the communications media but this need not have come from a garda as a number of people outside the force were in a position to observe that certain activity, which they could recognise as being unusual activity, was taking place.  I am informed that there are so many possibilities as to how information could have reached the media that it would be a waste of time to embark on any kind of investigation.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 326 and 327 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any specific case of the kind mentioned in either question.  I cannot introduce the regulations that are asked for in Question No. 326 since, apart from any other consideration, there is no legislation that authorises the making of such regulations.</P>
      <P>However, both questions are essentially concerned with the availability and cost of private rented accommodation. In reply to a question in this House on 13 November I said that the Minister for the Environment expected shortly to be in a position to make a submission to the Government in regard to the various issues arising in relation to private rented accommodation, including an assessment of the operation of the Rent Restrictions Acts, and that in the circumstances I was not at that stage in a position to make any further comment.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 355 on 25 October 1979, in relation to rules for Loughan House.  I expect that work on the formal rules will be completed shortly.  The regime followed in practice is similar to that in the other special schools but the higher staff numbers in Loughan have made possible some procedures which are thought to be desirable such as the star system whereby the boys can be motivated towards good behaviour.</P>
      <P>The procedures regarding transfer of boys between special schools is laid down in section 69 of the Children Act, 1908, which provides that the Minister for Education may direct the transfer of a boy from one school to another.  In practice transfers are arranged after consultation between the directors of the schools and the two Departments.</P>

As to the appointment of an assistant county manager, while there is provision for such an appointment for counties and county boroughs, and while it would be legally possible that an assistant county manager be appointed for Louth County Council who would in practice be assigned wholetime to Drogheda Corporation, I do not think that this would be justified having regard to the present level of population and development in Drogheda.  The Deputy will appreciate that there is already a town clerk in Drogheda with the status of a county secretary.  To create a further post, at management level, would be out of line with practice throughout the country generally in relation to large boroughs and urban districts.</P>

I believe that road authorities are providing a reasonable service within the limits of the finances available to them.

      <P>I understand that the banks felt impelled to close in consequence of the very heavy volume of withdrawals in the wake of the decision by the Irish Bank Officials' Association to ban sterling transactions.  Following the closure, the banks conveyed to the Central Bank their view that they could not reopen while the officials' action continued.  The Central Bank after consideration of the implications for the national economy and the banking system accepted this view and advised my Department accordingly. As the Deputy is aware, the banks reopened for normal business promptly following the acceptance by the IBOA on 29 November of the settlement terms proposed at the Joint Industrial Council.  I am pleased that the dispute was resolved speedily and that the inconvenience to the public of an extended closure was avoided.</P>

      <Col N="1899" /> While the tenure of office of the staff in question is not governed by the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977, I would not accept the suggestion that they are subject to arbitrary dismissal without redress. Their dismissal requires a decision at Ministerial level, and I am satisfied that they are safeguarded against unfair dismissal under existing procedures.  Accordingly I do not consider it necessary to make specific provision for their inclusion within the scope of the 1977 Act.</P>

      <P>Prior to 15 October 1979 payment of British social welfare pensions to persons residing in this country was made by pension orders payable at weekly intervals at the post offices of their choice.  On entry into the EMS and the break in the link with sterling a currency conversion charge should ordinarily have been made for the encashment of these orders.  However, as post offices do not operate a currency conversion service, payment was made at face value pending the making of permanent alternative arrangements for the payment of the pensions.</P>
      <P>As from 15 October the British authorities are paying the pensions direct to the pensioners by orders cashable through banks.  The basis on which payment is made has, however, been changed from the weekly to four-weekly intervals in arrears.  Despite very strong representations by my Department the British authorities would not agree to operate a system of weekly payment on the grounds that all British overseas pensioners are paid by computer prepared orders at four-weekly intervals in arrears and that no exception could be made in the case of persons residing in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the pensioners were notified individually by the British authorities of <Col N="1903" /> the revised arrangements for the payment of their pensions.</P>
    <P>Recent inquiries to the British Ministry indicate that payments to British pensioners residing in this country are being issued promptly every four weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the social benefit or allowance being received by a person (details supplied) and his wife, the amount of that allowance, the number of social insurance stamps held by him and if there are any other allowances or benefits to which he or his wife are entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned is at present in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance at the rate of £3.85 per week. His wife is receiving disability benefit and pay-related benefit at the rate of £19.80 per week.  The combined total, namely £23.65, is equal to the current weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance payable in respect of a man and his wife.</P>
      <P>He has a total of 455 contributions paid under the Social Welfare Act from 5 January 1953 to 1970, inclusive.  He had no contributions in the years 1971 to 1978 as he was self-employed as a brick-layer during these years.  He has a total of 24 paid contributions in respect of the period from 1 March 1979 to 10 August 1979.  He was in receipt of unemployment assistance from 19 August to 24 September 1979 from which date he has been submitting medical evidence of incapacity for work.</P>
      <P>As more than two years have elapsed since this man last had contributions to his credit in 1970 he cannot qualify for benefit or credited contributions until he has a total of 26 weeks of insurable employment since his re-entry into insurance in March 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition in order to qualify for payment he would require a total of at least 26 contributions paid or credited in the <Col N="1904" /> governing contribution year which in the case of his present claim is the 1978 contribution year.  As he had no contributions paid or credited in that year and as he has less than 26 paid contributions since his re-entry into insurance he cannot qualify for payment of benefit until after June 1980 at the earliest.</P>
    <P>On recovery from his present illness he will be entitled to payment of unemployment assistance in respect of himself and his wife.  The latter could continue to receive payment of disability benefit provided that she remains incapable of work and submits medical evidence of incapacity.  If, however, her husband continues to be incapable of work she could qualify for an increased personal rate of benefit and also for an increase of benefit in respect of him as a dependent spouse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated total annual cost of increasing by 20 per cent the current rates of disability benefit and unemployment benefit is as follows: disability benefit, £16,969,000; unemployment benefit, £9,570,000.</P>
      <P>Pay-related benefit is calculated on the basis of an individual's earnings, and accordingly the rates of payment made vary in each individual case.  Based on current expenditure, the annual cost of an increase of 20 per cent in pay-related benefit would be approximately £4,500,000.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Industrial Development Authority in conjunction with Irish Leathers Ltd. has, through its overseas offices, been promoting the Gorey tannery with a view to having it reopened.  A number of companies have expressed an interest in the project and some have visited Gorey.  I understand that negotiations between Irish Leathers Ltd. and one company are well advanced and it is hoped that a definitive proposal may be presented to the authority shortly.  The authority have also approached a number of Irish concerns but so far no real interest in the takeover of the tannery has been forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Ansil Ltd. recently commenced the manufacture of aluminium doors and windows in an IDA advance factory in Gorey and work has already commenced on an expansion of the factory.  This project has the potential to employ 240 workers by the end of 1981.</P>

      <P>I am not so aware.  The relevant provision of the Bord na Móna (Regular Works Employees) Superannuation Scheme 1963, as amendmed, specifies a number of matters in respect of which appeals can be made to the trustees.  The Deputy's question however seems to relate to the issue of early retirement on grounds of ill health from the service of the board which comes into the area of the employment contract and is therefore a matter for the board.  The superannuation scheme provides that the board, in deciding whether an injured or disabled employee should retire, should act on the advice of a medical practitioner.  I have not received any proposals from Bord na Móna for the amendment of the appeals system.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities say that the area, which is in Crumlin Garda District, is receiving constant attention and that a special Garda mobile patrol operates in that area as well as in other areas throughout the district.</P>

      <P>The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  As explained in the reply to a previous Question on 13 November, the statistics relate to charges.  I am informed by the Garda authorities, on the basis of their knowledge of the situation in a number of other countries, that it is common practice for police statistics to show as &ldquo;offences detected&rdquo; or &ldquo;offences cleared up&rdquo; all offences in respect of which charges are preferred.  As already indicated, it is to be understood that the statistics relating to offences by persons on bail are given only as a good general guide to the known extent of the <Col N="1937" /> problem.  However, in the view of the Garda authorities, they significantly understate rather than overstate the extent to which offences are committed by persons on bail as the Garda are satisfied that many offences are so committed without the Garda being able to obtain evidence to justify a charge.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, it is proposed to take Questions Nos. 399 to 403, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The report on the juvenile liaison officer scheme to which the Deputy refers is a confidential study which was undertaken with a view to determining what the results might be of expanding or otherwise changing the scheme, and which was prepared on the basis that it would not be published.  It would be contrary to established practice to disclose details of or make public comment on such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the operation of the juvenile liaison officer scheme, the action to be taken in regard to any young person who comes to the attention of the <Col N="1939" /> Garda in relation to crime is a matter initially for the local Garda district or divisional officer.  If, by an &ldquo;automatic referral system&rdquo; what is implied is that juvenile liaison officers should have authority to deal under the scheme with a young person no matter how serious the crime of which he is accused, I do not think that such a proposition would be defensible.</P>
    <P>I fully support the aims of the juvenile liaison officer scheme and, as the Deputy may be aware, a central administration unit, which has responsibility also for the development of Garda community relations, was established at Garda headquarters within the past year with a view to achieving a more effective operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Since the commencement of the scheme in 1963, about 13,000 juveniles have been dealt with under the scheme and the strength of the juvenile liaison officer unit has increased from the original strength of one sergeant and seven gardaí to a current strength, excluding the administration section, of four sergeants and 40 gardaí.  An assessment of the needs of the juvenile liaison officer scheme is a matter in the first instance for the Garda authorities, who have informed me that the results of surveys into the staffing needs and the work under the scheme which were completed last month are at present being evaluated by them.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that it is not proposed to reduce the strength of the juvenile liaison officer unit in the Dublin Metropolitan Area (South).  A vacancy which occurred in the unit last month is to be filled as soon as practicable.  I understand that a survey of the staffing needs and work of the juvenile liaison officers in the area is being carried out with a view to determining if an expansion of the scheme in this and adjoining areas would be warranted.</P>
    <P>As regards Question No. 403, I am aware of the official transport facilities being provided for certain organised activities for young persons that are <Col N="1940" /> arranged in the North.  The question of introducing a similar scheme under the auspices of the Garda juvenile liaison officer unit is under consideration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment (1) the present and (2) proposed system of appeals available to servants of local authorities and health boards against decisions affecting service, pensions, gratuities, etc., and if any statutory or other rules prevent an aggrieved employee from making an appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Sylvester Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 66 of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, contains the general provisions under which a servant who is aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a local authority to make a superannuation award in his respect or to return his superannuation contributions, or who is aggrieved by the amount of any such award has a right of appeal to the Minister for the Environment. The section also specifies time limits for the making of such appeals. Section 65 of the Act provides for the giving to a servant on request of a statement of particulars of a superannuation <Col N="1947" /> award which a local authority proposes to grant to him on retirement and extends the appeal provisions of section 66 to such statements.</P>
      <P>In accordance with subsection (6) of section 44 no appeal lies under section 66 against the non-return of superannuation contributions in the case of a servant discharged for misconduct. However, the working party set up in 1976 to review the local authority superannuation code recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, in an interim report published in 1977 that where a local authority servant was discharged for misconduct before the coming into operation of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, he should, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (6) of section 44 have a right of appeal against the non-return of his contributions. The recommendations of the working party are in operation with Government approval in anticipation of legislation.  The necessary legislative cover is being provided in the Local Government (Superannuation) (No. 2) Bill, 1979, now before the Seanad.</P>
