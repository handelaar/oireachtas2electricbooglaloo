      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient to make provision for the charging of such fees as may be specified in regulations made by the Minister for Health with the consent of the Minister for Finance under any Act of the present session to make provision for family planning services and, with a view to ensuring that contraceptives are available only for the purpose, <i>bona fide</i>, of family planning or for adequate medical reasons, to regulate and control the sale, importation, manufacture, advertisement and display of contraceptives and to provide for certain other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this motion and I wish to state my reasons for doing so.  We are opposed to money being spent through this Bill because we believe that the Bill in the form in which it is now emerging will not reflect the will of the Oireachtas and that it would be improper to spend money on it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that if you are opposing the Financial Resolution the discussion will have to be related to the matters which are affected by the Financial Resolution, namely, the payment of fees under section <Col N="155" /> 5 (2) and the importation of contraceptives and under section 6 (2), authorising the manufacture of contraceptives. Any debate on the Financial Resolution will have to be confined strictly to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this Financial Resolution because we think it is improper that money should be spent under a Bill which will not reflect the will of the Oireachtas because of the method of its introduction and its proposed passage through the House.  It is clear that this is a Bill which was introduced in one form by the Government under a Whips' vote, and having been brought through on that basis we will be debating it in Committee on a free vote basis.  At best this is constitutionally anomalous and it is certainly an improper procedure as far as the House is concerned.  We do not accept that money should be spent in these circumstances.  We are entitled to oppose the Financial Resolution and to state our reasons for so doing.  In our view, if there had been a free vote a different Bill would have come through this House and it would have represented the will of this House.  The Bill we now have does not reflect the will of this House. The effect of the procedure adopted by the Government has been, therefore, to vitiate any possibility of the will of this House being achieved.  It is improper that money should be spent on something that does not reflect the will of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I accept that I cannot proceed to elaborate these points further at this time.  I would wish to do so and feel that the rules of the House are inadequate in that they make no provision for what is admittedly an unprecedented event, changing the character of a Bill at this point.  I had hoped it would have been possible, because of the unprecedented nature of the situation, for me to develop the matter further.  I defer to the Chair's ruling, however, and reluctantly will give my reasons outside the House that I would have wished to give more fully in the House.  I do not wish to be out of order and, therefore, have no alternative but to develop the points I want to make in another place.  It is a pity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not to be able to explain the position in the Dáil as one ought to be able to do.  The unprecedented situation we have now is one to which further consideration. should be given.  Now that it has arisen, the Standing Orders should permit of a further consideration of the matter when the whole basis of a Bill is changed from one of active collective responsibility by the Government to one of a free vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for acceding to the ruling of the Chair but the Deputy will appreciate that Second Reading would have been the time to make these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but, as the Bill has changed its character since the Second Reading by virtue of the Government decision to abandon the original basis of it, bringing it in by a whip majority as a matter of collective responsibility and it is now a matter of a free vote, I could not raise it on Second Stage because no one, including the Taoiseach, knew it would be a free vote at that stage.  He was not aware of the nature and kind of pressure about to be exerted on him by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this resolution for the reason that so much is coming to the Dáil by way of resolution that we do not know exactly what is in the Minister's mind.  We oppose it because we do not know what the money is being spent on or for what purpose. The Minister will agree that in the last two years more and more has been coming by way of regulation that we do not know enough about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss this.  The Chair is not ruling out debate that may arise on the appropriate sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the point made by Deputy FitzGerald, leader of <Col N="157" /> the Fine Gael Party, this is the same Bill as was approved in principle by the House on Second Stage.  There is no change in the Bill.  As Deputies know, this is a very normal parliamentary procedure.  It is simply a technically to give effect to whatever financial provisions are involved in the legislation.  As regards the question raised by Deputy O'Connell about the regulations, we can discuss that in some detail as we come to the sections which give authority to make the regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is normal procedure would the Minister like to say when Fianna Fáil last had a free vote on a measure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald's main point was that this is not the Bill which the House passed on Second Stage.  It has not been changed one comma since the House approved it on Second Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 28, to delete &ldquo;contraceptives&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;voluntary tubal ligation or voluntary vasectomy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are setting out to do here with this Bill is to try to help the Minister to improve it.  I have been rather surprised and concerned by the attitude of the Government and the Opposition to the suggestion by Deputy Boland that a committee should be permitted to consider this Bill.  The Minister rejected this on the Second Stage on the plea that it would be impossible to arrive at an adequate consensus.  His attitude was that there were different opinions in committees and that there could not be a consensus. This is a Committee and this is the purpose of the Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister has not got a completely closed attitude to the cases we will be putting forward on the different amendments and that if we put forward a rational case he will have an open mind about it.  I accept the principle of this excellent part of our parliamentary procedure, the Committee Stage of a Bill.  I hope that if the Minister is convinced <Col N="161" /> by a point put forward he will accept it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Opposition, I have been surprised that they have not accepted this part of the procedure as being a committee in effect where they can put forward, if they want to, different points to the Minister.  If they make a satisfactory case which the Minister can accept then this in effect is a continuing committee.  The only way that can be done is by putting down various amendments.  Both sides of the House seem to have evaded the opportunity provided by this Committee Stage.  I have put down several amendments to the Bill to see if some changes can be made to improve it.</P>
    <P>I put down this amendment for a number of reasons, the obvious one being that a family planning service should provide a service which is safe, efficient and easy to perform and, in the words of the Supreme Court, easily acceptable. There must be multiple choice because one is dealing with various kinds of men and women who will come to the clinic for advice and help with regard to family planning or contraceptive techniques.  I put down the proposal of voluntary sterilisation because it is not in the Bill and it does not appear likely to become part of the Minister's proposals for a family planning scheme.</P>
    <P>There are two approaches to this idea of sterilisation.  On the female side there is the tubal ligation and on the man's side there is vasectomy.  Both of those are minor procedures which give complete safety as far as contraceptives are concerned.  The Minister might like to tell us why those proposals are absent from the Bill.  Those procedures are widely used elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The question of contraception is a very important one for women and its efficiency is a most important consideration they must have in their minds. Pregnancy for some women can be very dangerous.  In women over 35 it can cause maternal death and can lead to danger to the infant.  The infant mortality rate rises dramatically if there is a failure of the method used.  High blood pressure, blood clots and heart disease in some cases make it a matter of life and <Col N="162" /> death for the woman to have a method of contraception which is absolutely safe and efficient.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that under half of all fertile women try not to conceive. When they take a contraceptive they take it on the assumption they will not conceive.  The method, therefore, which the Minister should offer to them in his family planning clinics is the safest method.  Why is this simple, safe and efficient method not included in the Bill? In the USA in 1975 7,900,000 men and women used either sterilisation or vasectomy and there were 7,100,000 on the pill.  It is nearly universally used in the USA, in many west European countries and in the North of Ireland.  It is estimated that eventually over one-quarter of all couples with two or three children will be sterilised by the time the wife is 35 years old.  This is taken from an article by Dr. Margaret Bohan in <i>The Lancet.</i>  In the USA one-third of all couples are sterilised as a method of birth control, second only to the pill.  Ninety per cent who are sterilised are content with their infertility.</P>
    <P>I concede that this is a procedure which has to be entered into with some care, associated with responsible medical advice and counsel.  In Britain the health authority have not enough money to carry out this procedure on all the people who need or ask for it.  The Family Planning Association of Britain estimate that there will be 100,000 vasectomies in Britain in this coming year and that 40,000 women are likely to be sterilised.  Perhaps one should advert to the fact that this form of contraception is not considered acceptable by the Catholic hierarchy.  Is this the reason why this safe, widely used, efficient, simple procedure is not included in this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this amendment.  In this Bill our whole approach to the problem is framed along certain lines.  This approach involves the provision of a family planning service which includes only the advice, instruction, information and consultation.  The supply of contraceptives or any other form of operative procedure, is not relevant to the definition of a family planning <Col N="163" /> service for the purposes of this Bill. To accept this amendment would involve a complete change in the approach of the Bill to the problem.  Therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.  This legislation deals with one particular matter.

The question Deputy O'Connell asked is not relevant to the provision of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister imply that he considers there can be an efficient family planning service which cannot give advice to somebody who is looking for it and tell them what they require, even that it cannot be supplied?  It would be the oddest family planning service conceivable, as somebody said, a pub without any beer, which did not have any devices.  Is the Minister suggesting that the inclusion of this kind of service is being ruled out?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach of this Bill is fairly simple and straightforward. It provides on the one hand for family planning services which consist of information, advice, consultation and education and on the other hand, provides certain procedures for the supply of contraceptives. The Deputy may not agree with that approach but the whole Bill is constructed on that principle.  The &ldquo;family planning service&rdquo; for the purposes of the definition section is restricted to advice, consultation, education and information. Separate procedures for the supply of contraceptives are provided for in the Bill.  If the Deputy does not accept that approach he is entitled to reject it but I cannot depart from it without completely changing the whole structure of the Bill and my approach to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems rather strange that the Minister is providing a <Col N="164" /> Bill for family planning in Ireland but if a person wants to opt for a medical, acceptable, ethical form of family planning, such as tubal ligation or vasectomy, it is not provided for in the Bill.  This creates certain serious problems for the clinics which up to now have been providing such a service.  They may go out of business and hospitals may not be permitted to provide these services.  The Minister has not answered my question satisfactorily.  We are talking about a family planning service when we ought to be talking about established and acceptable methods of family planning, otherwise we can stop wasting the time of the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not seem to be aware of the fact that vasectomy and tubal ligation are medically acceptable and ethically normal procedures.  They are barrier methods of preventing conception. Their omission from the Bill leaves the big question that hospitals may be forbidden to provide these services, where people opt for them.  A person may want, or may be compelled, to seek contraceptive methods.  He or she may not be trusted to abide by the normal methods and he or she, may know of this particular form but may be prevented from availing of it because the Minister has made no provision for it in the Bill.  Are we deciding that this will be forbidden in our hospitals?  Can a patient go to a hospital and opt for this method?  That is the big question mark that hangs over the whole question of family planning.  If you talk about family planning you have to talk about measures which are medically and aesthetically acceptable and which are not in contravention of any normal standards. Can the Minister answer this, not saying that it is not relevant to the Bill? It poses serious problems now by virtue of the fact that the Minister does not see it as relevant to the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple answer is that I do not accept that all methods of family planning which some people regard as perfectly valid are covered in this Bill.  I instance as a clear illustration of my approach&mdash;I do not accept all forms of family planning or what in <Col N="165" /> some people's minds are regarded as legitimate family planning&mdash;the fact that this Bill sets its face firmly against abortion and abortifacients.  Some people regard abortion and abortifacients as methods available to them of family planning, but this Bill clearly and categorically sets its face against abortion and abortifacients.  Therefore, Deputies can surely deduce from that the fact that this Bill authorises and purports to authorise only family planning methods which are within the compass of the Bill as put forward by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister raises a very serious problem.  He has tried to equate simple vasectomy or tubal ligation with abortion or abortifacients.  This is a simple operative procedure that prevents conception in the same way as do the simple mechanical devices which the Minister is providing under this Bill.  This is another mechanical device.  It is a normal surgical procedure that has not been considered ethically wrong.  According to tenets of the different Churches it is not wrong.  It is not anything to destroy life.  It is important for us to realise this.  To try to say, in however subtle a form, that vasectomy or tubal ligation could be equated with abortion or abortifacients is a misrepresentation of facts.  You can no more equate them with the menopause, gall bladder disease or any other aspect of life.  It is too ludicrous for words.  This is a simple operative procedure which prevents conception.  The Minister must be aware of its existence.  It is practised world wide.  If a person opts for it there is no provision for it.  It is not a case of saying &ldquo;all forms&rdquo;.  We must condemn abortifacients.  There is no question of abortifacients here.  There are no drugs employed here to produce abortion, no methods, devices or instruments used to produce abortion.  This is a simple method of preventing conception in the same way as the condoms which are being provided under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister failed to answer this and Deputy Browne very rightly points to this omission.  The onus is on the Minister to tell us whether, if it is <Col N="166" /> precluded under this Bill, it is precluded from being applied in hospitals in our country as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very mixed feelings about this amendment.  I am not sure why Deputy Browne decided in tabling the amendment to delete paragraph (c) of the definition.  It would better have achieved its objective if this phrase were to be added as an expansion of the rather inadequate definition of family planning service.  What is really wrong here is that the Minister, as was pointed out on Second Stage, has not defined what family planning service is. If there had been a better attempt at a definition of family planning service possibly this amendment and other discussions on the section would be unnecessary. For the Minister to define family planning service as being a service for information, and so forth, on family planning does seem to be rather opening up the debate.  Either voluntary tubal ligation or voluntary vasectomy could well be interpreted as being included in &ldquo;information, instruction, advice and consultation in relation to family planning&rdquo; if there had been a definition of family planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole difficulty here is that the definition section to a large extent comprises a non-definition section.  Even on the inadequate way in which the definition section is set out, I would have thought that information, instruction or advice in relation to vasectomy or tubal ligation might have been interpreted as being already provided for.  As a result of discussion on this amendment I would not like the impression to go abroad, or for it to be interpreted if this unhappy Bill is to be passed, that advice, information, instruction or whatever in relation to vasectomy could not be given because it was not included specifically in the Bill.  I would be anxious that the Minister, in whatever line he takes in contributing further on this amendment, would make it clear as to whether it could be possible for information, advice or instruction in relation to these matters to be given under the Bill as it stands or whether, because these matters have not been provided for specifically in the definition section, they cannot be <Col N="167" /> provided for in effect if the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can do is make clear what I intend.  Whether Deputies agree with that is their own business. Neither tubal ligation nor vasectomy is included in family planning services as provided for in this Bill.  Let us be clear that they are not provided for in family planning services which I envisage as being provided for in this Bill.  Whether they are morally, medically or ethically acceptable is a different question which is not relevant to this legislation at all.  If Deputies want to raise it at another time in another way they are perfectly free to do so.  I am providing in this legislation for certain aspects and types of family planning which do not include these two operations.  I am not necessarily comparing them with abortion or abortifacients any more than this Bill includes family planning, abortion or abortifacients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>A very important principle involved here is the responsibility of the Minister in a society such as ours. The Minister evades Deputy O'Connell's questions.  The Minister is the Minister for Health and he is purporting to give to women and men&mdash;mainly women&mdash;a family planning service which will include all methods of acceptable family planning.  That must be assumed from the Minister's own letter to the Irish Medical Association in which he made the point that when he asked them to take part in the scheme his case was that he would try to provide a comprehensive family planning service with advice on all acceptable forms of family planning. As Minister for Health he is backed by a talented hinterland of advice and expert knowledge on these things in his Department. All of us who live on this side of his civil service and Department, the consumers of his service, medical officers, doctors in practice in hospitals and clinics all over the country, must look to the Minister for an authoritative decision on this very important issue. The issue is a safe and easy form of family planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have put forward this suggestion of sterilisation and it has not been controverted by the Minister.  I hope he will <Col N="168" /> not repeat that rather ugly attempt to twist what we are saying into the very emotive issue of abortion or non-abortion. It does not arise at all under this Bill and should not be introduced; it is quite a separate issue which I am prepared to debate at any time with the Minister.  I hope the Minister will not refer to it again because none of us is advocating this in any section or amendment put down.  Therefore, in omitting sterilisation the Minister is providing a substandard service.  He is perfectly within his rights to do this but it is our job to make it clear to the consumer&mdash;to men and women who avail of his family planning services&mdash;that it is a second-class service, that it is a substandard family planning service, that it does not include the most efficient, safest and simplest procedure of all probably because even the pill has its dangers.  The Minister is vague about it.  Perhaps he would take his courage in his hands and tell us&mdash;he mentioned the word &ldquo;ethical&rdquo;&mdash;has he ethical objections to the idea of sterilisation, a personal objection to the idea of sterilisation?  My idea of a Minister for Health is that he has no right to use his personal prejudices.  I may say I was faced with this problem myself in another way in that Department. I do not think we have a right to allow our personal prejudices to interfere with providing the service which we are privileged to provide as members of Governments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Minister used the word &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; in reply to my statement as if it was a consideration. Archbishop Ryan recently sent a letter around objecting to this idea of sterilisation as well as other procedures which he considered contrary to Catholic social or moral teaching.  I want to make it clear that I have no objection to that <Col N="169" /> Archbishop, any other Archbishop, or Rabbi, or any member of any Church, making it quite clear what the members of his Church may or may not do, or should or should not do; that is their job. We all know that family planning has been a very controversial issue for many years now.  In this situation I believe it is incumbent on the Minister to provide the most efficient service for all the members of our society irrespective of their religion, irrespective of the ethical or moral views of any particular religion in that society.  This is the basic principle on which possibly the Minister and I differ&mdash;that the citizen must have the right to make his or her own choice.  In my view the Minister, in providing family planning services, has no right to make a decision which limits choice whether it is a choice with which, for instance, I do not agree, natural family planning, because I think it is inefficient, but I think it should be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally it seems to me the Minister has the responsibility to make this form of contraception available to citizens who want it.  Remember there is a plurality of religions in our society. There are Churches which agree with this and other kinds of procedures with which we will be dealing later, the question of sterilisation.  These people have a right to this service.  Therefore the principle involved is whether the Minister is going to make laws which presuppose the existence of a pluralist society in the Twenty-six Counties, in the Thirty-two Counties, or whether he is going to restrict it for &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; reasons&mdash;a nice word, a euphemism&mdash;because of the attitude of the majority Church being against the provision of sterilisation.  In defence of the majority Church, the Catholic Church, the Hierarchy&mdash;and this is an unusual role for me&mdash;I should like to point out that while they have made their point clear on these various forms of contraception&mdash;and indeed to contraception in any form except what they call the natural form, they are opposed&mdash;they add this very important, in our history, changed proviso that the Minister and the Government are perfectly within their rights to bring in any legislation they wish, that this Bill, its morality, its ethical right or wrong, is <Col N="170" /> judged by each citizen according to his or her own ethical or moral standards, or religious beliefs and he or she is free to take an independent decision.  Of course, this is where this recent case, the Gibbons case, is so absurd and unreal because none of the provisions of this law, whatever they are, can be binding on anybody who is morally opposed to them.  What the Minister is providing is a service which people who want it and who feel that they can in conscience accept, will seek.  That is all.  Nothing is going to be imposed on anybody. Therefore it is completely fraudulent to claim that it is being opposed on moral grounds.</P>
    <P>The Minister must consider that principle. We must establish here, and not only from the point of view of mothers &mdash;I will give maternity mortality rates later&mdash;an efficient service.  The 1973 maternity mortality rate was eight per 100,000 in the younger age group; in the 35 to 40 age group it was 30 per 100,000 and, in the 40 to 45 age group 120 per 100,000, an appalling increase of 35 plus.  Therefore, the efficiency of the service must be, and should be paramount.  It astonishes me that a Minister for Health would dismiss this in a superficial way without any attempt to make an argument against it except with one word, &ldquo;ethical&rdquo;.  It astonishes me that he should dismiss a universally used practice while purporting to give to the consumer in our society who needs contraceptives this safe service.</P>
    <P>The Minister is hiding behind the Catholic Hierarchy.  He is free; they have liberated him and do not take the same attitude that they took in the past. They now say that the Government are free to bring in any legislation they want and, in those circumstances, I fail to see why the Minister will not introduce this important service.  There is also the consideration of the rights of the minorities. They are being denied this service.  Why are our religious minorities denied such a service which is available in all hospitals in Northern Ireland, to Catholics and Protestants?  Why can we not adopt that practice?  The Minister would have been very angry if a Northern Minister had told the people that they must have a certain scheme because it coincided with <Col N="171" /> his religious beliefs.  I am sure the Minister is concerned that on this issue we should be seen to legislate for the existence of a plurality of religions in our society.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court made it clear that Mrs. McGee had a right to contraceptives because pregnancy could endanger the security and happiness of her marriage, could imperil her health, hazard her life and subject her family to distress and disruption.  All those features are operative and the Minister is avoiding providing a service which would ensure the protection of a woman's health and happiness and the health and happiness of her children.  He has not given any grounds or valid reasons for his refusal to consider seriously the introduction of such a service.  He is denying this service to people who medically see no objection to it.  The Minister said the Bill was guided by certain principles and I suppose that is what he meant when he described it as an Irish solution to an Irish problem; a Roman Catholic solution to an Irish problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to press my amendment as far as I can because the decision by the Minister to refuse to introduce a family planning method which is the safest, most efficient and probably most commonly used in advanced countries is inexplicable in rational terms.  The only conclusion I can arrive at is that the Minister is afraid to introduce it because he could not carry it with his party on strictly sectarian religious grounds.  It supports the contention I have had all my life that Irish Republicanism is a very sectarian dogma and has nothing whatever to do with the pluralism, the secularism of Wolfe Tone's Republicanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a much simpler explanation than that.  I must go <Col N="172" /> back to the first principles on which this legislation is based.  As the Deputy pointed out, the decision of the Supreme Court in the McGee case was a point of departure in our society.  The Supreme Court on that occasion struck down as unconstitutional a provision which totally prevented the availability of artificial contraceptives here.  That judgement derived from the family provisions of the Constitution and it is important to remember that.  The Supreme Court found the <i>raison d'être</i> of their decision in the provisions of the Constitution which protect and cherish the family but that decision, as a side effect, created a situation where artificial contraceptives would be absolutely freely available here.  That invited the Legislature to do something about the situation, to legislate afresh now that the old provision had been struck down and rendered unconstitutional.  The Legislature had a duty to provide for this new situation.</P>
      <P>I gave this problem long and anxious consideration to try to decide what form the legislation should take.  As a result of widespread and patient discussions and long consideration I came forward with this solution which is fairly straightforward. Whether one agrees with it or not the approach should be understood by everybody.  The legislation purports to deal with the way artificial contraceptives should be available in our community. The Supreme Court has stated that they must be available and that the Legislature must decide under what terms and conditions they should be available.  That is what the Bill is about. In coming to the matter of controlling and limiting the availability of articial contraceptives I decided that the right thing to do was to relate their availability to family planning.  If one accepts that principle the rest of the Bill follows logically.  If one does not accept it that is one's own business and any Deputy is perfectly entitled to reject it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faced with this situation and having regard to the many conflicting opinions on the subject, I thought that the solution that would be most generally acceptable to sensible people and what would be also the best solution from the point of view of our health and maternity services was to relate the availability of artifical <Col N="173" /> contraceptives to genuine family planning purposes.  This Bill is based entirely on that simple principle.  Therefore, what I am purporting to do in this legislation is to deal with the question of the availability of artificial contraceptives for genuine family planning purposes. I am not concerned with any other matter but there are a variety of other matters that could be dealt with in this Bill in addition to that being put forward by Deputy Browne.  The Bill does not deal with the many different types of gynaecological or obstetrical operations which are all relevant to the maternity services and to the wonderful event of birth.  There are all sorts of aspects of gynaecology and obstetrics which could be dealt with in a piece of health legislation but I submit that such matters are not relevant to the issue with which the Bill deals.  Its objective is the regulation, control and limiting of supplies of artificial contraceptives to family planning purposes.  It follows from that that the provisions of the Bill should deal with the type of family planning services that are envisaged and these consist entirely of information, advice, consultation and education, not with the matter of the supplying of any device nor of the performing of any operation.  The family planning services envisaged are defined in the Bill in terms that are totally informational.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the question of whether voluntary tubal ligation or voluntary vasectomy are suitable or legitimate forms of family planning is not relevant to this legislation.  It does not come within the compass of my approach to the problem.  I refute the suggestion by Deputy Browne that I endeavoured to confuse the argument by referring to abortifacients in the context of these two types of operations.  I am not guilty of that and I am not competent to know whether there is any relationship between the two or whether any theologian would relate one to the other. Neither am I concerned with that matter but I did not attempt to confuse the issue as suggested by Deputy Browne.  I merely mentioned abortifacients to illustrate <Col N="174" /> that in this legislation I am not necessarily purporting to deal with all forms of family planning.  I am dealing only with those forms of family planning referred to in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne is entitled legitimately to say that the family planning services envisaged in this Bill are inadequate.  If he says that, I must accept his opinion but my purpose in this legislation is limited.  For the first time in this country I am endeavouring to legislate for this unhappy, controversial, long-drawn out and interminable situation.  I am trying to bring finally, some form of acceptable legislation into being to deal with that situation.  I should hope that Deputies would accept that I have gone to much trouble to ascertain as broad as possible a spectrum of views, to find out what the majority of people would accept and what would be in keeping with their view of what is reasonable.  I am prepared on Committee Stage to continue that process.  This problem has been before me for some time but I would not have any objection to spending several more weeks on it on Committee Stage, in teasing the matter out further, but I am endeavouring to explain as coherently as possible what is my approach and the reasons for it.  Deputies are perfectly entitled to say that they do not agree with my approach or that they reject the reasons for it but the principles I have outlined are the ones on which the Bill is based.  I cannot accept Deputy Browne's amendment because it is not relevant to the purposes of the Bill.  Nobody is being denied access to these types of operations as a result of this Bill.  They are not referred to in the Bill which is concerned mainly with setting out the manner in which artificial contraceptives will be available in future to the general public. There is a situation that must be dealt with.  I am satisfied that the overwhelming majority of our people do not wish to have a situation of total uncontrolled availability of contraceptives.  That is my assessment from my soundings, from my discussions and consultations, from <Col N="175" /> the advice I have had and from my own assessment of the situation.  I know also that there are some people&mdash;and this view has been expressed by Deputy Kelly&mdash;who believe that there should be completely uncontrolled availability of artificial contraceptives but I am convinced that there is a considerable majority of people in favour of making artificial contraceptives available to married persons.  That is solely what we are legislating for in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I have not said that.  What I intended to say was that Deputy Browne is entitled to criticise the Bill on the basis that the family planning services envisaged are inadequate.  But I do not accept that view.  I consider the family planning services envisaged in the Bill to be adequate for our circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The record will probably show that the Minister said that I have a case for saying that the Bill is inadequate. However, we need not quarrel about that.  Clearly with the absence from the family planning service of something which is universally used, and most efficient and safe, a simple operation, it must be considered to be an inadequate service and, therefore, as I claimed earlier, a second-class service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the McGee case and suggested that the McGee Supreme Court decision was taken in the context of the family and the Constitution. It is worth remembering that the family is not defined in the Constitution. What exactly the family is, is something we could talk about.  What is even more important is that Justice Fitzgerald went on in his dissenting decision to point out that whatever advantages <Col N="176" /> Mrs. McGee won, whatever rights she won in the court action, were rights to be made available to every citizen under the Constitution.  We will be dealing with this later on, but it cannot be restricted to families.  Every citizen has these rights which I mentioned here earlier: her right to the protection of her health, her happiness, her life and the happiness and welfare of her family. Every citizen has that right under the Constitution as a result of the McGee decision.  It is not simply the family.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has conceded that this family planning scheme will have grave limitations, major limitations, and therefore will be a substandard service. In a letter to the Irish Medical Association the Minister concluded by repeating his conviction that a wide-ranging and flexible family planning service which should form part of the health service should be under the control and guidance of the medical profession.  He said the service should be wide-ranging and flexible.  Now we find it is very limited and constricted.  The Minister repeated what he said earlier on Second Stage, that the overwhelming majority of the people do not want a wide, extensive family planning service.</P>
    <P>I have to ask him again why he makes this statement, because it could only apply to the Twenty-six Counties.  Does he wish it to apply to the Twenty-six Counties? Is he ignoring the fact that there are one million Protestants in the North of Ireland who would not agree with that at all and who, in fact, enjoy a very wide-ranging family planning service including sterilisation, as proposed by me here, and all the other things, condoms, spermicides, IUD, diaphragms, and so on.  Are we to restrict ourselves in considering laws of this kind where freedom of conscience is so vitally concerned?  Is it not a very dangerous doctrine for the Minister to incorporate into our laws that the attitudes of a majority, that is, a Catholic majority in Twenty-six Counties, must determine the kind of laws we would have presumably in Thirty-two Counties where there is a significant Protestant minority rather than the tiny one we are choosing to ignore in this legislation?</P>

      <P>I have put down a number of amendments and I have made it clear why I have done that.  The parliamentary process imposes on us a responsibility to attempt to make our case for changing legislation brought in by the Government. That is what the whole committee procedure is about.  Obviously I will not press some of the amendments, but this amendment&mdash;and I will press it first because it is extremely important&mdash;it is an enormous gap, or loss, or defect in the family planning service&mdash;and secondly because of what I believe to be its implications in the flexion of the Minister's attitude to the whole idea of pluralism in our very unhappy society.</P>

      <P>I want to make another point.  Eventually the Minister admitted today what this Bill really is, an attempt to amend the law, an attempt to mend the hand of the Oireachtas in relation to the law on contraception arising from the McGee Supreme Court judgment. That is absolutely at variance with every statement he and his colleagues in Government made prior to the introduction of this Bill when they insisted that this Bill would be a comprehensive family planning Bill.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind the Minister and the House that some weeks before this Bill was published, when I asked him on the Order of Business when the Bill to amend the law on contraception would be published, the Tánaiste was at pains to point out that the Government had no proposal to introduce such a measure, but that they would be introducing a comprehensive family planning Bill.  On this amendment the Minister admitted today that the Bill is not that at all.  According to the Minister's phrase, the Bill attempts to do no more and no less than to allow to married couples the right to contraceptives as a result of the McGee Supreme Court judgment.  As the debate goes on, it will be made quite clear that the Bill does a fair bit more and a fair bit less than that.  The way in which the Minister presented his concept of the Bill and the effect of the Bill is unfair and misleading. It has been unhelpful to the debate and does not augur well for the rest of the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I made several points on Second Stage which are worth repeating. The definition of &ldquo;family planning service&rdquo; is virtually non-definite and to get any real idea of what is meant by the definition purported to be given in the definition section one must read on further in an effort to get a definition of the definition section.  It could only be felt that whoever introduced this definition section was either extraordinarily devious or extraordinarily inept, and I conceded on Second Stage that the Minister was not extraordinarily inept.  I do not believe anyone could have felt that this was a genuine section giving definitions helpful in the rest of the Bill. One has to read the Bill in an effort to find out what the definition section is trying to say.</P>
      <P>In speaking on Deputy Browne's amendment the Minister suggested that this Bill was doing no more and no less than making contraceptives available to married couples as a result of the Supreme Court decision.  In many ways it is doing more and in many ways it is doing less than that.  It is quite clear in section 5 (1) that the Bill is in some respects dealing with individuals rather than married couples.  Section 5 (1) states:</P>
      <P>A person shall not import contraceptives into the State unless&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am pointing out that there is no definition of &ldquo;family planning services&rdquo; and that the Minister stated earlier, when dealing with an amendment, that the Bill seeks to do no more and no less than make contraceptives available to married people.  I am making an effort to find out what a &ldquo;family planning service&rdquo; is because the Minister has chosen not to define it in the definition section.  I am drawing the attention of the House to section 5 (1) (a) which refers specifically to persons rather than married persons in regard to the importation of contraceptives as part of personal luggage.  There is no mention whatsoever of married persons in section 5 (1) (a), although the Minister claimed a few moments ago that the Bill relates solely to married people.  When we get to section 5 (1) (a) we will have some discussion as to how it is decided what <Col N="182" /> quantity of contraceptives are solely for a person's own use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand how a &ldquo;family planning service&rdquo; could be defined as meaning a service to provide information on family planning.  Surely there should be a definition of &ldquo;family planning&rdquo;, what it is about, what it is related to and what it is intended that the health board family planning service and other family planning services could advise about.  There is no definition of &ldquo;family planning service&rdquo; except that it means (a)  family planning, (b)  contraception, (c)  contraceptives.  Surely this is an inadequate part of the definition section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More importantly, I and my party are particularly concerned that there has not been an attempt made in the definition section to give a definition of &ldquo;abortifacient&rdquo;. To explain what I mean by this it would be necessary for me to go further into the Bill and refer to section 10, which explains that nothing in the Bill shall be construed as authorising the procuring of abortion and the sale, importation into the State, manufacture, advertising and display of abortifacients. But there is no definition of &ldquo;abortifacient&rdquo; in the definition section.  All those who will be involved in the attempt to operate this measure if it becomes law&mdash;doctors, health board personnel, chemists, wholesale chemists, importers and the individual&mdash;will find themselves in a position where they may be deemed to be acting outside the law because of <Col N="183" /> their use or importation or recommendation of something which would afterwards be deemed as abortifacient in effect.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I said I did not propose to embarrass the Minister or the House by quoting the speech made in 1974 by Deputy O'Malley, in which he went at great lengths into what might or might not be abortifacient and in which he endeavoured through ridicule to suggest that the Bill then before the House was inadequate because of its poor definition of &ldquo;abortifacient&rdquo;.  I accept that the definition in the 1974 Bill was not complete by any means, but at least an attempt was made in the definition section to define &ldquo;abortifacient&rdquo;.  It stated that &ldquo;abortifacient&rdquo; means any appliance, instrument, drug, preparation or thing designed, prepared or intended to terminate pregnancy which has resulted from sexual intercourse between human beings.</P>
    <P>That having been stated in the definition section, section 7 of the Control of Importation, Sale and Manufacture of Contraceptives Bill, 1974, allowed the Minister to appoint a committee to advise him on whether or not a particular appliance, instrument, drug, preparation or thing&mdash;the same wording as used in the definition section&mdash;is an abortifacient, whether or not it is also a contraceptive. The committee would have consisted of not more than five persons and would have included people with medical qualifications.  The most important part of that section was subsection (3), which stated that a licence would not be granted in respect of a contraceptive which was in the opinion of the committee also an abortifacient.</P>
    <P>Clearly anyone who would have been involved in the operation of the 1974 Bill, had it become law, would have known exactly where he stood in relation to various contraceptive devices about which there was controversy as to whether they were abortifacient in their effect, notably the IUD.  In 1974 there were low oestrogen pills which Deputy O'Malley claimed were abortifacient. Everybody involved in the operation of the Bill would have known whether or not in the eyes of the law such items <Col N="184" /> were abortifacient.  There would be the decision of this expert committee, composed in part of medical representatives, who would advise the Minister and whose advice was to be taken and put into law.  Doctors, chemists, importers and individuals would all have known whether they were acting within or without the law.</P>
    <P>For some extraordinary reason there has been no attempt whatsoever to define &ldquo;abortifacient&rdquo; in section 1 or anywhere else in the Bill to provide that the Minister would make clear what is an abortifacient to the general public and the specialised professions involved in the operation of the Bill.  The failure to define &ldquo;family planning&rdquo; and the entire omission of a definition of &ldquo;abortifacient&rdquo; make the definition section most unusual and entirely unacceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I offer a few comments about the definition section may I refer very briefly, with the indulgence of the Chair, to something which the Minister said half an hour ago or so?  I believe the Minister is right in thinking that there is not a majority of opinion in the country&mdash;perhaps not even 50 per cent&mdash;that would share the point of view that I expressed on the last occasion when this matter was debated.  I accept that, but I think what we are trying to do here by going through the motions of debating this Bill on Committee Stage would not have been necessary if the Minister had taken the line which Deputy Boland suggested of trying to achieve consensus by means of an all-party committee.  I do not mean 100 per cent consensus; the Minister will never get that.  The Minister will never get Deputy Flanagan and myself or Deputy Clinton and Deputy Dr. Browne to agree on the core of this topic.  One could not get that in any parliament that did not consist of robots.  But he would get consensus of a majority just as there would have been in 1974 had the Fianna Fáil Party, out of a mean and cheap desire merely to embarrass the Government, not laid on a Whip against the Bill which Deputy Cooney had introduced at that time.  Had there then been a free vote, as the Minister knows, possibly&mdash;as he was good enough to imply <Col N="185" /> on the last occasion&mdash;some of the Deputies on my side might have felt freer not to support the Government if they had misgivings about the matter, as I suppose some of them had.  Conversely, many people in the Minister's party who, not to put too fine a point on it, do not give a damn about this subject, would have found it possible without doing violence to their consciences to support the sort of Bill the then Minister for Justice was promoting.</P>
      <P>I do not claim and never did claim that my point of view is a majority one but, merely to single out, on the one hand, my point of view and, on the other hand, Deputy Flanagan's point of view, and say that no agreement is possible in conditions like that is missing the point Deputy Boland made, namely, that if you took this matter out of the political arena&mdash;I do not believe in taking things out of the political arena if you can make progress with them in the arena but this is a case where that does not seem possible&mdash;and confided it to an all-party committee, we would have got a genuine majority consensus and possibly that consensus would have been about a Bill not too far removed from the one the Minister now has before the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At least there would not have been the silly scrapping, sneering and jeering which have accompanied all the efforts to change the law on the legislative side and which will continue to dog us until we are let off the hook, as I believe we will be sooner or later by the Supreme Court giving a decision that goes even further than in the McGee case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the definition section I could not improve on what Deputy Boland has said in regard to the absence of a definition of family planning as such.  I want to draw the attention of the <Col N="186" /> Minister and the House to a few more features in regard to the definitions in this part of the section.  The word &ldquo;family&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill.  I shall not niggle about that because most people know for most purposes what a family is.  It is not that clear in every context. There is a sort of extended meaning in some legal contexts, for example, in the Rent Restrictions Act, in which it has been held to encompass an adult sister and brother as being part of the same family even though not a family in the nuclear sense to which this Bill is obviously intended to relate.  The word is not defined in the Bill nor in the Constitution but I accept, without making the matter ridiculous, that it must mean something like the ordinary nuclear family, parents and children.  The couple of decisions that there have been in regard to the mention of the word &ldquo;family&rdquo; in the Constitution have pointed out that there is no definition and have said that for the purpose of the cases before the court they assume it means parents and children.  Very well &mdash;family means parents and children.</P>
    <P>What then does family planning mean?  It is too late to plan the parents; they are not the objects of planning. Presumably, it is also too late to plan children already in existence.  So, by a tortuous and I should have thought unnecessary process with a Government that was not afraid to say what it meant, we are driven to conclude that family planning means planning for the arrival or non-arrival of future children in a family. I suppose that is what family planning is all about.  I cannot see why the Minister's Department should not have said so in so many words or much fewer words.  I now want to know what is the difference between family planning and contraception which are listed here as separate items.  Notice that while &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo; is defined in terms taken, I think, from the Criminal Law Amendment Act, the word &ldquo;contraception&rdquo; is not defined.  There is no rule of law which obliges us&mdash;although I admit it is likely enough&mdash;to interpret one expression from another one of a similar root.  It could be said that contraception, undefined, is any activity which tends to <Col N="187" /> divert natural co-habitation from its normal consequences or, if you like, from the risk of its normal consequences. Looked at on that level contraception and family planning do not seem to be any different because family planning, if it means anything at all, is simply a pretty euphemism, one which can be used at the family table, for contraception.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to pretend that I do not know that contraception has in ordinary usage a more specialised meaning. I cannot see why that meaning should not be spelled out here.  In case it may be thought that I am trying to confuse these two concepts unnecessarily, in case it should be said that I am only making the kind of point which was made here in rich abundance in 1974 during the last Family Planning Bill by members of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Haughey among them, if I am not mistaken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Did the Minister not speak on it?  I am sorry.  Certainly Deputy O'Malley who, I think, was then spokesman on Justice and several other Fianna Fáil Deputies joyfully picked holes in the text of the Bill of the then Minister for Justice.  If we are supposed to assume, although the matter is quite unnecessarily left undefined, that it means family planning by abstention, abstention inspired, if you like, by some method based on computation of the wife's cycle or anything of that kind, then it does not appear all that clear because I see that in section 3 (2) we have the following series of words: &ldquo;family planning that does not involve the use of contraceptives&rdquo;.  Those words clearly imply that for the draftsman&mdash; for whom the Minister must take responsibility&mdash;there is such a thing as family planning which does include the use of contraceptives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That form of hoping that these concepts will get by undefined, unseparated with no clear direction being given as to what they mean or are supposed to mean for legal purposes is all of a piece. I do not suspect that there is any special purpose in leaving these things undefined <Col N="188" /> and unseparated: to me they are all of a piece and signal in one direction only, that there is not the remotest intention ever to enforce this Bill if and when it becomes law.  No trouble is being taken about these definitions because nobody ever expects to have to argue about them before a court&mdash;and that is what definitions are all about.  Nobody on the Government side ever expects to have to instruct counsel to place an argument before a court in regard to the meaning of any of these elements.</P>
    <P>If I am contradicted on that and told by the Minister that I am not doing this Bill full justice, that his Irish solution for an Irish problem is meant to be taken more seriously, I am tempted to reply that the peculiarly Irish nature of the solution lies in the fact that many people on the Minister's side will be content with the appearance of the law even though there is no reality.  That is Irish enough and appeals to a certain stratum of Irish mentality abundantly represented in the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;go through the motions and whether the reality follows in the wake of the motions we need not care; so long as we have a badge in our buttonholes and can speak a few perfunctory words, we shall be taken to have our hearts in the right place whatever the context refers to.  I believe that is what is meant here.  There is a certain sense in the Minister talking about an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  The Irish solution is to appear to solve the problem.  The reality is that it will remain exactly the same in a year's time as it has been for the last couple of years.</P>
    <P>If I am told that I am not sufficiently serious about this, or that I have missed something in trying to distinguish between family planning and contraception, or that an ample definition of either of these phrases is not necessary, I would ask the further question, if I am told that there will be occasions when counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions will actually be trying to enforce this law against people who will be purveying contraceptive devices, or whatever it is, otherwise than in accordance with the licensing arrangements which the Minister foresees: would the Minister explain what is <i>bona fide</i> family <Col N="189" /> planning?  If family planning means inhibiting, by one means or another, the natural risk of the natural consequences of co-habiting, what is <i>bona fide</i> family planning?</P>
    <P>There are a few parts of the law from which parallels can be drawn and I am not trying to make the thing any more ridiculous than it patently is.  I think the Minister was Minister for Justice when the licensing law was changed in 1960 or thereabouts.  Up to that time there had been a traffic in <i>bona fides</i>&mdash;that was a cynical term&mdash;but it was an Irish solution to an Irish problem in a big way. There was an appearance of there being a law in regard to <i>bona fide</i> travellers. The reality was exactly the opposite and so well recognised was the opposite quality to the reality that the <i>bona fide</i> name was actually cynically, but colloquially and without thinking, bestowed on the very establishments which had the benefit of this Irish solution.</P>
    <P>The <i>bona fides</i> that I remember from my student days were Matt Smith's and the rest.  These were establishments which were allowed to sell drink until midnight, whereas the public houses in the city had to close at 10 p.m., or 10.30 p.m., on the assumption that the people who were bursting out through the doors in their hundreds were <i>bona fide</i> travellers on their way to Kilternan, the Golden Ball, Enniskerry and points south who had just stopped off to slake their thirsts at Stepaside on the way out. Except for the dimension of drunk driving and dangerous driving that went with it, as people chased out from the Golden Mile of the inner city to the foothills of the Dublin mountains, which was a very serious and bad element, it was harmless enough.  The point here was that these were supposed to be <i>bona fide</i> travellers, people on their way somewhere else who stopped off to slake their thirst in Matt Smith's or the Dead Man's or the Widow Langan's, or wherever it might be.  Idiotic and disreputable though the law was&mdash;willing though I am to give the Minister credit for changing it&mdash;at least on the face of it, it was easy to see what was meant by <i>bona fide</i> travellers. What was meant was people on their way from somewhere else.  What is a <i>bona fide</i> family planner?  I take it that <Col N="190" /> what is meant there must be a reference to the mental disposition of the parents or prospective parents who resort to a clinic or medical advice in this connection. They could not be anything else. Natural family planning, by the way, is another expression not defined&mdash;we are not told what natural family planning is. I have a rough idea in my own mind what it is supposed to be; nobody will have to argue it in court, but, just for the record, it is not defined in this section.</P>
    <P>If there is such a thing as <i>bona fide</i> family planning since the <i>externalia</i>&mdash;if I may use another Latin word to join <i>bona fide</i>&mdash;since the externals of the family planning operation are indistinguishable, one from the other, whatever the purpose, it is only, therefore, the internal operations which can tell you whether the thing is <i>bona fide</i> or not.  I want to know is the Minister serious&mdash;and I know he is not serious&mdash;but is he willing to pretend he is serious in expecting a doctor to decide for himself whether people applying to him for the benefit of these services are applying to him <i>bona fide</i> for family planning purposes?  As I say, if I thought the Bill was meant seriously I would be more excited about it but I know we are only going through a certain number of motions.  Surely if it were to be taken seriously it would impose a hopeless burden on a doctor to expect him to say to a patient&mdash;I do not care whether the patient is a young wife just married or a mother of 16 children; I do not care what stage she is at in her maternal or potential maternal existence&mdash;&ldquo;Well now, Mrs. O'Halloran&rdquo;, or whatever her name is, &ldquo;I have listened to your tale and, honestly, I do not think the family planning service you want from me is one you want <i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; and if she says to him &ldquo;What do you mean by that, Doctor?&rdquo;  can one see the doctor saying, &ldquo;I think you are being selfish&rdquo;.  Are you really going to ask a doctor to say to people who come along for these services that they are being selfish, that they do not want these services, which have only one possible physiological effect, for <i>bona fide</i> reasons?  What are the <i>bona fide</i> reasons that would entitle a doctor to exercise a discretion here?  The subsection in section (4) clearly is intended <Col N="191" /> to confer some kind of discretion on a doctor.  What is that discretion? How is he to exercise it?  Can I have from the Minister an example of the kind of argument he would expect to find a doctor using if he were refusing to give a person these services on the grounds that their applications were not <i>bona fide</i>?  Perhaps I missed something vital on this aspect and the Minister will have a chance of pointing it out.  That is one aspect that I would be interested in if I thought the Bill was seriously intended to be passed into a serious law.</P>
    <P>Now, in case the Minister thinks I am trying to make a hare of him or of the Bill, this is a small drafting point and I may be wrong about it, but if he is serious about the Bill he might ask his advisers to look at it.  This refers to the word &ldquo;sell&rdquo; in the last part of the definition section.  I think the word &ldquo;sell&rdquo;, in the context of the sale of goods, refers only to a transaction for money.  I may not be right in that, as it only occurred to me since sitting down; had I thought about it earlier I should have looked it up.  If I am right in thinking that the law on the sale of goods restricts the meaning of &ldquo;sale&rdquo; to transactions in return for money, it would appear that the Minister has left out of the Bill transactions for reward or for a consideration, but in which the consideration is something other than money.  In other words, unless I am wrong in what I am saying about the Sale of Goods Law, it would leave completely uncovered by the Bill transactions of barter.  By barter I am thinking of some commodity which is not money but which can easily be converted into money's worth, for example, postal orders or stamps and <i>a fortiori</i> any other kind of property which people recognise as having a value.  If it is true that sale, in the legal sense, means exchanging goods for money and only that, then exchanging the goods which are in the Minister's mind in regard to this Bill for anything except money appears not to be covered by the Bill.  I am not concerned to help the Minister out in trying to make the Bill workable.  I would only be compounding the fraud&mdash;that is too strong a word&mdash;compounding <Col N="192" /> the farce which he is playing out in this House and to the nation.  If he wants to bring some degree of verisimilitude into his efforts, he would want to look well at the definition section.</P>

      <P>My problem in regard to this Committee Stage debate is to refrain from being party political.  I owe it to the House and to the public in general to try to continue discussing this Bill in a serious and mature way and not to be diverted into scoring party political points or to engage in partisan arguments across the House.  Any impartial observer would agree that it is difficult for me to continue to do so.  The Opposition have no real grounds for opposing this section or for speaking on it at any great length.  The definition section is simply a parliamentary device to secure the purposes of the legislation.  Normally, the definition section is a matter entirely for the parliamentary draftsman whose function it is to see that the statute is properly drawn and that it achieves the political purpose for which it is intended.  That is all that was happening here.  I have already explained at great length the purposes of the Bill, what it sets out to achieve, the principles on which it is based and the situation it is designed to bring about.  Deputies may disagree with that, but what the Bill is seeking to do and how it is seeking to achieve its objectives are fairly clear. This definition section is nothing more or less than part of that process; it is simply a parliamentary device to procure that situation.  I am satisfied that it does the job correctly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition are not serious in their criticisms.  They are just latching on to this section in a party debating way.  I will certainly look into the definition of the word &ldquo;sell&rdquo; raised by Deputy Kelly. As the Deputy raised the question off the top of his head, I will reply in like manner that he is probably confusing &ldquo;money&rdquo; with a phrase used in financial legislation, &ldquo;legal tender&rdquo;.  I will discipline myself and refrain from making party political points.  I hope it will be accepted by reasonably minded people that I am endeavouring to be non-partisan and to procure legislation which will attract <Col N="193" /> the maximum possible degree of popular sensible support.  Why can the Fine Gael Party not admit to me and to the House that they are fundamentally divided about this legislation?</P>

      <P>Deputy Kelly says on the one hand that this is a piece of nonsense, that it not intended to enforce it, and that it is ridiculous.  Yet he spent a great deal of time arguing about it.  If it is nonsense why does he not simply oppose it and be done with it?  Neither Deputy Kelly nor Deputy Boland can have it both ways.  They are using this Bill as a reason for attacking the Government politically and at the same time they say it is not worth talking about.  The criticisms genuinely made by Deputy Kelly of this Bill could have had equal validity in relation to the Fine Gael Bill introduced by the then Deputy Cooney, Minister for Justice.  Deputy Kelly, in his capacity as Chief Whip at the time, did everything he could to get the support to have that measure enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not very legitimate for Deputy Kelly, or for Deputy Boland to a lesser extent, to engage in this polemic type of argument about this Bill.  If they do not like the Bill, let them say what they will do.  They cannot ride all the horses in the Fine Gael Party at the one time.  They say on the one hand that this is nonsense and at the same time they proceed to go into the merits and demerits of it.  On top of that they refuse to put down amendments and say what they would do.  If they say this Bill is not acceptable because they do not believe in it and because it is not serious legislation, the honourable thing for them to do is to vote against it and have done with it.  If they want to criticise the Bill on its <Col N="194" /> merits, the honourable thing for them to do is to put down amendments and let the country see what they would do if they had the responsibility.</P>

      <P>I recognise the Minister's difficulty, that we are a serious legislative body and that when we pass Bills here we mean them to be implemented.  I will not take issue with the Minister on this section but I would like some information.  The present lack of definition will pose problems for doctors and will place an intolerable burden on them.  Doctors are expected to decide on issues that we are not endeavouring to explain to them&mdash;for instance, this question of the <i>bona fide</i> family planning.  We are saying to doctors that if a man or a woman comes to them for contraceptives he should seek an assurance from him or her that they are for <i>bona fide</i> family planning purposes.  This creates a very serious problem.  We are placing the onus on doctors to comply with the provisions of this Bill.  When we say &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; do we mean where a marriage has taken place, a legal ceremony, or do we mean a stable sexual relationship?  The onus is on the Minister to define what he means by this.  Is the Minister asking doctors to get a firm assurance from people seeking contraceptives that they will be used for family planning purposes?  Must he get that assurance in writing?  Must he ask for the spouse to come to see him also?  Serious problems are posed and they cannot be brushed aside lightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to elicit some information from the Minister.  I recognise the problems he has and I recognise the society we are in, but in passing the Bill in this House we must know what it is about.  We must ensure that when it is passed it will not be held up to public ridicule.  I want to know if doctors will be arraigned before the courts if it can be proved that they are issuing authorisations or prescriptions for contraceptives which may not be proved to be for <i>bona fide</i> family planning purposes.  We must settle this in our minds.  Unless we can assure the doctors who are being asked to carry out the provisions of this Bill that they will not be arraigned before the <Col N="195" /> courts and unless we specifically spell out the definition we will create enormous problems.</P>
    <P>It amazes me that the medical profession have not got a definition of <i>bona fide</i> family planning purposes.  If they have got it from the Minister, he has not provided such a definition in the Bill. The Minister should explain the situation to the House and he should write in the definition into the section.  I am asking him to put on the record of the House what he means by <i>bona fide</i> family planning purposes.  If he does that now he will assist us in our job.  I do not want to raise any problems.  I recognise the Minister's difficulty but he has an obligation to explain this matter to the House. I ask him to do it now.</P>

      <P>I wish to reply to what the Minister said a few minutes ago.  Apart from the fact that he did not even mention what I said in regard to the missing definition of <i>bona fide</i> family planning, to which Deputy O'Connell has referred, he is wasting time by harping back on what happened in 1974.  I will deal with it if the Minister wants to waste time thrashing out what happened then and I will meet him on every single point.  In 1974 I explained my views in virtually the same terms as I did here two weeks ago.  When I was speaking from the Government benches as Government Whip I said that I personally thought that section 17 of the 1935 Act was wrong from beginning to end and should be repealed.  If I had my own way I would have done that.  I had exactly the same opinion about it then as I have now, but I was being paid to act as Government Whip and there was nothing against my conscience in acting as Government Whip in order to regularise the law following the McGee judgment.  Had there been I believe my party and Government would have respected my conscience without question and would not have made it a headline topic, as was the case with Deputy Gibbons a week ago.  I did my job as Government Whip as well as I could.  I did not twist any arms, in spite of what the Minister implied when he <Col N="196" /> spoke.  I confess I did not know that two members of the Government, including the Taoiseach, were going to vote against the Bill.  I knew that some people were going to vote against and I did not have much hope that the Bill would pass, but I thought it was my job to make sure that it got the best show it could get. Without twisting any arms I put it to Deputies that unless it conflicted with their conscience they should support the Government.  As I said then and as I said here last month, I would have supported a more radical Bill and I still would support such a Bill.  I see no inconsistency in this position and I cannot understand why the Minister keeps harping on it.</P>
      <P>The position is very simple.  I do not think the State should set up in opposition to the law of God.  I think the law of God, the natural law, must bind every Catholic and Protestant who believes in such a concept.  Catholics will accept the teaching of their church in regard to contraception but that proposition is a completely separate proposition from the idea that a Catholic should impose that morality by the force of criminal law.  That is what we are talking about, nothing else.  While I admit I cannot argue it out, my instinct tells me that the area of life we are speaking about is so private and intimate, is so little adapted to the adjudication of other people and is so sensitive to intrusions by other people that it should be outside the pale of criminal law altogether.  A person might not accept a particular form of morality for himself, but not all morality has to be enforced by the criminal law.  Every moral proposition does not imply that the State should be breathing down the back of one's neck.  That is what we are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing inconsistent in regard to my own record on this subject or in regard to the fact that I think this Bill is a nonsense.  I am anxious that the House and the people should see that it is a nonsense and that it is not even believed in by the man who is sponsoring the Bill. He sees it as a nonsense and he is not able to say what it means or how it will work.  What is inconsistent about my saying that?  It is after 1 p.m. now. Would I be doing my job if I went for <Col N="197" /> my lunch now and took two hours over it while allowing this Bill to go through the House without comment?  Even the definition section on its own signals that the Bill is a nonsense and cannot be taken seriously and it will join other legislation as a dead letter on the Statute Book.</P>

      <P>I asked specific questions in a non-political way and not with any intention of scoring political points.  I am disappointed the Minister seems to be compounding the errors in his reaction to Deputy Browne's amendment in the way he is dealing now with the points made on the section.  Initially the Minister said he was prepared to stay here for some weeks if necessary to tease out the Bill on Committee Stage and to see if it could be improved.</P>
      <P>It is quite unfair of the Minister to say that if the Opposition want to oppose this measure they should just oppose it and that if they think it is unworkable they should not say anything about it. He said otherwise they should put forward what they believe is a solution.  I have pointed out to the Minister that I consider the definition section is seriously deficient in not having a definition of abortifacient.  I pointed out to the Minister that there was such a definition in the 1974 Bill and, more importantly, that there was a section providing for the setting up of a committee to establish what would be defined as being abortifacient in its effect.  I asked the Minister to explain to the House why he appears to think that that definition and the setting up of a committee does not appear now to be necessary in this legislation, although it would appear from the legislation to be even more necessary than it was in 1974.  The Minister did not answer that point.</P>

      <P>On the definition section I want to say this, and I will say no more about it.  As far as I and my advisers are concerned, the definition section is adequate and competent to achieve the purposes of the Bill, and that is the function of a definition section. The draftsman and my legal advisers assure me that the words &ldquo;abortifacient&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; are self-explanatory and do not need definition.  Deputy Boland may not know, but Deputy Kelly certainly knows, that in these matters the Minister responsible for promulgating legislation is guided by the parliamentary draftsman when it comes to the mechanics of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is at variance with his colleague, Deputy O'Malley, who on the Second Stage of the 1974 Bill is reported at column 311, volume 274, of the Official Report, as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with another matter referred to in this Bill, that is, the question of abortifacients.  I cite this again as an example of the impracticability of this Bill.  It is proposed to prohibit altogether abortifacients, a sentiment with which I and this party are in total agreement but, unfortunately, the way it goes about it is entirely useless in fact because abortifacients today can take either of two forms.  They can be either a mechanical intrauterine device which for the most part can only be fitted by a doctor and therefore would be fitted under medical prescription; or they can be one of the large variety of low-oestrogen pills which are now on the market and which it is believed, but it has not been proved conclusively, act as abortifacients.  Abortifacients within the meaning of the sort of things we are talking about here can only be one or other of those two things but both of them can only be supplied on medical prescription and if you go to section 15 you find that the Act will not apply in relation to <Col N="199" /> any substance, product or preparation the sale of which by retail, otherwise than in the dispensing, in accordance with law, of a prescription issued by a registered medical practitioner, is unlawful. In other words, anything which is prescribed by a medical registered practitioner is not covered by the 1935 Act or the 1935 Act, as amended by this Bill, if this Bill were ever passed, and since abortifacients can only in effect or in practice be prescribed by a registered medical practitioner the purported prohibition of abortifacients is totally illusory and of no effect.  This is just another one of the many difficulties that exist in this Bill that were not sorted out before the Bill was published.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of that Bill does not appear to have been changed in this Bill, and the confusion then in Deputy O'Malley's mind is now in my mind and in the minds of others concerned with the administration of this legislation, including doctors and chemists.  In 1974, Deputy O'Malley tried to clarify &ldquo;abortifacient&rdquo; and continued:</P>
    <P>If that definition were to stand it would be necessary in order to prove that something was abortifacient that it was designed, prepared or intended to terminate pregnancy.  There is none of these devices the manufacturers of which would admit that for one moment because the chemical abortifacients are all put on this market and sold and prescribed as contraceptives. It is thought now that their contraceptive effect derives from an abortifacient action rather than a contraceptive action but the manufacturers, of whom there are many, of such pills, would strenuously and vehemently deny that the intention was to abort an existing pregnancy.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister tells us he has accepted the version of the parliamentary draftsman who says the definition of &ldquo;abortifacient&rdquo; is self-evident.  He said that if I did not realise that, Deputy Kelly should have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>It is not only a debating point.  It is tremendously important for everybody concerned with the implementation of the Bill, doctors, chemists, wholesalers and so on.  A chemist, up against filling a prescription by a doctor must decide whether he regards the article as abortifacient in its effects&mdash;an article which the doctor has thought to be a family planning preparation. Is the wholesaler to be placed in a position in which he has not got guidance from the State except to the effect that the parliamentary draftsman has advised that the definition is self-evident? Are expensive medical researchers throughout the world to come to the Irish parliamentary draftsman to have explained to them what &ldquo;abortifacient&rdquo; means?</P>

      <P>I will not go into the details of the argument, but I shall put the following to the House for consideration. We have a well-established and well-tried system of law&mdash;it was in England but it has been altered there&mdash;which lays down a code for preventing abuse of abortifacients.  I was glad to hear Deputy O'Connell say &ldquo;Abortion we must condemn&rdquo;, and I therefore approach this on the assumption that we are all firmly of the opinion that anything that brings about or encourages it is to be condemned.  On that understanding I want to put the following points to those who advocate definition here.  I refer to the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, sections 58 and 59, which are saved in section 10.  Section 58 is very explicit and makes the procuring of abortion a felony punishable by penal servitude for life. That section paraphrased would be as follows: for a woman being with child <Col N="201" /> with intent to procure her own miscarrage to administer to herself any poison or other noxious thing or use any instrument or other means or for any person to do the same with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman whether she be with child or not is a felony.  That section in one sweep defines in the most general terms what an abortifacient would be whether mechanical or chemical.  It is interesting to notice that it applies whether she be with child or not. It is very embracing.  It is stated in section 59 that for any person to procure or supply poison or other noxious thing or any instrument or other thing knowing that the same is intended to be unlawfully used with intent to procure the miscarriage of the woman whether she be with child or not is a misdemeanour and several years penal servitude attaches to that crime.</P>
      <P>On the question of definition we have a well-tried system of law which is standing up here so much in fact that we are faced with a very difficult problem, namely, the exodus of many Irish girls to England to procure abortions.  The law is well settled and there is even case law, Lumley's case, where it is reached out to a doctor.  That law is intended to be kept intact by section 10.  I am sure that Deputy Kelly will agree with me that if one attempts any definition in this act or any legislation towards it&mdash;looking back on the 1974 Act, though I appreciate the intention, if we were arguing this I would make the same point&mdash;it would be wiser to omit that definition because one is bringing in a new and untried element where we have a well-tried system and body of law.  One could reinforce that argument with two further points but I do not wish to delay the House because there will be more on it on section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the McGee case there is an <i>obiter dictum</i> of Mr. Justice Walsh which would go to support my contention that at present the existing law in regard to abortion is effective and intact.  The word &ldquo;abortifacient&rdquo; is explicit.  It may be Latin or Latin derived, but to a lawyer or judge in interpretation there can be no doubt about what it means. One might circumscribe it if one tried, <Col N="202" /> but it is general enough to catch everything and it is therefore safe from the point of view I have and it is used in section 10.  In a nutshell, reserving the right to discuss it in more detail on section 10, not only is it unnecessary but, taking the Minister's point, it is a question of mechanics.  It would be much wiser for the House to leave that body of law alone and it would be much safer for us not to define that word in the section. In fact, if one wanted to insert the thin edge of the wedge with a view ultimately to facilitating the service of termination of existing pregnancy one could hardly do better than introduce conflicting provisions in another Bill dealing with the same topic.  Nobody in this House wants to do that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the comment made by Deputy O'Connell, who is a doctor as well as a Deputy, that we must condemn abortifacients.  It was a useful and helpful comment.  At least in the first section we should be able to reach unanimity. Deputy Kelly will appreciate I am making a lawyer's point and not a political one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera is quite right.  There is no dissent whatever in the House that I am aware of in regard to abortion or things which can cause it.  I did not mention this point but Deputy Boland did.  In reply to Deputy de Valera, he is right in pointing that out but he missed the point Deputy Boland was making which was that unless this term is defined in some way it may potentially expose purveyors of certain drugs or appliances to prosecution even though they may not have known at that time that they were at that risk.  I admit that is a far out possibility but it is one that a parliamentary draftsman or a Deputy combing out a Bill on Committee Stage must bear in mind.  The Offences Against the Person Act, is nearly 120 years old.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Council was established as the result of a decision by the Heads of State or Government meeting in Paris in December 1974.  Ireland agreed with her Community partners to the establishment of the European Council, which in fact held its first meeting in Dublin in March 1975 during Ireland's first Presidency.</P>
      <P>The European Council provides a forum for the Heads of Government to come together to discuss the problems facing the Community and issues of foreign policy of common concern to the member states.  It generally leads to orientations and directions for future policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been concerned that the European Council should not disturb the institutional balance of the Community, as laid down in the Treaties.  We are particularly <Col N="209" /> concerned that discussions on Community matters should take place in accordance with the rules and procedures of the treaties, including the provisions relating to the right of initiative of the Commission, as provided for by the 1974 Paris decision.  We are satisfied that in practice the institutional balance of the Community is not disturbed by the European Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>I would not so agree. It is fair to say that each member state, and France and Germany among them, is free to put forward at the European Council the general orientations to which I referred in my reply.  The Deputy will have noticed in my reply that we have adhered at all times to the institutional framework and balance which is an essential element of our support for the European Economic Community. I assure Deputies that that will remain the case.  We have also conveyed those views to the committee of &ldquo;Three Wise Men&rdquo; which will be reporting back to the European Council during our Presidency.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the interests of smaller countries are more readily protected in the framework of the ordinary Council <Col N="210" /> of Ministers meetings where, because of the frequency of the meetings and the greater intimacy involved, there is a greater sense of equality and smaller countries' interests can be looked after, in contrast to the European Council meetings which tend to be dominated by the two larger countries?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission, of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The Government consider it of fundamental importance that interrogations by the security forces in Northern Ireland should be carried out with full respect at all times for the human and legal rights of the person held and avail of the contacts which take place with the British authorities both at political and official level to ensure that they are fully aware of the concern of the Government in this regard.  In the course of these contacts we have been repeatedly assured that the British Government stand by the undertaking given by the British Attorney General before the European Court of Human Rights in February 1977 and that they do not authorise or condone any maltreatment of suspects. In the light of the recent and disquieting disclosures we have again raised the matter to reiterate our grave concern to the British Government.  We have in particular asked what action will be taken by them in the context of the recently published Bennett Report to ensure that the conduct of the police and particularly those engaged in interrogation centres will be in accordance with the undertakings given to the European Court of Human Rights, and to the Irish Government, by the British Attorney General.</P>
      <P>We have also expressed the view that it is only by such action that the entire community in Northern Ireland can be expected to increase their confidence in the process of law, something which the Government consider an essential precondition for normality in Northern Ireland and the evolution of political ideas towards reconciliation and peace.</P>

      <P>I met some of those people and there seemed to be a <i>prima facie</i> case at the time for their claims that they were brutalised in those interrogation <Col N="212" /> centres.  Is there any established process whereby an Irish citizen who claims to have been brutally treated in an interrogation centre and who chooses to look for the help of the Southern Government can make that claim, have it examined to establish its validity and, if it is a valid case, have action taken by the Government or the Minister's Department?</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that there is a process.  Any Irish citizen who has a complaint in respect of ill-treatment here or elsewhere&mdash;my responsibility is in relation to Foreign Affairs&mdash;can, and it would be welcomed by my Department, make a formal complaint. Obviously we can rely only on the facts which he presents to us.  We are not, either here or in relation to international consultations, a competent court of law.  We cannot make decisions, but I assure the Deputy that we will pursue those complaints very diligently to try to represent the best interests of our citizens in the hope of bringing normality and peace about in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>On the question of the Government's reaction to the report of the Committee of Inquiry headed by Judge Bennett on Police Interrogation Procedures in Northern Ireland, I would refer the Deputy to the answers I have given to Questions Nos. 6 and 7.  Abuses in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland are, as I have indicated, a source of serious concern in themselves.  In addition to our concern for the human rights aspects the Government are concerned that such abuses should not be exploited by the Provisional IRA and their propagandists abroad to justify a campaign of terrorism and violence.  Such abuses are therefore a cause of concern not only in themselves but also because of the ambiguous exploitation of the suffering involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ambassador in Washington gave expression to these views, which are central to our policy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the IRA propaganda campaign overseas.  He was not making a speech but was replying, and in words other than those quoted by <Col N="216" /> the Deputy, to a journalist's question which specifically asked about the sympathy for the IRA which the Bennett Report disclosures might generate in the United States of America.</P>

      <P>The establishment of residential embassies is a matter which is kept under continuous review in the light of our international interests and the availability of the necessary resources.

      <P>The Government have not received a formal request for guidance, nor did we give guidance concerning a proposal by the ESB to undertake consultancy work in relation to the management and internal structure of the Philippines National Power Corporation, under the aegis of the World Bank, since this matter arose before this Government took office.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from voluntary agencies in regard to consultancy work being undertaken by the ESB in the Philippines at the invitation of the World Bank.

As far as the human rights element is concerned, most Deputies will be aware that in the course of the renegotiations of the Lomé Convention there has been a tendency <Col N="222" /> on the part of the EEC countries to impose conditions for aid related to human rights.  That tendency has been very firmly resisted by the APC countries themselves.  We have to apply the same criteria in relation to Africa as we would to the Philippines or elsewhere.  We have to be consistent.</P>

      <P>My Department advise semi-State bodies as appropriate in relation to their activities in developing countries.  Where considerations bearing on Ireland's international obligations, such as the imposition of sanctions by the United Nations Security Council, exist, these are brought to the attention of semi-State agencies.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that semi-State bodies vary widely in their constitution, character and activities.  Many are companies whose boards of management have varying degrees of autonomy in regard to their operations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also appreciate that the development needs of other countries may seem to them to impose different priorities at different stages of their development.  Therefore, in our endeavours to promote human rights and to make progress towards a common standard we must show patience and understanding of the situation of the developing countries and not seek to impose our views on them.  The Deputy will be aware of my public statements in this context in connection with the renegotiation of the Lomé Convention and of the sensitivities of the developing countries on this issue.  Accordingly, it would in my view be difficult to formulate guidelines which would be applicable to all the activities of semi-State bodies, and in all the circumstances in which they operate, in developing countries.</P>

      <P>The Government of which I am a member are following on principles established by our predecessors in other Governments, so there is no change there.  I said it would be difficult. If it appears, having regard to the limited sort of knowledge that we would have about the whole range of developing countries, that we could make subjective judgments which would be helpful guidelines, we could consider it.  The Deputy would do well to consider, before he makes a firm issue of this, the fact that if we are going to put up guidelines related in any way to human rights we will have to apply those guidelines consistently even against the opposition of, for instance, the APC countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the details of a claim, if any, which the Irish Government have made at the Law of the Sea Conference for the seabed between Ireland and the United States of America and Canada, and which is beyond the edge of the Continental Shelf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Law of the Sea Conference is a multilateral conference at which claims against any particular state do not arise.  It is not therefore appropriate for any claim of the nature suggested by the Deputy in his question to be put forward by Ireland at the conference in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the issues under negotiation at the conference are the definition of the outer limits of the Continental Shelf over which the coastal states exercise sovereign rights for the purpose of exploration and exploitation and the regime for the international seabed area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. In this regard I would refer the Deputy to my comprehensive reply in the Dáil to a question on 22 November 1978 which sets out the stage of negotiations which the conference had reached at the end of the seventh session on these issues.  The first part of the eighth session of the conference in Geneva <Col N="231" /> ended on 27 April and will continue in New York in mid-July.  The present stage of negotiations will have to be reviewed at the end of the present session.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Continental Shelf the present text which is the basis for the negotiations at the conference, the informal composite negotiating text, contains articles which would give coastal states jurisdiction to the outer edge of the continental margin.  There is pressure at the conference for a more precise definition of the outer limits of coastal states' jurisdiction than is given in this article. This arises out of the fears of some states of excessive claims or creeping jurisdiction by the coastal states.</P>
    <P>Ireland claims jurisdiction over the geological shelf slope and rise to the outer edge of the continental margin. However, in an effort to meet the concerns of certain states regarding excessive claims and demands for a more precise definition of the outer limits to avoid uncertainty, Ireland has put forward a formula at the conference regarding the definition of the outer limits of the Continental Shelf which is satisfactory from our point of view.</P>
    <P>By resolution of the UN General Assembly of 17 December 1970 the seabed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction has been declared to be the common heritage of mankind.  The deep sea-bed begins where the outer margin of the Continental Shelf ends and, being accepted as the common heritage of mankind, no question of sovereignty over it or claims to it by any individual state therefore arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is, as I indicated at the end of my reply, that the deep seabed is part of what has been described as the common heritage of mankind.  Therefore, the question of making a claim to it in respect of a country does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 to 22, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Tánaiste, on the Taoiseach's behalf, informed the Dáil last Tuesday, the Taoiseach on 18 April last addressed a personal message to Prime Minister Begin of Israel in which he asked Mr. Begin to bring to bear all the influence he could exert to ensure the safety of the <Col N="234" /> UN troops and an end to the dangerous incidents which were impeding the force from carrying out its mandate.  Similar approaches with the same objective were also made by the Secretary General of the United Nations, who is responsible for the operation of the force, and by other troop-contributing and concerned countries.  In the course of his reply to the Taoiseach Mr. Begin indicated that the Israeli authorities had informed the so-called <i>de facto</i> forces that Israel opposed without qualifications any firing or shelling at units of UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>Deputies are no doubt aware that the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has not been able to establish control over the whole area entrusted to it by the UN Security Council and that the force is continuously subjected to harassment by the <i>de facto</i> forces.  Israel handed over to these forces effective control of a strip of territory on the Lebanese side of the border with Israel when it withdrew from South Lebanon in June 1978.  The Irish battalion of approximately 650 all ranks based at Tibnin is deployed in an area immediately north of part of this strip.  The battalion also has a number of outposts within the strip.  The remainder of the Irish contingent, a headquarters company of approximately 100 all ranks, is stationed at Naqoura, the headquarters of UNIFIL, which is on the coast within the territory generally controlled by the <i>de facto</i> forces.</P>
    <P>The harassment of UNIFIL has been a source of continuing serious concern to the United Nations and troop-contributing Governments.  I conveyed my concern by letter to the Israeli Foreign Minister in January of this year, and our concern has also been regularly communicated to Israel through diplomatic channels.</P>
    <P>The shelling and firing at an unprecedented level, which began on 15 April, followed the decision of the Lebanese Government, in consultation with the Secretary General, to despatch a contingent of the Lebanese regular army to take up duty alongside UNIFIL.  Under the terms of its mandate UNIFIL has the task of assisting the Lebanese Government in reestablishing <Col N="235" /> its authority in Southern Lebanon.  The shelling culminated in the intensive bombardment of UNIFIL headquarters at Naqoura, in the course of which six Irish soldiers were injured.</P>
    <P>In a special report to the Security Council on these events the Secretary General stated that he was taking steps through all possible channels to ensure that those responsible for this unprecedented act of indiscriminate violence directed against both the United Nations and the Government of Lebanon would be brought under control and that such incidents would not recur.</P>
    <P>As the Tánaiste informed the Dáil last week, since the events to which I have referred, there has been no major shelling of Irish troops, although the UN force is still subject to harassment and full freedom of movement has not been established.  The Secretary General has indicated that in the immediate future UNIFIL will concentrate its efforts on endeavouring to achieve further deployment and control in its area of operation and establishing as a matter of urgency a security zone around its headquarters of Naqoura.</P>
    <P>I have seen reports, such as that to which Deputy O'Keeffe refers, in which it is alleged that shells and shots were fired from within Israeli territory into the area held by Irish troops.  The United Nations has been unable to confirm these reports.  Were such reports to be confirmed, this would be a very serious matter and I should, of course, take the matter up at once with the Israeli authorities.  Israel has in any event not denied supplying the <i>de facto</i> forces with arms.</P>
    <P>Given the influence which the Government of Israel clearly exercises over the <i>de facto</i> forces, its position will, as the Secretary General has noted, be crucial for efforts to achieve progress in the coming months.  We hope that Israel will co-operate fully to this end.  The Government will in their continuing contacts through diplomatic channels do all they can to assist the Secretary General in making progress and reducing to a minimum the risks faced by the force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the first assurance we want to get is that the Israelis will not supply any arms to the <i>de facto</i> forces for use against the UN troops.  After that it would be necessary to get a resolution of the UN Security Council not to supply arms to any country and that would be a major political decision.</P>

      <P>Some recent developments in Iran and in particular the executions which are still continuing give me cause for serious concern.  On 2 May, in a debate on human rights at the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the French delegate&mdash;speaking in the name of the nine member-states of the European Community&mdash;expressed the deep concern felt by public opinion at the recent executions in various countries which in some cases had been carried out without the implementation of the due process of the law.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section I stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned I had been trying to deal with some points raised by Deputy de Valera and with which I am sure no one in the House would disagree essentially.  However, in relation to the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act the offences created either in section 58 or section 59 are offences in which the element of knowledge is essential to the committing of the crime.  In other words in order to commit an offence under whichever is the relevant section of that Act a person would have to administer the contrivance with the intent to procure a miscarriage. I do not think that is the situation with which Deputy Boland is concerned mainly because clearly somebody who innocently administers something in the belief that it is a simple contraceptive but which transpires to be more than that cannot be caught by the relevant section of the 1861 Act.  Section 10 of the Minister's Bill forbids the sale, importation into the State and the manufacture, advertising or display of abortifacients.  I do not care much for the use of that word but I do not suppose that anyone has produced an alternative to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of abortifacients is the one that is causing concern but I am totally unqualified to pronounce as to whether various drugs on the one hand or inter-uterine devices on the other hand act abortively by putting an end to an incipient pregnancy.  Perhaps Deputy Browne or Deputy O'Connell would be worth hearing on that subject.  The prohibition on the sale of such items is emphatic.  Therefore, it is not unreasonable to say to the Minister, to the extent that one believes him to be serious at all about this Bill, that before telling us that the Bill forbids emphatically the importation or sale of abortifacients, we should like to know what are abortifacients. Undoubtedly there will be differences of opinion on this question even <Col N="264" /> among the medical and scientific people who would probably argue as to whether one kind of preparation or another was abortifacient as well as being contraceptive. It was in order to confront that problem that Senator Cooney when he was Minister for Justice proposed a medical committee that would have the statutory power to define this term in a manner which they considered to be satisfactory.  There is no such proposal in this Bill.  I am sure that everybody here would take the point made by Deputy de Valera in regard to offences concerning abortion and would agree with his obvious determination that the law on abortion here should not be changed but he is somewhat beside the point at which Deputy Boland was aiming.</P>
    <P>I understood the Minister to say, as if this were an adequate response to what was being said here before lunch, that he was in the hands of the parliamentary draftsmen and that if these people told him that something was satisfactory he could not be expected to quarrel with them.  That is a respectable point of view but it is not too much to ask that when a Minister is sponsoring a Bill here, even if he must be helped to some extent by his officials, that he should be able to tell the House what is meant by something in a definition section or why other terms which are absolutely essential to the Bill are not included in the definition section with a proper indication of what they are supposed to mean.  Anyone will sympathise with an office holder who is expected to be an expert draftsman while on his feet but that is not what the Minister is being asked to do.  He is being asked either now or after he has had a chance to make inquiries, to put into the Bill some phraseology that will tell us something about some of the Bill's central elements and to do this in such a way as to enable us to deal with them. One matter is the question of what is <i>bona fide</i> family planning.</P>
    <P>Regarding the admittedly very marginal point I raised concerning the meaning of the word &ldquo;sell&rdquo;, the Minister will realise that the resources of the Oireachtas Library in regard to legal material are fairly scant and that what is <Col N="265" /> available is very old.  Therefore, I have not been able to carry out satisfactory research on this question of the word &ldquo;sell&rdquo; since lunch time but so far as I can ascertain from reading the 1893 Sale of Goods Act and also the 1913 edition of Hallsbury's <i>Laws of England</i>&mdash;the last edition of Hallsbury to be published and the only one which is available in this building&mdash;and subject to the possibility that I am wrong, the word &ldquo;sell&rdquo; means to sell for a money price.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has indicated his willingness to consider this question I shall not bore him with a long lecture on it now but would merely refer him to the two sources I have mentioned.  On page 109 of the 1913 edition of Hallsbury's <i>Laws of England</i>, a sale is defined as being a transfer of the ownership of a thing from one person to another for a money price.  Where the consideration for the transfer consists of other goods, or some other valuable consideration not being money, the transaction is called exchange or barter.  It goes on to say that, in certain circumstances, it may be treated as one of sale, but these are not circumstances referable to a pure exchange.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise also to the Minister that this is a penal statute. What we are dealing with here is a criminal statute.  I have already voiced my objection several times to the criminal law poking its nose into this area of life.  If the criminal law is to poke its nose at the behest of Fianna Fáil into this area of life, let it be noted that a court in the common law world interprets a penal statute strictly against the party seeking to enforce it.  Deputy de Valera will confirm that that is so.  If the Bill says &ldquo;sale&rdquo; when it becomes law, unless that can be proved clearly and absolutely to encompass the transaction under review, the person charged will get off.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if we did not have such an idiotic dilemma.  I know the Minister has not made this a point of contention and that he said he will ask his advisers to look at it, but if he is serious about it, he ought to look at this question of sale, and whether it really <Col N="266" /> does the whole of the job which he appears to expect it to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make one point.  It baffles me why Deputy Kelly keeps making these abrasive and contentious comments on this matter.  He has just dragged in by the hair of the head the phrase that the criminal law should not poke into this area but is doing so at the behest of Fianna Fáil.  I would ask the House is that calculated to contribute to a mature and reasonable debate here, particularly when this Bill is being introduced by the Minister for Health, whereas the Bill for which Deputy Kelly was Chief Whip was a criminal measure purely and simply, introduced by the Minister for Justice.  In all fairness, honesty, and decency, he cannot make the attack on Fianna Fáil that we are dragging the criminal law into this area in view of the history of the Coalition Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any need to include a definition of abortifacient in the Bill.  In the present state of our medical knowledge, we are not in a position to say what are and what are not abortifacients.  There is only medical conjecture about how these drugs act.</P>
      <P>It has never been established as yet how the pill works.  It suppresses ovulation and various professors and experts in the field of pharmacology have suggested that it might act as an abortifacient. In the present knowledge of the reproductive physiology, it is felt that it acts by supressing ovulation.  I do not think we could define an abortifacient except by saying &ldquo;anything which causes an abortion&rdquo;.  We could list weeds and plants.  Right down through history women have chewed various plants in an effort to produce an abortion.  They have taken gin, castol oil, so on.  Nobody has ever been able to define what causes an abortion in the line of drugs or medicines, apart from physical interference by means of physical instruments or an injection of saline into the womb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could not set up a committee to determine what would or would not cause an abortion in the line of therapeutic drugs.  The experts in <Col N="267" /> America, Britain and other famous medical centres have not yet established that.  It would be futile for us to set up a committee to examine this problem.  In the light of continuing research in medicine, we will have to learn from various medical centres what causes or does not cause an abortion.  The courts will determine accordingly if the problem ever arises.  I did not see very much logic in the committee suggested in the 1974 Bill.  Many agents have been used as abortifacients which could never be established as such.</P>
    <P>I was rather disappointed that the Minister did not try to clarify the situation in the Bill about <i>bona fide</i> family planning.  There is a big question mark over that whole area.  I recognise the dilemma he is in, and the dilemma of any Government in this situation.  This is an attempt by the Minister to meet all interests. He said he sought advice from and had consultations with various groups, but I feel he may have had consultations with extreme groups on both sides.  They do not necessarily represent the views of the majority.  At this time he might have listened to the majority rather than small pressure groups on either side in getting advice on the formulation of this Bill.  He may be mistaking the majority view of the public for the view of these pressure groups.  He may have gone wrong there.</P>
    <P>Sometimes when you listen to small pressure groups, unfortunately you can be misled about what people really think. Small groups do not necessarily reflect the views of the majority.  The Coalition Government could have taken the initiative at the time and called for an all-party committee of the Dáil to resolve this problem once and for all.  As legislators we have all failed in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>One point is almost clear now, that is, the impossibility of <Col N="268" /> defining these things.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell.  The same substance may give you a number of ambiguous answers if you attempt to interpret it in any rigid legal way, quite apart from the chemical affinities of many of these things.  For instance, the sex hormones, cortisone and cholesterol are all very closely related.  You are getting into an impossible area either chemically or medically as Deputy O'Connell is competent to state.</P>
      <P>What is the resolution on that?  The resolution on that was given very long ago by Lord Coleridge, C.J., in the case of Rex <i>v</i> Cramp in 1880.  He asked the question: &ldquo;What is a noxious thing?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It as said that &ldquo;noxious thing&rdquo; in the statute means some kind of poison, and probably that is so.  But what is a poison?  It is something which, when administered is injurious to health or life.  There is hardly any active drug which, taken in large quantities, may not be so, and, on the other hand, is there any poison which may not in small quantities be useful and salutary.  It is therefore in each case a question of the quantity and the circumstances under which the drug is administered.</P>
      <P>There is the only answer a lawyer can give in regard to these matters.  It is a question of fact to be intepreted in relation to the law as laid down in the statute.  We cannot go any further than that.  I would suggest that, having thrashed out this point, we should accept that we have arrived at a conclusion and prevent further delay.</P>
      <P>There is also a cognate problem in regard to the definition of family planning. It is not easily susceptible to precise legal definition.  That being so, the section as it stands is adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that Deputy de Valera is a most conscientious and painstaking Deputy when it comes to teasing out legal problems.  I painfully remember that the House was here week after week during the debates on the financial legislation of the previous Government while Deputy de Valera took time and pains to point to what he considered <Col N="269" /> were weaknesses in the drafting.  I am amazed to hear from him that we should pass a Bill which contains some definitions which are inadequate and fails to contain others which one would think desperately necessary because they are at the core of the Bill, and say that for that reason we should pass on because the definition is difficult.  This is as much a penal measure in its own way as is the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, which he first introduced into this debate.  What does he think Lord Coleridge, or any of Lord Coleridge's brethren, would have said in 1880 had he been asked to interpret an Act which contained the expression &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i> planning family&rdquo; where the Legislature had given him no hint or clue as to what that phrase meant and where, had he consulted <i>Hansard</i> he would have found that, although the matter was specifically put and repeatedly put to the Minister, he had not said one word by way of reply?</P>
      <P>I can understand the Minister's attitude towards this Bill.  He regards the Bill as a sore cross for him to carry.  He wants to get out of the House and be done with it and continue on his career of more lucrative publicity than the Family Planning Bill is likely to provide him with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly is so carried away with his personal animosity that he will not even let me in.  Of all things, he should not say that I want to get this Bill out of the way as quickly as possible.  I have spent time over this Bill and I think that any fair-minded person would reject that criticism.  This Bill has taken me longer than any other piece of legislation I have brought before the House.  I did not attempt to curtail the Second Stage debate.  I listened patiently to the Second Reading discussion and I am listening patiently to everything that is being said on Committee Stage.  Only a man blind with personal prejudice would make that attack on me.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy O'Connell, I took positive steps to ascertain what the ordinary man in the street thought and to do that I took the best possible scientific avenues open to me.  As a result, I am convinced that what is in this Bill is acceptable to the overwhelming majority of sensible people.</P>
      <P>On the question of defining or not defining &ldquo;abortifacients&rdquo;, there is no sustainable political case for the Opposition to make in this regard.  As many of them have been involved in the preparation of legislation, they know as well as I do that the decision of a skilled and experienced parliamentary draftsman is accepted in relation to the mechanics of a Bill.  If the parliamentary draftsman thinks that a word should be defined he puts in the definition of it.  If he says that the Bill is better without a definition, his word is also accepted.  In this case I agree with the parliamentary draftsman. Attempting to define &ldquo;abortifacients&rdquo;&mdash;and Deputy O'Connell has put the case clearly&mdash;would limit the scope of the section because the very definition would permit things which should not come within the ambit of the definition. This is one of those cases in which it is better to adopt the simple old drafting method &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill&rdquo;.  Let the word speak for itself.  As medical opinion changes the interpretation of the word also changes.  In this case relying on the word itself is stronger and clearer.</P>

      <P>I assure the Minister that I do not intend to lay on a performance <Col N="271" /> like that which I had to suffer when I was on the other side of the House.  I remember the House spending three days on a single amendment during a debate on financial legislation so I make no apologies for taking time with this matter.</P>
      <P>If the Minister looks at section 4 he will find that the last subsection states that anyone who contravenes the section, or regulations for its purpose, is guilty of an offence.  The contravention consists in supplying contraceptives otherwise than by way of sale under and in accordance with the section.  In other words, under and in accordance with the foregoing subsection which restricts the supply and sale of the things we are talking about to the qualified persons who supply them or sell them bona fide for family planning purposes.  With exquisite assiduity the Minister has avoided answering me and I want to know what &ldquo;family planning&rdquo; means and what &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i> family planning means&rdquo;.  If the Minister chooses to waive that aside I will let the people and the press draw their own conclusions.</P>

      <P>Up to now we have been talking about abortifacients. Deputy O'Connell demolished Deputy Kelly.

      <P>The point was first raised by Deputy Boland.  A view was taken of it by Deputy O'Connell and I accept what he said.  The point I originally made, which I am making for the fourth time, is can I hear from the Minister what &ldquo;family planning&rdquo; means and what &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i> family planning&rdquo; means? That is at the core, heart and guts of this Bill.  Unless the Minister tells us what these phrases mean he might as well wrap the farce up now and withdraw the Bill.</P>

Why can he not say to one of them &ldquo;Go and get from the draftsman something of what he thinks &lsquo;<i>bona fide</i> family planning&rsquo; means&rdquo;? Before lunch I put the case to the Minister of a couple who go to a medical practitioner for advice under this Bill.

      <P>I am not endeavouring to read the Minister's mind on this matter but I think that we should try to be honest about what we mean by &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i> family planning&rdquo;.  It means either a legitimate marriage or a stable sexual relationship.  I should like the Minister to clarify the position.  The Minister should say honestly what he has in mind and what the term means.  We must know whether it means that there is a marriage or a stable sexual relationship which may not be legalised.  We should have the courage to say that we are in favour of that and that contraceptives should not be available to all and sundry.</P>

      <P>On the very day this Bill was published I said during a radio discussion almost exactly what Deputy O'Connell is now saying.  I said we could not confine this Bill to married couples because the term &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; is subject to many different interpretations.  I am using the word &ldquo;family&rdquo; instead and the availability of contraceptives is for families.  &ldquo;Family&rdquo; can be defined as one wishes; the word &ldquo;family&rdquo; is not defined in the Constitution.  As to what I mean by &ldquo;family planning&rdquo;, I mean the ability of a family to decide the number of <Col N="273" /> children they will have and the spacing of those children.  By &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i> family planning&rdquo; I mean the genuine decision of a couple in a family context to make those decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I press the Minister further?  He is beginning to elucidate very clearly what I can only classify as some of the blundering hypocrisy contained in this Bill.  The Minister says that a family is also a family if it happens to be a couple who are living in what might be called a family climate.  Deputy O'Connell suggests that perhaps it should apply where people have stable sexual relations.  What about those who have unstable sexual relations and wish to avail of contraception? It appears they are outside the ambit of the Minister's mind.  We on this side have extreme difficulty in trying to divine what exactly the Minister means when he uses those phrases which underline the irrelevance and blundering hypocrisy of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can name at least a dozen Dáil Deputies on the Minister's side who, if they believed for one moment that the Minister was legislating for people other than those engaged in formal, legitimate marriage, would vote against this Bill. That includes some members of the Cabinet, not just the Minister for Agriculture.  I do not know what happened when the Minister went before his parliamentary party in January and gave them an outline of what was meant by <i>bona fide</i> family planning.  He gave the impression&mdash;so every Deputy and Senator in his party says&mdash;that this Bill was purely to confine the issue and sale of contraceptives to married persons, in the popularly defined term.  Now the Minister waves another wand over the concept of &ldquo;family&rdquo;.  He seems to imply people engaged in a family situation, a family climate, a couple living together but not married.  I should like to know exactly what the Minister thinks.  It would be a matter of historic interest, not only for the prurient in Irish society but for the Supreme Court who will have to deal with what we meant as legislators when we enacted this Bill.  The Supreme Court will have a field day in interpreting <Col N="274" /> this Bill; thanks be to God they have clarity of mind when we have cowardice of intent.</P>
    <P>It has been entirely appropriate for Deputy Kelly to raise the issue of <i>bona fide</i> family planning services.  The restrictions envisaged in the Bill and now elaborated more broadly by the Minister make nonsense of the Bill.  We should hear further on this because it is a fascinating interplay of words and non-words when we all know precisely what the Minister really means and has not the nerve to say.</P>

      <P>It is now becoming a little easier to understand why confusion has arisen in the minds of people in different organisations associated with the passage of this Bill.  In the past 15 minutes the Minister has told the House that this Bill relates to couples in a relationship rather than those who would be defined as being married in the strict sense.  While discussing the same section this morning the Minister was at pains to tell the House that the Bill went no further than to amend the hand of the law in relation to making contraceptives available to married people&mdash;no more and no less.  This morning the Bill provided no more and no less than that married people can avail of the right which the Minister seems to feel the Supreme Court have given to them; this afternoon the Bill provides for people in a stable relationship to avail of contraceptives. It is no wonder that not only some members of the public but some of the Minister's colleagues appear to have become confused as to what the Bill provides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not yet had the opportunity of replying to the interesting points made by Deputy Vivion de Valera in relation to the definition of &ldquo;abortifacient&rdquo;.  His intervention in the debate was useful.  In quoting from the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861, he pointed out that it would be quite within the competence of a lawyer, and certainly of a judge, to decide what was or was not abortifacient in its effect.  That is precisely the reason for my reservation and the fears of my party about the working of this Bill.  It should not be left to a judge to decide <Col N="275" /> whether the use of a particular drug or appliance had been abortifacient.  There is an eminent school of medical thought which believes that IUDs are abortifacient in their effect rather than contraceptive. It should be made clear to doctors, chemists and those who will be involved in the implementation of this legislation that the prescription of those articles would not be an offence under this Act.  They would not then be left in the dilemma of wondering whether they might be leaving themselves open to prosecution by prescribing an appliance or a drug at the request of the patient. The Minister often points out that legislation will apply to his successors in office.  The Minister of the time might decide to see prosecution instituted because of these appliances.  I agree with Deputy de Valera that the courts would be capable of deciding that a particular drug or appliance was an abortificant, but it is not fair that doctors or chemists should be asked to supply articles which are, in the opinion of some eminent medical people, abortifacient.  They know that according to this legislation the prescription and sale of abortifacients is illegal.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy O'Connell about the setting up or otherwise of a committee of medical experts who would decide what were abortifacients in their effects.  I do not think that Deputy O'Connell would hope that I would accept that merely because he is one doctor and decides that a committee would not be helpful that the House should immediately decide to fold up the debate which was the suggestion then made. There are many other doctors with many other opinions.  I accept the fact that Deputy O'Connell on a very regular basis agrees with the Minister for Health in many of his objectives and is agreeing with the Minister here that there is no need to define abortifacients.  Fair enough, that is his opinion and he is entitled to it, but I am equally entitled to mine and I believe that the procedure adopted in 1974 which would have meant a committee being appointed with medical experts on it and that committee saying: substance A is abortifacient in its effects; substance B is not, was correct. <Col N="276" /> That would have meant&mdash;whether they were right or wrong was perhaps immaterial&mdash;that all who had to implement the Act would know where they stood.  They would know if they supplied or prescribed substance A they would be in violation of the law whereas if they supplied or prescribed substance B they would not.</P>
    <P>If this Bill passes as it is framed at present no doctor or chemist will know whether he is within or without the law, certainly, in prescribing or fitting inter-uterine devices.  There will be considerable doubt in the minds of some as to the prescription or supply of some of the low oestrogen pills.  There is need for a definition of abortifacient so as to allow the insertion subsequently in the Bill of a section which would allow for the setting up of a committee that would define abortifacient.  That is why it is so important that the question of whether or not there should be some definition of abortifacient in the Bill should be discussed at some length at this time.</P>
    <P>The question of the lack of a definition of family planning has been debated and highlighted fairly clearly in the House.  I cannot at all accept the attitude the Minister adopted to it from 11 o'clock this morning when, according to himself, the Bill was to do no more and no less than make contraceptives available to married people, to 4 o'clock this afternoon when the Bill is now making a range of contraception and family planning services available to non-married people in a stable relationship. Perhaps it is not important that a Minister explaining his Bill should vary as much as that in the space of a few hours; perhaps we should accept in the words of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture in a different context that: &ldquo;It is only a Dáil debate&rdquo;, but I would have thought it might have been better and more helpful for the discussion if the Minister were at least consistent in trying to explain what he hopes to achieve in this Bill.  If in replying to different points raised he is going to give a different explanation of the purpose of the Bill, all that serves to do is to reveal to the rest of us the confusion that appears to have arisen in his own party and in <Col N="277" /> other places about the intent of the Bill. It certainly will not help the discussion on what now appears to be becoming a very tortuous and slow Committee Stage and Report Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>My case this morning was slightly naîve because when I came to read the letter which I got this morning on my way in and compared it with the amendments, my case that we would be given a chance to help the Minister by putting down amendments is rather blown apart in that most of the effective amendments which I felt were valuable and strong amendments that I had put down had been ruled out of order.  Possibly the cynicism of the Opposition was wiser than my ingenuousness in thinking that a serious Committee debate on this matter would be permitted.  However, there is no doubt that this Committee Stage has been very useful even up to the present.  We have had that most recent statement of the Minister's, the stable couples statement, that the obscurity of the law in relation to nullity and marriage clearly creates a very serious dilemma for establishing the criteria which the doctor will use&mdash;if the doctor is going to run the scheme&mdash;when he decides on a <i>bona fide</i> family planning pair.</P>
      <P>It should be emphasised that the Minister has moved away from the idea that contraception would be allowed only to married people.  I did not misinterpret him there because I have him on record as having said on the radio, when asked what <i>bona fide</i> family planning meant &ldquo;that contraception would be allowed only to married people&rdquo;. Obviously, this is a very remarkable advance, a considerable liberalisation of the interpretation of the Minister's family planning scheme and it would be interesting to know how the people behind him react when they find that this advance has been made during the Committee Stage, whether they will be completely happy about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that the law relating to marriage here was not clear which is a most extraordinary statement for a Minister to have to <Col N="278" /> make.  He has to make it because Deputy Collins has done the same thing in his turn.  So, you have the unfortunate doctor&mdash;I had intended to delay my intervention on this until the section which deals more specifically with it was reached&mdash;facing a couple and deciding as Deputy Desmond suggested what is the relationship.  First of all, it need not be a marriage; now it is a couple, a stable couple.  Can we move on from there to what happens with an unstable couple, just two individuals who get together?  How does the doctor make his decision about a <i>bona fide</i> attempt to plan a family or to plan to have no family?</P>
    <P>The Minister has produced an extraordinary Bill and most of the analysis of it is completely permissible because it must take place later on, possibly in the courts.  When one listens to Deputy de Valera's recitation of the dreadful 1861 Act&mdash;I think the last time it was used was in relation to Nurse Cadden and the lady went to prison for penal servitude for life, I think&mdash;this is a very frightening prospect for a doctor who breaks this law because the 1861 Act is there and it would be my case for not concerning ourselves with abortion on this Bill. But there is some validity in the case put forward by Deputy Boland and Deputy Kelly because at the last meeting of the IMA or the Medical Union&mdash;one of them&mdash;the question was considered and they could not come to a decision, yes or no.  There is no doubt that a good case was made for saying that high oestrogen content pills are an abortifacient and one must face the reality here from one's own ethical point of view whatever it may be and the doctor has to face it from the legal point of view, that you may be encouraging him or trying to make or persuade him as the Minister did in his letter to take part in a scheme which may lay him open to the charge of providing abortifacients.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there are two minds about the IUD.  In the Seanad a case was made that the IUD was an abortifacient.  It is a matter that must be considered.  If an abortifacient is as repugnant to everybody as a deliberately carried out abortion, then you must face <Col N="279" /> the fact that you are doing that under this Bill, that you are making it available, possibly making an abortifacient available.  A court may decide that a doctor is making an abortifacient available, and remember that this debate, as anybody who has spoken in public on this subject from time to time is aware, has created great bitterness, particularly amongst those with very deeply felt views&mdash;I am not criticising them, in any way&mdash;but there are a number of people who are bitterly opposed to this, in my view, very mild proposal.  A doctor may, possibly, inevitably will, face a charge from one of these people who will go to him and see that they get what they consider to be an abortifacient and then take him to the High Court for procuring a miscarriage, for conniving or conspiring to produce a miscarriage.  If the Minister declines to face this problem he leaves a number of fairly hefty mantraps for the unfortunate doctor who decides to try to implement the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try to get a definition of what is an abortifacient.  As you know this Union, whatever it was, has set up a committee to consider the question, but there is no doubt they would not have done that if they could clearly say high eostrogen, or the pill, or the IUD is not an abortifacient. Therefore you must be left with the possibility that what you are legislating for here is the provision of an abortifacient under the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put a couple more matters to which I have not got a reply.  The Minister said, on the only occasion on which he did address himself to the question of what was <i>bona fide</i> family planning&mdash;I could not write it down fast enough but if I am misquoting him, he might be good enough to say it again&mdash;that <i>bona fide</i> family planning was the kind of family planning which represented what he called a genuine decision by a family&mdash;I suppose he means by the parents of a family&mdash;to space their children.  That would be a fair shot at a layman's paraphrase of what a layman might mean by family planning but, of course, we are not supposed to be <Col N="280" /> laymen here, we are supposed to be making law, on the strength of which people are going to go to prison, if the Minister is serious about using this as a law.</P>
      <P>I am entitled to ask him, without calling up any more bad temper on his side, if <i>bona fide</i> family planning is a genuine decision by the parents of families to space their children and if the discretion whether to provide facilities of contraception and so on, which this Bill permits, is vested in the medical practitioner, would the Minister give us an example of the exercise of that discretion? Could he give us an example of what would be, in the medical practitioner's view, a non-genuine decision to space a family&mdash;possibly non-genuine, possibly ungenuine.  On what criterion is the doctor supposed to judge?  Could the Minister give an example, by way of making up the words which the doctor would use, speaking to the person consulting him, of how the doctor would express an unfavourable decision to people asking for a prescription?</P>
      <P>I said on Second Stage that one of the meanings which might be attached to the expression &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i> family planning&rdquo;, though there is nothing in the Bill to say this, would be the kind of thing which is relevant also to what I suppose the Minister means by natural kinds of birth control, namely, the moral proposition that marriage is intended to procreate children, that this is its primary purpose and that, while the church does not expect non-stop procreation, there is an expectation that a married couple will not be selfish in limiting the size of their family.  Now, how is a medical practitioner with the people sitting in his consulting room by the dozen to decide, no matter how much time he takes, what is a selfish and unselfish decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to make it clear that I am leaving out of this discussion people who are not married.  I am leaving that matter entirely to one side.  Take a married couple, absolutely above board and one of them is seeking a prescription from a medical practitioner of the facilities covered by this Bill.  That he has to find out whether this is <i>bona fide</i> family planning is only window-dressing, <Col N="281" /> it is bluff; these words might as well not be in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister should say this section empowers doctors to write prescriptions for contraceptives.  If he means more than that, what do these extra words mean?  Could he give an instance of how a doctor would formulate an unfavourable decision to a married couple, not an unmarried, not an unstable one, a married couple who presented themselves and asked for these facilities?  Is he serious in thinking that the doctor will sit down with the couple and say &ldquo;Wait a moment, are you not earning £180 a week?  What is to stop you starting a family?&rdquo;  Is he to get down to that level of discussion with a couple?  Is he seriously to probe into their circumstances and decide what they themselves have decided, that they do not want to have any children for the moment?</P>
    <P>It is a pretty general fact in the western world and anywhere in the world, that the higher up the social scale, the smaller the families tend to be. Perhaps there are exceptions but that is the general rule, that according as one goes higher up the income scale, families tend to get smaller, and as a population moves from relative deprivation to relative prosperity, family sizes tend to decrease.  That would suggest, if it is correct, that when you find, inside the same country, that the people at the bottom of the barrel, economically speaking, quite often have seven, eight, nine or ten children, whereas the people at the top of the barrel have a hygienic one or two or three&mdash;such is the rule in Sweden and many parts of Western Europe and many parts of the United States&mdash;that if one applied a crude yardstick of selfishness, the upper classes and the upper middle classes are selfish, that in spite of being better off, they are having fewer children.  That is a proposition which a moralist, or a revivalist, or a clergyman might utter, but is it up to us to be uttering such a proposition, or is it up to a doctor to come to such a conclusion?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give you my definition of family planning.  I use the word &ldquo;family&rdquo; because a married couple seems to bring us into some complicated legal situations.  There could be people who are a family and who strictly in the terms of our law are not so regarded. Can the Deputy accept that?  I mean a married couple, the partners in a family, deciding to space their births, limit the number of their births, or not to have any births at all.  Quite simply, I know what I mean by this legislation and normal, sensible people know and subscribe to what I mean.  It means that any such decision by a married couple, in a family context, to limit, to space their births is a family planning decision.  No doctor could have any view about that or be entitled to have any view about that. Deputy Kelly asked me to give an instance of a doctor who would refuse to write a prescription.  A doctor, approached by a single person for contraceptives would under this law be obliged to refuse a prescription.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will concede that that is a fair enough example.  It is the first concrete example we have had.  Is the Minister saying, in other words, that the only scope for the exercise of discretion here for a doctor would be if the person applying for a prescription for this facility was single?  The example I was giving all along was in relation to a married couple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I genuinely cannot imagine any situation where a married couple taking any decision about their family would not be <i>bona fide</i> family planning in the context of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that <Col N="283" /> while the Minister might not envisage it, the discretion is left to the doctor.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The doctor will be guided by the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>But the discretion is left to him.  If the doctor disagrees with the Minister's personal interpretation he can decide that although the couple are married they are not looking for family planning for <i>bona fide</i> reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No doctor could possibly disagree with my interpretation. The whole thing is subject to the professional discretion of the doctor and his clinical relationship with his patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>So it is being left to the discretion of the doctor.  The debate is becoming more useful.  This is the first time the Minister said in his definition of family planning that a doctor would be expected to deny the provision of the service to a single person but that he would expect him to provide it to married people in a general way.  Do we take it that when the Minister says married people in a general way he is also referring to common law husbands and wives as opposed to people who are married in the legal sense?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the same difficulties here as we had in relation to the definition section.  Paragraph (a) obliges the Minister to secure the orderly organisation of family planning services and paragraph (b) obliges him to provide a comprehensive natural family planning service.  The phrase &ldquo;orderly organisation of family planning services&rdquo; itself needs definition.  This morning Deputy Kelly complained that he did not see a definition of &ldquo;natural family planning service&rdquo;.  On the Second Stage I made the point that a natural family planning service is defined not in the definition section but in section 2 (b), because when you take out some of the verbiage you find that a natural planning service involves methods of family planning that do not involve contraceptives.</P>
      <P>From that it would seem that in an effort to get a further definition we should assume that, if you remove the word &ldquo;natural&rdquo;, family planning services other than natural family planning are by default defined in this section rather than in section 1 as being services that involve contraceptives.  I would have thought that a comprehensive family planning service would have included advice in relation to fertility guidance, for example, which does not involve the use of contraceptives.  Would that not be part of a comprehensive family planning service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> I was surprised that in the course of the debate on the previous section the Minister did not refer to items of that kind.  Therefore I should like the Minister to explain now what exactly he has in mind in paragraph (a).  Does it mean that in a period of time such services might be provided and is this to be taken to mean that the great reservations a number of us have in relation to the obligation of health boards to provide a service and staff that service with properly trained personnel are to be taken as valid?  What is the definition of the word &ldquo;orderly&rdquo; in this context?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This section places the Minister's choice of what he calls natural family planning services which do not involve the use of contraceptives as quite clearly his first choice in relation to family planning services.  It seems to me that he must have some good scientific reason first of all for introducing a special section to empower health boards to provide a natural family planning service and consequently for the implied rejection of what hereafter must be referred to as unnatural contraception.</P>
      <P>Here we are in deep water, but we should try to find out what is in the Minister's mind, why he seems to play down various forms of contraception which imply the use of contraceptives. And then, to go back to a point I made this morning, the Minister for Health being the authority on family planning under this Bill, why has he chosen to take the various forms of what I will call, for the sake of clarity, the unnatural methods of family planning and treat them as less worthy or less desirable forms of family planning than the natural system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned this morning tubal ligation and male sterilisation as being without doubt the most efficient form of family planning, which is denied to us. After that comes the pill, which generally speaking is probably the most widely used, extremely efficient but not perfect form for the various reasons mentioned, such as the possibility of thrombosis or blood pressure in ladies of more than 35 years, and other reasons which would <Col N="290" /> make the pill slightly dangerous in certain circumstances.  But, generally speaking, it is easily the most efficient, simple and safe contraceptive to use.  What are his grounds for putting what we now consider the natural family planning system in this special position&mdash;echoes of Article 44&mdash;in our contraceptive services? This natural family planning service is, of course, the Billings method.  I assume that is what he is referring to rather than the rhythm method.</P>
    <P>I am sure it is not coincidence that the Billings method is generally accepted as being the system of family planning which has been miscalled the natural family planning method because it allows for coition only 34 per cent or 36 per cent of the time of the female cycle. It therefore denies the couple the right to intercourse for a very considerable part of the menstrual cycle.  How can this be called a natural system of family planning where human frustration, probably one of the most powerful&mdash;and, in many ways, damaging where it is sufficiently intense&mdash;forms of abstention is implicit in the acceptance of the Billings method?</P>
    <P>The Conference of Bishops in April, as we know, condemned all contraception but are favourably disposed to the general position of acceptance of the natural method.  The Minister made it clear in his speech on the Second Stage that he intends to promote this natural family planning method.  The Irish Catholic Bishops Conference in December 1978 claimed there was a growing world interest in natural family planning.  The religious affairs correspondent in <i>The Irish Times</i> noted that the proposed limitation goes a good way towards meeting the points made by the Bishops in their detailed work in April.  The Minister stated on the Second Stage, at column 328, Volume 312 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>When the Bill has been passed, I propose to work closely with NAOMI and with the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and to obtain their assistance in providing a comprehensive natural family planning service so that in coming to a decision about the manner in which they wish to plan their families, couples have available <Col N="291" /> to them appropriate advice and information on this method of contraception in addition to other methods and that there will be available to them, if they desire to utilise this method, informed guidance and assistance in doing so.</P>
    <P>One must ask whether the Minister is acting responsibly in advising the use of this service, pre-eminently giving special consideration to the use of this service, special powers, no supervision, providing finance and various other facilities in order to push this particular measure.  It is a notoriously unreliable method.  It has a high failure rate.  It is not simple like the pill or like tubal ligation and the other form of sterilisation.  It requires a high level of education and of commitment to the scheme.  It is wrong of the Minister to appear to subscribe authority, as he is, to one form&mdash;the form put forward by the Catholic Bishops&mdash;when he must know that, in the first instance, in calling it the &ldquo;natural family planning method&rdquo; implicity suggests and seems to me to call into question the ethical values or standards of people who use the condom, spermacide, cap, pill, IUD or unnatural methods.</P>
    <P>The first place I ever saw the wording appear was in the 1946 Censorship of Publications Act.  There is no doubt that the Catholic Hierarchy are attempting to proposition the form they favour against the other forms as the natural against the unnatural.  The Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church, the Society of Friends and the Jewish religion all consider that the various unnatural forms of contraception are perfectly permissible and acceptable.  The Minister, using what appears to be religious discrimination in respect of a particular kind of family planning, is indulging in a gratuitously offensive slight on the minority religions in the Twenty-six Counties or, taking it as we did this morning, the Thirty-two Counties.  He is putting himself in an invidious situation when it comes to trying to establish that we have in fact abolished Article 44 and that our laws are not based on one particular church.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> That is one of the defects I see in the promotion by the Minister of the natural family planning method, but infinitely more important is the reality that the Billings method is a complicated, difficult method and a highly repellant form of attempting to plan a family.  However, each person to their own likes and dislikes. Its inefficiency is the most important point.  Why should the Minister favour an inefficient form of family planning against a number of demonstratively efficient forms of family planning? A <i>Lancet</i> study in September 1976, conducted by Professor John Marshall, who advised the Pope on <i>Humanae Vitae</i>, found a failure rate of 22 per cent&mdash;one in five.  That was a postal survey and I assume that if Professor Marshall produced these figures it is a survey that can be relied on.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is going into very great detail and that would not be in order at this Stage.  It is all right to debate one method as against another but to go into a long detailed <i>exposé</i> of it is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of doing that.  I will just quote two or three sentences and then I will be finished with it.  It states that all the women had been successfully instructed in the method by the correspondence service of the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council.  A Mrs. Noreen Ryan, who is secretary to this Catholic Marriage Advisory Council on this subject, said it is really only successful with a very attuned couple who have a very good relationship.  She is really one of the most powerful proponents of this method.  The Council of Europe Commission of Inquiry said the natural family planning and rhythm methods of contraception are too ineffective to be trusted and the World Health Organisation took up the same position that this form of family planning is, on the existing evidence, unreliable. As the Minister told us, they are carrying out a further survey and the Minister himself is proposing to promote a seminar here to inquire into the merits of this form of natural family planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> Accepting that it is effective in certain circumstances, the reason given for its failure is patient failure and not method failure and that may be right but the World Health Organisation dismissed this idea that patient failure did not effectively mean method failure.  But even assuming that it is, in the best terms, effective to between 15 and 20 per cent and the other methods, particularly the one I mentioned this morning, are all 100 per cent safe, efficient and simple giving the multiple choice which is imperative in this sort of situation, I find it very difficult indeed to understand why the Minister appears to favour this above what we call for convenience sake unnatural methods of family planning.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that there is only one lady deputy present and that she is outnumbered by the men here but I would emphasise that medical safety is a constitutional right for our citizens.  The lives of too many women are at stake for the Minister to take what appears to be a politically expedient decision or one which is determined by one religion over another, to offer avoidable risks, unnecessary risks to the lives of mothers and their children.  The figures I gave this morning are worth repeating.  In 1973 the maternal mortality rate for women between 18 and 25 was eight per 100,000; for those between 35 and 40 it was 30 per 100,000 and for those over 45 it was 120 per 100,000.  So pregnancy can be a matter of life and death and therefore the Minister has a completely bounden responsibility which he cannot evade.</P>
    <P>I have no objection whatever to any of the Churches and all of the Churches&mdash;the Presbyterian Church, the Church of Ireland, the Roman Catholic Church, the Jewish Church, the Society of Friends&mdash;advising their members on these things; that is what they are there for.  But I believe that it is the responsibility of a Minister of State, having considered the various methods open to him, to provide these various services to the community and then accept that the community is mature and is going to behave in a mature way and make a decision in line with their own conscience, feelings and beliefs.  The <Col N="294" /> Minister appears to favour this so-called natural method; I do not accept that it is natural&mdash;I think it is most unnatural.  I do not know how the Minister reconciles this with the provisions of the Bill but according to the Bill one must get a lecture on the Billings method even if one is simply coming to the doctor for a prescription for condoms or spermicides. This is quite obviously a public relations exercise.  The Minister is attempting to ingratiate himself with the Catholic Hierarchy.  I have no objection to him doing that but he should not do it by providing a deficient or a defective or a substandard family planning service which, let us remember, our citizens will accept as being the best service that can be provided simply because the Minister provides it, because we must assume that he will act <i>bona fide</i> in the best interests of the citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on the section and in the process to answer the question raised by Deputy Browne.  Why should the Minister favour one particular form of family planning service rather than another?  I doubt if my answer to that question is the one which the Minister would give. This is a core section in the Bill and it is a fundamental part of what I see as the Minister's strategy in bringing this Bill before the House in this way.  It is easy to see&mdash;and we would be dishonest if we did not admit we saw&mdash;the very many political difficulties faced by the Minister when he sat down to draft this legislation. But it is possible to sympathise with the Minister's difficulties without agreeing with his solutions.  The solutions that he has advanced in this Bill&mdash;and I do not think anybody who reads it carefully can come to any other conclusion&mdash;are based on a balancing off of interests.  My case is that it is this balancing off of interests that is at the core of the Bill and which has led to a need for a change in the law and not the needs of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer first to 2 (a) which lays down that the Minister shall secure the orderly organisation of family planning services.  Like Deputy Boland I find it very difficult to understand what this means, if it means anything at all. Will we have inspectors, cigiri an Roinn <Col N="295" /> Sláinte, going around securing the orderly organisation of family planning services?  It seems to be unnecessary at best and at worst it gives the Minister even more powers in a broadly based way than he is given elsewhere in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I now come to 2 (b) which is rather more important.  There are two points I would like to make.  The first is simply a drafting point.  It would have been quite possible for the Minister to come to exactly the same conclusion and to have provided a subsection with exactly the same effect if he had left out all the words after &ldquo;provide&rdquo; down to &ldquo;a comprehensive service&rdquo;&mdash;if he had left out the words which read &ldquo;a comprehensive natural family planning service that is to say&rdquo; because, as has been pointed out, the latter part of the subsection simply defines what the Minister believes to be the kind of service which the Minister should provide.  But we have here the insertion in this subsection of the phrase &ldquo;natural family planning service&rdquo;.  It is not needed to achieve the legal effects the Minister feels he wants to achieve.  It is the purpose of this subsection to achieve a political effect, not a legal effect.  The political effect is that it is intended to distract as much attention as possible from the fact that the Minister in other parts of this Bill is making available, however unwilling, partially or inadequately other forms of family planning via agencies other than those over which he has control.</P>
    <P>The politics of this Bill, which are not negligible, are that the Minister and the Government were put in the situation, not only by the McGee case but by their pre-election commitments, that they had to introduce some piece of legislation.  It was inevitable that it should allow for some availability of contraceptives of the non-medical kind.  It was equally inevitable that there should be a substantial public lobby&mdash;we have seen the fruits of it over the last few days&mdash;against any legislation whatsoever. It is as plain as the nose on the Minister's face that much of the impetus and the force behind the lobby, which is <Col N="296" /> associated with opposition to any legislation on contraception which would make ordinary non-medical contraceptives more widely available or even, as in this Bill, less widely available than they are at the moment, is allied in many ways with a current of opinion which believes that the so-called natural family planning method is the only form of family planning which can and should be organised in this country.</P>
    <P>I have nothing to add to Deputy Browne's excellent resume of the personal, medical and social drawbacks of this particular method.  I do not like making the Minister's case for him but I might point out that, even though the Catholic Church here and in other countries is the most effective, most organised and the most vocal lobby in favour of natural family planning, natural family planning methods are to some extent endorsed by other denominations and are used and endorsed by people of other denominations. It is not, strictly speaking, a sectarian issue; but it is certainly true that the Catholic Church and its spokesmen are powerful and effective spokesmen for this point of view.  The Minister has decided that the only way he can secure any widespread acceptance for even this restricted Bill is to build into it a substantial goodwill gesture towards that lobby.  That gesture is contained in this section and in section 9.</P>
    <P>I find it repugnant that the Minister should be using a section of a Bill in this public relations way.  It is not just a section of a Bill and it is not just public relations, because under section 2 (b) we are authorising the Minister to spend public money on one kind of family planning service only.  The part of his Second Reading speech which was read out by Deputy Browne noted that he proposed to insert this section in the Bill to authorise spending public money on the investigation of natural family planning so that couples would have information and advice available on this in addition to other methods.  &ldquo;In addition to other methods&rdquo; is an exact quotation from what the Minister said.  He was carefully making a distinction here because the other methods to which he referred in <Col N="297" /> such an offhand way are not to be provided by him but by other people, if they are to be provided at all.</P>
    <P>This section is drafted in such a way as to give the impression that the Minister and the Government are in some sense in favour of a comprehensive family planning service.  In practice the Bill restricts it to one kind of family planning, the kind which is open to many criticisms, and in doing so it gives the Government and any Minister for Health the right to spend a great deal of money on family planning&mdash;no doubt to the exclusion of spending money on any other forms of family planning&mdash;and in the process it effectively pre-empts the free, voluntary and responsible decision of many people in the State.  I find this extremely repugnant because of the misplaced and unworthy sense of public relations deemed necessary to squeeze this Bill through the Fianna Fáil Party, the Government, the House, and because it goes to the length of encouraging the Minister or any future Minister to spend public money in the pursuit of this particular end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As a woman I should like to say that there are a considerable number of women and of married couples who are in favour of natural family planning.  While I am a rather liberal person and hoped that this Bill would be expanded in various ways, I am very happy to see that in it natural family planning is given a special section and that money will be available to do research and to find out exactly what natural methods are safest and are the best.  Many of the natural methods do not work very well and this is why it is important to do research to find out better and more acceptable methods.  If a couple can find a safe natural method, it is best.  Very few couples would prefer to indulge in the kind of operations which were suggested this morning or make a final decision not to be able to have any more family.  Couples like to think that they are spacing their children.  If they have been using the natural method and after two or three years the woman conceives a child, it is not the end of the world.  It is a couple's own choice and they can choose, as has been mentioned <Col N="298" /> here, unnatural or mechanical methods if they wish.  They should be allowed to choose natural family planning and not be downgraded, as has been happening here for the last half hour, for using those methods.  I am all for research to find better and safer natural methods. The majority of our people want these methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected to be accused of many things in relation to this Bill but I did not think anybody in the House would accuse me of indulging in public relations in regard to it.  I want to assure Deputy Horgan that he need have no worries about that.  As far as my political assessment goes, there is no public relations benefit of any sort for me in this measure, no matter what provisions I put in or leave out.  As far as I am concerned, and as far as Deputy Horgan or Deputy Boland are concerned, I do not think any great public relations benefit will ensue to any of us as a result of getting this measure through the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of this section places on the Minister for Health the obligation to secure the orderly organisation of family planning services.  I would have thought that that was perfectly simple and straightforward.  I want to assure the House that it is not wording to which I gave any particular attention.  I knew what I wanted to say in that connection but thereafter I left the drafting of that paragraph to the draftsman.  I wanted to ensure that we provide a family planning service on as wide and as suitable a basis as possible for the general public. If any Deputy wants to put forward any other form of words to achieve that same objective, I will accept it because I am not particularly wedded to that form of words.  I want to assure the House that there is nothing sinister in that form of words.  They mean exactly what they say&mdash;that I, as Minister for Health, will endeavour, with the co-operation of the medical profession in particular, with the nursing profession also and others, to build up throughout the country and to make available to married couples a suitable adequate family planning service. That is exactly what paragraph (a) says: &ldquo;to secure the orderly organisation <Col N="299" /> of family planning services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Basically the Bill suggests that this should be done through the general practitioner service.  We are placing on the general practitioner the obligation to become knowledgeable and expert in family planning matters and to be able to provide family planning advice, information and education to patients throughout the country.  That is the first step in the provision of a family planning service.  There will be others, the need for which will become obvious as this Bill comes into operation.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a family planning service may be provided by others, for example, the health boards.  Here I want to make the point that the health boards were unanimous in telling me, when they came to see me that they did not want to be involved with the distribution of contraceptives.  They have no objection to providing a family planning service in the sense that family planning is used in this legislation, namely, a family planning service which consists of advice, information, education and so on.  The health boards did not, under any circumstances, wish to be involved in the provision of artificial contraceptives as such.  We may ask them to undertake the provision of these services. We may ask some of our larger maternity hospitals to provide family planning services as envisaged in this Bill.  If all these fail we may have to devise some other way of ensuring that every couple who wish sensibly and maturely to plan their families will be advised and informed on how to do exactly that.  That is all that is involved in paragraph (a).</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) has attracted some comment, I think very unfairly.  I reject any suggestion that this is a public relations exercise.  I do not think that stands up.  If one goes into it, and leaving this debate aside, one could not maintain that suggestion.  This section places on the Minister a statutory obligation to provide this type of service, a comprehensive natural family planning service. That is not window dressing.  That is not a charade; it is a reality.  If the <Col N="300" /> obligation is placed on the Minister to provide a service, he must provide that service.  That is something of effect, something that will have to be done.</P>
    <P>Why do I suggest that this service should be provided?  Deputy Lemass has given a good point of view on this aspect.  There are a very large number of people in our community and whether Deputy Browne or Deputy Horgan likes it, they are there and they have their views and their convictions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not deny that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and they are entitled to their views and their convictions. If this very large volume of married persons&mdash;I would say the majority&mdash;could possibly find a form of family planning or contraception that did not involve artificial contraceptives, they would be very happy people.  This would solve for them a very serious agonising dilemma.  That is a fact and let us recognise it.  Surely I, as Minister for Health, aware of that situation must do something about meeting it.  I must do what I can to see if it is possible in our circumstances to meet that need of that very large number of persons.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne said a couple of things today which I was not going to comment on but I think I had better.  He is a medical doctor and therefore what he says here carries some weight in a medical context.  I do not pretend to be in any way expert on any of these matters. My personal knowledge of them is minimal.  I can only take what advice I get, listen to it as carefully and intelligently as I can and try to devise policies accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Browne has been very scathing about natural family planning as a method.  I do not think he is right in what he says.  I do not think he is up to date.  I think he is medically wrong. Again I qualify what I am saying by telling the House that I am not medically qualified but the evidence available to me indicates that Deputy Browne is misleading the House.  I do not say he is deliberately misleading the House, but he is putting forward a view which I do not think is tenable.  There is very good <Col N="301" /> evidence, and I am quoting the World Health Organisation&mdash;not the Department of Health in Ireland, the Eastern Health Board or anybody else&mdash;who have just published a report in which they say that where it was correctly used the Billings method was 98.5 per cent effective. If any Deputy wishes to have a look at this report I will be delighted to make it available to him or her.  I will quote one sentence from that report, which is entitled <i>Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction, Seventh Annual Report, November, 1978:</i></P>
    <P>However, only three of the pregnancies occurred under circumstances where the method definitely appeared to be used correctly.  Thus the theoretical effectiveness of the method is 98.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, that corresponds more or less exactly, or favourably, with the effectiveness of the pill.  Therefore, if, simply on the evidence, you are to take a decision as between one and the other purely on the scientific medical aspect you would be entitled to opt for the natural family planning method.  I say that only to balance this debate.  I do not maintain that what I say is correct or has any finality about it.  That is the latest report from the WHO and I put it forward in contradiction of the rather sweeping condemnation made by Deputy Browne.  This morning he also at very considerable length advocated vasectomy as a method of family planning. I am advised that in the UK, the USA and elsewhere studies are now being made into vasectomy because it is alleged that it has very serious after-effects in later life.  It is not entirely legitimate for anybody in the course of this debate to take up these very dogmatic stances about any aspect of this matter.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Connell very honestly said this morning, medical knowledge is far from complete.  Indeed, the views of medical people and the theories of medical science change from time to time.  I say all this by way of counteracting the argument that natural family planning is something not even to be contemplated.  Deputy Browne was <Col N="302" /> quite scathing in his assessment of it as a method.  Whether it is or not, as Deputy Lemass points out, if we could come up with some safe natural family planning method we would be providing a very acceptable answer for a very large number of genuine, sincere people in this country who want only to lead their lives in accordance with their own codes, consciences, religious beliefs and convictions. For that reason I have put in here this obligation on a Minister for Health to provide a natural family planning service. That is the only way to ensure that it is done.  A statutory obligation on the Minister to do something will ensure that it is done and anybody can take the Minister to task here in this House or elsewhere to find out why it is not being done, if it is not.  Both the provisions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are perfectly reasonable provisions and perfectly suitable to include in a family planning measure of this sort.  The obligation to secure the orderly organisation of family planning services means no more than that, and the obligation to research fully natural family planning methods and provide a service based on them for those who want that type of service is a reasonable provision.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the WHO are doing an enormous amount of high level work in this whole area of family planning, particularly in investigation into natural family planning methods.  In an endeavour to advance our knowledge of the situation I intend to arrange later this year for an international seminar on natural family planning.  I emphasise that it would be a scientific seminar of, I hope, very high international standing which will bring before us in this country the very latest information of the highest scientific quality on the development of natural family planning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is exactly a year since, speaking publicly at the annual conference of my party, I made the very point that Deputy Lemass and the Minister have made.  I doubt if anyone in the House would disagree with the suggestion that if there is an effective and acceptable natural method of family planning the vast majority of people <Col N="303" /> would favour the use of that method.  Of course it is certainly up to Deputy Browne to speak for himself, but listening to him I would have thought that he was not in disagreement with the suggestion that if there is available to people an efficient, safe method of natural family planning it would meet with the general acceptance of everybody.</P>
      <P>I got the impression that what Deputy Browne was endeavouring to convey was that some of the more widespread methods, which are known as natural methods in this country, have not had the success rate that one would have hoped for.  Any man or woman would need to be a fool to continue to use artificial or mechanical methods of contraception if there was available a natural method for producing the desired result.</P>
      <P>I accept that the figures that the Minister has quoted in relation to the Billings method have been quoted in the international context, but if we are going to spend some time discussing the success rate of the Billings method we ought also to discuss the success rates of the methods used in this country and in the western world&mdash;generally.  If the Minister has those detailed figures made available to him by his officials it might be appropriate for him to produce the success rate for the Billings method in this and other European countries and to see how they compare with the 98.5 per cent which was the overall figure produced.  The information which I have is based on statistics compiled generally for the Third World.  It has been suggested, though I have no evidence to make me believe it, that they may have been compiled in a less than efficient manner.  Certainly my party would accept, as I am sure would everybody else, that there should be an emphasis on natural family planning methods that are efficient and safe.  I am afraid that, so far, very many people still do not believe that the various methods of natural family planning advocated in this country produce as efficient a result as some of the mechanical or artificial methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> I make one further point on which I had hoped the Minister would elaborate. In order to provide education in the Billings method it is required that the people providing that education would themselves be very highly specialised in order to be able to impart very highly specialised knowledge.  Otherwise the women employing the Billings method will not do so efficiently.  The Minister was at pains to emphasise that the success rates he quoted are only success rates where the method itself had been used properly.  There is some evidence to suggest that for whatever reason&mdash; rather difficult to understand&mdash;people in the more affluent and better educated countries appear less efficient in the use of the Billings method than people in the third would countries.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister might have explained to some extent in what way he was going to ensure that those providing the education in natural family planning methods would themselves receive education so that they could properly impart the technical and highly specialised knowledge necessary to enable a couple to practice the Billings method properly.  I am also disappointed&mdash;if we are to have an honest debate about it&mdash;that the Minister did not give the figures in the Irish context which are substantially less impressive than the overall figure the Minister quoted.</P>
    <P>What I had hoped the Minister would have explained also was the difference between paragraphs (a) and (b).  In one he obliges himself to secure the orderly organisation of family planning services but, in the other, he places an obligation on himself to provide&mdash;rather than to secure&mdash;a &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; natural family planning service.  Why comprehensive for one and not for the other? Ought it not be to secure the orderly organisation of comprehensive family planning services?  Or is the comprehensive nature to relate merely&mdash;apparently as it stands it certainly does solely relate&mdash;to the natural family planning methods?</P>
    <P>Why are we apparently endeavouring in this section to deliberately ensure that there is comprehensive natural family <Col N="305" /> planning service information available but no statutory obligation on a Minister to ensure that there is organisation of comprehensive family planning services which would include methods other than the natural?  Perhaps I did not make myself sufficiently clear when I spoke initially; it was rather difficult with people departing from the chamber after the last vote.  But that was the point I had intended making, that the comprehensive insistence placed in paragraph (b) is not, for some reason, outlined in paragraph (a), when one would have thought it would have improved that paragraph.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also as to the use of the word &ldquo;orderly&rdquo;.  The Minister tells us that he did not concern himself personally to any great degree with the use of that word.  Very often the word is used where it is envisaged that the provision of a service cannot come about overnight, simultaneously throughout the country, or in a comprehensive, efficient way at the same time.  The word &ldquo;orderly&rdquo; is then often used to signify that on a scaled, progressive, even gradual base, a service is provided, perhaps initially in some parts, subsequently in others and possibly never in more remote areas.  Certainly, through the use of the word &ldquo;orderly&rdquo; a Minister could be forgiven for admitting that the service was not uniform in different parts of the country because he was endeavouring in an orderly way to extend it to the different areas of the country.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on Second Stage I said that, as far as many people are concerned, this debate is a non-starter.  It is quite wrong when Parliament get itself to the stage where we are endeavouring to mend our hand, to catch up with the decision taken by thousands of ordinary, decent Irish men and women in planning their families.  They have made their own arrangements quite satisfactorily.  The people about whom we need to concern ourselves most are those mainly poorer people in the remoter areas who do not at present have access to family planning clinics, to some of the more sophisticated and large maternity hospitals, some of which incidentally already provide a family planning service, as I am sure the Minister and the <Col N="306" /> House well know.</P>
    <P>Therefore, to suggest that some of the larger maternity hospitals might subsequently, as part of this orderly development, provide the service is somewhat misleading.  Indeed I understand that one of the largest Catholic maternity hospitals in this city for some years now has been running a comprehensive family planning service for its patients.  But we should be endeavouring to ensure that the poorer people in the remoter parts have as easy an access to as comprehensive a service as the Minister for Finance's friends&mdash;the well-heeled and articulate women in the better-class suburbs of Dublin.  I do not see that section 2 in any way places an obligation on the Minister, within a reasonable period of time, to ensure that that happens because he has only to secure the orderly development of the services.  In four or five years time the Minister could reasonably say that he had found it impossible so far&mdash;although he still intended at some stage&mdash;to provide a service in, say, Donegal, Kerry, parts of the West because of the paucity of numbers of trained personnel in those areas.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that when the Minister was explaining to us what he meant by orderly organisation he would have put at least a verbal obligation on himself to ensure that some decent service was provided, on a standard, uniform basis throughout the country, within a reasonable length of time.  I should still like to invite him, again very much in a non-political way&mdash;I am rather concerned that the Minister appears to feel that all points being made are being scored against his unfortunate personal reputation&mdash;to speak on that matter, to give the House some enlightenment as to his plans to see the service provided on a uniform basis throughout the country over a particular time scale.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister also to explain why the word &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; is used in paragraph (b) and not in (a).  I have been thinking since the Minister spoke on Second Stage about the fact that he mentioned then, as he mentioned today, that the representatives of the eight health boards were unanimous when they came to see him, all saying <Col N="307" /> that whilst they did not object to providing information or advice in relation to family planning, they did not want to become involved in the actual distribution of contraceptives.  Thinking about that since, I realise it was the most obvious and logical thing for the representatives of any health board to say.  As we know, health boards are comprised of representatives of different areas.  Many of the health boards are unable to fulfil quite a number of the statutory functions they hold already.  I am quite sure if the representatives of the eight health boards were brought together now and invited to say whether they wanted to continue the public dental service, which many of them are unable to operate, they would probably say, for their own convenience, that they are quite prepared to advise people on dental hygiene but they would be delighted to see taken away from them the statutory obligation to provide the service because they know they have been falling down on it.</P>
    <P>I could go on right through the rest of the health services, picking out a number of different ones which the smaller boards especially would be quite pleased to have removed from them.  Therefore, if one thinks about it, it was not surprising that they should have said: yes, we are quite happy to give the advice but do not ask us to dispense.  That does not mean necessarily that the Minister should have decided that that was the right thing to do.  If a high proportion of the population are medical card holders, especially in remoter areas, are visiting health board clinics on a fairly regular basis, and if the health boards, through those clinics, are going to have to disseminate information and advice, is it not wholly illogical to expect a man or woman to go to a health board centre to receive advice as to the type of contraceptive he or she might use, then leave that health board centre and go to their general practitioner, from whom they are entitled to free medical services because they are general medical card holders, in order to obtain from him an authorisation in respect of a service, <Col N="308" /> which service they apparently now receive free on the basis of their medical card?  Is it not illogical to expect those people to go from the doctor to a chemist in order to have the script filled and pay for the contraceptive because it will not be covered by their medical card?  Would it not be easier, simpler, more efficient and a more comprehensive service if those medical card holders merely had to go direct to the health board centre to seek advice on the method of contraception best suited to them and if that involved the dispensing of some artificial form of contraceptive it could be supplied at that centre, irrespective of the reservations of the representatives of the eight health boards?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle were present he would be reminding the Minister that he was moving to the next section and would not allow this discussion but it is relevant to take the two sections together.  To state &ldquo;under the direction of a general medical practitioner&rdquo; does not mean the doctor must be sitting there with his diploma under his arm while the entire operation of giving advice is going on.  When we reach that section we will discuss in detail the devious mind that conceived this method.  A clinic can be under the direction of a general medical practitioner who may be dangling his toes in the Adriatic while the clinic is still <Col N="309" /> operating.  A health board clinic can be open to receive visits from medical card holders or other people without a doctor being present.  A health board could purport to operate a family planning advice centre in a health centre without a doctor being present.  I envisage that happening in certain cases under the Bill. The example I gave is one which will take place in reality.  I invite the Minister to think again as to whether or not it was the easiest thing for the representatives of the health boards to say that they did not want to be involved in the dispensing of contraceptives.</P>
      <P>At no stage during this debate did I endeavour to be party political but I should like to remind the Minister that in 1974 the majority of his colleagues expressed the view that the health boards and health centres were the most appropriate areas through which artificial contraceptives ought to be distributed. That is why this should be reconsidered. As far as the Minister not being involved in a public relations exercise is concerned I suggest that the public relations endeavours of the Minister are still present. In this case the considerable PR talents of those who assist the Minister are being used to defend rather than enhance his position, as well they might. I am surprised at the Minister suggesting that he has not been employing public relations because he has already told us that in the course of his thinking on the Bill he carried out a public opinion poll to get the view of the general public.  I would have thought that the taking of a public opinion poll by a Minister for Health in order to ascertain how people felt about family planning could be described as a high level in public relations. I do not blame the Minister for feeling that he has all the weight of the world on his shoulders, that he is carrying the cross alone.  It is interesting to see him take on some of the other biblical roles, apart from the role of St. Paul. That is one of the responsibilities of office and part of what comes with the concept of collective responsibility.</P>

      <P>I am expanding on the Minister's comments.  The Minister should give us some idea of the time scale he envisages in relation to subsection (a).  He should give us some idea in relation to the plans he has for the training of personnel.  It would be illuminating in relation to the debate on natural methods of family planning if he could give the figures available on the success rate in Ireland, as opposed to the figure he gave earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>After listening to the Minister I can honestly advise him that he would be safe to sack, or otherwise re-employ, any public relations people that may be operating on his behalf because he does the job so well for himself.  In his response to the initial debate on this section his stance could be summed up in that very traditional Irish phrase, &ldquo;hit me now with the child in me arms&rdquo;.  The portrait he painted of himself was so touching and wholesome that it would almost bring tears to one's eyes.  Here he was like Horatius on the bridge of Rome, behind him an embattled city, on the other side Larso Porsena and the hordes of Clusium.  It is not like that at all.  The Minister is setting up a straw man.  It is simply not the case that Members on this side&mdash;even perhaps Deputy Browne&mdash;want to deny people here access to a comprehensive natural family planning service.  That is not what is being advocated from this side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criticism from this side is that we cannot have a comprehensive family planning service that concentrates on and effectively limits itself to one form of family planning.  This limitation is unnecessary, anti-social and, perhaps, has serious side-effects as well.  There are many people who use natural family planning methods and who would prefer that such methods be improved.  I do not think anybody on this side of the House disagrees with that proposition.  I cannot see any comprehensive family planning service being set up by an Irish Government, or, hopefully, in any country by any government, which excludes consideration of and help for people who had decided in conscience to adopt this particular form of family planning.  For <Col N="311" /> the Minister to say simultaneously that the majority of people in Ireland want this service and then to say that by putting a statutory obligation on a Minister is the only way to ensure that such a service is provided is surely nonsense.  No comprehensive family planning service could exclude the service which he has written into section 2.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of his speech the Minister described these people as the majority of the people in the country. For the purposes of argument I am not disputing his contention.  The Minister described them as a genuine people and I do not dispute that; I would endorse it every step of the way.  But let us consider again the implications of that.  What about those who decide in conscience on other methods of family planning?  Are they less genuine, less Irish or less to be catered for by the family planning service envisaged by the Minister?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will be good enough to accept that people who adopt other forms of family planning are just as genuine as those who adopt the natural methods, but would he then go on to explain why only one genuine group of people are having their wishes catered for in this respect?  Is it because they form a majority, and what does this say about the attitude of this Government and of this Dáil to minorities in our community and in our culture?  If we were talking in these terms&mdash;about the rights of genuine people in relation to family planning&mdash;we should, if anything, be inserting in the Bill a statutory obligation on the Minister to provide in his comprehensive family planning service for acceptable minority methods of family planning; because the real danger is not the danger that the Minister presents to us, that is, that we will not have a natural family planning service, but that we will not have an effective family planning service for any other kind of family planning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

If there is any reason for the distinction between the two paragraphs it is that the Minister shall not provide directly any form of family planning service other than that involved in so-called natural family planning. I fail to see any other logic in that situation.  When we asked why the Minister is placing a statutory duty on himself to provide a service for only one group of genuine people among other groups of genuine people, we must conclude that the insertion of this subsection at this time was simply an attempt to buy off with public money the political opposition to this Bill.  I concede a point to the Minister on that from the public relations aspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>When I intervened on the question of the Billings method I recall being perfectly clear in saying that there are people who believe in this method.  Of course these people must have a total right to use that method if they so wish.  I did not make any attempt whatever to restrict access on the part of people who believe in the method.  In fact I have been chanting all day the criteria that I consider to be important.  These are that there be safe, simple and efficient methods and that there be multiple choice having regard to the different needs of different people.  This is a series of criteria which I examined in any system proposed.  On the question of the favouring of the Billings method by the Minister I must ask why he chooses that method against the other methods suggested by me such as voluntary sterilisation and other methods such as condoms and the IUD, all of which are accepted in practice as being easily more efficient than the Billings method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister quoted the WHO findings on the Billings method.  I can tell <Col N="313" /> him what the WHO said about that so-called natural method.  They said it was not worth considering because of its unreliability. That does not gainsay the statement made by the Minister that the method is 98.6 per cent successful when used correctly&mdash;but here lies the difficulty. It is not an easy or a simple method.  In those circumstances it is not efficient and it is on the grounds of its not being efficient that I object to it.  In considering the whole question of contraception I tried to concentrate on it from the point of view of the woman who does not wish to have another child and to ask myself what would I offer her if I were Minister for Health.  I would not regard myself as having any right to be concerned with her religious beliefs or with her social or ethical attitudes, but simply as Minister for Health I would be concerned to give her the best advice possible in the form of legislation.  I do not believe the Minister is doing that in this instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I made that point this morning also and that is why I suggest the idea of multiple choice.  If one refers to the various statements made by the different churches one finds that they have no problem in relation to the acceptability of what are called the unnatural forms of contraception.  Many years ago it was said at the Church of Ireland Synod that that body had no objection to such forms of contraception.  The Presbyterians hold the same view and members of the Jewish faith also made representations to the effect that so far as they are concerned contraceptives should be available.  It was rather unusual <Col N="314" /> for minority faiths to make representations on this issue.  These people must be accommodated equally so far as the legislation goes.  I object to the preferential treatment being given to the natural methods of family planning, not only because this attitude appears to be discriminating on religious grounds in favour of the Catholic religion but also because the EEC survey found these natural methods to be inefficient.  Professor John Marshall's findings said the same thing and dismissed them as unreliable.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organisation made exactly the case both of us had made, that it is efficient when correctly used. As Deputy Boland said, it is only successful with a very attuned couple who have a very good relationship.  In the Marshall findings there was a 22 per cent failure rate.  In another study in the island of Tonga in 1972 the failure rate was 15 per cent.  It is described as patient failure and not method failure. The World Health Organisation said, in reply to the defence that it is very efficient, that the patients get fed up trying to practise it because it is too complicated and too difficult, and the sex drives are too powerful and they cannot overcome them.  The result is that they have coitus, the lady conceives and there is a pregnancy.  Billings would say: &ldquo;If they had only done what I told them, the lady would not have conceived&rdquo;.  It means a 34 per cent right to coitus in the female cycle and to a young, healthy, lusty couple that is not acceptable and not practical.</P>
      <P>It is inexplicable to me why the Minister, in his position, would go along with the generally held view that this is a natural method.  I do not think it could be in the light of what I just said.  It is promoted by the various Catholic authorities and organisations and, being 90 per cent Catholic, or whatever the figure is&mdash;there is a very high percentage of Catholics&mdash;obviously people will try to avoid getting into trouble with their consciences by doing something of which their church does not approve. That is perfectly reasonable behaviour on their part.  The Minister should not go along with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> It is perfectly permissible, except in the Minister's case.  His job is to act outside all of these influences, the sectarian influences, the pressure groups on both sides.  He has to stand outside in a judicial capacity.  Women will go to family planning clinics in the belief that they will be offered something which will save them from becoming pregnant.  As I said, 46 per cent of women do not want to become pregnant and try to avoid becoming pregnant.  One of the very distressing realities is that, in the absence of contraception, we have a very high level of abstinence in Ireland.  Even though our birth rate figure, our fertility rate, is very high, twice the EEC figure, because there are no contraceptives and because women are so frightened of pregnancy, there is a very high level of abstinence.</P>
    <P>I remember telling the Minister that, as a psychiatrist, in my working class practice I found that the fear of the next child was one of the highest sources of distress among women coming to the clinic.  This fear of pregnancy led to abstention, abstention led to repercussions on the part of the husband, and the next thing was the battered wife and so on.  There are very serious social consequences to this whole question of family planning and contraception.  Sometimes one wonders if it is fully understood by people that one is not simply being a crank.  It has very serious repercussions for men and women and also for children.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the suggestion by Deputy Lemass that it is all right if things go wrong, and if a child is born it will be accepted as the will of God, or whatever it may be.  I do not think children should come into the world like that.  There should be only wanted children.  The unwanted child, it has been found, tends to become emotionally deprived and ends up in a psychiatric hospital.  This question of family planning which the Minister is trying to introduce&mdash;and it is good that he is trying to do it&mdash;is an attitude of mind this haphazard idea that if things go wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are now dealing with the detailed consideration of the sections.  Surely there is repetition which is unnecessary. The Chair cannot permit this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am answering points I wrote down which were made by the Minister, Deputy Lemass and Deputy Boland.  I am attempting to answer statements made by them.  Deputy Boland and Deputy Horgan were quite right to take up the point about the difference between paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) and the use of the words &ldquo;secure&rdquo; and &ldquo;provide&rdquo;.  I was fascinated by these two words when I saw them.  I looked them up in a dictionary to try to work out what the Minister had in mind, and I have to say I could not.  To secure is to tie up a boat, or to tie a rope, or something like that.  It is sufficiently vague not to be of any help.  To provide is obviously very much more clear-cut. There is no doubt in my mind that there is something the Minister is not telling us about in the use of those two words in the two paragraphs.</P>
      <P>If paragraph (b) read:</P>
      <P>provide a comprehensive natural family planning service, that is to say, a comprehensive service for the provision of information, instruction, advice and consultation in relation to methods of family planning ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>that would necessarily include all forms of family planning, including so-called natural family planning, and would not give the impression that the priority in the new family planning scheme will be to bow to the wishes of the natural family planning lobby and to try to downgrade the most efficient, most effective and simplest forms of family planning.  The Minister has some explaining to do about his clear preference without substantial evidence.  He must accept the point I made conceding the reference he made to the World Health Organisation.  Of course, he did suggest that I was misleading the House in being scathing about the Billings method.  I made the point that the need for cooperation <Col N="317" /> between couples was the important consideration in regard to the effectiveness of the Billings method.  None of that applies to anything like the same extent in regard to the pill, the condom, the diaphragm and the IUD.</P>
    <P>This brings one to the question of the attempt I made to discuss fitting and supply and whether the Minister could answer my question as to how he proposes the clinic to operate.  I agree with Deputy Boland's point that the health boards will get out of providing anything they can get out of providing. What happens in the case of a lady who wants a diaphragm?  Is she fitted with a diaphragm?  The idea, I suspect, is that she would be fitted.  What happens then? Does the doctor take the diaphragm back and tell her to get a diaphragm in the chemists?  If that is true then what Deputy Boland said is correct.  There will be an appalling waste of time on the part of the doctor, the chemist and the lady looking for help and the greatly added expense of a prescription charge and a doctor's consultation charge.  What will happen about the fitting of an IUD and the use of a spermicide?  What will the liasion be between the chemists, the health boards and the suppliers of these mechanical devices?</P>
    <P>The other objection to the Billings method is its complexity.  To use it requires instruction, high motivation and persistence.  I think the IMA told the Minister that there were ten or 11 doctors in the country who were really experienced in family planning methodology.  Does the Minister believe that it will be possible for a busy general practitioner who believes in natural <Col N="318" /> family planning to explain it in a way which will make sure that we get a serious family planning service in a reasonable time?</P>
    <P>The other question relates to the doctor who does not believe in natural family planning but who, according to subsection (5) &ldquo;shall ensure that the service includes information, instruction, advice and consultation in relation to methods of family planning that do not involve the use of contraceptives&rdquo;.  He will find himself having to talk about natural family planning.  In a later section he is told he can use his discretion but he will not be compelled to do anything he does not believe in as a doctor in his medical relationship with the patient.</P>
    <P>There are many points of confusion in the Bill.  I am not attempting to make difficulties for the Minister.  I am simply attempting to show him the points about which I believe many people are confused. It is in the Minister's interest that we should make it clear.  Why does the Minister accept the health board recommendations if he really believes that it is their job to provide these facilities or to reduce the difficulty which people in rural areas will have in finding a doctor who accepts the scheme, a chemist who stocks the devices, and so on.  There is a compelling case for insisting that the health clinics be responsible for the family planning service, including the fitting and supplying of devices.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (3), lines 23 to 27, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The feeling that one has in regard to this section is that in some way this would tie up with the Minister's vagueness in section 2 (a) about the provision of family planning services involving the use of contraceptives.  My belief is that if there is need for a family planning service and if it is provided under the law, and lawfully constructed, under adequate supervision, or supervised by trained family planning personnel, then it should be possible for a clinic to be established.  It seems that this subsection is aimed at the <Col N="321" /> existing family planning clinics.  We all know these were established with great difficulty against considerable hostility and that it took quite a lot of courage by people to provide for what it transpired was a very real need.</P>
    <P>These clinics since their establishment have provided a very valuable service. They are economical, well-run, efficient. They provide various tests, smear tests, cancer tests, breast examination, pregnancy testing, psychosexual counselling and they are recognised from the point of view of the Department for grants towards training by doctors, nurses or social welfare workers or anybody else. These are helped by the Department of Health in attending courses run by the clinics to become eligible for the College of Obstetrician&mdash;Gynaecologists and the General Practitioners' Association, the joint group, the Royal College of General Practitioners, which provide a certificate to certify that those who have that certificate are competent in the training and advising of people in regard to contraceptives and in fitting of contraceptive devices of various kinds.</P>
    <P>While in principle, as is probably well known, I am not a great believer in voluntary organisations, at the same time where they are providing a good service&mdash;there is no doubt about the value of the service these clinics provide&mdash;then until as good a service or a better service is provided by the State every encouragement should be given to the continued survival of the family planning clinics.  They cannot survive unless they are allowed to sell contraceptive devices. This is precluded under the Bill and in these circumstances it would seem that the Minister is aiming to close down these clinics.  Certainly it does not appear that he is going to do anything to prevent them from being closed down.</P>
    <P>The extent of the service provided includes various diagnostic services and various services associated with family planning, contraception and also associated with the provision of information and lectures to doctors and a postal service.  The latter is important because with our background we are very slow to discuss sexual matters in our culture for <Col N="322" /> various reasons.  That certainly applies to those over 24.  As regards the survey carried out by the Minister and referred to by Deputy Boland, it would be interesting to know if there was any difference between the replies from the 18-25 age group and the 25 plus group as to their attitude to the kind of contraceptive service they needed.  There is a large group of people who will not go to a doctor.  There are also many doctors who are not very good on these matters. It is not implicit in the fact that a person is a doctor that he is able to discuss these extremely delicate, difficult and complicated matters, all the various problems associated with sexual relations in marriage and out of marriage.</P>
    <P>By post in 1977, 80,000 orders came from people who will not go to family planning clinics.  That is a very important service which I think should be continued, because if they need contraceptives the facility for them to get them any way they want to get them should be provided. There were 11,000 callers in 1977.  That is a remarkable achievement by these clinics.  I should like to know what plans the Minister has for these clinics.  I understand one-third of their income comes from the sale of contraceptives of different kinds.</P>

      <P>In the debate last evening several issues were raised in regard to the present crisis in supplies of oil petroleum products.  There may be argument as to whether the situation confronting the country is described as a problem or a crisis.  The Minister of State last night said that we did not have a crisis but we did have a problem.  I do not think we need lose any sleep over the actual description of the situation other than to note that as it affects supplies in city garages there are queues and there are shortages.  It is also to be noted that such shortages and such queues appear to coincide with price applications by the companies concerned.  No one will deny that the Government, in common with other EEC countries, face a problem in relation to oil supplies generally.  It has been pretty clear for some time that we were entering a period in which, if there was not actual scarcity of oil supplies, there certainly would be very sharp price increases and the most recent meeting of the OPEC oil Ministers gave evidence of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the handling of the situation the present administration may fairly be indicted for their apparent lack of preparedness.  The Iranian troubles were so long in preparation and the consequences following from a disruption of the regime there so obvious that it is quite incomprehensible that this administration should have found itself so <Col N="324" /> unprepared.  The reason may be advanced that the full consequences of the supply situation may not have been known to the Government.  The reason may be advanced also that the oil companies themselves are so much in control of the actual supply situation that they have such an accumulation of knowledge from their multi-national contacts, that they are in a superior situation to any small State like ours. However, one would have thought that a State as vulnerable as we are, which lacks the refining capacity even if it had the supplies to produce certain of the energy needed, would be even more alert in a situation like that, a situation which was predictable at the time of the events which led to the fall of the late regime in Iran.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The late regime, yes. We are promised a national oil corporation and I want to make it clear that from these benches we support this concept. We are not, as yet, in full possession of all the details of that operation, whether, for example, it will extend into supply and distribution itself.  But it necessarily follows from the State's vulnerability in the area of energy that there must be some State presence guarding the national interest, to the extent to which it can be guarded, because it would appear that the oil companies, with their monopoly control of the market, their multi-national contacts abroad, have our national economy by the throat.  Any administration anxious to protect the national interest are on the right path in suggesting an oil corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is less satisfactory is this administration's handling of the immediate crisis we have now.  There appears to be immense confusion on the order of priorities to be followed in the present situation.  The Minister of State last night denied that there is any factual basis for the introduction of rationing.  The point must be made, pretty legitimately, that we do have a rationing situation in several parts of the country at present in the sense that there is shortage, that <Col N="325" /> there are queues and that petrol products are not available as they were formerly.  In any case, the order of priorities drawn up does appear not to make any order of preference as between the needs of particular sectors of industry and of agriculture, and as regards the area of hospitals and the health services it does not appear to distinguish in that area very adequately.</P>
    <P>There is one special category&mdash;and though all categories may plead with justice that their case is one that calls for attention, there is one special category&mdash;I refer to householders who de-pend on domestic heating oil as a sole source of heating in their homes.  Certain companies have completely refused to give them supplies.  Granted that there is a scarcity, it would appear that much more work needs to be done in differentiating between deserving cases.  Without exaggerating the situation it can be said that many families in these circumstances, families with young children, are placed in a very difficult position indeed. Their homes were originally constructed some years back, with State encouragement, and State grants, and have no other form of heating other than central heating.  It is true that the last administration began to reverse this trend after 1973, when it appeared that we were entering a totally different era in terms of energy supply and oil prices generally.  Such families at present are faced with a very serious situation and one wonders whether there is not a more compassionate way of dealing with their plight.  Granted, again, that we have had another aggravating factor in the weather experienced recently, which has been totally unseasonable.  We have had spells of cold weather not associated with this time of year.</P>
    <P>Another instance of the culpability of the Government would appear to be their lack of knowledge of the actual storage situation within the State, their lack of knowledge of the actual grades held by the companies.  The worry still persists that the EEC requirement of 90 days' storage was not fully lived up to within the jurisdiction of the State and that amounts in line with this 90-day figure were held in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this debate would suggest <Col N="326" /> that there is any magic wand that can be waved over the entire energy scene to produce solutions satisfactory to all.  Nobody from these benches will deny that we face a very uncertain future in relation to our energy requirements.  We face a constant price rise in the product here.  I said last night that it is reasonably predictable that we shall see a three-phase price &ldquo;hike&rdquo; for the remainder of this year in relation to petroleum products, with natural consequences for our own inflation rate.  This very disturbing future supply and price situation will have effect and impact on other plans of the Government.  Now, the Minister has made it clear that he sees no reason for a White Paper on this new and evolving situation.</P>

      <P>I conclude by saying that this Government have been found wanting in their handling of this immediate crisis and that it is not sufficient to point to a future national oil corporation, which I support.  It is not sufficient to point to that happy day to avert the justified criticism of their bad handling, their inept handling of the present supply situation, which is extremely confusing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal, first of all, with the amount of petrol sold in this present year, so far, by comparison with the corresponding period of last year.  In the first quarter of this year 9.8 per cent more petrol was sold to consumers than in the corresponding quarter last year.  Broken down month by month, the figures show that in January 9.7 per cent more was sold to customers, in February 20 per cent more. was sold and in March 2 per cent more. I will not have the final figures for April for a few days but indications are that either exactly the same or marginally more than in April 1978 was sold.  The projected figures for May indicate that the same amount of petrol will be supplied to consumers here as was supplied in May 1978.  These figures, which are accurate and factual, cannot sustain any sort of allegation of widespread shortage <Col N="327" /> or whatever.</P>
      <P>The rise in demand for petrol is in the region of 9 to 10 per cent and that is caused for the most part by our increased economic activity and by our growth rate.  The shortfall is, therefore, the difference between 110 per cent of last year's figures and whatever is supplied. It would appear that a shortfall only began to appear in March.  In fact there was considerable excess sold in the month of February.  We have to face the fact that we need 110 per cent of last year's supply if we are to continue using petrol and oil generally at the rate we want and we must also face the fact that we, like many other countries, are very wasteful consumers.  Even still, psychologically, we have not yet as a nation faced up to the fact that there is a serious problem in the world.  It is not of crisis proportions if everybody keeps their heads and acts sensibly both internally in each country and internationally.</P>
      <P>We have to face the fact that oil is simply not available in the quantities that we would like it and that we will have some shortages.  If some people are temporarily short, that is an unfortunate fact of life that we must get used to.  In virtually every speech I made about energy since I became responsible for energy I harped time and again about the vulnerability of this country in regard to imported oil and the need to adapt our way of thinking and our way of life to the fact that oil will not be permanently available to the extent that we and the rest of the world would like it, in the relatively short term as well as in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are criticised apparently for not foreseeing and taking action to forestall the limited shortages we have had in the last month or six weeks.  Everybody knows, except perhaps those who take part in debates trying to score political points, that this problem was caused by the serious political upheaval in Iran. One could see a problem looming up in Iran for several months before it finally exploded; but even if one were to foretell for example that the Shah's Government was going to fall, what could we have <Col N="328" /> done at that stage other than in a very limited and temporary way?  In relation to foretelling six months ago that the Shah of Iran would fall, if we did not foresee it we were in rather good company. The CIA, regarded as one of the premier intelligence organisations in the world&mdash;at least they were in that category although I do not know how they rate nowadays&mdash;are reputed to have advised the President of the United States almost up to the last day that the Shah was virtually impregnable.  The former Foreign Secretary of Britain, Dr. David Owen, up to a very late stage in the day made speeches on behalf of Britain saying how important and necessary it was that the Shah be supported because they could see him being there indefinitely.</P>
    <P>This sudden upheaval took the world by surprise, to say the least of it, and naturally the consequences which flowed from it in terms of oil took the world by surprise.  I make it clear here and now that even if the problems that exist in Iran in terms of production were to cease overnight&mdash;unhappily they will not&mdash;we are still facing a very uncertain future in regard to oil supplies.  It has been suggested that because Iran is now back at about half its previous exporting capacity the problem should not be serious now.  Unfortunately at the time that Iran came back to about 50 per cent of its previous level of exports, Saudi Arabia was cutting back its increased production by approximately the same amount and the result is that oil is every bit as scarce now as it was a month or two ago and this is likely to continue for the remainder of this year.</P>
    <P>I do not foresee major problems for us in the summer, although we will continue to have some problems in regard to petrol, but I can foresee that we will have quite serious problems next winter if we do not knuckle down to, first of all, a psychological acceptance of the fact that these are the facts of life and that we cannot continue to dissipate oil and oil products in the way we have been and in the way we are doing every day.  I travel the road between Limerick and Dublin very regularly and I have never seen heavier traffic on that road than I have <Col N="329" /> seen in recent weeks, I know this city and Limerick city well and I have never seen heavier traffic in either of them than I have in the last few weeks.  This is in a country which should by now know that we have a shortfall in oil supply, that we have problems in relation to gas diesel oil, which have been overcome with some hardship to some people by the order I made.  Obviously, I cannot make a similar order in relation to petrol, because one cannot categorise people in the same way.</P>
    <P>We are facing a situation for which some people suggest rationing.  I do not go along with that frame of mind.  It is a blunt instrument, a crude and unnecessarily severe way of dealing with what should be a limited problem.  Petrol is being bought at present at a rate that is considerably in excess of necessary usage.  These queues, I am sorry to learn, have started to reappear, in Dublin at any rate, within the last few days.  The oil companies suggest that they are to a great extent caused by psychological factors.  I am sure that is right. Nonetheless it is a fact of life and it means that petrol is being taken out of the system.  This psychological move is creating a shortage where there would not otherwise be a shortage.  This is something I regret very much.  The country as a whole will have to realise that if we all go on in this way we will have unpleasant consequences and that is something that I, and I am sure the great majority, do not want to see.</P>
    <P>So far as gas diesel oil is concerned, I made an order some weeks ago which I think has had the effect of rectifying the problem except for odd isolated incidents. We get an odd complaint still that there are individuals who have temporary difficulty in getting supply even though they are in the priority category and should be able to get supplies.  I regret this but they are not widespread or major problems.  We have had, in effect, to rule out the great majority of deliveries of diesel for home heating but, on my instructions, my Department have been very liberal in giving exemptions for people who suffer any form of hardship, whether through illness, age or for any other genuine reason.  I have also made it clear that oil is to be made <Col N="330" /> available to blocks of flats where there is no other means of heating.</P>
    <P>Unhappily, the problems in relation to petrol are not as easily soluble as the problems were in relation to gas diesel oil.  The spread of users is different and it is not possible to categorise them in the same way.  There are various alternatives if one wanted to stop short of full rationing. We could consider measures that are being implemented or being considered by other countries such as prohibiting the use of certain cars on certain days or prohibiting the owners of cars with odd numbers from buying petrol on days with even numbers and <i>vice versa.</i>  Such measures are being considered and have been partly implemented in certain countries and if we had to think in terms of trying to control petrol usage I think we would operate on those lines before resorting to full rationing. That is very unpleasant and difficult and would have quite serious consequences for the economy, particularly in relation to tourism.</P>
    <P>The outlook in the longer term&mdash;and we should be blunt about it in this House&mdash;is not good and the Irish people as a whole will have to adjust their thinking psychologically to this kind of situation. The present difficulties are not of our making.  We are a small country.  We are manfully seeking to cope with the problem that is entirely external so far as we are concerned but which has potentially quite serious consequences for us.</P>
    <P>One topic that was mentioned in the debate, particularly by Deputy Kelly, was the question of prices.  I hope I do not paraphrase the Deputy incorrectly and I am sure he will correct me if I do.  I was not in the House last night for the debate because I had an official engagement but from reading his speech today from the unrevised transcript it appeared he was strongly of the opinion that we should use the price mechanism in order to solve the supply situation.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that I could use the price mechanism to solve our supply situation.  I could flood this country in petrol and diesel oil tomorrow until we were swimming in the stuff if I forgot about the consumer interest and let it rip so far as prices are concerned.  However, <Col N="331" /> I have different responsibilities in my Ministry.  The Government have a number of apparently conflicting responsibilities in the sense that they and I have a duty to look after the consumer as best we can consistent with our efforts to keep supply at a reasonable level.</P>
    <P>There is one country in Europe that has no difficulty in terms of supply, namely, Germany.  They have no price control of any kind and anybody is free to sell any form of oil product at any price he wishes.  As a result there is no scarcity of any kind in Germany and the same situation applies in Switzerland, I think.  Germany is a country that perhaps can afford to follow that policy. Ireland is not.  We cannot afford to do that.  If I were to let prices rip to the German level tomorrow morning it would cost this country an extra £100 million a year in the deficit on our balance of payments.  We cannot afford that kind of situation.  We have got to solve our problems other than by the lazy easy way that affluent countries can afford.  We have got to be fair to the Irish consumer, and to the suppliers and we must try to keep our supplies at a reasonable level.  We have got to remind them&mdash;even though some people think they should never be reminded of this&mdash;that they have a duty to this country to look after it and to meet its reasonable needs.  They might well be reminded that for very many years, back to the time when we got our independence, they have had a free run here.  I am sure the profits made here during the decades are not insubstantial. Any major company that has a responsible attitude will have to learn to cope with times of difficulty.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say a great deal more than I have said on the question of prices.  Already we have had two price increases this year and we will certainly have more.  In fact, I think we will have several more.  Only today, I saw an application to the National Prices Commission for an increase from one major oil company in addition to the increases already granted.  The size of it almost winded me.  The commission will <Col N="332" /> proceed to examine the application and the question of my making a decision on it will not arise until I get their recommendation. We must face the fact that we will have many more price increases, perhaps several this year alone, depending on what OPEC do in June and what happens in the second half of the year.  Even with substantial increases, I still have no guarantee that we will have total adequacy of supply for our exceptionally high and growing demand. I cannot still guarantee that.  I could do it if I repealed all prices legislation and orders, but I am not prepared to do that.  I must think of the national interest and the consumers' interest.</P>
    <P>Without going into any detail I want to give an indication in broad terms&mdash;I must keep it in broad terms lest I breach any information that I have received confidentially in the course of price applications&mdash;of some of the problems we face in relation to prices.  Most of the oil companies selling in Ireland, or their small Irish subsidiaries, tell me that they are incurring losses.  A representative of one company said they are incurring a substantial loss.  I do not doubt it on the figures he gave me.  I examined in some detail the price at which he is buying the product from his parent company.  He has no say in it at all.  He is simply sent a tanker-load of the product and an invoice and he has no say in what the price will be.</P>
    <P>I got some of my staff to examine in detail the level of that price and how it was made up, and even though that company have been losing in the past three or four months a relatively substantial amount of money in Ireland, nevertheless the world-wide conglomerate of which the Irish subsidiary are an insignificant part are still making substantial profits on their oil sales to Ireland, and the substantial profit they are making on oil sales to Ireland far outweigh the loss which they are incurring at their retail distribution end here.</P>
    <P>I am afraid this is something one cannot in all conscience disregard.  I cannot say when a representative of that company comes to me looking for a price increase that I will simply and solely look only at the accounts of the Irish subsidiary. <Col N="333" /> I feel in duty bound to go back along the line and, in going back along the line, I have seen&mdash;I cannot give the details of how I have seen it because it might give away too much information&mdash;and my staff have checked it, that the price at which that oil is being charged to Ireland is so high that it is giving a very substantial profit to the supplying company that far outweighs any loss they might incur at the distribution level.</P>
    <P>Can I in conscience disregard that?  I do not think I can, and this is one of the difficulties we and every country faces when dealing with multinational oil companies. We have had a situation here that although most of the companies have genuinely done their best, some of them are perhaps less enthusiastic to try to meet current demand, and one of them which had 5 per cent of the market here let us down entirely.  For weeks on end we had not anything coming from them.  If we did not have that situation of one company letting us down entirely, I think the others would have been able to manage relatively satisfactorily without giving us the sort of consequences we have had.</P>
    <P>A country like us in many ways, which has had that difficulty and which has had substantial price problems, is New Zealand.  The New Zealanders have taken the view that they cannot pay the kind of prices being asked for, and there is a shortage of petrol in New Zealand.  I admire them for the stand they have taken.  Of course they are much less vulnerable than we are.  They do not use fuel oil at all because they have tremendous hydro electricity reserves, lots of spare gas, and they do not use home heating to the same extent we do.  Nevertheless one admires their refusal to pay what they regard as an exorbitant price.  They have had to put up with some hardship as a result.  I am afraid we must face the fact that we may have to put up with some hardship because we cannot simply take the easy way out that rich countries can.</P>
    <P>I referred before to what I see as a vital need for a national oil corporation here.  It has taken a long time to get this <Col N="334" /> off the ground.  I started work on it last year, but it is a major undertaking in legislative and administrative terms, and while progress has been made I cannot guarantee that the legislation will be enacted within a few months.  Indeed I cannot see it being enacted before Christmas at the earliest, and possibly even a bit later.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this with my Government colleagues.  I told them about how important it is for us, particularly facing next winter when we should be in a position to have some standby reserves of our own, independent of the oil companies operating here.  I have asked my colleagues to agree, which they have done, to my forming a limited company under the Companies Act to act as a sort of precursor to the proposed statutory oil corporation and whose powers during the three or six months of their existence will be confined mainly to purchasing oil and arranging for its distribution, and if it is crude, arranging to have it refined and made available for the Irish market.</P>
    <P>However, I want to make it clear that the proposed national oil corporation or their precursor whose formation is now in train, will not solve our problems in the short term.  They will only alleviate our possible problems next winter and next year in a relatively marginal way.  A company like that must be got off the ground and staff must be recruited.  My great regret is that this was not done years ago.  My amazement is that it was not done immediately after the 1973 oil crisis.  As far as I can see, apart from Luxembourg, this is the only country in the EEC that does not have an oil corporation of this kind.  They are invaluable to many of the countries which have them.</P>
    <P>Last night, Deputy Kelly was very disparaging about this proposal.  With the sort of inferiority complex Fine Gael have about this country, he felt such a corporation could not succeed, that we did not have people who knew anything about oil&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is the only person who does not know anything about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Col N="335" />
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>One sees this inferiority complex being continually repeated by him and his colleagues.  I have every confidence that a national oil corporation can be a success here as it has been elsewhere.  Last night Deputy Kelly gave a list of two or three national oil companies which last year had losses. As always, he was selective in his quotation. He did not make any reference to those that made substantial profits and thereby strengthened their respective countries by their strong trading position in the oil world.</P>
      <P>It will take us quite a time to build up to the kind of strength we should like or that would even approach that of similar corporation in other countries, but we have got to start this necessary task as soon as possible, and the sooner the better. That is why I decided to form the limited company to which I have referred, as a temporary measure which will be dissolved in time and their assets and liabilities taken over by a statutory national oil corporation when the legislation has been passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In the long term I can see a national oil corporation being of considerable assistance here, but it would be unrealistic for anybody to think that such a corporation will become the major oil distributor here in a short time.  It is quite possible that their contribution could be as low as 5 or 10 per cent of our needs for several years.  One of the dangers I see in forming the corporation is that it may give the multinational oil companies the idea that we are taking them off the hook, that we are relieving them of their responsibility.  That is not so. The multinationals operate in nearly every other western European country side by side with the national oil corporations. Here the multinational companies have had a free run in the past 50 years and they have obligations to their consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are the fastest growing market for oil in Europe.  We have considerable growth and I can see this national oil corporation taking up a lot of that growth as it arises, but this does not lessen the obligations of the multinational oil companies in any way.  This is a matter about which there has been a great <Col N="336" /> deal of talk and a half an hour does not give one time to review all the aspects of it that one would wish to.  We have problems but we, the Irish people, are making what could be a relatively minor problem which we could easily cope with into a serious one which will cause great damage to the economy and to the life of the nation if we continue to act irresponsibly in the way we have been doing.  I do not know if pleas of this kind fall on deaf ears.  Many pleas I made in relation to oil in the last 12 months have fallen on deaf ears.  I hope there is realisation of the fact that we have difficulties and that we will have to cut our cloth accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last 30 minutes we have had a very depressing speech from the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  He has outlined the difficulties and has at last admitted that there are problems.  While the Minister said he has sounded warnings of danger in the past 12 months the fact is that they have not been successful and I doubt very much if he has sounded them to the extent he gives us to understand tonight.</P>
      <P>Less than five weeks ago I recall reading in a newspaper that the Energy Secretary in the UK, Mr. Benn, was very concerned about the energy problems in his country, a country that is 85 per cent self-sufficient in oil.  In the same issue of the newspaper the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy stated that there was no reason for any concern in this country.  That from a Minister in a country which is nil self-sufficient in oil supplies is something that baffled me then and, having listened to the Minister tonight, baffles me more now.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that 9.8 per cent more petrol was sold this year so far than was sold in 1978.  That may be so. He puts it down to increased economic activity.  That is absolutely irrelevant. The fact is that even that increased consumption does not meet current demand and it is demand we must go on.  If supplies do not meet demand there is a shortage, and that is what we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, is in the House.  I was not <Col N="337" /> present last night but I read his speech. He gave the impression that there was no great shortage.  This morning I had the privilege of driving through some of the Minister of State's constituency and found very long queues on the main Belfast road.  Indeed in one case, in Upper Drumcondra, there was a double line of cars blocking the main Dublin-Belfast road.  This is because of a shortage, which may be a crisis or a problem, we do not know which.  However, going into semantics or definitions of words at this stage is nonsensical, because if one is waiting in a car for an hour to get up to a petrol pump that is the reality and that means there is a shortage.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in a very sombre, ominous speech, leading us into the valley of despondency, that he cannot see any immediate solution to the problem and that in fact in the long term we will still have problems because of the energy shortage.  The Minister&mdash;and I am grateful for it&mdash;has moved ground on this issue.  Up to recently the Minister and the Government would not even admit that there was a problem.  How can one approach a solution to a problem if one does not admit the problem exists? It is one of the prerequisites for a solution. As a result of the failure of the Government to admit the problem we have had an appalling and deplorable indifference by the Government to the grave situation that now confronts us.</P>
    <P>This problem was highly predictable not a year or nine months ago but three or four months ago.  From the beginning of this year until recently the Minister had not admitted that a problem exists even though as far back as last January oil stocks&mdash;and I understand we normally keep 90 days' supply&mdash;fell by 20 days.  That is my information.  There was a repetition of this in February.  That was three months ago.  Yet we are told that nobody knew there was a problem until March.  The Minister should have known that this was going on and should have sounded his sombre warnings and taken action, but he failed to do so. When other people pointed out that there might be a problem confronting us in the short term the Minister gave figures which conflicted greatly with the figures given by people in the trade. <Col N="338" /> There was confusion, chaos and panic buying as a result of the grave degree of uncertainty which took hold of the community at large.</P>
    <P>The Minister might be right in saying that a mile long queue of cars this morning is a psychological reaction by people in a chaotic or uncertain state of mind. However, the Minister must bear some responsibility for that reaction because, through the initial inactivity and the later confusion caused by conflicting figures given by him and his Department, he has caused this kind of situation.  As the situation got worse the Minister had to admit that there was a problem, but then his reaction was that the companies were hoarding oil.  He was pointing the finger of accusation at them.  They were hoarding it in the hope of a rise in price. We now know that this took place to a very minor degree.  There was no major hoarding but a very genuine degree of shortage of different types and grades of oil.  The accusation of hoarding and monopolies did not play the major part in the situation that the Minister would lead the people to believe it did.  The net result of this is that the Minister, as he has done tonight, has faced the House squarely and stated that there are problems of supply and that they will continue.  When he did take action he took it along specific lines and tried to ensure that areas of priority got supplies.</P>
    <P>But in the overall context the Minister is still pointing an accusing finger at the people.  Indeed, he strongly implied that in the case of petrol hundreds of thousands, and possibly millions of gallons were being wasted by the people.  That is a very serious allegation to make.  But the Minister and his Government are to a large degree responsible because some 20 or 21 months ago in that now infamous manifesto the people were told that car tax would be abolished and it was abolished; let us give full credit where credit is due.  But in 1979 the equivalent of the amount written off in car tax was taken back in the form of partial withdrawal of food subsidies.  The end result of the abolition of car tax was that we had in excess of 100,000 new cars on the road in 1978 resulting in extra purchase of imported oil and possibly, <Col N="339" /> by the law of averages, extra wastage of petrol.  So the Minister, even though he points the finger at the people and implies strongly that they are wasting petrol as he has done tonight, must bear some responsibility for that fact.  The petrol situation, as the Minister said, will get worse.  The admission by the Minister tonight that the national corporation may relieve the problem partially but will not solve the problem is quite right.  What I would like to ask at this stage is what is being done now to conserve this precious energy, which is becoming scarcer and scarcer, in order to ensure that our economy is not held up to ransom by so-called unscrupulous monopolies of oil companies?</P>
    <P>On the question of tourism, for example, I have here in front of me a note from my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, who, because of illness, is unable to be here to speak on this motion.  He tells me that at Shannon Airport the Aer Rianta station has no petrol at the moment which means that tourists coming in and leasing cars for the duration of their vacation cannot get petrol.  This is a very serious matter particularly at a major airport.  That is the kind of thing that the Minister should be looking at.  On the question of tourism in general I expected the Minister to give us some indication tonight of what plans he had to ensure that this major industry will not fall flat on its face this year.  At the moment, due to other circumstances this industry is literally on its knees.  I will not go into that area now but the Minister is quite well aware of what I am referring to.  On top of that the blatant inactivity by the Minister and the lack of any idea of what might be done to relieve the situation is obvious.  No new ideas have been forthcoming tonight.</P>
    <P>On the question of diesel oil there are very definite areas which are not being served with adequate supplies of diesel even for basic essential work like farming. I am told indeed that in north County Dublin there is a grave shortage of diesel among the farming community.</P>
    <P>There is one other area which is causing grave concern at the moment and the <Col N="340" /> Minister is aware of it.  I have in my possession a letter dated 9 May, which I received legitimately, the original of which the Minister was in receipt of today. It is from the Irish Overseas Transport Association.  These people represent the major portion of road hauliers who are in the export business and operate on the Continent.  I wish to quote two or three paragraphs from this letter which will bear out exactly what I am talking about.  The Minister referred to the question of the equitable distribution of diesel oil and he said that the situation in regard to this was under control, that the problem was practically solved except in minor areas here and there.  Road haulage is a very important area.  It impinges on industry, particularly manufacturing industry, and on farming. Unless one can shift goods after having manufactured them or shift produce after having reaped the harvest the whole economy grinds to a halt.  The IOTA have written to the Minister saying:</P>
    <P>Although statements were made in the Dáil to the effect that there was no crisis it must be very evident to you that this is not an exact assessment of the situation.  Members of this association who are responsible for the haulage overseas of Irish exports, in particular fresh and frozen meat, have trucks lying idle and are unable to get sufficient fuel to move.  In a previous statement by you transport was included in the category of essential services and we must ask you to implement this assurance by issuing instructions that supplies should be delivered by the oil companies to points from which our members may draw their requirements.</P>
    <P>Further down it is stated:</P>
    <P>One of our members has 16 loads of exports for overseas haulage this week and he has no diesel in his storage tanks.  We are now advised that Irish hauliers are finding it difficult to obtain supplies going through England.</P>
    <P>This surely is a damning indictment of the Minister for his failure to ensure that this kind of service, which is absolutely essential to our economy, is kept moving. <Col N="341" /> That is just one letter.  The Minister said that he had letters of complaint from areas now and again but this surely is a responsible body of people who are working in a very sensitive area dealing in fresh and frozen meat and unless they can be supplied a large area of our economy, agriculture, could be in trouble.</P>
    <P>On the question of domestic heating, while the Minister may have made every effort to ensure supplies where oil is essential, for example in the case of hospitals, old people's homes and so on, it is now well known that this system of distribution is open to terrible abuse and that because of this people for whom some of this oil was intended are not getting supplies.  The end result of all this is that the Department expect the companies to bear the odium of deciding who is and who is not a compassionate case.  This is an unfortunate situation and the most unfortunate aspect of it is that at the end of the line we have helpless people suffering because they do not know where to turn.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated tonight that there was one company who let the country down but he did not name the company.  I have no intention of naming them but he should have qualified that statement. The company in question were not in a position to supply this country simply because the source of the major volume of their product was Iran, which dried up over a period due to political instability. This kind of allegation against a company is misleading and unfair.  The Minister, in saying this, is trying to convince the people that he is a tough man taking on the oil companies.  We saw what happened three weeks ago when he came back from official business abroad to take on the oil companies, as the press said.  The exercise ended up in the Minister approving a price increase, which could have been done without all the ballyhoo and the impression given that he was a tough man.  He knew that a price increase was imminent and at the end of the day he came out blood spattered having had to approve a price increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement tonight was, as he said, blunt but it came slightly late. <Col N="342" /> It was blunt in the sense that he told us that he has now a further price application on his desk from the National Prices Commission which in due course will be processed.  He repeated in his statement tonight that we will probably end up with several other price increases this year.  This is very straight, blunt talk but it is about time the country were given the facts.  Tonight's speech is a far cry from the Minister's stand a few weeks ago when he denied that there was even a problem, when he said there was no crisis.</P>
    <P>With regard to consumers the Minister said that he could flood the country in oil if he wished provided he paid the price and ultimately the consumers paid a vastly escalating price. Nobody can deny that the Minister is not capable of doing that but, as he said, he has a responsibility to consumers.  As Deputy Kelly said one way in which to conserve this very precious resource is through conservation.  The abolition of car tax had the very opposite effect when we had over-usage of this precious resource.  What has the Minister in mind besides the control of prices on behalf of consumers?</P>
    <P>There are many areas of conservation the Minister might get himself involved in to ensure some kind of conservation of this resource.  There is, for example, energy labelling, which they have elsewhere.  This would demand that equipment would be labelled showing consumption of energy but this has not been done.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing and insulation in housing a very practical approach would have been for the Minister to do something about encouraging people to instal insulation in their homes to conserve heating oil.  What is happening? The Government are demanding a VAT rating of 10 per cent on insulation.  That is in direct contrast to what is happening across the water where not only is insulation free of VAT but a grant is given for the installation of insulating material. If the Minister is serious about looking after the consumer and ensuring that he pays the minimum price for this product, apart from the control of price at the point of sale of oil, petrol and diesel, <Col N="343" /> there are other areas to which he could give some attention with, hopefully, a favourable result for the consumer.</P>
    <P>We now have a major problem on our hands, which has become a very urgent one.  It is not a psychological problem, as the Minister might suggest because there are people who must have a supply of petrol or diesel for their business.  A few weeks ago I recall the Minister of State calling people who topped up their tanks criminals.  I can visualise circumstances in which the topping up of a tank could be a criminal act by a consumer.  People are so uncertain about the future, because of the lack of information, the unrealistic approach and a failure to admit that there is a problem by the Government, that they are topping up their tanks, while there are queues all over the country and petrol stations are open for an hour and closed for five or six hours and no petrol stations open at weekends.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this is election year and that we will be facing elections in a month's time.  I appreciate the political reality of the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party.  I believe, notwithstanding that, that at this time strong, real action must be taken and the sooner it is taken the better.  I hazard a guess that the Minister, having issued his ominous warnings about the future is getting ready the road to really put the boot in on 8 June after the elections are over.</P>

      <P>I would like to praise the Minister and the Department in relation to the stand they have taken particularly in relation to the oil companies.  I was surprised to hear Deputy O'Toole say tonight that we were the only country with an oil shortage and petrol queues.  I read in yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i> that somebody in California pulled a gun on the other people in a petrol queue, and that yet another person had his dinner while he was waiting.  We have not reached that stage yet.  It warms the cockles of my heart to see, in spite of the Opposition's lack of confidence in us as a country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>That we can stand up and say we are going to do something and it is typical of the Minister and the Department to say that we cannot do this in isolation.  We now have a very important arena, the EEC, which should have a common energy policy.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed to hear Deputy Kelly and Deputy O'Toole defending the multinational oil companies.  A group of these companies has made more money in one year than all the OPEC countries. I do not understand how anybody could defend a group who are exploiting a commodity which is so vital to our economy.  I would like to see within the national oil corporation a country to country exchange of oil because this is very essential.  Profits should not be made at the expense of lives.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to conservation. South Tipperary County Council brought in experts to see how best they could conserve energy.  They have forecast how much they can save in a certain period.  Other county councils should follow their example.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>A common energy policy within the Community must assist the processing of any deposits discovered in any member state.  The EEC can no longer stand in isolation and make their own arrangements.  It is time they came together to defend the right of the Community.  With a consumer body of 280 million people they have the power, the right and the goodwill to deal with the oil producing countries.  This will be done in the very near future.  It will be part of our policy in the EEC elections to ensure that this comprehensive, common policy will come about in the EEC.  The Common Market is about people and resources for the common good.  That is essentially the policy we want to implement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the national oil corporation will be unanimously approved by Deputies, who should have a responsible attitude <Col N="345" /> to our future energy needs, and that alternative energy sources will be investigated fully.  I hope too that people like Deputy Kelly and Deputy O'Toole will bear the national interest in mind at this stage and not try to cause people to panic buy by the kind of statements they have been making over the past few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very tame Minister here this evening.  He has been a very muted man compared with the kind of headlines he was reaching for at the beginning of April.  I noticed in the course of his speech&mdash;I agreed with a great deal of it&mdash;that there was not a word about how the trouble at the end of March and the beginning of April had been caused by concealment or misrepresentation of oil stocks.  That was a major part of the front which was put up by the Minister and the Government at that time.  The wicked multinationals were telling lies about their stocks until the Sherlock Holmes in the Department took out his dip-stick and found that the stocks were greater than they said.  The Minister had to climb down two nights ago when, in common justice, he had to admit they had been right all along and he was looking in the wrong tank.  There was no reason at any time for him not to be absolutely clear about the level of the stocks because there are customs officials there every single day reporting for excise purposes on the levels of stocks and various grades.</P>
      <P>There was not a word today about the companies trying to get higher prices by squeezing supplies.  That was another cheap headlines he got and allowed others to get for him.  There was not a word today about people needlessly topping up.  I noticed the Minister allowed Deputy O'Toole to get away with this.</P>

      <P>There was not a word this evening about how there was no real scarcity at all, that it was all an invention. These are themes which, on the odd occasion the Minister was in the country in March and April&mdash;and they were not too often&mdash;came easily to him, but he <Col N="346" /> was a very quiet man this evening.  It was very easy to talk to him this evening. He produced long-term assessments of our energy situation which, as Deputy O'Toole said, were sombre and depressing. I am sorry to say I have to agree with him.  The outlook is sombre and depressing.  I do not want to say anything which would make it appear that I want to devalue the warning he gave.  I wish he had restricted himself all along to giving these warnings instead of appearing to be taking on people who were only laughing at him.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of his speech the Minister adverted for the first time to what had been said here yesterday evening when he said that I had been very anxious to use the price mechanism as a means of flooding the country with oil and diesel.  I am not anxious to throw away money any more than the Minister is.  If I were in the Minister's job I would have to think, as he does, about the balance of payments, the revenue, the impact on the economy, taking money out of the country, taking so much out of our economy and putting it into the economy of the Persian Gulf and so on.</P>
      <P>These are things he had to think of but he did not admit that we still have the cheapest petrol in Europe.  It is evident to anyone who stands at Donnybrook Bridge in the morning, or any other bridge or main road coming into the city, what little respect people have for petrol or what it costs.  As the Minister said people are grossly wasteful in the way they use petrol and every form of energy.  You do not waste anything you think is expensive.  That is an axiom that could be put in a child's book of economics for six or eight year olds.  Something a man appreciates as being expensive, as taking a large sum out of his earnings, he does not waste. He takes very good care not to waste it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see the way the Irish use their cars, heat their homes and use energy of all descriptions.  We see the way builders build and sell houses called detached, but you would scarcely put a couple of cats between them.  They are only detached in name.  Cats would scrape each other if they passed between these so-called detached houses which are so <Col N="347" /> grossly wasteful in energy. Since we are speaking bluntly this evening, it is only fair to say that energy and sources of energy are regarded as cheap in this country. I do not care how much whinging there is about £1 for a gallon of petrol and so forth, the Irish people, from the way they behave, still think it is cheap. If they thought it was dear they would not behave as they do.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right in calling them wasteful, as he did this evening, but I do not think one can blow hot and cold. One might observe people being grossly prodigal in the way they use petrol and oil which has to be hauled 2,000 miles, refined, retailed, distributed, docketed and invoiced before the Deputy can put it in his car and zoom around South Tip-perary, and he is still only charged £1 for a gallon. You barely can buy a large whiskey for that money these days. I do not want to labour this point too much, but we have the cheapest petrol and oil in Europe. I respect the Minister's anxiety not to push up the CPI and I respect genuinely what he said this evening about trying to offer some opposition to people who are making exorbitant demands. But we are not in the situation that we can pawn the stocks. If you find yourself with a pistol held to your head by an oil company you cast around even more desperately for some alternative source of supply. If the oil-supplying countries or the oil companies give themselves a bad name in this part of the world they will pay dearly for it in time to come.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State opposite accused me last night and on a previous occasion-and the Minister supported him at Question Time the other day-of being the darling of the oil companies, or else he said that they were my darlings, I . forget which. It was one or the other or possibly both.  The oil companies and I were in a nice little inter-personal relationship. That kind of approach is all very well in a students' debating society or even in here, but on a national level such an approach is contemptible. I said last night and I repeat that I have no oil company shares. An old aunt of mine left me some about 20 years ago. I was a <Col N="348" /> student at the time and it was not long before I sold them. Since that day I have never had a half-penny's interest in an oil company. I have no friends, relations or neighbours in oil companies. To run a national policy on the grounds that there is a certain group of commercial interests which you can blackguard is the wrong way to do it, particularly when you are only covering up your inertia, lack of planning, lack of action, and lack of foresight.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the multinational conglomerates that the Minister was belabouring here this evening. What was Ferenka, which the Minister said he was so keen to keep in the country, but a multinational or an affiliate or subsidiary ofAKZO, one of the biggest multinationals in Europe? What is Mostek, whom he is so pleased to have got in here with their very advanced technology, but a multinational? What is Asahi?</P>

      <P>I have seven minutes left. What are these but multinationals? What is Asahi in Deputy O'Toole's constituency but a multinational? Let us not be sleveen about it, we are damned glad to have them here. If they were not here there would be not 100,000 but 200,000 unemployed in the country. The IDA, to whom we are always throwing bouquets, have said in their last report that the multinational corporations here are better from the point of view of our exports situation simply because they are multinationals, because they have affiliates in other countries and inter-affiliate trading relations which makes it easier for them to sell their products abroad. I care nothing for any company, national, multinational or anything else, except to the extent that it will benefit the people whom  we  are  supposed  to  be representing here. I resent-not deeply because I do not take it seriously but I <Col N="349" /> must go through the motions of resenting-being called the darling of the multinationals or they being described as my darlings. I do not give a damn about them except to the extent that they can contribute to the wellbeing of this people. In justice also, they should not be immediatdiy blackguarded and lies should not be told about them to cover up the mistakes, failures and neglects of Ministers in Government.</P>
      <P>Only the other day I learned in regard to the telephone service that we are thinking now, because we cannot manage the industrial relations in our telephone service, that we might hive it off to the private sector. Of course, we have not checked that out with the POWU yet.</P>

      <P>We are. I beg your pardon, Sir. The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is right in doing his best to try to intensify the off-shore exploration. That is one of the things that have to be done here because of the energy corner we are in. He is trying to get foreign exploration firms to intensify their efforts here. He may be disarmingly modest, but does he think that his voice does not reach any further than the walls of this room? What will the corporation think about being invited to come in here to do off-shore exploration and at the same time knowing that they <Col N="350" /> will be under the eye of a Minister who has a neurosis about multinationals and about their possible profiteering and who will be anxious if he can, to squeeze the last whiff out of them? That is not literally true but the competitors we have will be very anxious to make those people believe that it is true.</P>
      <P>Deputy M. O'Leary said here last night that he was in favour of a national oil corporation. I am in favour of a national oil corporation, but one that will not be just a joke, that will have proper personnel, experts and consultants, people who know their business. There is no more complicated, complex, devious and difficult business in the world than the oil business. With the greatest respect for this couple of dozen officials in the Minister's Department, I say that not one of them qualifies as an expert in oil. The Minister's own commerical adviser who, he admitted here, has been frequently engaged in advising him on oil, knows absolutely nothing about oil. He has no experience in the oil business. That is no skin off his nose. That is nothing against him as a man or a commercial adviser. He has no experience in these matters. Where are we going to get the expertise?</P>

If that was a genuine, sincere admission that he has not got all the answers I will say no more about it, and I will assume in his favour that is the case. I will not make comments about a purely cosmetic operation. However, when we see the one really spectacular opportunity open to this country which <Col N="351" /> somebody sought to grasp with both hands, namely getting a slice for this country of an oilfield which is in a politically relatively stable area and within geographical reach of us-that is the Norwegian field-and when there is talk on foot that the Norwegians might make some of that field available to people other than themselves, when Irish national fishing waters and deals about fishing boats for Ireland are being talked about in the context of a possible exchange with that facility, I want to know why the national oil corporation are not going to get in on that. That is what a national oil corporation is for. But no, it is the 'Aran oil consortium, Aran Energy Limited, a private company in whom the Minister has a very minute shareholding, who are envisaged for the Norwegian field. That is a long day's work and I cannot do it justice in three minutes.</P>

I am amazed that not one word is said about that, that it appears, so far as I can see, to be a buying organisation and a distributing organisation without the expertise either to buy or to distribute. That is all that is envisaged for it. I am sorry to say, although I wish the Minister and his Department all the best in this difficult situation-and I will support them constructively-1 am not optimistic about the future of that.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Meat Processing Factory Closure.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought permission to raise on the Adjournment the serious matter of the closing down of the IMP meat processing factory in Leixlip for a limited period because the information I received from representatives of the workers is that on Friday last 450 people got one week's notice that the industry would be closed down for at least a month. I understand that 650 people are employed there and I need not stress that the laying off of 450 workers will cause a lot of hardship. I am raising this matter in the hope that the Minister for Agriculture can do something to keep this lay-off to a minimum. The Minister should use his influence with the management to see if the situation can be eased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that talks did not take place prior to the serving of the notice and for that reason it is possible that if talks were arranged something could be done. I know the workers concerned and they are not unreasonable people. They <Col N="355" /> do not want to cause trouble. I am also acquainted with those on the management side and they are reasonable people. I am sure both sides would be anxious to minimise the hardship involved. Discussions could take place with a view to, for instance, reducing the number and Finding other work for the remainder. Another suggestion is that those involved should take their holidays now. That would mean that the period off work before cattle become available again would be short.</P>
    <P>The immediate cause of the close down is the shortage of cattle. I am aware that at this time of the year there is always a shortage of cattle but for a long number of years there has not been any trouble in the industry or closures. The last time there was any difTiculty was in 1972 when staff were put on short time for a period. The arrangement then did not work out very satisfactorily. Everybody feels that the shortage of cattle is an artificial one that has been created by the crazy 2 per cent levy announced in the budget. Farmers rushed to avoid paying that levy, a natural reaction, and anything that was fit or near fit for sale was sold. The cattle that are left are in poor condition because of the hard and long winter and the fact that there is no fodder available. There is little grass to put condition on them and the anticipation is that cattle will be in short supply for some time to come.</P>
    <P>If the Minister moved quickly in relation to this problem some hardship could be relieved. We all have a responsibility to try to avoid hardship. In the long term there are other procedures that could be adopted in relation to the entire processing industry. One of the things that has been causing difTiculty is the MCAs not applying to certain processed products. I understand that that position has improved substantially due to the devaluation of the British Green £ by 5 per cent and the improvement in sterling and that the loss involved on the raw materials is : now less than it was. However, it still represents on a normal sized bullock a £5 difference and on cows a difference of £8 to £10.  It is still serious and there is still an element of instability there that <Col N="356" /> must be rectified. That can fluctuate and people cannot seriously go into further processing that is possible and necessary to keep people employed until some stability is brought into that sector. The only way that can be done is to rectify the MCA situation as a matter of urgency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of the future of the factory and I do not wish to go outside that matter. Another matter that has a bearing on this subject is the fact that there is no money in winter feeding. There is this seasonal supply situation. On at least three occasions I pressed very strongly in Brussels for a phased intervention price but I failed to get agreement. I am convinced that a special case could and should be made for Ireland and that this is the time to make such a case because of our very exceptional position in that the bulk of our beef is produced on grass and, consequently, is very seasonal. In addition there is no other country in Europe in which, there are the same number of sales from one place to another, where there are the same number of movements. Elsewhere cattle are produced and finished on the same farms. Our processing industry is extremely important. It provides much employment. The plant at Leixlip is not the only one processing in this country that will be in trouble in the very near future. Reading the Order Paper today I was interested to note a motion from a Fianna Fail Deputy calling on the Minister to initiate a livestock development programme for beef production. That Deputy, too, obviously sees the prospects that are in this area and realises the amount of employment that this type of industry can provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must do everything possible to bring about the provision of the extra raw material for processing by way of the dairy industry and by way of an expansion of that industry. Too much concern is expressed regarding the expansion of milk production. Our production represents only 4 per cent of the total supply in Europe. Therefore, we must be <Col N="357" /> concerned about our own position. There is an unhappy situation in the processing industry generally but the situation at Leixlip is most unfortunate. I note that the plant has been delisted for the processing of meat for the American forces in Europe and that is another reason for the closure. That meat is now being processed at Grand Canal Street. I understand it was a rough decision on the part of the Americans to make this change but it is something that can be rectified quickly. However, I am asking the Minister to rectify what he is in a position to rectify and thereby to minimise the hardship involved for the workers at Leixlip.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department's veterinary personnel at Irish Meat Packers, Leixlip, were informed a few days ago that the factory would be closing on Friday next for a period of four weeks or so. They were not told the precise reason for the closure and as of now I do not know what is the reason. The latest information I have-and this was up to 6 o'clock this evening-is that the closure will go ahead and will be for a period of four weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for Fisheries and Deputy Lawlor visited the factory this morning and had consultations with the management and the shop stewards. Whatever the reason for the closure it certainly cannot be blamed on the 2 per cent levy. Slaughter cattle are always relatively scarce at this time of the year and this year is no exception. It appears that the late spring and the scarcity of grass, by delaying the finishing of cattle has made the seasonal scarcity even more noticeable than usual. The current very high prices for cattle reflect that shortage to some extent.  I can only assume that the factory management <Col N="358" /> have taken the view that it is economic in the short-term to continue in operation when the supply of cattle is less than the management would like to handle and when cattle prices are higher than they would wish them to be. If this is their view there is nothing that either the Minister or I can do about it, however much we may deplore it.</P>
    <P>It is essential to realise that this is a temporary problem. With an improvement in the weather the supply position will ease considerably in the coming weeks and factories should be able to get the level of supplies needed for profitable operation. It is not reasonable to suggest that there is a crisis in this area when all that is involved is the short-term closure of one meat factory. We must realise that the cattle that would otherwise be slaughtered there will maintain employment at other plants. It is not helpful either to suggest that jobs are at risk, The closure is for a few weeks at most.</P>

The effects of the h^avy cow slaughterings of a few years ago are still noticeable. Among the Minister's priorities is the achievement of significant growth in this area but in the shorter term factories will have to get their additional supplies by way of more effective competition with the live export trade.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 176, 177 and 178 together.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the situation is as represented by the Deputy.  A small number of reports of difficulties in cashing Irish notes and cheques abroad have come to my notice.  These are being looked into.</P>
      <P>Imports and other transactions denominated in sterling at present cost somewhat more in terms of Irish currency but there would be corresponding gains in respect of exports.  Since December last forward cover has been available in respect of sterling transactions directly related to the movement of goods and services.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that the banks are charging a 35p transfer fee on each business transaction.  Since 2 April 1979 the Associated Banks, with the agreement of the Central Bank, have applied to Irish pound-sterling operations the charges normally applicable to foreign exchange business.  I am advised that similar charges are made by the banks in the North.  The actual charge in a particular instance would depend on the service rendered and the amount involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overdrafts on bank accounts in Northern Ireland and Britain would normally be denominated in sterling.  At present, <Col N="241" /> interest and repayments on such overdrawn accounts would cost more in terms of Irish currency because of the exchange difference.  The transfer of an account from a bank branch in Northern Ireland to a branch in the State would not affect the liability as expressed in Irish currency.  In this connection, I would point out that, under exchange control, Irish residents were required to close bank accounts in Northern Ireland and Britain and repatriate the proceeds by 18 March 1979 unless permission had been obtained from the Central Bank to retain the account.  Without such permission an account may not now be maintained with any bank or financial institution outside the State.</P>
    <P>Some problems were to be expected arising out of the discontinuance of the one-for-one exchange parity between the Irish pound and sterling.  I have no evidence that they are general or widespread and I am satisfied that they will disappear as people adjust to the new situation.</P>

      <P>(i) The qualifications for entry to the grade of technical inspector of taxes by way of open competition are set out in the appropriate regulations laid down by the Civil Service Commissioners. The qualifications for entry to the grade of technical inspector by way of transfer from the non-technical structure are as follows: In the event of suitable non-technical inspectors opting for transfer to the technical structure being less than the number of vacancies available to be filled from the structure the balance will be filled by the promotion of suitable higher tax officers who either have (a) three years established service in the higher tax officer grade and satisfactorily completed the period of probation or (b) five years established service of which not less than two have been in the higher tax officer grade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  Entry to the grade of non-technical inspector is by way of promotion of suitable higher tax officers who either have (a) five years established service in the higher tax officer grade and satisfactorily <Col N="246" /> completed the period of probation or (b) five years established service of which not less than three years have been in the higher tax officer grade.</P>
    <P>(iii)  (a) The technical inspector is given training over a period of some four years in the law and practice relating to the various taxes.  This training involves both courses in the inspectors' training school and on-the-job training in a tax district under the supervision of the district inspector.  During the period of training the inspector is required to undergo two departmental examinations, the preliminary examination and the commission examination.  The preliminary examination is in two parts, the first of which is taken six months after entry, with Part II being taken nine months after Part I.  The commission examination is in three parts.  Part I is taken 12 months after passing Part II of the Preliminary Examination, Part II 12 months after passing Part I (Commission) and Part III 12 months after passing Part II (Commission); (b) the non-technical inspector selected for work on the examination of accounts will already have received considerable experience and training in most aspects of income tax excluding the computation and taxation of profits arising to the self-employed. Before undertaking any work in connection with the examination of accounts of the self-employed he is given an intensive three months course in book-keeping and accounts and in the computation and taxation of the profits of self-employed.  He then commences work on the examination of accounts of self-employed under the supervision of the district inspector in the course of which he is given considerable on-the-job training.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The conditions governing the appointment and establishment of a technical inspector are set out in the appropriate conditions of service laid down by the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(v)  Under the terms of his conditions of service an inspector of taxes may be required to serve in any part of the State in which a tax office is located and to perform any duties assigned from time to time as appropriate to his position. Transfers of technical inspectors, other <Col N="247" /> than on promotion, are made in accordance with the exigencies of the service, due consideration being given, in so far as practicable, to personal circumstances, where made known.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he is <Col N="256" /> aware that insurance companies operate a limit of £10,000 in any one claim for third party property damage in most commercial insurances and the proposals, if any, to have these limitations changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that in this question the Deputy is referring to commercial vehicle insurances.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a limit of £10,000 in any one claim for third party property damage in commercial vehicle insurances is operated by some companies. In others a maximum as high as £100,000 applies without payment of additional premium while most companies will offer cover in excess of £10,000 and in some cases to a limit of £¼ million for additional premium.</P>
      <P>I cannot require insurers to quote for commercial vehicle third party property cover in excess of the statutory minimum of £1,000 laid down in the road traffic legislation but I would be surprised if in this highly competitive sector of the motor market any difficulty in obtaining cover in excess of £10,000 would arise.  It is important that policyholders are fully conversant with the indemnity conferred on them by the particular policies they hold and for most commercial vehicle owners I am sure this is the case.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Turf Development Act, 1953 (Regular Works Employees) Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1978, is not available in Statutory Instrument <Col N="257" /> form.  Because of its limited application the scheme was exempted by the Attorney General from the provisions of section 3 (1) of the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947.  As to the provisions of this scheme, the Deputy is aware that the scheme was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and is available for inspection. I would also refer the Deputy to my reply on the 15 February 1979 to a Dáil question on this matter by Deputy Tully in which I outlined the general terms of the scheme.</P>

The schemes in final form will be presented to the Oireachtas as soon as they have been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by Bord na Móna that their practice is to circulate all proposed amendments to the members of the superannuation scheme prior to their being submitted to me and to the Minister for the Public Service for approval.
