      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As already indicated, it is intended to hold the referenda on the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution (Adoption) Bill, <Col N="1686" /> 1978, and the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Election of Members of Seanad Éireann by Institutions of Higher Education) Bill, 1979, together on 5 July next.  This Bill proposes to assist voters at the referenda by making available to them a statement relating to the proposals which are the subject of the referenda and by providing for the printing of headings on the ballot papers to identify the proposals to which they refer.  It also proposes that the polls at the referenda be taken on the basis of counties and county boroughs instead of Dáil constituencies.</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides that a special card, containing the statement set out in the appendix to that section must be sent to every elector including postal voters.  A single card will cover both referenda. The statement will also be displayed in and in the precincts of polling stations and presiding officers will be authorised to assist blind, incapacitated and illiterate voters by reading out this statement to them, where necessary, and asking them whether they wish to vote in favour of or against the proposals and then marking the ballot papers in accordance with the voters' answers.  These arrangements are the same as those made in relation to the referenda on the Third and Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bills, 1968, the referendum on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1971, and the Fourth and Fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bills, 1972.</P>
    <P>Under existing law, the proposal which is the subject of a referendum must be stated on the ballot paper by citing, by its short title, the Bill containing the proposal for amendment of the Constitution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and the ballot paper may not contain any paraphrase or summary of the proposal.  The short titles of the Constitution Amendment Bills which are to be the subject of the forthcoming referenda contain an indication of the subject matter of the Bills.  This is the first time this has been done and it should help voters to identify the proposals on which they will be voting. However, the titles will not tell the voters what the Bills propose to do and I feel the House will agree that there should be <Col N="1687" /> a definite statutory arrangement for informing voters of these proposals.  The most convenient way of doing this is to include on the polling card to be issued to each voter a statement approved by the Oireachtas in relation to the proposals as has been done in relation to previous constitutional referenda.  A further step to aid voters in distinguishing between the ballot papers at the forthcoming referenda is proposed at section 3 of the Bill.  This section provides that a heading be printed on the front of each ballot paper indicating in large print the proposal to which the ballot paper relates.  This provision, along with the measures I have already mentioned, should ensure that voters will not be confused when they come to cast their votes at the referenda.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for the taking of the poll at the forthcoming referenda on the basis of counties and county boroughs instead of Dáil constituencies. This change will apply only to the forthcoming referenda and is being made because the referenda are to be held so soon after the European and local elections.  The polls at these elections are being organised on a county basis and it should greatly facilitate local returning officers at the referenda if they can simply repeat the arrangements they made such a short time earlier.  The polls at any future referenda will, of course, be held on the basis of Dáil constituencies.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It is a pity that the country is to be burdened with these referenda on 5 July, so shortly after the European Assembly elections and the local elections on 7 June.  I appreciate that the reason for having separate days for the elections is that people might be confused. However, I doubt that they would be confused because people are sufficiently educated and sufficiently intelligent to follow four ballot papers instead of two or five instead of three.  The first time that we ever had two national decisions taken on the same day was in 1937 when the people voted on the Constitution referendum, and in a general election. <Col N="1688" /> In 1945 the people voted on the election of the President and in the local elections on the same day.  That meant that in many rural and urban areas people had three ballot papers to deal with and by and large they dealt with them intelligently and efficiently.  It is amazing how well able the people are to handle and to deal with ballot papers.  I can recall a case 25 years ago when two candidates with the same Christian and surnames appeared on the same ballot paper.  It was thought that there would be utter confusion among the electorate, but when the election was over it was discovered that the people had used their votes for the man they had wanted to see elected.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I think it is a pity that we are to have the local elections and the European elections on 7 June and then, within a month, these two referenda. That is not to say that we do not regard the referenda, particularly the referendum on adoption, as matters of great urgency.  The same can be said, but to a lesser degree, about the referendum dealing with university representation in the Seanad.  When we were dealing with the European Assembly Bill in the House we were assured without reservation by the Minister for the Environment that it was extremely unlikely any other election would be held simultaneously with the European election.  We were given that assurance several times during that debate.  Indeed the Minister put it so strongly as to say it was nearly unthinkable. Suddenly there was a change of view about that and we are now to have two elections together, with which I do not disagree.</P>
      <P>There is not very much of a controversial nature in this Bill which is to provide the machinery for the holding of the referenda on 5 July.  I agree it is a good thing to have in this Bill a synopsis of each of the Bills which are the subject matter of the referenda.  Section 1 provides that the polling cards will be sent to postal voters and that they will contain a synopsis of the Bills.</P>

      <P>The Committee Stage is the time to raise matters of detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1689" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Bill puts a statutory obligation on the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to have these Bills made available in post offices throughout the country for free inspection there and put on sale there at 2½p.  I hope that Minister will be able to implement that statutory obligation imposed on him by this Bill and I hope the Minister for the Environment can tell us if there are alternative proposals in mind for implementing that obligation, which is also mentioned in the explanatory memorandum.  Two months ago if I had asked which proposals the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had for implementing such a provision I would have been asked by the Minister now in the House if I thought the postal strike would go on for ever.  However, in view of the turn of events meanwhile, there is not an assurance that the strike will have been settled by 5 July, though I could not help noticing this morning the absence of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs from a full turnout of Government members at the opening of business in the House. Let us hope he is engaged in what one might call a crash process to get that strike settled.  However, in the event of his not succeeding or not trying&mdash;he has not done very well to date&mdash;we should be told of the alternative procedures for discharging the statutory obligation I have referred to.</P>
      <P>We can deal with details on Committee Stage, but there is one matter of a general nature applying to all elections. It is the secrecy of the ballot.  Unfortunately, recently there has been some doubt as to the absolute secrecy of the ballot in all elections.  I am satisfied beyond doubt that there is absolute secrecy, not just considerable secrecy.  I do not want to be scoring points on the Minister but it is my duty to remind Deputies that in reply to a question recently the Minister said it is extremely difficult to ascertain how a person has voted but that it is possible.  He said that in case of a criminal offence the Garda might have to go through a very involved procedure in order to find out certain things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the Minister was wrong <Col N="1690" /> when he answered that question off the cuff.  It is not possible to find out how a person voted in an election, European or local, or in a referendum, and that should be shouted loud and clear and often in this House.  The procedure in the not so olden days was that a ballot paper had a number and the same number was on the ballot paper counterfoil.  The presiding officer wrote the voter's number on the counterfoil.  That meant that when a person got the voter's number from the register and then had access to the counterfoils of the ballot papers he could wade through 30,000 or 40,000 ballot papers to find out how a person had voted.  Somebody objected to that procedure and a High Court action was brought by a man named McMahon. The High Court held that the procedure violated the absolute secrecy of the ballot and accordingly declared and directed that the voter's register numbers no longer should appear on the ballot papers.  That is the situation now&mdash;the voters' numbers do not appear on the ballot papers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Since that, provided the rules are observed and that the presiding officer carries out the directions given to him, it is absolutely impossible for anybody to find out how a person voted whether there is a legal case arising out of it or not.  In view of the reply given to the parliamentary question and the doubts created thereby it is essential that the Minister should state clearly and without any doubt that the ballot is secret and that no person, official or unofficial, garda, judge, returning officer, Government Minister, politician or private individual can find out how a person votes.  That is fundamental to the democracy that has operated here so far. In practice it was never possible to find out how a person voted.  In theory it was possible, but it is not possible now even in theory.  Let us have this explained clearly and all doubts wiped away. There are people in this country who would be fearful that it could be found out how they voted and it is only right and fair to those people that that should <Col N="1691" /> be clarified now.  I thought it right to avail of this opportunity a week before the European Assembly elections and the local elections, and now a month before the referenda, to clarify that once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful, and I am sure the House is grateful, to Deputy Fitzpatrick in his role of assuring those thousands of Fianna Fáil voters that when they desert Fianna Fáil for the first time it will be in the total secrecy of a ballot and that in no way can their desertion&mdash;or perhaps their finding the true way&mdash;be discovered even in the Customs House or anywhere else.  It is a useful clarification that should be made because there is always the person you meet on canvass who tells you that they will get you in the end because they can open up the black boxes somewhere down in the basement of the Customs House and find out who voted in the postal vote or in such and such an area.</P>
      <P>This is enabling legislation and I do not propose to take up the time of the House.  The Minister is setting a good example simply by introducing the Bill and saying exactly what he proposes to do.</P>
      <P>It is right and proper that in this year, the International Year of the Child, he should at last see the right of adopted children declared a basic human right and that the Constitution is amended subsequently to ensure that adopted children have those rights that were denied to them in the past.  Everybody in this House has either direct or indirect contact with adopted children and with the parents of adopted children and knows exactly the importance of this legislation.  It is a good move and I congratulate the Minister present for moving quickly to have it copper-fastened in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other referendum is in relation to universities and I understand that my colleague, Deputy Horgan, will be talking about that.  Again, that is enabling legislation that will enable this House, the elected representatives of the people, to enact laws democratically without being <Col N="1692" /> hidebound by detailed provisions of a constitution from another age.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposals for the referenda, one can put the obvious question mark about how it is proposed to send out the cards and so forth to the electorate.  In fairness to the Minister present, that is not his problem departmentally.  However, in view of the nature of the two measures and in view of the fact that there will not in effect be any kind of party political campaign, and because it is important that each elector receives a printed card with the two proposals on it, in view of the unholy possibility that the postal dispute is still in operation on 5 July, I hope that the Minister has retained for himself some capacity to postpone these referenda until such time as there is a fully functioning postal service.  It would be a mistake if we proceeded on 5 July in the event of a continuing postal dispute or of interrupted and uneven postal services. I have scanned the Bill and I see no specific mention of the date 5 July. Perhaps the Minister will inform me and the House that he retains, by way of an administrative device, the capacity to postpone the day without interfering with this legislation.  That is essential, and I hope the Minister can address himself to that point.</P>
    <P>Secondly, what information campaign do the Government propose to undertake in relation to both these measures? Which Government Department will be responsible for it?  Both are non-contentious measures essentially as far as the political parties in the Dáil and also in the other House are concerned. Therefore, the kind of information that a political campaign normally generates by way of contesting parties informing the electorate is going to be absent. Perhaps the Minister would indicate which Government Department will be responsible for informing the public on both referenda.  What proposals, if any, exist at this stage?  As a follow-up to that, will the Minister indicate what the estimated cost of these referenda will be and if a provisional budget has been made for an information campaign?</P>
    <P>Committee Stage will give us ample room to deal with the procedures <Col N="1693" /> relating to the way in which the vote will be counted and all the other matters.  I will conclude Second Stage by saying that we welcome the response of the Minister.  I have some personal reservations about splitting the referenda from 7 June to a separate date, but I understand the logic of it and I can see why it has been done.  Anyhow, the decision has been made.  I hope to co-operate fully with the House in order to get this measure passed.  If the Minister has the information available perhaps he will reply to the questions I have raised.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions and for their appreciation of the fact that there is an urgency about getting this Bill through both Houses in order to hold the referenda on 5 July.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made the point that when we were debating the European Assembly Bill in the House I said that it would be extremely unlikely or probably would not happen that there would be more than one election on the date of the European Assembly elections. It is true that I did express that opinion, but I remind the Deputy that we were debating that Bill in the context of the European elections taking place in May 1978, which was the date set for those elections.  As we know now, those elections were postponed until later and now they clash with the date for our local elections at the end of five years. The Deputy was right in saying what he said, but he did not seem to remember that we were talking about the European Assembly elections being in May 1978 at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Minister said that the European people did not want any other elections on the same day to take away from the importance of the European one.  Perhaps I am wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not remember off the top of my head if I said that, but at the time, we were preparing for the May 1978 European elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the points made by Deputy Quinn about the date of these <Col N="1694" /> referenda, that is fixed by order which will come after the Bill has been signed by the President.  That will be done at that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The date is set by order and we consider that a suitable date for holding the referenda.  There is an urgency about the referenda, particularly the one on adoption.  If we do not hold the referenda in July they will probably have to wait until the autumn and we do not want that to happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It would very much depend on the odds.  With regard to the secrecy of the ballot, on which we had questions recently, what I was endeavouring to say, amidst interruptions at the end of Question Time then, was that the number on the electoral list no longer appears on the ballot paper. Some people seemed to misunderstand me&mdash;not Deputy Fitzpatrick&mdash;when I was talking about the serial number, the same as is on the counterfoil.  It is true to say that how a person voted would not and should not be traced.  But in the extreme it is just possible&mdash;that is the point I made&mdash;because there is the number on the counterfoil and on the ballot paper.  I am not trying to establish doubts in people's minds.  But it is not possible if everything is done in a regular manner. If there were irregularities it is just possible but it is not possible if the rules are adhered to.  That is the point I want to clarify.  It is quite true to say it is not possible because the rules will be adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1695" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): But surely a presiding officer should be sacked, and I think prosecuted, if he made it possible because he could make it possible only by putting the voter's number on the counterfoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course that should happen to any such presiding officer, but I say that if the rules are adhered to, it is not possible.  Therefore, there should be no doubt in people's minds in that respect.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick about the Bill being posted in post offices, I should say that that can still be done.  General post offices are the only ones which are closed; all the sub post offices are open and, out of the total number of post offices in the country, there are 80 closed at present.  Therefore it is quite possible and feasible for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to comply with that obligation.  Reverting to the postal strike, being an optimist, I hope it may be over by that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): When we mention the postal strike we are regarded as being mischievous and not being very relevant. As Deputy Quinn has said, there will not be anything like an election campaign either in support of or against these referenda.  Normally there would not have been a very high-powered campaign one way or the other because they are agreed measures.  But it is even more unlikely&mdash;following a long drawn out Euro election and local elections campaign&mdash;that it will be possible to get much enthusiasm worked up in regard to these referenda.  Also it is only right to say that these are very important Bills, particularly the adoption one to validate all adoptions that have taken place since <Col N="1697" /> adoption was introduced.  It is very important that there be a decent turn-out and I believe people will turn out in goodly numbers because they regard this as serious, provided they get due notification.  It is more important on this occasion that polling cards go out than ever before.  It might well be that, notwithstanding the importance of the matter, if this wretched strike has not ended, it would be a good thing to consider putting back the referenda, I will not say for long but until the strike is ended.  The point I am endeavouring to make is that polling cards will be more important in this election than in any other.</P>

      <P>I should like to say something on section 1 and about the appendix.  The idea, as a general proposition is that in a referendum the gist of the proposal to amend the Constitution should be explained as simply as it can be done, in a manner such as this Bill proposes.  That is an improvement on the situation that has obtained up to now.  I could find no objection to the form in which the two paraphrases of the two amending Bills are set down here.  The explanation of what the sixth amendment is about is fair enough and the same is true of the explanation of the seventh amendment.  I should merely like to say that I hope that the fact that these amendments are being passed not only without opposition but with the agreement of the Opposition here will not be taken as a precedent in the future.  We are talking now about an ordinary piece of law.  What we are passing here today will not itself be submitted to the people for approval.  In other words, the Government majority in both Houses can pass a law of this sort without a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am concerned about is that, while we could agree today that the two paraphrases here are as near to perfect as they can be made, I could see a great objection, in the case of a contentious referendum in the future, if what we are doing here today were cited as a precedent for a paraphrase of a referendum proposal which itself could be extremely <Col N="1698" /> controversial.  In 1968 and 1959 were the two efforts&mdash;in fact it is nearly coming up to the time when we might expect a third effort&mdash;by Fianna Fáil to get rid of the proportional representation system.  I could imagine that if a proposal of that kind were before the House, and if there were a proposal similar to the one before us today in regard to explaining to the voter what the whole thing is about, there could be very strong objection taken to the paraphrase which, in a contentious matter like that, the Government might put on what they wanted to see incorporated in the Constitution.  In other words, if, for example, in 1968 it had been then the law that the explanation was that this amendment is designed to provide us with the straight vote&mdash;something like that&mdash;I would consider that an entirely objectional paraphrase of what was then sought to be done.  I am only anxious that the mere fact that what is being done today is being done not only without opposition but by agreement should not be cited against the Opposition, or any Opposition in the House in future, if a Government should try to facilitate the passage of a much more radical and perhaps much more objectional amendment, by incorporating in a further amendment of the Referendum Acts a provision allowing them to put their interpretation on what their amendment is designed to achieve.</P>
    <P>In this connection&mdash;in case the Minister and his Department are thinking that far ahead and there is no reason for them not doing so because a matter of this sort could arise at any time&mdash; might I suggest that, in a case where a contentious paraphrase of a constitutional amendment proposal is produced by the Government, the President might be given a role.  The President has very few formal, legal functions. They could be written on half a postcard. He might be given a certain role here in consultation with the Council of State to adjudicate on the acceptability or otherwise of a paraphrase of the referenda proposals.  There seems to me to be a very appropriate model for such a proceeding in Article 22.2. of the Constitution, where what is envisaged is a dispute about what is a Money Bill.  The <Col N="1699" /> privileges of the other House are at issue here.  Where the Seanad are afraid they may be short-circuited and may not get a sufficient chance to debate something, because a Bill is represented as a Money Bill which is only masquerading as a Money Bill, there is a provision in Article 22.2.3º for the President to form a Committee of Privileges consisting of an equal number of Members of the Dáil and Seanad and a chairman who shall be a judge of the Supreme Court.  That would be an appropriate model to adopt in the even that we have a future referendum where the Government are seeking to make their path easier in a contentious matter by putting a favourable construction on what they are trying to do via this polling card.</P>

      <P>With regard to campaigning, which Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned, before the referenda on 5 July, the Deputy can be assured that this party will not fail in that respect.  We look forward to the other parties in the House doing the same thing, explaining what is involved to the people.  We certainly will not be found wanting in regard to that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Kelly, I understand there was a similar debate on this matter in 1963. An amendment was brought in by the Minister which was withdrawn later after debate.  The only thing that is involved here is simplification of the two matters for the electorate.  This makes it easier to identify the two papers.  That is really all that is involved here.  We should all agree that that is the proper approach.  It is not setting a precedent. We will make it clear to the people what is involved in the referenda and I trust the parties opposite will do the same.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): During one contribution from the Minister he seemed to brush too lightly aside the obligations of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs under this section.  He seemed to think that, notwithstanding the postal strike, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs could still carry out his obligations under this measure, but I do not think that is so.  It says in the section:</P>
      <P>Copies of the Bills can be inspected free of charge, and purchased for two and a half pence each, at any Post Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister simply says that only 80 post offices are closed, but he did not tell us that those are the major post offices in the country which are serving large built up areas in huge centres of population. The sub-post offices, which are still open, are to a large extent serving small communities of people.  Places like the GPO and the principal post offices in the cities and the major towns are closed.  I suggest that the Minister and his colleague take this matter seriously and see what can be done in regard to the various obligations under this Bill to use postal facilities for sending out polling <Col N="1701" /> cards with this important notice on them, for sending out postal votes to those entitled to vote by post and for making copies of the Bills available.</P>
    <P>Those are serious obligations.  I would like the Minister to take them seriously and I would like the Government to give them serious consideration and, if necessary, postpone the referenda until those matters can be brought to the attention of the people.  There is no use in the Minister saying that his party or any other person's party will take this matter as seriously as they would have contested a general election or a local election. That may sound all right on the record but he is not being practical about it.  He knows they will not take the matter as seriously as they would a general election, especially as this comes on the heels of a long campaign which has been going on for months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate that a polling card is not necessary for a local or general election.  It is simply an information device.  There is no political message as such on the polling card.  It simply conveys the location of the polling station and so on.  In this instance we are talking about a polling card which serves a totally different function. Subsection (a) states that the polling card &ldquo;shall contain the statement set out in the Appendix to this section&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we leaving ourselves open to a court case subsequent to a referendum held during a postal dispute?  If a person gets a copy of a newspaper in which he reads the appendix&mdash;which is my interpretation of the Minister's proposals&mdash;which says that if a person lives in a certain street he should vote in a certain polling station, does that information and manner in which it is conveyed, meet the provisions of this clause?  I am not a lawyer but it seems to me that it does not, unless it is proposed to send a free copy of <i>The Irish Press</i> by <Col N="1703" /> special delivery to every elector in the country.  A simple advertisement in the newspapers does not have the same meaning in terms of the word &ldquo;sent&rdquo; as delivering a polling card.  That is why I raised the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is perhaps the most important section because we are dealing with a reality.  There is a getout clause in subsection (e) to which the Minister referred.  If the same clause was put in with regard to the point I raised it would cover us legally.  The getout clause in subsection (e) states:</P>
      <P>copies of the statement referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be displayed by a presiding officer in and in the precincts of his polling station:</P>
      <P>and then it goes on to say in case something goes wrong</P>
      <P>Provided that no referendum shall be invalidated by reason of any failure to display such copies in or in the precincts of any polling station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what they are hoping will be <Col N="1704" /> done but if it is not done in every polling station it will not invalidate the referendum. Is there some way we can get legal cover for the words &ldquo;each elector shall be sent a copy of the polling card which shall contain the statement set out in Appendix in this section&rdquo;?  I am not a lawyer and neither is the Minister, but I think this matter should be clarified now. I want to facilitate the Minister in getting this Bill through but this point should be clarified because we are dealing regrettably and unfortunately with the reality of a postal strike to which nobody can see the end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I support the point made by Deputy Quinn about the get-out clause.  It is significant that we have this clause providing that failure to display these notices in the polling booths and in the precincts of the polling booths will not invalidate the referendum.  The fact that that proviso is absent from the direction to send out polling cards with the synopsis of the Bills on them would seem to indicate that a good case could be made in a court of law for saying that the intention of the legislator was that it was obligatory to send out these polling cards and, if that was not done, that the referendum could be invalidated.  We should not put unfortunate adoptive parents, and there are many of them, at risk again.  Many of them have been experiencing considerable fears since the Supreme Court decision two or three years ago that the children they regarded as theirs for years would be taken from them.  We should not let the postal strike or our anxiety not to discuss it or anything else create a situation where there might be any doubt about the validity of the referendum.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am sorry I have to come back to the secrecy of the ballot.  The <Col N="1705" /> last day the Minister said how a person could be found out and went on to say that in certain circumstances it might be necessary for the gardaí to find out.  It is never necessary for them to find out.  If they are finding out impersonation, all they want to be able to do is to know that a person voted and they can find that out by looking at the marked copy of the register used by the presiding officer.</P>
      <P>When I raised this matter today in all good faith the Minister gave a less than full affirmation that the ballot is private if the rules are observed.  The ballot is private and secret.  There is no point in saying &ldquo;if the rules are observed&rdquo;.  We must take it that they are observed.  If any presiding officer acts in a way that would make it possible to find out how a person voted, not alone is he not carrying out his obligation as a presiding officer, but he is guilty of a breach of the Secrecy Act and could and should be prosecuted in a court of law and be seriously penalised for this breach.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The House is already officially aware, from a statement made here by the Taoiseach on 31 January 1978, of a Government decision, which was made on 19 January 1978 to remove from the office of Commissioner of the Garda Síochána the then holder of that office, Mr. Edmund P. Garvey.  Mr. Garvey subsequently took legal proceedings which resulted in, amongst other things, a finding by the Supreme Court that the removal from office was null and void.</P>
      <P>I propose to return, later on in my statement, to that decision of the Government and to the circumstances in which a decision of the Supreme Court was sought by both sides in the legal proceedings.  For the moment, I am concerned only with the fact that that was the decision.  It meant that Mr. Garvey was still legally Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and, since the law provides for only one Commissioner, it followed that Mr. Patrick McLaughlin did not hold that office or rank.</P>
      <P>The judgements given in the Supreme Court make it clear that the right of the Government to remove a Commissioner from office is not questioned and that the Government were free, if for adequate reason they considered it necessary, to make a new decision removing Mr. Garvey from office, provided certain procedures were adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government were satisfied that Mr. Garvey should not be allowed to remain in office but considered it right, as <Col N="1707" /> they did in January 1978, to give him the option of resigning.  He availed himself of that option.  In saying this, perhaps I should make it clear that I am aware that he is reported in a newspaper as having said that he &ldquo;retired&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;resigned&rdquo;.  As far as I am concerned, nothing hinges on any distinction that might be thought to exist between those two terms&mdash;the position is that the solicitors acting for him used the word &ldquo;resign&rdquo; in the relevant letter to me and he himself used the word &ldquo;retire&rdquo;. Perhaps in that context I should make it clear that he has qualified for, and has been formally awarded, maximum pension and maximum gratuity.</P>
    <P>His resignation was expressed to be with effect from, and was accepted as from, 14 May and Mr. McLaughlin has been formally reappointed as Commissioner from the following day, namely 15 May.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a need to validate actions of Mr. McLaughlin during the period of 16 months or so when he was carrying out the functions of Commissioner but when, as it now transpires, he did not hold the office.  There is also a need to validate acts done by some others.</P>
    <P>One of the most important functions in respect of which validation is necessary concerns the appointment of new members to the force.  Every new member has to be appointed by the Commissioner&mdash;the precise terminology is &ldquo;appointed and enrolled&rdquo;&mdash;and it is, therefore, necessary to have validated all the appointments of new members during the period in question.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner is also responsible for promotions up to the rank of inspector, and it is necessary to have those promotions validated.  Appointments to the rank of superintendent and higher ranks are a matter for the Government and accordingly the question of validating those appointments does not arise except for one particular appointment to which I shall refer later.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of appointments, I invite the attention of the House to an important distinction that is implicit in <Col N="1708" /> the terms of the Bill, that is, that while both the appointment of new members and the promotions to sergeant and inspector rank will be validated, the Bill, in so far as Mr. McLaughlin himself is concerned, validates only his actions, not his original appointment.  This explains why the Bill contains a reference to his pay and conditions of service in respect of the 16-month period but does not do so in respect of the new members or newly-promoted sergeants or inspectors whose appointment or promotion, as the case may be, is in question.  Once those appointments and promotions are validated, the entitlement of the members concerned to the appropriate salary and conditions of service follows as a matter of course.  Mr. McLaughlin will not, however, be appointed retrospectively as Commissioner and, in the absence of a special provision, he could in certain circumstances suffer some diminution of pension rights.  The reference to his pay is probably unnecessary but it is included as a precautionary measure and also because it would seem inappropriate to include a reference to conditions of service without including a reference to pay.</P>
    <P>What I have referred to up to now concerns the validity of appointments within the force.  There could also be some consequential matters.  For instance, the Commissioner may under section 3 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, give a written authorisation to a named superintendent to exercise certain functions that are primarily vested by that Act in chief superintendents.  In practice, the only function of significance in this context is the extension from a maximum of 24 hours to a maximum of 48 hours of the period during which a person may be detained under section 30 of the 1939 Act.  It has been the practice to grant such authorisations to superintendents attached to Border districts and to superintendents attached to divisional headquarters.  There is no injustice to anybody in the retrospective validation of those authorisations since they are authorisations that would have been granted in accordance with well established practice, irrespective of who was Commissioner, and the invalidity of <Col N="1709" /> Mr. McLaughlin's original appointment has no material relevance to the decisions taken by the relevant superintendents.</P>
    <P>In theory, there could have been similar situations in relation to the prohibition, under the 1939 Act, of certain types of public meetings but this did not arise in practice.</P>
    <P>The authorisations I have been referring to are formally given by the Commissioner to certain superintendents under specific statutory authority.  There are other situations in which there is no question of a specific statutory authorisation of a particular superintendent but in which, nevertheless, there could be room for argument arising from the fact that the assignment of a superintendent to his district took place during the period we are referring to. There are various provisions in statutes or in rules of court or other statutory instruments whereby applications or notices of one kind or another are to be given to the superintendent of the district in which the person making the relevant application or giving the relevant notice lives or has a premises.  The superintendent, in certain cases, has power to grant or refuse certain permits, certificates or the like, or to object in court to the granting or removal of certain certificates or licences.</P>
    <P>Although the assignment of a superintendent to a particular district is an administrative matter and is not referred to in statutes or statutory regulations, and although it could be cogently argued that a superintendent who takes up duty in charge of a district is, by that very fact, the superintendent for that district, it is clear that somebody wishing to challenge a superintendent's decision might argue that the assignment flows from, or involves, the exercise of the Commissioner's general statutory function of directing and controlling the force.  Consequently, if only to avoid sterile argument, those matters have to be covered also.</P>
    <P>Reverting for a moment to functions exercised by the Commissioner, as distinct from persons deriving authority from him, I would mention also bye-laws or rules which he is authorised to make <Col N="1710" /> under the Road Traffic Acts.  I am informed that one set of traffic bye-laws were made in the period in question and one set of local and temporary rules.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as the House will have noticed, refers to things done by Mr. McLaughlin or by any other person.  The expression &ldquo;any other person&rdquo; is, of course, limited by the context in which it appears&mdash;the validity conferred by the section can have no application otherwise than to acts which were invalid by reason of the fact that Mr. McLaughlin's appointment was not effectual. As the House is aware, the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;, under the standard rules of interpretation, includes a body of persons and, in the present context, it includes the Government in that the Government, in January 1978, appointed a new Deputy Commissioner when, as it then appeared, Mr. McLaughlin had become Commissioner.  Under the relevant statutory instrument, there was provision for only two Deputy Commissioners so it appears that the new appointment needs to be validated.</P>
    <P>Another example of what is covered by &ldquo;any other person&rdquo; is a local authority putting up road signs&mdash;their functions in that respect are, by law, exercised subject to the consent of the Commissioner.  The expression &ldquo;any other person&rdquo; is also intended to cover, if necessary, acts done in the course of their duty by those people I have already mentioned, namely those admitted to the force during the last 16 months, those who were promoted to the rank of sergeant or inspector in that period or those of chief superintendent or superintendent rank who were assigned to their division or district during that period.  Naturally, only a small number of the official actions of any of those persons could come into question in any event, since most of their work does not consist of the exercise of statutory powers that might be open to be challenged in the present context.  Moreover, in so far as such acts may need to be covered, it seems likely that they would be covered by the validation being accorded to Mr. McLaughlin's acts, on the basis that, once his acts are validated, everything that flows from them is <Col N="1711" /> automatically validated.  There might however, be room for some argument about that, so it seems safer and simpler to rely on the direct validation that the Bill proposes to give to them as things done by &ldquo;any other person&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is one other point in the text which I think may call for explanation, namely the words in brackets at the beginning of section 1, referring to the satisfying of any condition precedent to the exercise or performance of a power or duty.  This is included because a number of functions of the Commissioner may be exercised only on the basis that he is satisfied as to some factor or that he is of a certain opinion or that it appears to him that a particular situation exists.  Although the satisfying of conditions of that kind naturally involves his considering the matter and reaching an opinion or conclusion and in that sense involves his doing something, there appeared to be some possibility of argument as to whether the phrase &ldquo;everything done&rdquo; would by itself clearly cover it and for that reason it was thought prudent to include those words that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I have given what I think are the main examples of matters needing validation though the House will appreciate that, in the nature of things, the list does not purport to be a complete one.  I would like to make it clear, however, that it is not through an oversight that I have not made any reference to criminal proceedings instituted during the period in question.  The reason I have not referred to them is that I am not aware of any reason why it should be thought that a question arises about them.  I am aware that certain public statements have been made suggesting the contrary but those statements seem to be based on a misunderstanding of the legal position. Legal proceedings in the more serious cases are brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions and even in a number of less serious the DPP may also be the prosecutor.  In those cases where a member of the force brings a prosecution himself, he is not, as a matter of law, acting on behalf of the Commissioner nor is it the Commissioner <Col N="1712" /> who, in practice, gives directions as to whether such proceedings should be brought.  The member is, therefore, not in any way acting as agent of the Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I said, at the beginning of my statement, that I would return to the question of the initial decision of the Government and to the circumstances in which a decision of the Supreme Court was sought by both sides in the legal proceedings.  I do not, however, consider it appropriate to go into these matters in any detail, at all events on this occasion, and for a number of reasons.  One of the reasons, and a sufficient one by itself alone, is that certain important related issues are before the High Court and, in accordance with long established practice, we ought to avoid issues that are <i>sub judice.</i>  This is an area in which I cannot say with any confidence precisely what aspects are likely to be in question in the High Court but, since there is a claim for damages, I have to assume that any aspect of the entire circumstances preceding or relating to the Government decision of January 1978 could become relevant to the proceedings.  Over and above that, there is on the Order Paper, in the names of Deputies Harte and O'Keeffe, a motion&mdash;it is item No. 73&mdash;which will provide opportunity for debate.  Indeed, if it were not for the constraints imposed by the fact that those proceedings are before the High Court, I would have suggested that the debate on that motion should take place now in conjunction with the debate on the Bill but, as matters stand, this is not possible.</P>
    <P>There are, however, certain matters that are clearly not <i>sub judice</i>, matters that it is permissible to refer to and that, in my view, it is in fact desirable to refer to, even if only briefly, in fairness to the House which is being asked to pass this legislation.  In referring to them briefly, I still do so on a purely factual basis that will not anticipate the debate that no doubt will take place on the motion on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>The House is aware, from what was said here by the Taoiseach on 31 January 1978 that the Government lost confidence in Mr. Garvey as Commissioner. <Col N="1713" /> Mr. Garvey took a legal action in the High Court which can be described as an action for wrongful dismissal. Counsel on both sides agreed that, instead of embarking on possibly protracted litigation in the High Court on issues that might prove irrelevant, it would be in the interests of all parties to get an initial authoritative ruling on what both sides agreed was a preliminary issue, namely whether the Government had, as a matter of law, unqualified authority to dismiss a Commissioner without notice and without giving reasons.</P>
    <P>As it happened, it was Mr. Garvey's legal representatives who proposed that the preliminary issue should first be determined, though I do not make any point about that other than that there is no dispute about the fact that the issue submitted, first to the High Court and then to the Supreme Court, was intended by both sides to be a preliminary one. Counsel for the Government, for their part, recognised that, if the preliminary issue were decided in favour of the Government, the case would end there and then and no costs would have been incurred on investigating issues of fact which would have been irrelevant.  It was for that reason that they agreed to this course and certain questions, agreed by both sides, were submitted to the High Court and then, by way of appeal, to the Supreme Court.  In the event, the Supreme Court decided against the Government on the particular questions put to them.  Furthermore, they went on to decide that, on the basis of their decision on those preliminary questions and the pleadings in the High Court, the dismissal was null and void because&mdash;so the court held&mdash;the various assertions made in the statement of claim as to the circumstances of the dismissal had not been denied, or sufficiently denied, in the defence that had been filed on the Government's behalf, and those assertions were on that account presumed to have been conceded by or on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>The House will notice, therefore, that, although the legal representatives on both sides had intended the appeal to the Supreme Court to be an appeal on a <Col N="1714" /> preliminary issue, the court's response was such that their decision on that issue, irrespective of what it would be, was going to determine the substantive issue as well.  This is clear because, if the court's answers had been in favour of the Government, the plaintiff would necessarily have lost the action at that point and, when the decision went the other way, the court in effect held that the plaintiff had won the action at that point.  In either event, therefore, what was intended and understood by both sides to be a preliminary issue was going to turn out to be something quite different.</P>
    <P>I mention this matter because it illustrates that there are, unavoidably, areas of the law where uncertainty prevails.  Deputy Cluskey, commenting in this House on 16 May&mdash;in Volume 314, column 710 of the Official Report &mdash;spoke of the incompetence of the Government who, according to the Deputy, did not know how to sack a Commissioner.  The Deputy is, of course, entitled to make this political charge.  The reality, as he and other Deputies knew, is that governments, irrespective of party, make no pretence to any special inspiration in the interpretation of the law.  Even the courts make decisions that are found to be wrong in law.  It is a common occurrence for decisions of the High Court to be overruled by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The important point is that, however much a party to a legal action may feel aggrieved at a particular decision&mdash;and counsel for the Government have stated clearly in open court that the Government do feel aggrieved at the decision&mdash;we all, in this House, recognise that we are fortunate in that we live under a system in which the law is interpreted by an independent judiciary.  The feeling, on a particular occasion, that one is hard done by is a price that we gladly pay for the benefits of a separation of powers.  Moreover, in determining an issue before them, the court are not only the interpreters of the law but also the arbiters on the construction or interpretation of documents and on findings of fact for the purpose of the particular action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1715" /> It is necessary to be clear, however, as to what the court have decided and what they have not.  As I have said, the court found that the defence pleadings did not constitute a sufficient denial of the various assertions made in the plaintiff's statement of claim and, consequently, that the defence pleadings must be construed as an acceptance of them.  To say that particular pleadings must be construed in a particular way, is not to say that such a construction corresponds with the intentions of the Government or of counsel who drafted the pleadings on the Government's behalf.  Still less is it to say that the Government must accept, or do in fact accept, in any context or for any purpose other than that of the particular issue before the court, the account given in the plaintiff's statement of claim.  As I have already indicated, I am not here embarking on any defence, still less any detailed defence, of the Government's decision and actions.  Even if the reasons I have already given did not obtain, I am conscious of the fact that to do so, unless events were to make it necessary, would be open to the charge that it involved gratuitous criticism of a person who is not present to defend himself, and that it was therefore contrary to the traditions of the House.</P>
    <P>I think it is both right and necessary, however, to put on record one matter of fact, a fact which is not open to dispute, and that is that, contrary to an impression that may have been given, there was no question of Mr. Garvey being simply called in out of the blue and given two hours to resign.  I am not implying that I had previously mentioned either resignation or dismissal to him.  All I am saying&mdash;but I do say and emphasise that much&mdash;is that there was a background to what occurred and one of which he was aware for some time. What that background was, how far back in time it extended, how many people knew at least something about it and so on are matters I do not propose to expand on now because to do so would inescapably involve argument on the merits of what was done and, for the reasons I have given, and especially the fact that there are issues to be determined <Col N="1716" /> by the High Court, it would be inappropriate for me to embark on any argument whatsoever about the merits at this stage.  I simply want to place on record the fact that what occurred did not occur out of the blue, and if the need arises, either in the context of the motion which is on the Order Paper or otherwise, I propose in due course to say as much as I have to say to defend myself.  How much that may be is, perhaps, largely dependent on what may be said or done by others and, in that sense, may be out of my hands.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that the Bill is put forward to meet a need that clearly has arisen and on that basis I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a monument to the incompetence and bungling of the Administration.  Even worse, it follows on the actions of the Minister for Justice in the handling of Garda affairs where he departed from and ignored completely normal standards of natural justice.  This was a sorry example, coming from the person who holds the highest office in the State associated with the administration of justice. Listening to the Minister's speech one does not get any indication that the motivation in the Minister's time in any way changed and what really concerns me is that similar examples of denial of natural justice may arise in future in the Minister's actions, administrative and otherwise.</P>
      <P>There is a background of course to the present Bill and I should have expected that the entire background would have been exposed in this House and that we, the democratically elected representatives of the people, would have an opportunity of a full and detailed debate thereon.  The Minister's speech does not, in fact, deal with many questions that are in my mind and I can only proceed with my own speech on the basis of raising a number of issues to which perhaps we can return at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect of the case arising out of which I put two questions to the Minister for reply.  Will he now clarify whether prior to the 1977 general election <Col N="1717" /> he expressly or implicitly indicated that in the event of his party coming to power Commissioner Garvey would be sacked or otherwise removed from office? The second question is: if not, has he any knowledge that other members of his party did so?  This aspect of the matter must be cleared up and I challenge the Minister in his reply to deal with these points.  Too many rumours have been circulating in this regard and it is only right that the Minister openly in the House should clear up the question once and for all without equivocation.</P>

I know from experience of the past couple of months at the hustings, the promises that were made prior to the election and the efforts to win votes but certainly anything that would relate to the basic principles of justice involving a person's standing as a servant of the State is not something that should be bandied about.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will forgive the Chair for intervening. The Chair is in a rather difficult position and I appeal to Deputies to ensure that they do not infringe on cases which are already before the courts are <i>sub judice.</i>  Discussion of the merits or demerits of the dismissal and things of that nature could not arise on this Bill which is a Bill to validate certain actions.  I appeal for the assistance of Deputies who are to speak on the Bill. Most of them are in the legal business and they know exactly what they should or should not touch on.</P>

      <P>The Chair assures the Deputy that to the extent that the Minister has referred to matters in his speech, the Chair will not curtail any other Member speaking here. However, the debate on this matter must be constrained by the fact that aspects of the matter are still <i>sub judice.</i>  The Chair is only asking that Deputies try to keep within rulings that have been given down through the years in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to keep within the confines of the rulings but as you will appreciate I shall have to speak relatively broadly on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for the Bill arises because of the now established inability of the Government to grant to one of the servants of the nation the most elementary and fundamental justice.  This is a fair indication of the shameful state of this country.  Dáil Éireann is now concerned with the enactment of a Bill which, it is alleged, is necessitated by virtue of the Government, under the Constitution <Col N="1719" /> failing to observe the basic tenets of justice.  The Minister has referred to the principle of separation of powers and I shall come back to that because there was a rather dangerous implication in some of his remarks.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I should say that we, as members of the Opposition or members of the ordinary public, would expect our Government to act in such a way that the dictates of justice are not flouted.  We are, indeed, fortunate in having courts which are able to re-establish a situation when that has been done, as has occurred in this case.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister's speech, one could hardly call the sacking of Mr. Garvey a mistake.  Though the Minister has not dealt with the matter in detail, it is fairly clear that no attempt was made to give to Mr. Garvey the consideration which every citizen in similar circumstances would be entitled to expect.  Certainly, there is nothing in the Minister's speech which indicates otherwise than that there was an absolute denial of considerations which every fair-minded person would subscribe to.</P>
    <P>It may well be asked, how could the Government be so blind to such fundamentals? It may also be asked, if the Government are blind in this fundamental regard and if these are the standards they apply, what standards of fairness, honesty and justice do the Government subscribe to and put into effect in other spheres?  I should have expected from the Minister some word of apology, or some attempt at justification.  He stands indicted by the Supreme Court of this country for the manner in which he summarily dismissed, without notice, or reason given, a servant of the State of 40 years' standing.  Yet, he stands before this House bold as brass, without any effort to explain, or justify his acts.  What worries me even more is it does not seem to have sunk into the consciousness of the Minister or his party how reprehensible his actions were in this regard.  Are there other public servants shivering at the thought of similar treatment being meted out to them?  Have the Minister and his colleagues learned a lesson? Can we have a guarantee to this <Col N="1720" /> House that never again will the principles of natural justice be flouted in the same manner as was displayed in the Garvey case?  That, perhaps, would be the most important contribution which the Minister could make to the House at this stage.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with a number of aspects of the Minister's speech which need to be referred to, I shall deal with a general point about this Bill.  Retrospective legislation is dangerous legislation.  I am concerned that we have before us a Bill which fits into this dangerous category.  I appreciate the serious legal implications which touch on the whole foundation of the administration of this country, arising from the chaos and muddle caused by the Government.  I have to put on record my worries, in a general sense, in regard to retrospective legislation.  I would have no fears in this particular situation, if the retrospective legislation were merely to regularise formalities. The Minister has touched on a number of areas which would be affected by this Bill, if and when it becomes law.  The Minister says his list is not exhaustive.  I should have expected from him a complete list, so that the House could properly debate this specific Bill, in the context of the principle that retrospective legislation is not the type of legislation that should normally be passing through this House.</P>
    <P>I accept a number of aspects which were dealt with by the Minister as needing and being worthy of regularisation. The appointment of new members of the force obviously should be validated.  The present law is that such appointments have to be made by the Commissioner.  In view of the uncertainly&mdash;though it is no longer uncertain at this stage, in view of the fact that Mr. McLaughlin was not Commissioner then&mdash;I accept that the appointments of new members of the force since 20 January 1978 should be validated.  There is also the question of appointments up to the rank of inspector, again requiring the approval of the Commissioner.  On that point also I would entirely accept that the people who have been appointed and promoted since January 1978 should have their positions secured.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1721" /> I agree with the Minister that we should validate formalities.  At the same time there are a few aspects, in regard to this Bill, that give me cause for concern. The 1925 Act provided that the whole direction and control of the Garda is vested in the Commissioner.  I am aware that there are certain powers reserved to the Commissioner under the disciplinary regulations.  Quite rightly, this aspect was not referred to by the Minister.  I do recall, from the days when I practised as a lawyer, before becoming a politician, that there were powers which were specifically reserved to the Commissioner. Here again I am raising the question: what powers under the Garda Síochána disciplinary regulations have been exercised by Mr. McLaughlin since 20 January 1978&mdash;I believe that this House is entitled to a full answer to that question&mdash;and are there members of the force who have been penalised as a result of actions and decisions of Mr. McLaughlin since January 1978?  Even more specifically, are there members or former members of the Garda Síochána whose livelihoods were affected to such an extent that they were dismissed from the force by an invalid act put into effect by Mr. McLaughlin since January 1978?  I have reason to believe that to be the case but I would have expected such detailed information to be furnished by the Minister in asking us to approve this Bill.  If that is so, in dealing with this Bill we are not merely validating certain formalities; we are validating retrospectively acts which were carried out illegally and invalidly which may have affected the livelihood of individual citizens.  In that regard I find the Minister's speech totally incomplete and it is difficult to give a final view on this Bill in the absence of this information.  I and my colleagues accept that this is a situation of chaos resulting from the actions of the Minister and that action is necessary in the interests of preserving the institutions of the State and permitting normal legal proceedings to continue.  My concern is whether this Bill is all-embracing and covers situations of which Members would not approve if we had full information.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to powers under section 3 of the Offences against the <Col N="1722" /> State Act, 1939, and made the point that authorisations issued would not lead to any injustice.  The House should have been given full information in regard to this point.  Were there people whose detention was increased from 24 hours to 48 hours as a result of such authorisations which were possibly issued invalidly or illegally?  If so, how many people were affected?  Information on this point was very sparse and it is a matter of genuine concern to many Members. The Minister referred to bye-laws authorised by Mr. McLaughlin since 20 January 1978.  We are not given details of these bye-laws and this is typical of the general content of the Minister's speech. Surely if we are to judge how important these were we should have been given some information thereon.  We are now asked to validate these bye-laws, yet we have not been told what they were.</P>
    <P>The other really disturbing aspect of the Minister's speech was the reference to the Supreme Court and their decision. I will not move into matters which are <i>sub judice</i> but I can only interpret the Minister's remarks as being an attack on the Supreme Court and I am very concerned as an elected representative that such an attack should be made.  We accept under our Constitution the principle of the separation of powers and it is of grave concern that a Minister of this Government should stand up in this House and, by way of what appears to be some attempt to justify his own actions, mount an attack on the Supreme Court.  This is something which should not go unnoted.  I would ask the Minister in his reply clearly to confirm that this attack was unintentional.  The Minister's speech can only be interpreted as a bald attack on the Supreme Court merely because they do not uphold his viewpoint. The democracy in which we live respects the rule of law as the basis on which our democracy thrives.  In that context attacks on the courts of this land by members of the public are something which diminish respect for the rule of law.  When the attack in this situation comes from the Minister for Justice one can realise the seriousness of the attack. It goes beyond the individuals of the court and to the very institutions of the State.  In his reply the Minister should indicate <Col N="1723" /> that the attack which appears obvious in his speech was unintentional or else he should make it clear that he is withdrawing same.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are asked to validate acts by or on behalf of Patrick McLaughlin between 20 January 1978 and 14 May 1979.  It is regrettable that a Bill of this nature should come before the House.  I would put another question to the Minister: has he considered the constitutional effects of such retrospective legislation?  In effect he is trying to legalise what was illegal and validate what was invalid.  It is not possible for me, in the absence of information which I referred to earlier, to comment further at this point but certainly I would be concerned if the rights of an individual were to be interfered with by this Bill, this retrospective legislation.  I would be concerned that such a Bill would then be considered to be contrary to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In general, therefore, the view of myself and my party is that retrospective legislation is bad.  Yet, looking at the chaos and legal tangles that are resulting from the disgraceful act of this Government in what is now called the Garvey case, we accept that some legislation is necessary.  I would have preferred to see a Bill coming before this House which would retrospectively validate certain formalities which would be specified.  I mentioned some of them&mdash;induction of new members, promotions and so on.</P>
    <P>The Bill we have before us is an all-embracing one.  We do not have sufficient information on the powers which were actually exercised by Mr. McLaughlin from January 1978 to May 1979.  I am concerned and my party are concerned that the exercise of some of these powers may have adversely affected the livelihood of people.  Individuals may now be branded as criminals because of invalidations; members of the force may have lost their jobs as a result of decisions taken by Mr. McLaughlin during that period.  I would indeed be far happier if, in the light of the discussions today, the Minister were to withdraw the Bill and to reintroduce a measure along the lines I suggested <Col N="1724" /> detailing in particular which acts were being validated.  If he does not agree to this course he has a duty to this House at the very minimum to give a full and comprehensive account of what acts we are expected to validate by this Bill.  I would also suggest, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, that the Minister has a duty to this House, and indeed to this nation, to offer some more decent and reasonable explanation for the manner in which he and his Government acted in regard to the Garvey dismissal. It is the minimum that this House and the country will accept.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Bill, I have made these suggestions to the Minister as to what he might do.  I accept that legislation is necessary.  If the Minister does not accept the proposals which will be coming from my colleagues I will attempt, on Committee Stage, to put down a number of amendments to confine the validation measures to certain acts which are openly approved here and discussed here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is as fine a political obituary as I have read for a long time.  Even in its very format all one would need to do is to draw a couple of lines around it and it looks like a tombstone. The only difference is that the symbol on top of the tombstone is not a cross but a harp.  If I refer to it as a political obituary it is because it is a political obituary of the many high flying promises that were made especially in the area of justice by representatives of this administration before they came to power in 1977.  We all remember the political climate then.  We all remember the allegations that the country, under the Coalition Government, was going to the dogs and nowhere more than in the delicate and sensitive area of law and order.  Here we have a Government, having come into office at least partly on the kind of sentiment which has been determined by the highest court in the land, who have carried out an administrative action in relation to an appointment which lies at the very core of our system of law and order which is null and void. Null and void are harsh words indeed and the Minister has included them in this script because he could hardly have <Col N="1725" /> excluded them, forming as they do part of the judgment of the Supreme Court.  I would argue that the position of a Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, along with that of the Minister for Justice himself and that of the President of the Supreme Court, are the three most important and influential appointments that any Taoiseach or Government could make.  In respect of one of these three appointments&mdash;and it is one which concerns the day to day administration of justice in a very clear and detailed way&mdash;the Government have now been found by the Supreme Court to have acted in a way that no Government should act.  They should not act like this in any area but that they should have acted like this in this particular area is all the more reprehensible.  It is not just reprehensible it is, given the rhetoric of the Fianna Fáil Party when in Opposition, also extremely hypocritical.  That a Government who come to power, partly at least on a law and order ticket, should be found within such a brief space of time to have acted so unfairly is, as I said, a fundamental statement of political obituary.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his address to us this morning, tried to make the best of a bad job by arguing that the Government had made a mistake and that after all everybody can make mistakes.  He said in referring to a statement by Deputy Cluskey, and I quote:</P>
      <P>The reality, as he and other Deputies know, is that Governments, irrespective of party, make no pretence to any special inspiration in the interpretation of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This statement of the Minister is, of course, completely unexceptional. Nobody can take any exception to that statement because no Government and no political party have any function whatsoever in relation to the interpretation of the law.  Under our system the interpretation of the law is a matter which is reserved exclusively to the courts. Time and time again in this House&mdash;although less frequently now&mdash;I have had questions to particular Minister disallowed on the grounds that it is no function of the Minister concerned to supply an interpretation of the <Col N="1726" /> law.  So the Minister is hiding behind something behind which he cannot logically hide.  What we are concerned about here is not any action by a Government interpreting the law but an action by a Government administering the law.  We are talking about an administrative executive decision by the Government; we are talking about an administrative decision by the Government which goes to the heart of the administration of justice in this land.  That decision and that action has been found to be null and void by the Supreme Court, has been found to be devoid of natural justice.  This again, I should like to stress, was in relation to one of the highest appointments in the land.  If they do this in the green wood, what will they do in the dry?</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to cast some doubt, in so far as it is possible to do so, in the environment of the House on the decision of the Supreme Court. Translated into plain ordinary common or garden speech there are passages in his address to the House which simply read, &ldquo;We wuz robbed&rdquo;.  That emerges in its smoothness in the following sentence: &ldquo;The feeling, on a particular occasion, that one is hard done-by is a price that we gladly pay for the benefits of a separation of powers&rdquo;.  I should like to know who is being &ldquo;hard done by&rdquo;. The Government appear to think that they are being hard done by, but the Supreme Court took a somewhat contrary decision and came to the conclusion that the Commissioner had been &ldquo;hard done by&rdquo;.  The results of that particular conclusion are still in progress through the courts.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that a Government who came to office partly on a law and order ticket should come here and complain that they were &ldquo;hard done by&rdquo; by the Supreme Court.  I do declare that we saw the end of this famous law and order stance a long time ago.  I have not done my sums but I would not mind betting that in the last two years they have locked up more children than armed bank robbers.  In the latter stages of his speech the Minister made an extraordinary statement.  Referring to the Commissioner, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1727" /> ...there was a background to what occurred and one of which he was aware for some time.  What that background was, how far back in time it extended, how many people knew at least something about it and so on are matters I do not propose to expand on now because to do so would inescapably involve argument on the merits of what was done and, for the reasons I have given, and especially the fact that there are issues to be determined by the High Court, it would be inappropriate for me to embark on any argument whatsoever about the merits at this stage.  I simply want to place on record the fact that what occurred did not occur out of the blue.</P>
    <P>It is now plain on the evidence of the Minister's own words that we got government by incompetence and we are now to have government by innuendo. There are some Ministers and some Departments which specialise in this particular line of attack but I have rarely seen such a calculated example of the technique of innuendo as is contained in that paragraph.  If one were on a jury reading those sentences in relation to any action that might be before any court what would one's normal and honest conclusion be?  The normal and honest conclusion would be that of course the Government were right to do what they did but that they cannot let us know and, therefore, we have to accept it on its merits.  The Minister has said that if the need arises he proposes in due course to say as much as he has to say to defend himself.  Will the Minister be going into the witness box in the High Court to give that court the reasons for his dismissal of the Commissioner?  If he intends doing that that is the only proper place to do it and he should not be doing it in this House by way of innuendo.</P>
    <P>I am intrigued by the phrase, &ldquo;what that background was, how far back in time it extended&rdquo;.  I believe that what was chiefly involved was the fact that Commissioner Garvey, as he then was, simply refused to play ball with the then Opposition.  I believe that he is a man who would refuse to play ball with any <Col N="1728" /> political party or any administration and that is why his fate was sealed before the election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe asked the Minister a number of question and, if I recall him correctly, he asked him to give an assurance to the House that no promise had been made by himself or any Member of the Opposition at that time that the Commissioner would be sacked if they were returned to office. The Minister answered a categorical negative to both inquiries.  I believe that the truth is that they did not need to make any such promise or any such statement because they knew what they intended doing.  What they did was based on pique and vindictiveness rather than any concern for the real needs of the situation.</P>
      <P>In the course of his speech the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The Government were satisfied that Mr. Garvey should not be allowed to remain in office</P>
      <P>The truth of the matter must surely be that it was not just the Government, it was the pre-1977 Opposition which had also come to that conclusion.  The Minister referred to some of the retrospective actions which this Bill seeks to justify and validate and, commented:</P>
      <P>There is no injustice to anybody in the retrospective validation of those authorisations</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is the Minister flying on a wing and a prayer if ever I saw it.  If the logic he said elsewhere is correct, it is not up to him to decide whether any injustice has been done to anybody; it will be up to the courts to decide.  Despite the passage of this legislation&mdash;it undoubtedly will be passed despite our reservations &mdash;it may still be open, and I would not be surprised to see it happen, for somebody who feels that an injustice was done to take his case to the courts where it will be argued out again.  The <Col N="1729" /> Minister may yet again have to admit that he was wrong.  The situation is a very serious one.  We accept that some legislation is needed not to cover up for, because it cannot be covered up for, but to make good the misjudgement and mistakes of the Government in their actions in dismissing the then Commissioner, Mr. Garvey.</P>
    <P>I believe it is true to say that even though the Government were aware in 1978 that their action would be to some extent popular within the force the Commissioner was a tough boss and tough bosses are not always loved by their subordinates&mdash;the real reason is that it was an action which compounded incompetence and vindictiveness and because it was vindictiveness they tripped over themselves and got it wrong. They not only got it wrong but, in the process, in the eyes of the Supreme Court did considerable injustice to a man who, whatever problems would have arisen in relation to his appointment and tenure of office, was and remains an honourable man.  The Government also in this action, in this serious hamfisted and vindictive action contributed significantly to the undermining of the institutions they are sworn to defend.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been dealing with the difficulties that have arisen from the purported dismissal of Garda Commissioner Edmund Garvey.  The new Commissioner, Donegal man Mr. Paddy McLaughlin is also involved.  I feel I should pay tribute to him.  I remember him when I was a boy in Donegal and when he first joined the Garda.  He moved up the ranks of the Garda and I am proud that a Donegal man has proved that he can get to the top of the line.  It was of great satisfaction to me to watch his progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the new Commissioner and I am proud that he made it to the top of the ladder.  His hour of glory was destroyed by the incompetence of the Minister when he appointed and purported to appoint him Commissioner of the Garda and by his blundering incompetence in handling the Garvey case.  It is a disgrace that a man who has served so well should be put in an embarrassing position by the Minister's handling of this case.  Paddy McLaughlin was destined to become Commissioner of the Garda when Commissioner Garvey retired having served the appropriate number of years and I protest with deep resentment about this matter.  Since Garda McLaughlin became Commissioner I only spoke to him on the phone once and I would not know him if I met him in the street but I remember him in Donegal waiting to enlist in the Garda.</P>
      <P>This state of affairs has been brought about by the incompetence and political intrigue of a Minister more interested in politics than anything else.</P>
      <P>I have never met or spoken to Commissioner Edmund Garvey and I am totally neutral as to the administration under Mr. Garvey and as to whether he was causing friction within the ranks or not.  That is not the issue here.  Deputies O'Keeffe and Horgan mentioned the legal difficulties arising from the purported dismissal of Garda Commissioner Edmund Garvey and the reasons for this Bill being before the House.  It is all very well to talk about whether a person is technically properly in jail or whether a person has been technically, not correctly enlisted in the Garda, but the reasons for this Bill go a lot deeper than that.  The Minister can deny that until the cows come home or until the Post Office workers get back to work but he will not convince me or anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the 1977 election it was commonly noted by candidates representing different parties in different constituencies that if Fianna Fáil got back into office Garda Commissioner Garvey's days as chief of police were gone.  I do not know why that was said but it must be acknowledged that every other promotion <Col N="1731" /> conferred on Garda Garvey was conferred during the term of office of the Fianna Fáil party.  Tributes were paid to Edmund Garvey by former Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice, by Deputy Haughey, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Oscar Traynor.  It is not without significance that within six months of the present Minister taking office a man who won the admiration and the confidence of these Minister was publicly embarrassed without reason.  I do not condone but condemn these standards.</P>
    <P>There are broader issues involved than just the dismissal of a police officer because, as the Minister for Justice says, the Government can no longer have confidence in him.</P>

Until that point the draft of the Minister's speech it would appear was prepared by legal advisers in the Department to save the Minister from the difficult position he had found himself in because of his bungling of the Garvey affair.  However, when the Minister continued in his speech to say &ldquo;I think it is both right and necessary, however, to put on record one matter of fact&rdquo;, he opened the debate because, as Deputy Horgan has said, by innuendo he was saying he was not permitted to put these matters before the House because Mr. Garvey was not here to defend himself.</P>

      <P>All I am saying&mdash;but I do say and emphasise that much&mdash;is that there was a background to what occurred....</P>
      <P>There was no background when Deputy Cooney or Deputy O'Malley or Deputy Lenihan was Minister for Justice, or if it was it was not known.  Why did it become known a few months after Deputy Collins became Minister for Justice?  Deputy Collins said that he or his party did not do a deal with anybody about the dismissal of Commissioner Garvey.  I say categorically that preelection attitudes on this matter by Fianna Fáil were heard clearly in constituencies like Donegal to the effect that if there was a change of Government there would be a change of leadership in the Garda.</P>

      <P>This is not the first time that a chief of police has been dismissed. I will not go into the circumstances of the last such occasion here, which was before I was born.  If we want to create a society and standards whereby all Irishmen and women will have a sense of security and confidence, in which they will know they are safe and that political intrigue will not undermine the ground they are standing on, the standards set <Col N="1734" /> by Deputy Collins as Minister for Justice stand condemned.  He has done a disservice not alone to Edmund Garvey, not alone to his party and Government but to all the people of the State.</P>
      <P>The Government party have preached the unity of the Irish people.  How have they contributed to any sense of confidence to fellow Irishmen in the North? If any of them wanted a career in the police force would they feel any sense of security in this part of Ireland considering the standards set by the Minister for Justice?  Is any one mad enough to think that what Deputy Collins did was applauded by the police forces of Northern Ireland or Great Britain or by the ordinary people living there?</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House does not stop at the issue of whether Edmund Garvey continued to hold the confidence of the Government.  There are far deeper implications and it is about time the Minister and the Government realised that in addition to the duties they are obliged to perform as Ministers of State, their obligations go far beyond that.  By example and performance they must create an atmosphere in which people of all traditions, classes and creeds can say, &ldquo;We would like to belong to that society&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not what has happened.  What has happened has been a downright disgrace.  Edmund Garvey has been publicly embarrassed.  The head of our police force has been dismissed, and the standard set is that if any future Garda Commissioner disagrees with the Minister he will do so at the peril of being dismissed.  There is to be no freedom of expression.  Edmund Garvey was within two years of retirement.  He joined the police force as a young man and had all the knowledge that experience brings during a period of nearly 40 years of State service.  All that has gone for nothing because a Member of this House who happened to belong to a party which got a majority of Deputies and the Taoiseach decided he should be Minister for Justice.  On the simple basis that someone is elected to the House, is fortunate to be a member of the party who takes control of the House and is honoured by being placed in a Cabinet <Col N="1735" /> position, he challenges the experience of almost 40 years in the police force.  I leave the Members of this House or anyone else to decide the wisdom of that.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I have no axe to grind.  I have heard Edmund Garvey being criticised by members of the police force.  I have heard him being praised by members of the police force.  That is not the issue here.  With respect to the Minister for Justice, if I had been in his position I would have said to Edmund Garvey, &ldquo;I am not satisfied with the way you are running our police force.  I am hearing too many complaints from other parties.  We will have to work out another method.  We will have to do something together to have this problem resolved&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Edmund Garvey's task was not an easy one.  He took over the police force when they were under attack from subversive organisations, when the general public not only in the Republic of Ireland but in the entire island of Ireland and in Great Britain and also exiled friends in different parts of the world were praying to God for some guidance in Ireland, for peace and sanity, and above all for law and order there.  If it meant pushing a few gardaí around, that price should have been accepted by the Minister for Justice and if Edmund Garvey went to the extent of pushing it too far that should have been understood by the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>My contribution will not take me much longer.  I protest at the action of the Minister.  There is no point in running behind denials and saying &ldquo;we did not do it, we were unaware of any rumour circulating before the 1977 general election&rdquo;.  There is no point in denying that because if the Minister for Justice denies it what he is really saying is that he was unaware of a rumour which all candidates could hear except Fianna Fáil candidates.  I am not saying that the Minister for Justice was aware of this, but if he was not aware of it he was not very much in touch with preelection rumours.  I heard it in Donegal and other Members had heard it all over the State and it was only a matter of time as to when the thing would happen.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that there were difficulties in the police force and that in itself presented the new Minister for Justice with a difficulty, but I do not consent to a decision by the Minister for Justice to dismiss within two hours without reason the head of a police force, a man who had given such long and outstanding service to that police force.  If the Minister had ended his speech before saying that there was no question of Mr. Garvey being given only two hours to resign, less exception could have been taken to what he said.  His speech changed in style at that point. That change in style occurred when the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>I think it is both right and necessary, however, to put on record one matter of fact, a fact which is not open to dispute,...</P>
      <P>The infallibility of the Minister for Justice.  It is not open to dispute.  In other words no one can say to the Minister for Justice, &ldquo;You are wrong&rdquo;.  He has the right side of it.  A man whose backside was scarcely hot in the seat of the Minister for Justice would challenge the experience, expertise and knowledge of a man who had given his life to the police force, and that fact is not open to dispute. The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>...contrary to the impression that may have been given, there was no question of Mr. Garvey being simply called in out of the blue and given two hours to resign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> We know that Mr. Garvey was kept sweating in his office for weeks.  He was not consulted, he was ignored, no business was given to him, he was pushed around and made to feel that he was not wanted.  We know there was a crisis.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>I am not implying that I had previously mentioned either resignation or dismissal to him.</P>
    <P>In other words, he had never talked seriously to the former commissioner about the intentions he had of sacking him.  That is the expression we use.  The Minister says &ldquo;his dismissal&rdquo;.  He was sacked; he was told he was not wanted, that he was not suitable.  He was not suitable on whose judgement?  On the judgement of a man who had three or four month's experience as Minister for Justice, who was more politically orientated and more concerned about getting votes than about the high standards that he should have in the carrying out of his duties as Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan mentioned the Minister casting doubts on the Supreme Court.  If that remark was taken in isolation we could dismiss it as being off the cuff, a remark put into the script maybe in a moment of temptation.  However, when we know that on the day the Supreme Court gave its decision, the Tánaiste, who is the Deputy Prime Minister and speaks for the Taoiseach when the Taoiseach is not in the House, stated that they might consider impeaching when he said, &ldquo;We will look for a two-thirds majority.&rdquo;  That was an off-the-cuff remark, but if it was it was symptomatic of the thinking of the members of the Government and their jackboot tactics of clobbering everyone in their way or who disagrees with them and of a King Kong attitude of 84 Deputies who feel they can do what they like.  The power of those 84 Deputies was challenged and rocked when the petticoats of 3,000 nurses came to Dublin.  The King Kong power of those 84 Deputies has them roaring like mice since the Post Office workers went on strike.</P>

Perhaps singularly the sacking of Mr. Edmund Garvey is also a noted thing because at present I cannot remember, nor am I aware, of any other election promise that the Government have fulfilled.  At this point in time the Minister for Justice must surely regret the sacking of Mr. Edmund Garvey.  He must surely regret that he did not do justice to the present Commissioner, Mr. Patrick McLaughlin, who deserved more than being placed in the middle of a political row.  His service to this State, his service in the police force, deserved better than being publicly embarrassed and being caught in the middle of a political battle between the Minister for Justice and the rest of the police force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be a difficult job to be a Minister for Justice in present times but there were times when it was more difficult. The beginning of the last decade, from 1969 onwards, warranted the support of all parties in this House, warranted everything necessary to make the job of the Minister for Justice successful, not because we wanted to be nice to the person occupying the office but because it was essential in the general interest and for the good of all.  The last couple of years have not been that difficult, not as difficult as in the early and middle parts of the seventies.  It could be said that the present Minister for Justice is having an easier ride than his two predecessors.  However, it is still a difficult job and I wish him well in it.  But the Minister for Justice is lacking in one thing: he did not recognise the same difficulties that go with being Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, a man who gives such distinguished service to our police force, a man saddled with the responsibility of ensuring not alone that law and order are upheld but that every garda be loyal to the force, that every garda without question could be depended on to do his duty.  That in itself is a mammoth task.  It did not deserve what the Minister for Justice offered Mr. Edmund Garvey&mdash;two hours notice to resign or be sacked.  I protest against <Col N="1739" /> those standards.  I will never accept those standards.  While I offer the Minister for Justice every help and wish him every success in the years ahead of him as Minister for Justice or in any other role he has to play, I condemn without reservation his handling of the Garvey affair.  I condemn him because he passes it on to the Government, contending in his speech that it was a Government decision, but he is hiding behind the Cabinet table.  The Government took the advice of the Minister for Justice.  The Government merely accepted the advice the Minister for Justice offered the Cabinet, and he misled his own party.  If at some time in the quietness of the evening the Minister has a guilty conscience it will do him no harm to admit publicly that he did Mr. Edmund Garvey a dreadful disservice, that he did the police force of this country a dreadful disservice and that he did neither himself nor his party a service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ways it is difficult to be restrained when dealing with this Bill because it does not bring much credit to the relationship between public servants, the Executive and indeed the discharge of that mutual interaction of contract of employment.  It is on that aspect I shall make some brief observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I in no way deny but rather fully accept the right of any Government of the day&mdash;for reasons best known to them and acting in the national interest&mdash;to the ultimate prerogative of government. That most certainly does reside in the right to discharge and remove from office the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  That is a basic right of the Government of the day, just as the Government have the right to remove from the public service any other member of the Garda Síochána, from the lowest to the highest rank, to remove from office any other member of the security forces or indeed any other person serving in a public office under the Civil Service and Garda Síochána Acts.  That right is not being challenged in any way on this side of the House. <Col N="1740" /> But what I find very disturbing is the manner in which the Government went about discharging that right.  I have never served in the Cabinet but my understanding of the process would be that, in the first instance, the Minister of the day would prepare a memorandum. Presumably he would discuss that memorandum with the secretary of his Department, perhaps with the assistant secretary of his Department.  In the process of the preparation of that memorandum relative to the employment of the Garda Commissioner he might well consult with the Attorney General.  In relation to aspects of superannuation and termination of employment he might well consult the Department of the Public Service.  In due course when he had the memorandum ready within his Department he would have it transmitted to the Cabinet in the strictest confidence.  It would be placed then on the Cabinet agenda, debated internally in the Cabinet and, since the Government of the day must exercise that right&mdash;and in the Government alone resides the right&mdash;there is then a Government decision taken.</P>
    <P>I wonder and we are entitled to know, and every public servant in the country has the right to know, what happened on that occasion.  For example, I wonder did the Minister for Justice call in the secretary of his Department and say, &ldquo;Look, I am at a total <i>impasse</i> in my relations with the Garda Commissioner. I have good reason to come to a conclusion that I must terminate his employment. Therefore, let us set in train the preparation of a Department of Justice memorandum.&rdquo;  Did this happen?  We are entitled to know if it did happen. There are many eminent members of the Government who are members of the legal profession.  The Taoiseach has a legal background.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs trained as a lawyer as well.  The Tánaiste, prior to becoming Deputy Leader, while in Opposition went back into active legal practice.  He has quite considerable legal experience. A former Minister for Justice, who is now Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, is a member of the legal profession.  Whatever talents the Government may possess they are not <Col N="1741" /> short of general legal expertise and legal training.  The Minister for Labour has no more legal training than I have, but one would have thought that he would have said to his Cabinet Ministers: &ldquo;Let us be quite clear about what we are doing.  We are terminating the employment of a public servant.  Let us tabulate our precise reasons for doing this.  Let us ask the AG if we are likely to find ourselves in dire trouble subsequently.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One can only surmise, because one is not likely to be told, that a precipitate decision was taken for some reason, that very little thought was given to the precise reasons for dismissal and that the due process, which any public servant is entitled to, was dispensed with in an outrageous fashion.  I am profoundly disturbed that any Government, whether it be Fianna Fáil, National Coalition or any other, would proceed in a manner like this.  Apparently what happened to Commissioner Garvey could have happened to any public official.  We have to contend with that situation and we have to ensure that by public condemnation in the House this will not happen again.</P>
    <P>We have to bear in mind that when a public servant in the State takes up office that person signs the Official Secrets Act.  If that person suffers the humiliation of being dismissed from office the Official Secrets Act still applies.  Even if that person is under intense cross-examination in the Supreme Court, the Official Secrets Act still applies.  Every civil servant knows that.  No matter how any public servant may be dismissed that person has enormous constraints placed on him or her in terms of defence, disclosure of what happened internally during his or her employment and is at enormous personal disadvantage in regard to public controversy.  I would have thought the Government would have taken all those factors into account in arriving at any decision in relation to Commissioner Garvey.</P>
    <P>I was under the impression during the last general election campaign, when I was meeting many people from all walks of life, that it was the intention of the Fianna Fáil Party, if they were returned to power, to remove the Garda Commissioner. I do not know the Garda Commissioner <Col N="1742" /> personally.  I have never had any personal dealings with him, although we live quite near to each other.  It was nothing short of disgraceful, in a country which prides itself on being a democracy, to subject any public servant to the process which was invoked in relation to Commissioner Garvey and to the humiliation which ensued. I know that some members of the Garda Síochána were at odds with the former Commissioner, but that does not constitute grounds for dismissal.  I know that some members of the Fianna Fáil Shadow Cabinet at that time were at odds with the Commissioner but that does not constitute grounds for dismissal.</P>

I have rarely harsh words to say about the Minister for Justice but he did not bring much credit on his office in his handling of the affair.  Commissioner Garvey, at least in this House, is owed a vindication simply <Col N="1743" /> as a public servant, to ensure that no future action taken by any Government will be carried out in the way this was carried out.  We have a fundamental obligation in the House to protect the servants of the State as much as to ensure that they discharge their responsibilities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen recent press reports regarding the Cavan Surgical Hospital. The provision of services at the Hospital is primarily a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board.  I am informed by the board that surgery had been temporarily suspended at this hospital while the consultant surgeon was on special leave pending completion of investigations into complaints received regarding the treatment of patients at the hospital.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer made the following report on the matter to the health board at their meeting on 21 May 1979:</P>
      <P>At earlier meetings, I informed the members of the Board of developments at Cavan Surgical Hospital and outlined the action which I proposed to take in light of these developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The independent investigating group of medically qualified persons <Col N="1745" /> established to inquire into specific cases of the care and treatment of patients under the charge of Mr. Hanna, County Surgeon, has now reported to me.  In many instances, it was not possible for the group to arrive at conclusions concerning the complaints.</P>
    <P>However, there are several significant aspects of the working of the hospital causing concern.  These were very difficult to define, but arose in the hospital in areas of management, support, communications and confidence. The findings, however, show no evidence of culpable negligence in relation to patient care on the part of Mr. Hanna.</P>
    <P>Solutions to the problems are being sought and a number of staffing arrangements are in the offing.</P>
    <P>Significant among these is the recommendation by the Local Appointments Commission of a second surgeon to the unit and it is hoped that the appointee will take up duty in the hospital on 1st July.  Mr. Hanna will be granted study leave and will be absent from the hospital for a period of approximately six months.</P>
    <P>We are continuing actively to seek a locum surgeon and are not admitting cases for surgery to the unit until we do so.  The family doctors in the area have been advised to this effect and arrangements have been made with hospitals in Monaghan, Navan, Drogheda and Dublin in relation to surgical patients.</P>
    <P>The health board discussed the report and endorsed the action taken by the chief executive officer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I take it that the report quoted by the Minister was intended to clarify the position.  I suggest that it actually creates more doubts and uncertainties than clarification.  In view of the fact that Mr. Hanna is apparently on six months study leave, will the Minister take steps, through the health board, to see that there is a locum surgeon there between now and 1 July?  If there is not a locum, there will be no surgical facilities in the hospital.  The Minister will appreciate <Col N="1746" /> that the absence of surgical facilities means that patients have to go to Navan, Drogheda, Dublin and Monaghan.  Does the Minister appreciate that patients who are just outside the health card category have to pay the cost of travelling to these hospitals three or four times?  Will he take steps to see that they are indemnified against that expense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I can do is assure the Deputy that the health board and the chief executive officers are making every effort and availing of every possibility open to them to ensure that the necessary level of surgical services is fully restored in Cavan at the earliest possible moment.  If there are any difficulties in regard to the cost of transport of any particular patients, I will ask the chief executive officer to look into these matters as sympathetically as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am grateful to the Minister.  I met a lady recently who told me she had to go back to Drogheda for a check up and was due to go there the following Wednesday but it would cost her £20 and she could not afford it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): No, she was just outside the category.  The Minister is aware that many people have lost their cards.  I do not want to drag this matter out but I ask him to understand that there is a serious, unsatisfactory situation there which has not in any way been clarified by the statement he read out.  I ask him to see that a locum is got immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The most up-to-date life expectancy information relates to the period 1970 to 1972.  This shows that, while there was an increase in male life expectancy at birth and at ages over 72 years, there was a decrease at other ages during the previous ten years.  The main reason for this decrease was an increase in mortality among middle-aged and older men.  Heart disease was the principal cause.  Cancer was also a contributing cause, together with an increase in deaths from accidents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Health, my responsibility for public investment in medical education relates to postgraduate education and training of doctors engaged in the provision of the health services.  Most of the cost involved is in respect of the salaries of approximately 1,500 doctors who at any one time are employed in training posts in hospitals.  As part of their postgraduate training these doctors, under the supervision of the consultant medical staff, also provide a substantial element of the service needs of the hospitals concerned.</P>

Voluntary organisations provide the bulk of the employment and supplement the disabled persons' allowance of the health boards by amounts varying from £2 to £12 per week.  The Rehabilitation Institute tell me that about half their workers get the top rate.  Persons getting only £2 per week would be working at a very low level in not much more than a care setting or in the early stages of activation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>These organisations provide printed matter for the health boards.  Is the Minister aware that the health boards are actually conspiring in the exploitation of these people by encouraging the work of these places in which they are paid such small amounts <Col N="1758" /> of money?  Would the Minister agree with such a policy of the health boards?</P>

      <P>It is not a question of the wages being low; it is a question of exploiting these poor people.  Would the Minister not take immediate steps to remedy this situation or stop it completely? To pay a person £2 per week is exploitation of less privileged and disabled people.  The Minister should never condone that.  When does he expect to take the necessary measures to stop this exploitation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if a time limit should be set to the presentation of health boards accounts in future and, if so, the time limit envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 to 20 together.</P>
      <P>The procedure followed up to now for the presentation of certified abstracts of accounts of health boards to the Houses of the Oireachtas was to present the abstracts of all health boards for a particular year simultaneously.  This led to delay in presentation until the audits of all the boards were completed.  Because of these delays, I reviewed this practice earlier this year.  As a result, it was decided to arrange for immediate presentation of all available certified abstracts. In future individual certified abstracts will be presented as they become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The presentation made on 26 April, <Col N="1761" /> 1979 included an abstract for 1976 for one health board.  I expect that the certified abstracts for the other seven health boards for 1976 and those for all boards for 1977 and 1978 will become available for presentation between now and April 1980.</P>
    <P>The certified abstracts are sent to the Minister for Health immediately following audit of the accounts.  As I have indicated, I propose for the future to arrange for presentation of each abstract as it becomes available.  It would seem inappropriate to set a time limit for presentation, since a situation could arise where factors outside the control of the Minister for Health could delay presentation beyond the fixed time limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>All available certified abstracts covering the years 1973 to 1976 were presented in April 1979, although the complete set of abstracts for all boards for any of these years is not available.  The presentation covered following accounts: Eastern Health Board, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976; Midland Health Board, 1973-74, 1974 and 1975; Mid-Western Health Board, 1973-74, 1974 and 1975; North-Eastern Health Board, 1973-74 and 1974; North-Western Health Board, 1973-74, 1974 and 1975; South-Eastern Health Board, 1973-74, 1974 and 1975; Southern Health Board, 1973-74, 1974 and 1975.

    <P>I am advised that everything possible has been done both to care for the <Col N="1764" /> children affected by the outbreak and to trace the source of it.  Investigations in this respect have eliminated such possible causative factors as methyl bromide and the water supply and, on the basis of the information available, I am satisfied that there is not a major cause for concern for the health of the children.  Some of the children had mild enterovirus infection which caused stomach upsets, and circumstances within the classes involved may have combined to produce a psychological reaction in other children, which quickly cleared up.</P>

      <P>The value of butter vouchers was originally increased for the months of February, March and April as an interim measure pending the payment of the budget increases in certain social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Because of the difficulties encountered by a number of social welfare recipients as a result of the disruption in the postal services the increase in the value of the vouchers has been extended for the month of May.  As the budget increases were designed to provide a real improvement in the living standards of social welfare recipients after taking account of any increase in the consumer price index, the intention is that the vouchers will revert to their original value when all recipients receive the benefit of these increases.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment exchanges, which were originally created to provide an employment service, are now intended, since the transfer of the employment function to the National Manpower Service, to provide an adequate service in the administration of the schemes of unemployment benefit and assistance for which my Department is responsible. Together with their affiliated branch offices, the exchanges form a network of over 120 offices situated at suitable points throughout the country.  Their efficacy <Col N="1767" /> is kept under continuous review and I propose to provide additional exchanges in suitable areas in the Dublin suburbs in the near future.</P>

I consider that this arrangement is in the best interests of the great majority of persons benefiting under the scheme.

      <P>The special needs of widows are kept under review by my Department with a view to effecting such improvements as are practicable and feasible within the limit of available resources.  It is the stated policy of the Government to maintain the living standards of all social welfare recipients by regular adjustments of the level of payments, at least in line with the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already this year widows' pensions in line with all other social pensions were increased by 16 per cent as from the beginning of last month.  In addition the following improvements, details of which were announced at Budget time, were made in the means test for widow's non-contributory pensions: (a) increase from £100 to £200 in the amount of capital not assessed as means, (b) removal of upper age limit for the receipt of widow's non-contributory pension, in line with widow's contributory pension, (c) all unearned <Col N="1774" /> income of a widow's children disregarded, (d) dwelling houses and farm buildings discounted for means purposes, (e) commencement of phased removal of anomaly in regard to means limits for reduced rates of pension.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why the EEC Regulations allowing Irish people returning from England to claim benefit on the basis of their United Kingdom insurance record require that they must work here for a time before claiming benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirement that a person returning from England must work here for a period before claiming unemployment benefit arises from the provisions of the EEC Regulations on the social security of migrant workers which require that such persons must first become subject to Irish social insurance before they can claim benefit in this country.</P>
      <P>Once the person concerned becomes subject to Irish social insurance, by becoming insurably employed here for some period no matter how short, the regulations provide that his previous social insurance in the United Kingdom or any other member state may be aggregated with his Irish insurance for the purposes of his claim to benefit.</P>
      <P>The position I have described normally applies throughout the Community to any worker who moves from one member state to another and who claims unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this, I understand, is to ensure that liability for benefit will not fall on the social insurance funds of a State to which the claimant may never have contributed.</P>

      <P>The question of the rates of payment of social welfare pensions of other member states, in the light of currency fluctuations, has been the subject of constant discussions between the countries of the EEC since its inception but no satisfactory solution has yet been found.</P>
      <P>On the entry of this country into the European Monetary System in March last it was agreed with the British postal authorities that, as a temporary measure, British pensioners in this country and Irish pensioners in Britain would continue to be paid their pensions at post offices at the rates shown on their pension books.</P>
      <P>At that time there was only a slight difference in the exchange rates and this arrangement was regarded as the most equitable method of payment for pensioners in both countries.  It also has the advantage of saving the pensioners any currency exchange charges for which they would ordinarily be liable if pensions were paid otherwise than at the post offices.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I had just risen to speak <Col N="1792" /> when we reached 1.30 and the House adjourned.  The Bill we are discussing is a Bill entitled an Act to provide for certain validations arising out of the dismissal of Commissioner Edmund Garvey and the attempted appointment of his successor, Commissioner McLaughlin. The facts which led to this Bill do not confer any great glory on the Minister for Justice or the Government.</P>
      <P>The former commissioner of the Garda Síochána, Mr. Garvey, was wrongly dismissed without notice, without reason and without an opportunity to defend himself.  The decision to dismiss him was obviously made and implemented in a hurry.  It is hard to see why there was such a hurry because I believe the decision was on the cards a considerable time before that.  When Deputy O'Keeffe opened the debate for this party this morning he asked the Minister if before the last election he had taken a decision to dismiss Mr. Garvey or if anybody on his behalf had done so. The Minister stated that he had taken no such decision, or had given no such public notice or had no knowledge of it. I presume that report will appear in tomorrow's newspapers.  Thousands of people all over the country will not accept that they will become more cynical of politicians and that is bad for democracy and the country.  I say that because it is a well-known fact that before the last general election canvassers of the Minister's party canvassed certain houses on the basis that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power Commissioner Garvey would be removed from office.  That is common knowledge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I know thousands of people will not accept the Minister's denial of <Col N="1793" /> knowledge for the reasons I have given. Part of the Fianna Fáil campaign was conducted on the basis that Commissioner Garvey would be removed from office if Fianna Fáil were returned to office.</P>
      <P>Commissioner Garvey was removed from office in January 1978.  He brought an action in the High Court&mdash; not a simple, wrongful dismissal action as the Minister would in his introductory speech lead us to believe&mdash;for a declaration, among other things, that he was wrongfully removed from office because he had been denied his fundamental and constitutional rights in that he was removed from office without notice, without being given any reasons and without being given an opportunity to defend himself.  The Supreme Court held by a majority of four to one that the attempted dismissal of Commissioner Garvey was null and void and of no effect because he had been denied his natural and fundamental rights by the Government.  That is the enormity of this case.  We had the Chief of Police, the officer holding one of the most important public posts in this country, being thrown out like a dog, removed from office, without being afforded his natural and fundamental rights of defending himself.  That is a very serious situation because the Government of the day are bound to uphold the Constitution, to uphold the laws of the land and to afford to civil servants and others the protection that the laws and the Constitution give them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it on the record of this House that the Government must have known they were violating the constitutional and natural rights of Commissioner Garvey.  An ordinary five-eighths in the street would not be excused for committing a wrongful act if his only excuse was that he did not know the law. There is an old maxim we all learned as students, <i>ignorantia legis neminem excusat</i>, which means ignorance of the law is no excuse.  In this case the Government must have known the law because several decided cases were quoted in the Supreme Court in support of Commissioner Garvey's case.  The most recent case was as recent as 1971, the case of <Col N="1794" /> Ian Ray Haughey, which is reported in Irish Reports.  In that case the law which guided the Supreme Court in Commissioner Garvey's case was laid down then by the then Chief Justice, the late Mr. Justice O Dalaigh, in very clear terms.</P>
    <P>There are other cases on record which substantiated and laid down the law as applied by the Supreme Court in this case.  One would think, listening to the Minister for Justice this morning, that the Government were taken by surprise, that the Supreme Court had created new law, and I would not be going too far if I were to say, that they laid down law which the Minister and the Government do not accept.  That is not the case.  The law is well settled and is well known.  The Government, in violation of that law and in the teeth of those decisions, decided that they would dismiss Commissioner Garvey at two hours' notice without ever mentioning the word resignation, retirement or dismissal to him, as the Minister admitted this morning.</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed to run his case on the basis that the Government were in some way taken by surprise and that the Supreme Court decision was a short cut that prejudiced them.  I want to protest in the strongest possible terms against that.  If anybody outside this House made the speech the Minister made this morning, it would be bordering on contempt of court.  The Minister made a lot of play about the fact that the appeal brought from the High Court to the Supreme Court was on what he called a preliminary issue.  There was only one issue in this case and it was not a preliminary issue.  Commissioner Garvey in his statement of claim pleaded that he was wrongfully dismissed because he was not given notice, he was not given reasons for his dismissal and he was not given an opportunity of defending himself.  The Government in their defence simply and solely relied on the Garda Síochána Act, 1925, which they claimed gave them the right to dismiss Commissioner Garvey without notice, without reasons and without giving him an opportunity of defending himself.  That was the only issue in this case and that was the issue that went to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1795" /> The Minister was critical of the Supreme Court and seemed to be making great play of the fact that some sort of preliminary point went to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court can only adjudicate on questions of law on acts, facts that are either proved in the High Court or admitted by the parties in the Supreme Court.  In this case the facts were admitted.  The facts were that Mr. Garvey said he was dismissed without notice, without reason and was given no chance of defending himself.  The Government said: &ldquo;We agree but we were entitled to do that by virtue of the 1925 Act.&rdquo;  That was the only issue before the Supreme Court.  Lawyers and, I am sure, Ministers know that there is vast scope for alternative pleading in defence.  For example, in a murder case a person may plead: &ldquo;I did not kill A and, if I did kill him, I killed him in self-defence and I did not use any more force than was necessary.&rdquo;  That is a simple example of alternative pleading.  There are other alternative pleadings in running down actions where a man says: &ldquo;I did not own the motor car; I was not there&rdquo; and &ldquo;If I did own the motor car and I was there, I did not drive too fast.&rdquo; That is alternative pleading.  But the Government here, having the best brains in the country behind them, did not choose to put in any alternative pleading in their defence: they simply relied on the 1925 Act to dismiss this man on two hours' notice without reason and without giving him any chance to defend himself.</P>
    <P>The Government bungled Commissioner Garvey's dismissal and if we take seriously the Minister's contribution this morning, they bungled the defence of the action brought by Mr. Garvey against them, putting it at its best, if what the Minister says is right.  This Government could be regarded as the Government of bunglers because we have one bungle after another from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This Bill invites the House to validate retrospectively everything Commissioner McLaughlin did or authorised to be done when he was appointed in January 1978 until he was reappointed on 15 May 1979. Retrospective legislation is bad at any time; it is undesirable.  But when we have, as we have here, an attempt to validate retrospectively actions relating to the personal and perhaps fundamental rights of members of the Garda Síochána who have been dismissed, demoted, retired or asked to retire, it is a very serious thing.</P>
      <P>We also have here an invitation to the House to validate retrospectively defective proofs in criminal cases.  It is unthinkable. The Minister is not entitled to come here with this form of blank cheque validation and ask the House to vote him these extraordinary powers.  When the Minister spoke this morning he outlined some of the things that would need validation.  For example, a person who was arrested under the 1939 Act can be held for 24 hours and, if he is then to be held for a further 24 hours, the extension must be authorised by a chief superintendent or by somebody authorised by the commissioner to discharge the duties of chief superintendent under this Act.  I want the Minister to say if any such people have been held for 48 hours under the direction of a superintendent under the authority of Commissioner McLaughlin.  If they were, I suggest they were wrongfully detained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My next question to the Minister is: did any of those people make statements while in custody for the second 24 hours and, if so, were any of them convicted on foot of those statements, because in my opinion if they did make statements during the second 24 hours and were convicted on foot of such statements their conviction could not possibly stand because I think there have been decisions of the courts in recent times that such statements are not voluntary statements, not admissible and not admitted. <Col N="1797" /> We are being inivited to validate that.  It is impossible for me to go through all the Acts of Parliament and find out the duties that a commissioner might exercise in relation to criminal prosecutions or the duties he might authorise somebody else to discharge in that regard; but if there are any such&mdash;I have outlined one of them&mdash;we are being invited to validate them here.  That is wrong and the House should not be asked to do it.</P>
    <P>I do not know if any members of the Garda Síochána have been dismissed on the authority of Commissioner McLaughlin but I believe members were dismissed between January 1978 and May 1979 and it might well be held&mdash;I am not saying this as a matter that is as positive as the last one&mdash;that their dismissal is wrongful and, on bringing a case to the courts, such dismissal might be held to be wrongful.</P>
    <P>In my opinion this Bill will lead to a chapter of legal actions of one sort or another, constitutional and otherwise.  Have any people, members of the Garda Síochána or otherwise, suffered as a result of the wrongful dismissal of Commissioner Garvey and the wrongful appointment of Commissioner McLaughlin?  Have there been any promotions within the Garda Síochána which could be questioned?  Have any people been passed over who might have expected promotion if there has not been a change?  Is it a fact that a panel of people suitable for promotion from the position of superintendent to that of chief superintendent is drawn up each year by a selection board appointed by the commissioner? Is it a fact that the panel drawn up by that selection board is valid for approximately 12 months?  Was there a panel of superintendents suitable for promotion to the position of chief superintendent decided upon by a selection board set up in a normal way during the last months of Commissioner Garvey's term of office?  Were there any vacancies for chief superintendents in existence during that time?  Were these vacancies filled by superintendents on the panel drawn up by the selection board?  I would ask the Minister to give this information in his reply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1798" /> Was the panel ignored during the last months of Commissioner Garvey's term of office because the Government did not appoint a chief superintendent?  Was another selection board prematurely set up shortly after Commissioner McLaughlin wrongfully assumed office and did they draw up another panel of superintendents suitable for promotion to the rank of chief superintendent? Did the second panel consist of superintendents who had not applied for a number of years previously, even before the term of office of Commissioner Garvey?  Were the superintendents on that second panel deemed suitable for promotion instead of those on the panel drawn up in the normal way by the selection board set up by Commissioner Garvey?  Were they promoted while the people on the previous panel were ignored and passed over?  Is this the case?  If so, it is something the House should not be asked to validate without a more detailed and acceptable explanation.</P>
    <P>I would not be a party to validating it, as I would not be a party to validating a prison sentence on somebody who should be at large today if the law as it stood at the time of his conviction and sentence were known and applied.  People can be convicted of a criminal offence only under the law as it stands and on proofs which are acceptable to the court at the time of conviction.  Such people having been convicted on defective proofs and sentenced, it is wrong that we should be asked retrospectively to say that the proofs were in order and that it was right to extend the terms of detention.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with an extremely serious matter concerning whether the head of the police was properly dismissed and whether his successor was properly appointed.  Above all we are being asked to give a blanket ratification and validation to every act carried out by the present commissioner during the period from January 1978 to May 1979. I can see that some form of legislation is necessary to get the Government out of this mess, but the procedure proposed here is certainly not acceptable.  There should be a Schedule to this Bill and at <Col N="1799" /> least each category, if not each act that the Bill seeks to validate, should be spelled out.  The House would then know what it should validate and what it should not.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of this Bill states:</P>
    <P>Everything (including the satisfying of any condition precedent to the exercise or performance of a power or duty) done, or purporting to have been done, during the period from the 20th day of January, 1978, to the 14th day of May, 1979, by, to or on behalf or in respect of Patrick McLaughlin or any other person shall be, and be deemed always to have been, as valid and effectual as if the said Patrick McLaughlin had been validly and effectually appointed to be Commissioner of the Garda Síochána on the said 20th day of January, 1978; and the pay and other conditions of service of the said Patrick McLaughlin as a member of the Garda Síochána shall be, and be deemed always to have been, as if he had been so appointed on the last-mentioned day.</P>
    <P>Nothing could be more comprehensive than that or more nearly presented in the form of a blank cheque.  Some form of legislation is necessary, but I have no sympathy for the Government and the Minister for Justice because of the mess in which they find themselves.  They brought it on themselves because of the preconceived ideas which the Minister for Justice had on assuming office.  I regret to have to say that.</P>

This form of legislation is not the right way to go about this matter. Let the Minister bring in a Bill every <Col N="1802" /> fortnight to validate actions of the commissioner he wrongfully appointed and let those Bills be considered by the House.  It is unheard of and an outrageous performance to bring in such an omnibus piece of legislation.  It was wrong to introduce it with a speech that was obviously couched in blackmailing terms.  It was wrong of the Minister to make further threats of blackmail against a former Minister who is still a respected Member of the Oireachtas. The Minister should not treat Senator Cooney as he has treated Commissioner Garvey, by giving him no chance to defend himself and throwing him out by the back of the neck.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Minister is well aware that I am speaking about Commissioner Garvey who was thrown out by the back of the neck at two hours' notice.  Not alone has Commissioner Garvey been wrongfully dismissed and denied his constitutional and fundamental rights, but he has been badly treated also.  He was in the Garda Síochána for 40 years and rose through the ranks without putting a foot wrong.  He was treated in a disgraceful fashion.  It is a good job that we have the courts to protect men like him.  I have known Commissioner McLaughlin since he was a young guard and the unkindest thing that could have been done to him was what the Minister did, to appoint him improperly so that he, through no fault of his own, finds himself in the middle of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" /> Our citizens as a last resort rely on the courts for protection, the most important of those being the Supreme Court, and it is a sorry day for Ireland when the Minister for Justice by innuendo and implication attacks the Supreme Court as he did today.  The Supreme Court decided that Commissioner Garvey had been deprived of his natural and constitutional rights by a majority of four to one.  The Government could not accept that decision and tried to wobble and waffle.  They went back to the Supreme Court for an interpretation of that court's decision and got that interpretation, not by a majority of four to one but by a unanimous decision of the four judges.  In the light of that it is disgraceful that the Minister who bungled the dismissal of Commissioner Garvey badly, and slandered the other team, as a last resort should beat the referee.  There is no use in the Minister accusing his legal advisers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister invoked with a lot of respect the <i>sub judice</i> rule in the course of his speech.  This is a rule which is recognised in this House as a matter of courtesy&mdash;although there certainly is no other reason for recognising it, because no legal proceedings can ensue in respect of things said in the House&mdash;and recognised outside the House as a matter of law because a breach of the rule may amount to contempt of court.  But we must get it clear in our minds what the <i>sub judice</i> rule means and what its purpose is.  It is mentioned here as though it were a sacred thing with almost religious dimensions, as though the mere fact that a situation or an element of anything at all happened to feature in any shape or form in any sort of court proceedings in any part of the country at any time prevented anything being said about it here.  The <i>sub judice</i> rule and the rule about contempt of court is part of the ordinary Common Law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be debating something with the Chair.  The Chair <Col N="1804" /> suggests that the Deputy take this matter to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges.  It is a rule that is as old as the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the Minister's speech.  There is no one in the House I have more regard for than the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but he torments me on a matter like this.  It would not have crossed my mind to mention the <i>sub judice</i> rule had the Minister not sanctimoniously invoked it to excuse himself for not giving the full background which, as Deputies Fitzpatrick and O'Keeffe said, is simply known now as innuendo.  The Minister said &ldquo;I could, if I would, if I dared, but I cannot because it is <i>sub judice</i> and I am a good boy and will respect the rule so that I cannot tell of all the dirt I could fire out if I were allowed to do so&rdquo;.  I will give way to the Minister, provided I can get back again, if the Minister wishes to give us the background now.</P>
      <P>The <i>sub judice</i> rule has been made relevant by a vital part of the Minister's speech.  The Constitution says that no proceedings can be had, criminal or civil in any court at all, in respect of anything said in this or in the other House.  The purpose of that is not to allow licence for loose and long tongues.  The purpose of it is so that Members of these Houses can speak their minds freely and without the fear of criminal prosecutions or actions in which they may be ruined from an award of damages.  That privilege ought not to be abused and any comment on court proceedings which takes the form of abuse, which is something which would be objectional even outside the House, naturally ought to attract the sanction of the Chair.  But this thing about the <i>sub judice</i> rule has gone beyond all bounds in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the case that the courts are in any way prejudiced, offended or affronted or that their function is called into question or diminished in any way by reference being made to a case before them.  The purpose of the rule is to protect the integrity of the courts and so as not to subject the judges to pressure along the lines of us telling them what they should do.  Any Member of the <Col N="1805" /> House who took it upon himself to lecture judges about what they should do would be abusing the privilege of the House, but any Member who merely makes a comment about something which the Minister is free to say outside the House is not doing so, and when the Minister piously invokes the <i>sub judice</i> rule in relation to something he is free to discuss outside the House I have to ask myself if the thing has not gone beyond all bounds.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, on pages 9 and 10 of his speech:</P>
    <P>I said, at the beginning of my statement, that I would return to the question of the initial decision of the Government and to the circumstances in which a decision of the Supreme Court was sought by both sides in the legal proceedings.  I do not, however&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;one could nearly see the incense arising from the halo balanced on his ears&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;consider it appropriate to go into these matters in any detail, at all events on this occasion, and for a number of reasons.  One of the reasons, and a sufficient one by itself alone, is that certain important related issues are before the High Court and, in accordance with long established practice, we ought to avoid issues that are <i>sub judice.</i></P>
    <P>That is not a proper view of what <i>sub judice</i> is all about.  The Minister is absolutely entitled to state, not only here but outside, his side of the case.  The Minister can print his side of the story in a newspaper and he will not be in contempt of court.  The Minister is entitled to defend himself in or out of court or in or out of the House.  To try to avoid saying what the House wants to debate, namely, what led up to the Garvey dismissal, by saying &ldquo;this is still before the courts and since I am devoted to protocol and to the rules of the House, I will not say anything at all about it&rdquo; is unworthy of the Minister.  I do not wish to use hard words about a Minister whom I find it hard to dislike.  I suspect that there is some termite either in the Minister's party or in his team of advisers <Col N="1806" /> who told him that this was a cute way out of the difficulty, which a Minister, if he had been Senator Cooney, would have faced up to and led with his chin in dealing with it.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the Minister should not tell his side of the story in here.  It would be quite a different thing to threaten the courts or say to the High Court that they must decide in a certain way, but there is no reason why the Minister should not tell the story.  I could be wrong, as the present Attorney General was wrong in the Garvey incident, or as the lawyers on the Government front benches&mdash;the Taoiseach, a barrister, the Minister for Finance a solicitor, the Minister for Forestry and Fisheries a barrister, Deputy Haughey, also a qualified barrister, Deputy O'Malley, a solicitor and Deputy O'Kennedy, a barrister who practised up to the day the Government was formed&mdash;are wrong; but to represent the <i>sub judice</i> rule as forbidding a litigant&mdash;and the Minister is in the position of a litigant&mdash;from telling a story as freely as he likes when and where he chooses is a misrepresentation of the rule.</P>
    <P>To try to point to the courts what they should do or to insinuate that they are not doing their job or are likely to make a wrong decision is an affront and should be discouraged, although even there a situation could arise in which it might be in the public interest that a Minister or a Deputy spoke his mind on a court decision about which he thought little.  This is a free country, which means that it is possible not only to speak one's mind about political parties but also about court proceedings, provided one stops short of bringing pressure, even moral pressure in the sense of telling the judges how to perform their function.  It is in the interests of all of us that no one should be allowed to pressurise the courts, but once the courts have made a decision one should be able to speak one's mind about it.  That is part of what freedom is all about and it is part of and not far from what I had occasion to say at the time of the row between the then President Ó Dálaigh and the then Minister for Defence.  There is far too much pietistical half sincere respect paid <Col N="1807" /> to totemistic concepts which were inherited from the British, but invested by the Irish with the peculiar sham and humbug which flourishes in a country which has been ruled during nearly all my lifetime by the party opposite.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the Minister should not have told his story.  What is central to this story&mdash;and if I am wrong the Minister can stuff it down my throat&mdash;was the political need of the Government to deliver on the whispered promises which they had been making to the Garda Síochána before the election. That and nothing else is what is central to this story.  It is because I consider that such an unworthy history and background that I have not one blind bit of sympathy for the Minister in the mess in which he finds himself.  I realise that all around him there is nothing to be seen but Ministers waist deep in trouble of all description, so that Minister Collins is no exception.  All he has to do is to look around him and he will see Ministers who can barely show their heads, so unpopular have they made themselves and their party in Government. I have not one blind bit of sympathy for him in this problem because it arose, not because of a genuine mistake or difficulty which arose between the Government after it was formed and the Commissioner whom they found awaiting them in the Phoenix Park; it arose out of a political commitment which they gave, admittedly not in their manifesto&mdash;although it would not have been any more valuable had it been in the manifesto&mdash;but which they gave via whispers before the election, that if Fianna Fáil got back, that would be the end of Commissioner Garvey.  That has to be said.  I followed most of the debate here this morning.</P>

      <P>The Chair has already ruled against giving reasons.  These are matters for the court. The Deputy has made his case about what is <i>sub judice</i> and what is not.  What the Chair is dealing with is the practice of the House down the years and the Chair must adhere to that practice. Those are the rules of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, I shall not labour this point.  But this is not a case of an unlucky mistake.  Let us say that, by an oversight, the Government order which purported to appoint Commissioner McLaughlin had not been sealed with a Government seal&mdash;I am not sure exactly by what instrument the Commissioner is appointed&mdash;but if the instrument had not been perfected according to the relevant rules, the appointment would have been just as invalid as if there had been no commissionership to appoint to, which is what was the case here because the commissionership was already occupied by a man whose purported sacking was ineffectual.  If it was an unlucky mistake, an accident, this Bill would have been through the House in 30 seconds, all Stages; the Minister knows that.  But if ever a Minister or Government asked for this special trouble, they asked for it.  I do not want to bring Greek tragedy into the picture, but there is something peculiarly fitting about what has happened to them in this instance. All the components of the Greek tragedy are there, the hubris, the overbearing, arrogant pride with which they stepped into office and proceeded to step high wide and handsome about them, sacking a commissioner here, purporting to fulfil promises which they were only laughing at the people for believing, such as that about the ground rents.  And now the nemesis: the pit which they dug for Commissioner Garvey they have fallen into themselves. I have not a bit of sympathy for them and neither has anybody else on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I recognise that the Minister opposite me here cannot be made to carry personally 100 per cent of the blame for this.  He is part of a collective authority.  It may be that the advice on which that particular authority acted was mistaken, and anybody can make a mistake, a lawyer or otherwise.  But when I find that the Minister this morning confronts us with a speech like this, if ever I was inclined to have any sympathy with him, that inclination would be dissolved absolutely.  I had better not use impolite language but, when the Minister talks about the Government losing confidence in Mr. Garvey as <Col N="1809" /> Commissioner, that really touches bottom in disingenuousness.</P>
    <P>I will tell the House when the Government lost confidence in Mr. Garvey; they lost confidence in him around the month of April 1977, before they were in office at all.  They lost confidence in him, not because they had ever experience of him as Commissioner, which they had not, on the contrary&mdash;as Deputy Harte and Deputy O'Keeffe said here earlier&mdash;they had promoted him, all the promotions he had had been from them.  They lost confidence in him because they were getting a feedback from the ranks before the election campaign that the methods of discipline which Commissioner Garvey stood for and was applying were not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I am not a member of the Garda and I do not want to make any comment on those methods of discipline.  The resentment against them may have been proper or improper.  But I do say&mdash;and I have said it in the House before&mdash;that the Minister is buying big trouble for himself in the future&mdash;what we have today will be proved to have been only a trailer&mdash;if he ever allows it to be said or thought that a disciplined force on which the State depends is able to get rid of their own boss.  I read the editorial in the Garda Síochána <i>Review</i> in its next issue after the physical departure of Commissioner Garvey from the Phoenix Park.  It made sorry reading; because it came through clearly as if it had been written in black and white that the force considered that they had been material in effecting this change at the top.</P>
    <P>There are things I do not want to prejudge or offer any comment on, because I do not know anything about them.  I do not know whether or not Commissioner Garvey was a correct disciplinarian.  It is admitted on all sides that he was doing his job with honesty, honour and sincerity, but it may be that his disciplinary methods were not apt ones for the year 1977 or 1978.  The world has changed and perhaps one cannot employ discipline in the same way nowadays as once one could.  That may be the case.  It may be the case that the personnel in the various ranks of the Garda who were subordinate to him and who had to put <Col N="1810" /> up with these disciplinary methods were entitled to feel aggrieved.  It may be the case that they had a genuine and correct grievance.  If so, it should have been dealt with with something more than the lack of feeling and instinct which we have met here.  Most certainly it should not, even at the cost of perpetuating for the couple of years which remained to him until his retirement, even at that cost, it should not be given to a disciplined force in this or any other country to say that they can call the tune to the extent of being able to dispose of their commanding officer.</P>
    <P>I said here some six months ago in a different connection that if my interpretation of what happened is correct&mdash;maybe it is not correct&mdash;but if it is correct the Minister has bought big trouble for himself and for the rest of the country as well.  If the Garda are allowed to feel at election time that they can bring pressure of this kind to bear and that the biggest party in the country are willing to respond to them, would have crawled on their hands and knees to them in order to get their votes and those of their families and relations, what will they do next time round?  What promises will they expect from Fine Gael and the Labour Party?  What competing promises will be expected from Fianna Fáil, not alone for the Garda but for everybody else in the country?  The Minister and his party may have bought a few thousand votes in that way.  If I am correct in my interpretation of this history, this is the beginning only of the harvest they are reaping.  Perhaps it is not a question of treachery, but there is an Irish seanfhocal which I think I remember learning in school: filleann an feall ar an bhfeallaire.  If ever there was an ill deed which rebounded on the people who perpetuated it, this is an example.</P>
    <P>I want to say this to the Minister&mdash;and again I do not offer it as the last word in legal knowledge or anything else; I may be absolutely wrong about this&mdash;this technique we are adopting in the House here today has never yet been constitutionally tested.  I know there have been Acts which purported to validate, which I suppose may <Col N="1811" /> have validated, which with the lapse of time unquestionably did validate procedures which were defective in the past.  It must be so in a country which consists of human beings, in which mistakes can happen and, unless they can be put right retrospectively, disorder is the result.  But I do want to point out to the Minister and his advisers that the technique he is adopting here has never met a head-on constitutional challenge. For some reason, perhaps accidental only, no constitutional challenge has ever been presented head-on to an enactment of this kind; or at least, if it has, it escapes my recollection.  For example, we had here in 1923, after the Civil War, an Indemnity Act, which purported to render non-actionable, if I remember correctly, whatever might have been done without lawful authority by the agents or forces of the Provisional Government or of the Irish Free State Government.  It was a very drastic and wide-ranging Act.  I have often wondered&mdash;merely as an academic exercise&mdash;what constitutional authority there could be, at least in the present constitutional climate, for the passage of an Act of Indemnity which would effectively attempt to legalise that which was illegal.</P>
    <P>I want to give the Minister my view for what it is worth.  Perhaps it can be done, and perhaps the Minister may get the Supreme Court to say it can be done but I would not regard it by any means as an open-and-closed question.  I would not regard it as settled beyond dispute because it never has been, so far as I know, argued out by any of our modern courts here, whether it is open to the State, retrospectively, to make legal that which is illegal.</P>
    <P>I stated that where an irregularity occurs, which is accidental&mdash;I gave the instance of forgetting to sign or seal some appointments&mdash;validating Acts and sections in other Acts that nobody bothers much about because they are lost or not well known has to be possible. I do not expect an answer from the Minister because I do not know what the answer about it is.  I believe the Minister is not shut of this matter when he leaves <Col N="1812" /> the House today, if he gets out of it today, because there are acts of Mr. McLaughlin which may have been done without lawful authority.  Many of them were acts which in their nature were not apt to cause a grievance on the part of any citizen.  Many of them were acts which would not have impinged in such a way on a citizen as to cause him to litigate or to feel a sense of grievance.  I do not know if he has a function in regard to describing the areas where double yellow lines are painted on the streets or something of that kind.  Even there, the possibility of something being agreed, for instance, a business concern who suddenly find their customers cannot park, are not to be entirely excluded.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Barry is right even that instance will lend some weight to what I am saying.  Many of the acts of Mr. McLaughlin would not cause anybody any grievance and would not have given anybody cause for complaint. But what about the acts of Mr. McLaughlin which may have caused grievance?  They are in a quite different category because at the time they were done, although they were innocently done as far as Mr. McLaughlin was concerned, they were done in the purported exercise of an authority which it was not his to exercise, and which still resided in Commissioner Garvey.</P>
      <P>I am sure if Deputy Harte is right in detecting two hands in the Minister's speech, one a fine Italian one and the other a Limerick one.  The earlier part of the Minister's speech contains the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no injustice to anybody in the restrospective validation of those authorisations since they are authorisations that would have been granted, in accordance with well-established practice, irrespective of who was commissioner, and the invalidity <Col N="1813" /> of Mr. McLaughlin's original appointment has no material relevance to the decisions taken by the relevant superintendents.</P>
    <P>Sherlock Holmes used a rather pompous little expression when he was hot on the trail of something in the gaslight and fogs of Victorian London.  He used to say: &ldquo;You may have heard of any little reputation I may possess.  I will stake it all on the fact that your story is an absolute fabrication&rdquo;.  Every lawyer feels that he knows a little about his subject.  I do not mind staking anything I feel I know about my subject on the assertion that that sentence is completely wrong. It is correct only in the sense in which the word injustice might be used in a church or on a political platform but it is not correct in a legal setting.</P>
    <P>The Minister must not forget that people are not entitled to justice.  If they can get justice, well and good.  What they are entitled to is the benefit of the law and the last letter of the law.  They are entitled to the last morsel that can be extracted from the letter of the law.  That is what is meant by the rule of the law. While I know what the Minister means in a general sort of way when he says that many of the authorisations he is talking about here&mdash;I realise also that it is only a restricted field of the commissioner's functions which is in play in this part of the speech&mdash;and a lot of what happened under Mr. McLaughlin would have happened anyway no matter who was commissioner and, therefore, somebody cannot complain, that is not true in the legal sense.</P>
    <P>If I have committed a break-in, stolen a car or committed some offence and I am tried for it, convicted and sentenced to some penalty and I find afterwards that the judge who presided over my trial, conviction and sentence was dressed up as a judge, that he kidnapped the real judge and took his place on the bench that day and that the whole thing was a farce from start to finish, still in a sense no injustice was done.  Even if there had been a proper judge on the bench the same thing would have happened to me.</P>
    <P>But that is not the point relevant to a lawyer because a lawyer is entitled to extract <Col N="1814" /> the utmost morsel from the law for the benefit of his client.  A citizen is entitled to the last morsel for his own benefit.  If a citizen finds that he has been tried in front of a judge, whose appointment was invalid, the whole series of steps, the conviction, the sentence, the committal order which flow from that, are equally invalid.  It is as though they all hung like a chain from the heavens and if you cut through one link of the chain high up, all the rest fall into the sea.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not believe me he will find that this point was made actually in regard to the appointment of a judge in 1951 by a litigant called Killian, who alleged&mdash;it was an academic point&mdash;that the judge by whom he had been tried for arson or something like that, had not been properly appointed. The reason he said he had not been properly appointed was that the courts which the Constitution envisaged were intended to be set up immediately after the enactment of the Constitution, and by 1951 they still had not been set up, so that whoever was still purporting to function as a judge was not in fact properly appointed at all.</P>
    <P>That might seem a dim argument to a layman or a dim argument to a Minister willing to say that no injustice had been done because this or that would have happened anyway.  The Supreme Court took it as a serious legal argument.  They made it quite clear, by taking it seriously, that, had he succeeded in establishing&mdash;he lost because of his interpretation of the Constitution&mdash;that Judge McCarthy before whom he was tried had not been properly appointed, his conviction and his sentence would have been gone.</P>
    <P>It is no good saying that no injustice has been done.  To say a citizen is not entitled to justice does not explain what his rights are.  He is entitled to justice, so far as the law can give it to him.  If he is the recipient of a disposition on the side of a governmental authority, a police commissioner or anybody else, unless the State can show an unbroken link of authority between the disposition which requires from him the payment of a £10 fine, to the summit, unless all these steps represent an unbroken series of chains, <Col N="1815" /> without any weak link, the citizen is entitled to exploit the weak link in regard to what has been done to him as unlawful. The courts are there to assert that it is unlawful and to assert his right and to extract the uttermost drop from the law in his favour.</P>
    <P>The consequence of the situation so far as concerns Mr. McLaughlin and the person who is still Commissioner Garvey, innocent though Mr. McLaughlin is in this regard, is that there may be people who were aggrieved by things done under Mr. McLaughlin.  I am saying this as a category quite separate from things which were not a source of contention.  Deputy Barry mentioned yellow lines, but let us assume that never happened.  Taxi licences are highly contentious and I will deal with them in a moment.  If something was done by Mr. McLaughlin at the time when he had no authority, that person has the right to feel aggrieved.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, let us look at somebody passed over for promotion.  In consequence of the first of several names on the recommended list having been ignored and subsequent names substituted in their place, the people aggrieved by that proceeding might have had, and perhaps still have, a right of action in respect of the illegality of the appointments which were purported to be made.</P>
    <P>I know the Bill is intended to put an end to all this.  I know the purpose of the Bill is to deprive these people retrospectively of any possible right of action; but that is just the point at which the difficulties begin.  Can it do that?  I am not so much concerned here with the validity of the appointments of the inspectors or sergeants who were promoted.  I am concerned with the grievance which might be felt by those who were not.  I am also concerned with the people who applied for taxi driving licences who were refused them or conversely with the rights of existing taxi drivers who objected to new licences being granted.</P>
    <P>The Minister probably realises that the atmosphere of the Supreme Court these days is very different from what it was 20 years ago.  There is a very adventurous <Col N="1816" /> bench there now.  They have built up whole new structures of rights which were undreamed of when I was a student or even when I was at the bar.  One of these rights is the right to earn a livelihood.  These are rights which are not mentioned in the Constitution, but are held now to be latent in the guarantees of Article 40.3.  Corollary to the right of earning a livelihood is the right to embark on a career, train for a career and so on.  In its application&mdash;and sooner or later it will be so applied&mdash;to a career which is part of a hierarchial structure, in which there is such a thing as promotion from step to step, I would say that the Supreme Court would not have any difficulty in holding that the right to a career and livelihood carried with it the right to fair chance of promotion.</P>
    <P>I make no reflection, good or bad, or pass no comment, good or bad, on the quality, correctness or wisdom of the promotions or refusals to promote.  They may have been very wise decisions for all I know.  All I am saying is that a man who was passed over for promotion, or a taxi driver who was refused a licence or who might feel aggrieved by the fact that somebody was granted one, realises that the disposition about which he felt aggrieved was one without lawful authority.  Therefore, he may have a right of action to ask the courts to set aside those purported disposition, to set aside those purported promotions and get the administrative authority concerned to open up the whole thing all over again.</P>
    <P>Although the matter has not been explored I consider that there is a definite possibility that it is not open to these Houses retrospectively to cut off rights of action which people have, as the Minister for Fisheries would say &ldquo;at this moment in time&rdquo; by virtue of one very plausible reading of Article 34 or Article 40, vested constitutional rights.  It may not be within the power of these Houses plus the President to divest those rights by the passage of a one-section bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows by now he has put his foot into a nest of hornets.  I do not get any degree of satisfaction from watching him suffer but I must warn him that, while this Bill may have the desired <Col N="1817" /> effect, I am not by any means sure it will.  There are two precedents on the statute book&mdash;there may be more and if so I would be grateful, for personal reasons, if anybody would point them out to me&mdash;of specific attempts to cut off rights of action which were already vested.  One was the Accidental Fires Act, 1943, which purported to render non-actionable damage resulting from a fire on neighbouring premises arising after a certain date.  The Bill was drawn up in such a way that actions arising from the big fire&mdash;the fire in Athlone&mdash;would not be affected but there may have been other actions which were on the point of being launched at that time and which that Act purported to put a quick end to.</P>
    <P>The constitutionality of that Act was never litigated.  Even if it had been, it is possible that the Government may have got away with it because the spirit of Supreme Court in the mid-1940s was not as independent as the modern courts have come to be, and it is possible that Act might have passed muster.  A few years later, inspired by the fact that they had got away with the Accidental Fires Act, the Government got both Houses to enact their Sinn Féin Funds Act, which purported to stop in mid-action a case which was brought to establish the ownership of funds left over from the old Sinn Féin organisation.  That Act was shot down by Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy in the High Court and by a majority in the Supreme Court at least, and possibly unanimously.</P>
    <P>I have not asked the Minister this question so far, and perhaps he does not know the answer.  Are there in being at the moment actions against the Government, against Ireland, against himself or against any authority based on the lack of legal warrant for the acts of Mr. McLaughlin?  The Minister may be in deep water if he supposes that merely to pass this one-section Bill will put an end to those actions.  It may do so, but it is perfectly possible that it will not do so. Even if there are no actions in being that he knows of, even if he has not got on his desk statements of claim and summonses from such litigants, for all he knows there may be people even now consulting their legal advisers, or if they <Col N="1818" /> think about it tomorrow having read today's debate, they will tomorrow consult their legal advisers and issue proceedings designed to get back to square one with, say, a competition which resulted in a promotion or failure to promote.  The Minister may be disappointed in his expectation that this Bill is going to cure them.</P>
    <P>I think any Government must have&mdash;if only because it consists of human beings, as are all the people who work for it&mdash;room in reason and fairness to cure a technical defect retrospectively.  But an instance like this is perhaps a bit different.  I imagine that in a case like this the courts would look pretty jealously at what the Government here are up to.  They might look at it in this light, that by a Bill of this kind the State is trying to give itself a privilege which the ordinary citizen cannot give himself&mdash;not just the State in its capacity as the State but in its capacity as a Minister who has made a bungle&mdash;I do not care how sincerely he may have acted or how solid the advice may have seemed to be which he received.</P>
    <P>Effectively what this Bill seeks to do is to draw a veil over the bungle which the Minister committed.  If I commit a bungle I cannot draw a veil over it. There is no machinery to enable me to validate or get an Act of Indulgence or Amnesty or Indemnity or Retrospective Validation which will cure bungles in my life.  While I realise, as does the Constitution, that there is a difference of social function between citizens and the State, and that the State does not have to stand in all respects on the same footing as the citizen, here is a situation in which in the perspective of possible litigation the State and the litigant or prospective litigant are not being equally treated because the State is trying to get let off its side of the litigation.  It is trying to let off its Minister or its representative, the Attorney General or whoever it is, by the invocation of a procedure, namely, the passage of a Bill, which the other litigant could not do for himself if the situation were reversed.</P>
    <P>Naturally, I hope for the sake of all innocent people, from Mr. McLaughlin down, who have been involved in this sorry history, all rooted in the sick greed <Col N="1819" /> and ambition of the Fianna Fáil Party who sit in the Government benches, that this Bill will work, and it would be wrong for me to hope otherwise.  But I want to give the Minister fair warning that I do not consider that an absolutely open-and-shut certainty.</P>
    <P>Finally, I compliment the Minister's advisers and whoever it was who wrote at any rate most of his speech because it is a very clear setting-out of what he sees in the situation.  It is not always that we get a series of speeches that are so well put together.  I have had occasion to say that on a previous occasion; I think it was one of the constitutional amendments, perhaps it was the Adoption Bill. Obviously, the Minister is being very well served by the people who put words into his mouth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening speech I pointed out that the Supreme Court had held that the defence that had been filed on behalf of the Government did not contain a denial or at all events a sufficient denial of the various allegations that had been made in Mr. Garvey's statement of claim and that on that account the Government must, according to the court's ruling, be presumed to have accepted those allegations. I do not want to take the risk of its being said in relation to the many serious allegations made in the course of this debate that because I am not free to refute them at this point, on that account I am to be regarded as having accepted them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that on some issues at least a denial on my part is a waste of time. Deputy O'Keeffe, leading for the Fine Gael Party, began by asking for answers to two specific questions.  The first was whether prior to the general election I had indicated that the commissioner would be sacked or removed from office. The second question was whether in the event that that had not happened I had any knowledge that other members of my party did so.  Deputy O'Keeffe asked me for a categoric &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to those questions without, as I think he put it, any evasion.  I intervened to give a categoric &ldquo;no&rdquo; to both questions only to <Col N="1820" /> find that a number of other Deputies completely disregarded what I had said. It is perfectly obvious, as the Chair has pointed out, that allegations that the Government did not act in good faith would be highly relevant to issues that may arise in the proceedings of the High Court and for that reason I regret that some Deputies in the full knowledge that legal proceedings were going on have nevertheless seen fit to make allegations which are without any foundation.</P>
    <P>Certain criticisms were made of my opening speech.  Deputy Horgan, for instance, picked up the phrase from it that one may feel hard done by as a result of a court decision, and he and others implied that this was a very serious criticism of the Supreme Court's decision. I wish to make two points about that.  It is perfectly permissible for anybody in appropriate circumstances to criticise in a reasonable and reasoned way a decision of any court, including the Supreme Court.  Individual judges themselves have been known to criticise&mdash;and in public&mdash;decisions of the court, including the Supreme Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Accordingly, even if what I have said were to be interpreted as a criticism of the Supreme Court it would not on that account be open to the charge of being improper or inappropriate. In fact I was referring to a very limited aspect of the case when I was speaking of the Government being hard done by in their opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>What about being aggrieved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the fact that a decision on the substantive point was given by the Supreme Court in circumstances where no arguments or evidence about the merits of the background had been placed before either the High Court or the Supreme Court.  I have made it clear that the Government felt aggrieved at that situation.  In saying that I am saying nothing more or less than what has already been said in open court, in the High Court in fact by counsel for the <Col N="1821" /> Government when referring to the decision of the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>The second point to which I refer is the suggestion made by several Deputies that at the very end of my speech, by referring to the fact that there was a background to the Government's decision, I was endeavouring to damage Mr. Garvey by innuendo and in general indulging in argument about the merits of the dismissal while disclaiming any intention of doing so.  I deny this categorically.  I have not said or implied anything about the nature of the background, and while it is obvious and needs no stressing that in the Government's opinion the background justified their action, I in my speech made no claim that it justified the Government's action.  I refrained from doing so on the basis that it would involve argument on the merits of what happened and this is precisely what should not be done at this stage in this House because it would be liable to raise issues which are <i>sub judice</i> in the High Court.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harte paraphrased my remarks by saying that they meant I have a case to make which I cannot make at the moment but which I may make later.  I accept that paraphrase, but I deny that anybody could reasonably claim that a person who says he has a case to make and will make it in due course is by that fact engaging in argument about the merits of the case he has to make or doing anything more than saying that he is not to be condemned unheard.  What I have said I have said and I make no apology for it, nor do I withdraw anything I have said.  I accept that because of the office I hold I have to observe constraints to which other Deputies do not feel themselves subject. That does not mean that I have to take it to the extent of not even saying that I have a defence and a very good defence to put up.  It will be for others to judge in due course how good that defence will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Horgan also accused me of setting myself up as judge and jury when I said there is no injustice involved in validating authorisations given by superintendents under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  He asserts that this is a matter which might be <Col N="1822" /> referred to a court for a decision and that I might be proved wrong.  Of course I might, but when I say there is no injustice involved I am quite obviously putting forward an argument which is readily identifiable as being an argument. If every Deputy in this House were required to refrain from making any assertions without qualifying them by phrases such as &ldquo;in my opinion&rdquo;, the normal process of debate would surely become impossible.  It is clear to everybody who heard my speech that I was not attempting to pronounce on legal issues but to express what appears to me to be a very well-founded opinion.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised for not giving a complete list of every power or function exercised or discharged by Mr. McLaughlin during the past 16 months. It would be impossible to be certain that any such list was complete.  I gave what I believe to be a virtually complete list as it affects the public at large and certainly I did not deliberately omit anything.</P>
    <P>I did not think it necessary to refer to any internal disciplinary matters in the Garda Síochána for the simple reason that they are internal matters in the Force and that anybody affected by them has open to him or her various methods of seeking redress.  There was no concealment whatsoever in this.  The House has already been officially informed in reply to a parliamentary question put to me at the beginning of this month by Deputy Harte that there were three dismissals in the year 1978, in other words, from the time Mr. McLaughlin took over until the end of 1978.  There were no dismissals in 1979. I see no reason why disciplinary decisions should be excluded from the scope of the Bill.  I believe there is no injustice whatsoever involved and the fact that Mr. McLaughlin's appointment was legally invalid had nothing to do with it. I submit that the Oireachtas ought to validate the disciplinary decisions.  If any individual wishes to challenge such a validation as it would affect him, he is quite free to do so.  If they were not validated by the Bill, the natural consequences would be that the procedures would have to be commenced all over again, an alternative which does not appear to offer any benefit to anybody <Col N="1823" /> other than the introduction of uncertainty as to the position of the various people, as would be likely to happen if some of them had no interest in involving themselves in such procedures all over again.  It might be impossible to know whether or not a particular disciplinary decision was effective where the person who was the subject of that disciplinary action was not disposed to take any action in the matter.</P>
    <P>I brought this Bill before the House on the basis that Mr. McLaughlin took up duty in good faith and that the fact that he was not legally commissioner involved no injustice to any of the people within the Force against whom disciplinary proceedings were instituted since he took over.  Neither does validation involve any injustice to anybody else.</P>
    <P>I was asked about traffic by-laws and those to which I referred were traffic by-laws appointing taxi stands in Dublin.  It is not to be assumed that there are now no valid by-laws governing taxi stands. If the ones to which I referred are deemed to be invalid, the older by-laws which the most recent ones purported to repeal would, of course, still be in force. The temporary rules to which I refer concerned parking restrictions at Knock, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>With regard to those who wish to make capital out of allegations that I made criticisms of the Supreme Court, there is nothing in law or tradition which makes it inappropriate to say that the Government felt aggrieved at the decision. Such a statement was already made in the High Court by counsel acting for the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer very briefly to what Deputy Fitzpatrick said.  Despite what he said, it is a fact that certain agreed questions&mdash;three in number&mdash;were put by both sides as a preliminary issue to the Supreme Court.  The Deputy should have known that.  I repeat that it is not true that the Government said in reply to the allegations: &ldquo;We agree but we were entitled to act in this way.&rdquo;  They did not say &ldquo;We agree&rdquo;.  In effect, they set out to say that in their opinion they had an absolute right to dismiss so costs should not be incurred in arguing about what did or did not occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to defective proofs in criminal cases.  That may be his legal opinion, but I have no intention whatever of embarking on any legal arguments as to whether a statement made to a garda by a person detained for 24 hours would on that account be inadmissible.  I am clear that if any such statement is thought to be inadmissible <Col N="1830" /> it is a matter for the convicted person to raise the point and to establish it in court.</P>
    <P>With regard to promotions, I dealt fully with the matter in my opening speech.  With regard to promotion panels for promotion to superintendent, these have no legal status whatsoever.  These promotions are for the Government to make and are Government functions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what Deputy Kelly says, there are, in my opinion, very strong reasons why I should not on this occasion tell my side of the story.  The central fact is that, if I were to do so, I could be regarded by very many people as attempting to conduct a trial here on an issue which is actually before the High Court.  I am not prepared to do anything of the kind as long as I can avoid doing so.  I believe the tradition of the House is sound on this point and I accept that in a large measure it may be a matter of tradition rather than clear cut law.  My opening speech referred to it as a tradition.  As for Deputy Kelly's reference to nemesis, let me just say that the last word has not yet been spoken.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly suggests that validating statutes may be unconstitutional.  Possibly it may be: I do not know, nor can anybody else know, in the absence of a decision by the Supreme Court.  There have been other validating statutes and this House is entitled to act on the basis that it is a constitutional type of statute. Therefore, when Deputy Kelly speaks of citizens being entitled to the benefit of the last letter of the law, by which he means that a layman would avail of any loophole in the law, I accept that, but I must point out that this Bill is introduced for the specific purpose of ensuring that it will be part of the law.  As I said, in the absence of proof to the contrary, Parliament is fully entitled to enact effective legislation which is confined to preventing all sorts of consequences flowing over into areas where the wrongs of the dismissal are of no practical relevance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1831" /> I am not aware of any legal proceedings being taken on the point raised by Deputy Kelly other than action being taken by certain taxi owners to prevent the commissioner from granting new taxi licences.  I heard a great deal about there being innuendo in my opening statement.  I strongly believe that I have been scrupulous in avoiding innuendo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies opposite have engaged in innuendo and much worse than that and they are not the only ones.  I ask any Deputy interested in innuendo to read the letter from Mr. Garvey in last Friday's <i>Irish Times.</i>  It is enough to read the last paragraph.  I do not have the text beside me but it will be found to contain a claim that we need a police authority to get away from ministerial and bureaucratic control and to so achieve an honest and efficient police force.  I do not need to spell out the implications of that reference to an honest police force.  I decided when coming into this House to ignore that kind of provocation and I do not say anything more about it except that it is going unnoticed.</P>

The only period in respect of which things have to be validated is between a date in January 1978 and 15 May this year.  Things cannot worsen.

I put it to the Minister today that I wanted to put down amendments to this Bill and I suggested that such acts as the Minister seeks to validate should be scheduled to the Bill so that we can see exactly what acts are to be validated.  It is a reasonable request.  I object to the omnibus type of validation which validates everything without specification over a period of 18 months.  I want to get legal advice and to put down amendments and I have not an opportunity; neither has any other Member.  I see Deputy de Valera opposite and I would be amazed if he disagreed with one word I am saying. When a Bill is complicated it needs to be considered in detail with a view to amendment.  I spelled out the type of amendment I want to put down.  The acts of the Commissioner during the time of the dual commissionership should be spelled out in a Schedule to the Bill.  If the Bill is taken tomorrow morning there is no way this can be done.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government to be reasonable.  The position, bad as it is, cannot worsen.  I appeal to the Minister in the name of common sense and democracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are two Opposition parties in this House and it is as well that both should have their say.  Those on this side of the House who want their say should have it.  The Minister for Justice has asked us to approve of a motion to take this Bill tomorrow morning and, in so far as I understood his interjections adequately, he has given two main reasons for taking Committee Stage tomorrow morning.  The first is that the Bill is urgent.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has very adequately disposed of that argument by pointing out that it is needed to validate something which took place within a fixed period which has now ended.  The situation is now under control and there is no reason to assume that it will get any worse in the immediate future.  The second reason given by the Minister was that this is only a one-section Bill.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Confidence in Government: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Cluskey on Tuesday 29 May 1979:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, gravely concerned about the serious economic mismanagement of the country by the <Col N="1841" /> Government, declares that this House and the people of Ireland have no confidence in the Government.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;expresses its satisfaction at the Government's management of the economy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just seen a very good reason why Dáil Éireann should express no confidence in the Government.  On an important Bill involving high legal principles the Government have asked the House to dismiss it as though it is a Fianna Fáil election programme.  I ask the Government to be serious.  As a senior Member of this House&mdash;as it happens, still on the right side of 50&mdash;I ask the Government not to insult the Dáil and the people of Ireland by asking the Dáil to endorse the Government's amendment to the motion of no confidence.  The amendment is an impertinent one.  It asks the Dáil to express its satisfaction at the Government's management of the economy.</P>
      <P>That is a sick joke.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the Government know there is only a tiny minority of dedicated Fianna Fáil supporters who know anything about the management of economic affairs who today have any confidence in the Government's management of the economy.  Even if it was bad management I could understand the amendment, but there is no management at all. There is no Government at all, and that is the almost universal cry of the plain people of Ireland.  Quite rightly they are asking why the Government do not govern.  They were elected to govern, they did not and they are not governing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most tragic aspect of the present national crisis&mdash;there is a crisis of unprecedented dimensions&mdash;is that the Government do not realise there is any crisis at all.  They describe it merely as a problem.  There is a problem, but the <Col N="1842" /> problem is the Government.  It is a problem of the Government's making. When we were in Government, Fianna Fáil spent several years during a real international recession arguing that all we said was untrue, that all that was needed was to elect them to office in order to make Ireland once more a land running with milk and honey for everybody, without any great effort.</P>
    <P>I accept there is an international crisis now but it is only one-fifth as serious as that which we experienced.  The situation in Ireland today is immeasurably worse. There is a strong irony in Fianna Fáil's European election slogan which asks the people to vote for them in order to have &ldquo;a strong voice in Europe&rdquo;.  Fianna Fáil were given the strongest voice ever for a Government of Ireland but the only time we hear that voice now is complaining that their critics are being unfair to them, particularly complaining that the media critics are not giving them a fair innings. They were given a voice to govern, to put right many of our problems, but all we have had have been feeble indifferent government, Green Papers and White Papers, economic theory that has little relationship to practice.  We are now quickly grinding to a halt.  The Government should govern or get out.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry said that whether we like it or not, whether the people of Ireland like it or not, Fianna Fáil will stay in power during the next two-and-a-half or three years.  If that is to be our plight, and the people are angry that it is their plight&mdash;they were deluded into bringing that situation about&mdash;would the Government please govern and do the things that are necessary, even if they are unpopular?  They have enough safeguards and shields for themselves in their massive historically unprecedented majority to save them from the unpopularity that might be theirs if they did the right thing.  I have been long enough in politics to want to see the country ruled properly, irrespective of who gets the glory or who gets the blame.  I sincerely urge the Government for God's sake to rule properly.</P>
    <P>The sad political situation is that the Government are primarily responsible for our difficulties.  They have <Col N="1843" /> themselves to blame for the woeful industrial situation because they led people to expect things which could not be delivered by our economy, our society. The reason is that the Government have not got a policy.  For all their White Papers and Green Papers and talk of planning, we have not got a plan.  With great respect to him, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development reads his policies from textbooks that have little association with the real facts of life&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are to blame for the fact that we are no longer one nation but two, an urban and a rural one, because the Government by their ineptitude have set town and city against country and vice versa.  When we left office we left the economy in the healthiest state it had been in since the foundation of the State.  To use the Taoiseach's words, economically there was a sound basis from which to grow, if handled properly.  Now the situation is on the verge of disaster, as is indicated by the dangerous depreciation in the value of the Irish £ as against the £ sterling.  Fianna Fáil have to their discredit that, for the first time since the Act of Union in 1800, the Irish £ is valued at less than the £ sterling.  I believe that is but the beginning of an inevitable trend because we have the highest inflation rate in Europe, the highest rate of Government borrowing in Europe&mdash;three times higher than the European average&mdash;the worst balance of trade in Europe, which this year will significantly exceed £1,000 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have the worst industrial relations in Europe and therefore we will not have people investing in Ireland.  The only reason why we have been able for some years to run a very high imbalance of trade has been because there was massive foreign investment. That was related to good management of the economy.  Now, foreign industrialists and would-be investors are worried stiff about investing in Ireland, with the Irish £ sinking like a stone in the ocean, with inflation rampant, with industrial disputes rampant, with everything that should be right going the wrong way.  I believe it is not unlikely that in the forseeable future the Irish £ will be worth 90p or 85p and also will be debased against other European currencies.  I do not like to be a prophet of doom, but unless the Government begin to govern properly and put into practice what they are preaching that is the inevitable outcome.</P>
      <P>Is it not high time that the Government governed?  If they want to be preachers they should have joined the Dominicians and become an order of preachers, because that is what they are today.  At least the Dominicans with their vows of poverty and other vows of self-denial have never pretended that heaven could ever be reached without sacrifice.  Fianna Fáil went the other way and suggested that all was available to people.  It sickens me to hear the Minister for Economic Planning and Development going on radio, as he did last Sunday, denouncing people for being selfish, materialistic and not considering the problems of others, when the whole programme which brought him and his colleague into office was based upon an appeal to greed, selfishness and class privilege.  What they did not say in public they settled up in private by promising the wealthy the abolition of the wealth tax, although the excuse for the abolition of that tax was that they were encouraging investment. Investment is now trickling off; it is falling.</P>

      <P>The Minister is the greatest fiddler of figures that there ever was in this House.  The reality is that now&mdash;and I will quote figures&mdash;an opinion poll in the magazine <i>Business and Finance</i> showed that nearly 70 per cent of the business people in this country have no confidence in the Government. Never at any stage when we were in office was there such lack of confidence on the part of the business community in the management of the economy and in the control of industrial relations.</P>
      <P>I do not know in what fairyland the Government live.  They pass in their Mercedes through mountains of rotting refuse in this city and they let that situation develop unconcerned.  Industry, the tourist industry in particular, is grinding to a halt because of the postal strike.  I am not saying that the way to settle all strikes is to give in to all demands, but the way to have industrial harmony is to explain your difficulties to everybody including the strikers and to negotiate quickly for a settlement.  Can one have confidence in a Government where the Minister responsible waits for over three months to make an address to the nation about what he regards as a serious problem of national dimensions?  Yet that is what has happened.  One of the most essential services in any modern community, a service here affecting 13,000 workers and 3 million people, is the postal service.  Yet nothing was done for over a quarter of a year by this Government who have the temerity to ask this House to express confidence in their management of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is outrageous.  Not even in the Fianna Fáil party rooms would you find today a majority prepared to express confidence in the Government's management of the economy.  Yet that party have the audacity to come into the Dáil and ask the Dáil to go on record nationally and internationally as giving <Col N="1846" /> its blessing to the worst possible economic and social situation that this country has experienced since the commencement of our independence in 1921.  I am appalled that the Government have such temerity.  If they had simply voted down the vote of no confidence I would say, &ldquo;So be it.  We know that the figures are there&rdquo;.  But they have the audacity to drive their 84 gobbaloons into this House asking them to express confidence in them.  It indicates that something is seriously wrong in the Government.  They are totally out of touch with the ordinary people of Ireland whom I have had the pleasure of meeting hour after hour over many days in recent weeks.  I do not know what we can do about this other than to express our indignation.  I do not like to use the words &ldquo;express our contempt&rdquo;, because that might be regarded as personally offensive. I will simply convey to the Government and the Minister the fact that most of the people of Ireland have nothing but contempt for the worst Government that this country has had to endure since the foundation of our State in 1921.</P>

      <P>I will address myself immediately to some of Deputy Ryan's remarks.  I recognise that he is a candidate in an election and therefore he has given in to the temptation to indulge in rather colourful language which has very little regard to the facts.  His reference to joining an order of preachers reminds me that the convenient way to apply the test of this motion is to go on the biblical injunction that by their fruits you shall know them, and that &ldquo;not everyone who says &lsquo;Lord, Lord&rsquo; shall come into my Kingdom&rdquo;.  If you want biblical or religious comparisons, let us have them.  By the test of performance, contrasting what has been happening to this economy in the last two years with what happened to it during the Coalition period of management, then it is quite clear that this party have every reason to be proud and to expect the House to vote its full confidence in our policy.  It is the Opposition parties who have an incredible nerve and gall to come into this House and pretend that <Col N="1847" /> they are in any position of moral authority or otherwise to allege that they can do anything to improve that situation. Their own record damns them month after month through their abysmal period of failure.  If they now wish to repent their ways and errors of the past let us hear from them what it is they would now do to remedy what they regard hypocritically as an appalling state of affairs.  Several times I invited Deputy Ryan to indicate what he would do.  He wants us to govern&mdash;a nice catchphrase&mdash;but it is not clear what he wants us to do.  He made some wild allegations about confidence falling off and investment falling off.  I invited him to quote any figures to support that and he very modestly declined to do so.</P>
      <P>I can continue these examples but another point that I do not wish to let go is that in his opening remarks he was saying that the exhibition we have had in this House was sufficient to merit a vote of no confidence in the Government. Who is responsible for the appalling hypocritical behaviour in this House not only this evening but on numerous occasions during the last week or two?  We have them coming in here expressing mock concern for law and order and wanting to preserve standards and uphold procedures.  What are they doing? They are deliberately undermining procedures of this House of which they must know&mdash;or, if they are so ignorant, about which they can easily find out and have their ignorance remedied.  They know there are procedures for raising questions, for having issues debated and so on.  Do they resort to any of these procedures, which would be the proper approach of anyone seriously interested in law and order and in strengthening democracy?  Not at all.  They rush in and out in search of cheap publicity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to take other examples.  Apart from kicking up a fuss and having oneself put out of the House in order to secure a headline, there were other recent examples.  Last week Deputy Barry, in his great concern for the outcome of the proposed national understanding, took the unusual step of giving a day's notice to the Chair that he proposed to raise that question on the following day.  This was no doubt designed to acquire some cheap publicity.  On the following day Deputy Barry was told that there would be questions in the House on which this matter would be discussed, but when we arrived at Question Time there was not one single Deputy from the whole of the Fine Gael Party present in the House to voice this great concern about this major national issue.  By their fruits we shall know them.  Let us judge them by their performance and not by their words.  On their performance they ought to hang their heads in shame for many years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tabled the amendment expressing confidence in the performance of the Government.  Deputy Cluskey in moving this motion said that he wanted to list five headings under which our performance was seriously inefficient in order to justify his motion.  These were, employment, growth, inflation, taxation and industrial relations.  Deputy Cluskey said that all he ever got from me was lectures. Since he is not here at the moment he will not be subjected to one but I must apologise to the Chair and to the House because they will have to endure another lecture and more statistics <Col N="1849" /> because since Deputy Cluskey insists on repeating statistics or alleged facts which are wrong and which he ought to know are wrong, I have no alternative but to keep repeating the truth until it is established and reported.</P>
    <P>I note that Deputy Cluskey attaches some importance to employment.  I wish he had attached the same importance to it when he was a member of the Coalition Government.  On the aspect of employment the record is damning for the Coalition period but we are proud of our record.  During the Coalition period, as we know, employment fell in most years.  Deputy Ryan will tell us that that was because we suffered an international recession.</P>

      <P>Employment should be the over-riding objective of economic and social policy at present, just as it should have been but never was an important objective of the Coalition Government because no attempt was ever made to launch employment-generating policies in the wake of the 1973 recession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In that context, Deputy Cluskey tried to dress up his remarks by some curious manipulation of figures.  The Deputy referred to the level of unemployment on the live register in July of 1977 and said that there had been only a small fall from then until now, and that emigration was also running at a much higher figure.  By adding the emigration and the employment figures the Deputy presumably convinced himself that the overall unemployment level is as great now as it was two years ago, but that is simply not true.  That is a curious and wrong mixture of statistics referring to two different things.  In his reference to emigration the Deputy appeared to be out of date and did not appear to be interested in the replies to questions he tabled in this House.  For some time Deputy Cluskey has been claiming that emigration rose between 1977 and 1978.  I <Col N="1852" /> could not find any evidence to support that.  The only material I could discover was used in reply to the question which he had tabled, and it showed that far from emigration increasing last year it appeared to be the other way around. Although we do not have full, adequate accurate statistics for emigration, the ones used to indicate the trend, namely the figures on net passenger movement, show that in that year up to October 1978 there appeared to have been a net inflow of 16,000.  I am not suggesting that when the final record comes to be written for last year it will measure an inflow of 16,000; I am simply saying that on the statistics available so far, there is no basis for alleging that emigration has increased but, on the contrary, if one takes the figures at face value, they point in the opposite direction and show that emigration has tapered off and if anything has reversed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cluskey was wrong to try to add together emigration figures and unemployment figures and secondly, the figures he was attempting to add together had no basis that I can discover. The only figures to which we can refer are in relation to what has been happening to employment.  They show quite clearly a record increase last year and another very substantial increase this year, which I expect will constitute a further record.  So much for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not surprisingly, this record improvement in employment has been associated <Col N="1853" /> with a record improvement in growth. Again in this area Deputy Cluskey seemed to have difficulty in knowing what statistics he wanted to quote.  It was not very clear what he was trying to allege.  He appeared to imply that the growth rate last year was only about 5½ per cent.  I can find no basis for that.  It is true that some forecasts earlier on appeared to suggest a figure of just below 6 per cent, and that there are some other bodies which suggest an outturn in the range of 6 to 6½ per cent.  However, no final statistics have yet been prepared. On the basis of the information available to me I understand that the material is consistent with the growth rate that we had suggested of 7 per cent.  The outturn might well proceed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Central Bank quoted a figure of 5.8 per cent in their December Bulletin.  They have retained a rather coy silence on the 1978 outturn in their report published last week even though the published revised figures for export performance last year are very interesting.  They revised their December figure, which had been 12½ per cent, upwards to 14 per cent, which was the figure we were using.  They also revised upwards their figure for investment from 12 per cent of an increase last year to 14 per cent, which brings them <Col N="1854" /> much closer&mdash;our figure is still 15 per cent&mdash;but at least they are coming closer to us.</P>

      <P>No, it did not.  The outturn on the balance of payments for last year, for 1978, was very much lower than we had expected at the beginning of the year.  Since the Deputy was so quick about quoting White Papers and Green Papers, perhaps he would care to go back and look at the January 1978 White Paper and the outturn for last year when he will see that the outturn was much better than we had expected.</P>

      <P>I have dealt with employment and growth.  I have shown that the growth for last year was in the region of 7 per cent, contrasting with a figure of 2¾ per cent a year on average during the Coalition period.  This year we had expected that the growth would continue to be somewhere in the region of 6½ per cent. That now looks unduly optimistic because of the impact of the oil supply difficulties as well as domestic problems. But, even allowing for any reduction which may occur as a result of those factors, there is no reason to believe that we will not comfortably head the poll&mdash;if I might call it that&mdash;for EEC growth this year and indeed also comfortably exceed the growth performance recorded during the Coalition years.  Therefore, even in a period of relative difficulty, we still expect to see a very much better growth performance than had been recorded.</P>

      <P>Inflation was the third point mentioned by Deputy Cluskey.  Here again, what does the record show&mdash;an average of almost 18 per cent annual inflation during the Coalition period down to about 8 per cent last year?  And, despite the adverse impact of higher oil prices this year, we see no danger of returning to anything like the Coalition figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>We see no danger of a return to anything like the Coalition figures.  On the question of taxation we committed ourselves quite clearly to a programme of lowering the overall burden of taxation.  We campaigned quite clearly on that.  We even pointed to the priorities we had in the area of income tax reform.  We said we would place the emphasis on improving the income tax position of lower paid workers, especially married workers, because we thought they constituted desirable social priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures are reflected in the performance since then.  The tax-free allowance for married people has been more than doubled in two years, in contrast to the miserable 20 per cent increase in the last two budgets of the Coalition.  We spelled out those priorities quite clearly.  In addition, we have gone ahead with the other tax changes we promised at the time.  I would remind the House that two years ago we were told that none of these things was possible, that the country could not afford any of <Col N="1857" /> them.  Indeed, at the time I would not blame a lot of people for feeling that way because, if Deputy Ryan wants to talk about business confidence, he should go back and look at the last detailed survey taken of business confidence at the end of 1976, beginning of 1977, when he will find it showed an appalling lack of confidence in the future prospects for the Irish economy throughout the whole business sector.</P>
    <P>Of course, that feeling of gloom and doom ran among young people, evident in their lack of confidence of any opportunity of job prospects and so on.  Indeed that lack of confidence was reflected in the titles of some of the conferences which used to be held.  I recall a couple of years ago that an Irish Management Institute annual conference in Killarney was entitled simply &ldquo;Survival&rdquo;&mdash;it was reduced to just that&mdash;whereas now we are talking about &ldquo;Performance&rdquo;, which I think was the title for their conference this year.  Most of the speakers at that conference this year were stressing the opportunities, the dynamic pace of progress, the way in which they envisaged Ireland being able to move ahead in this and ensuing years. Therefore, there has been a total turn around on the part of a leading sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>Lest the House might think that I am concerned only with what the business sector thinks and with what management thinks, I might point out also&mdash;I am moving on because I must move on quickly to the fifth theme, the industrial relations theme which was raised by Deputy Cluskey&mdash;yes, there are problems in that area.  We have sought to bring about an understanding of the way in which change must occur in this country over the next few years.  We spent a considerable degree of time in very substantial, complex discussions with leaders of the Irish trade union movement.  The leadership of that trade union movement quite clearly did not share the sort of views being enunciated from the Opposition benches, because they did not feel that there was this lack of confidence, this divisive social approach or anything else.  Some of their documents&mdash;endorsed, incidentally, by special conferences of the trade union <Col N="1858" /> movement as a whole&mdash;recognised and welcomed the commitment this Government had made to promoting increased employment.  They recognised and welcomed some of the other positive changes which had been made to deal with some of the problems of inflation.</P>
    <P>In passing I want to emphasise that the notion that we were implying that all available money had to be channelled into financing economic growth and that nothing would be available for improving the position of social welfare recipients is simply not true.  The facts show that the real improvement in social welfare benefits during the Coalition period was of the order of 2 per cent in the year in real terms whereas last year the increase was something over 6 per cent in real terms.  We expect that figure to be repeated, if not exceeded, this year. However one does the sums the record of actual performance quite clearly demonstrates the superior results which have been achieved by Fianna Fáil in Government.</P>
    <P>I could go on to deal with many other things but, regretfully, I will have to confine myself to summarising that on each of the five indicators which were taken in Deputy Cluskey's motion&mdash;presumably we must give him credit for choosing the grounds most favourable to himself and his party&mdash;as the test of performance and the justification for his motion, he fails because there was never a commitment to any worthwhile positive policies from the Coalition.  They tried to sweep that problem under the carpet.  There was never an adequate performance in growth.  There was an attempt to deliberately ignore inflation as a problem or to say that the choice was between growth and inflation.  There was also the lack of any real, genuine improvement in social welfare benefits and no attempt at any worthwhile improvement in reducing the heavy burden of taxation on lower paid workers.  If I can single out one reason for some of the present tensions and difficulties I believe it would be associated, first of all, with a general problem, a tension that arises from any period of sustained inflation.</P>
    <P>During the early years of the period of office of the Coalition Government they tried to tell the House and the people <Col N="1859" /> that there was a painful choice to be made between maintaining employment on the one hand, and curbing inflation on the other and that if you tried to curb inflation you would have to worsen unemployment. That is simply not true and we campaigned against it.  We have been trying to demonstrate how important it is to reduce unemployment and reduce inflation since we came into office.</P>
    <P>(<i>Interruptions.</i>)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Any period of severe inflation and severe fluctuations in the rate of inflation generates a great degree of social unrest, instability and uncertainty because it stands a lot of traditional behaviour on its head. Whereas during a period of price stability it becomes normal for prudent people to save for tomorrow and we tend to look askance at anyone who borrows too heavily, we know that in periods of severe inflation this position can be reversed and it is the heavier borrowers who can end up the gainers at the end of the day and the prudent savers who can have their savings wiped out.</P>
      <P>Those kind of tensions and problems take a while to resolve and overcome. The specific problem which aggravated it in the case of the transition from the Coalition to the Fianna Fáil Government was that in 1977, presumably because they were facing up to an election period&mdash;I do not know how they succeeded in doing it and it is the one area where I might ask them to lend me the recipe&mdash;they succeeded in persuading the trade unions to accept a 9 per cent pay rise in a year when inflation was 14 per cent, in other words, to voluntarily accept a pay agreement which would cut the real living standards of workers by 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the inheritance we had and that was why there were so many tensions which had to be worked out and resolved.  When the changeover came, <Col N="1860" /> when we were able to demonstrate that there was no need for the gloom and doom of the Coalition years, when we were able to show that living standards could rise and that our people could start talking in terms of a better tomorrow, that they could talk in terms of providing jobs for their young people, then, naturally, workers said: &ldquo;Why do we have to agree to this sacrifice and this belt tightening?  Surely that was all unnecessary?&rdquo;. We have been showing that it was unnecessary, that there is scope for improving the living standards of all. We have to manage the difficult transition from that period of Coalition gloom and doom into a period of sustained, reasonable progress.</P>
    <P>The message should be that while we can afford improvements it has to be at a sustainable pace of 4 per cent to 5 per cent a year and not talk in extravagant terms of 40 per cent or other gains.  For those reasons I have absolutely no doubt that when the history of this country comes to be written, much less the record of our two respective Governments, the people of Ireland will see clearly why they were right to express their confidence in Fianna Fáil in Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened patiently to what I describe as a lecture in economics.  I am no economist but I believe I am in touch with the ordinary people in my constituency.  I believe, no matter what kind of a lecture the Minister, Professor O'Donoghue, comes into the House to give me as a representative of the Labour Party, he will not convince the ordinary working people and the ordinary business people in my constituency that his Government are doing a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken to many people in the constituency of Leinster during the last few weeks.  I am convinced that the vast majority of them believe that this is the worst and most inept Government that has been in power since the foundation <Col N="1861" /> of the State.  People I have met throughout the new constituency of Leinster have given me many reasons for this.  They have given me the reasons why I should support this motion of no confidence in the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not write speeches nor go into statistics, but I know how the people feel about the Government of the day, no matter what kind it is.  An economist may take five or six years to develop a theory.  Most people give a new Government taking office a period of honeymoon to adjust to the policies they want to put forward. Fianna Fáil in every debate in the House since they took office have been talking about the performance of the Coalition Government. Fianna Fáil have been in office for longer periods than any other party.  I have seen many Fianna Fáil Governments since I first entered this House and there is no doubt in my mind that this is the worst Government I have ever seen.</P>
    <P>I say that for the following reasons. The Minister claims that the unemployment situation has improved beyond all recognition.  Two years ago Fianna Fáil, and principally the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, put across the message to all young people that there would be plenty of jobs. That has not happened. Let the Minister and everybody else be honest with the ordinary people and let them know that the kind of jobs they produced for our young people did not last very long&mdash;some of them less than three weeks.  They set up a youth employment team which was disbanded recently.  I do not think the Minister or anyone else can point to anything they achieved.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil gave the impression that they were going to do all sorts of things in regard to youth services and youth associations and that they were going to run school buses to take our young people to functions in the evening.  Most people now realise that that was a lot of eye wash and political propaganda.</P>
    <P>Two years ago many prominent Fianna Fáil people went around with a thing called a &ldquo;shopping bag&rdquo; which principally contained items of food.  A woman in my constituency told me that when the present Taoiseach, as leader of the Opposition, <Col N="1862" /> was on a tour of my constituency he went into a supermarket. This lady had a pound of butter in her hand and said to him &ldquo;What do you think of the price of that?&rdquo;  At that time it was around 50p a pound.  He said that if Fianna Fáil were put into office he would do something about it, and they certainly did.  Butter is around 70p a pound now.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were talking about the shopping basket they did not tell the people that they were going to remove part of the subsidies from food, which were a help to the housewife in particular and to people depending on social welfare payments. In my opinion that was one of the most unsocial things that could have been done by any Government. The ordinary working people, especially the poorer people, remember that act which was done just after Christmas.  They did not even have the decency to wait for the budget to do it.  The subsidy on cheese, which was becoming the poor man's meat, had been removed earlier.</P>
    <P>No matter what figures the Minister produces there was a 17.9 per cent increase in the price of food last year.  If he is proud of that he should think again and get his feet back on the ground like the ordinary people.  He boasts about the 12 per cent increase given to social welfare recipients.  He claims that that is great and is a real benefit, but most of the money these people get is spent on food.  I cannot see how a 12 per cent or even a 15 per cent increase in social welfare will pay for a 17 per cent increase in the price of food.  I am separating food from other items.</P>
    <P>The people now realise that they were codded by the Fianna Fáil Party at the last election.  There were several items in the manifesto which looked good on paper but which did not turn out the same way.  The car tax was removed. Everyone was delighted.  As a matter of fact it was probably the master stroke which won them the election.  I compliment the Minister for thinking of it.  It is all right to do away with a tax which is used for certain purposes, provided it is replaced by some other means.</P>
    <P>On paper it appears that the grants being made to county councils from the <Col N="1863" /> road fund have been replaced.  By a very clever manipulation in road grants they were increased in name but in the majority of cases there has been an actual reduction.  Almost unnoticed we passed in the new Value-Added Tax Act a section which brought county councils under VAT.  My county council got a 10 per cent increase in road grants but £155,000 is taken back into the Government coffers by way of VAT.  This means that with rising costs there is no increase in the road grant, as the state of our roads shows.  Anybody driving through our country sees potholes because the maintenance money allowed by the Government to replace the money raised by way of rates and the road fund is not sufficient.  There are potholes that would break cars' axles&mdash;a claim has been made against my own county council for such an accident.</P>
    <P>Anybody going through the country will realise that the Government have not replaced the taxes they removed. County councils, county managers and road overseers are being blamed for the state of the roads.  The Government played cute and the people do not seem to be blaming them.  I know this because I have been among the people.  I am a candidate for the local elections and have been on the county council.  The public's attitude is that the county council are responsible for the state of the roads.  They never think that the money for road maintenance has been drastically cut to cover up a gimmick which was introduced at the whim of the Minister sitting in this House to win votes in the last general election.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the shocking way the Government have treated the workers in my town.  Since the foundation of the State we have put millions into forestry.  I have been told here many times that the Government could not set up a State industry which would use this timber.  That was said by various Governments, I admit.  It was suggested by a Government Deputy that a State industry be set up to deal with forestry products now coming on stream, but we have no timber industry <Col N="1865" /> to deal with these products.  We had an industry in Munster Chipboard and another in Irish Board Mills Limited in my town where 180 people were employed.  Despite so-called efforts by the present Government that industry was allowed to close and the employees are on the streets.  Yet timber products are coming in from Northern Ireland, and because they are subsidised they are able to out-price our smaller sawmills. There is no major industry to deal with forest products now coming on stream.</P>
      <P>That is the kind of Government we are asked to have confidence in.  I certainly have no confidence in them.  If I said otherwise I should be betraying the workers in the forestry plant who are now laid off and on the dole.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy tells us that he is going to build an advance factory in that town to employ these workers&mdash;probably it will come when they are dead.  We have no industry to go into that advance factory so far.  When we went to the Minister he told us about an industry that was coming into a town 23 miles away.  That was quite a good answer for him and might make good reading, but for anybody knowing the circumstances and condition of the people who worked in that industry it would not be much good.  We have the result of neglect by not only the present Fianna Fáil Government but by previous Governments since the State was founded.</P>

      <P>For the Deputy's information, most of them were Fianna Fáil Governments, and they completely neglected to build up any industrial wing of the Forestry Department.  They meant to produce forest products which would be used by private enterprise if there was any profit in it; if there was no profit these closed down and sold off at a sacrifice price to suppliers in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The so-called Government opposite gave private enterprise in that industry almost £1 million to put in their pockets and then close the doors and go away. The little investigation that went into <Col N="1866" /> that matter is the talk of my town.  There was no effort, as suggested by a Deputy on the Government side, to start a State industry for the forestry this State planted and grew.  That is no reason why any of us should have confidence in the crew that are ruling.</P>
    <P>There was a bald statement in the Fianna Fáil manifesto to the effect that we would process all our food.  I was very glad to see a political party put that statement in a manifesto.  Have they done anything?  I challenge whoever replies to the debate to tell me by letter or otherwise if they have done anything to implement that promise.  In Tuam?  I did not see that yet and I do not think I will.  However, I think there has been total failure in that area.</P>
    <P>We were promised, and the promise was implemented by the previous Government, that there would be an interdepartmental committee on land structure.  This Government have had the report for months past, and suggestions as to how the problem should be tackled, but there is no movement.  We are told by the present Minister for Agriculture, who I believe is a very moral man who would not tell lies, that he will have the headings of a Bill ready by the end of the year and that it will be introduced in the next year.  I fear that a few speculators, a few companies and very large farmers will own all the agricultural land by that time.  The Minister's land structure policy, if he has one&mdash;I doubt it very much&mdash;will be irrelevant in Leinster anyway.  I do not think it will be relevant even in Kerry where I know that a German company bought 700 acres without saying &ldquo;by your leave&rdquo; to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party are serious about tackling the land structure problem. They have had years to prove otherwise but they have not done so.  I can say with authority that they have sent new instructions to the Land Commission which finish once and for all land acquisition as we have known it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I know it well.  I challenge the Minister for <Col N="1867" /> Agriculture to deny that he has made regulations for the Land Commission which will end land acquisition as we have known it.  That is well known, and I do not need to elaborate on it.</P>
      <P>Lack of good relations between Government Departments, their Ministers and the workers and the trade unions is making us a laughing stock of Europe.  It is unbelievable that we should have three months of a post office strike. Some businesses, to my knowledge, have actually closed because of lack of communications. I will produce proof of that if the Government need it.  These were small businesses which were not able to put people on the road either to collect debts or take orders.  The Minister's answer for three months was that it was not his concern.  Then he made a statement and apparently he broke confidence during negotiations to make that statement.  He had three months to make it but according to the Post Office Workers' Union he has broken confidence. If any private employer whose workers were in dispute for three months had refused to talk to those workers what would any of us say about it?  Here we have a Minister who is talking about rules and regulations which have been the damnation of industrial relations in the Post Office over the years.  He says he is precluded from talking to them.</P>
      <P>That is the attitude of the Government in whom we are asked to pass a vote of confidence.  I have no confidence in that type of administration.  The Minister should go and talk to the Post Office Workers' Union and not talk in whispers to someone else who might talk to them. Everyone knows that the people working in the Post Office are reasonable decent people.  The POWU have been in existence for 50 years and this is the first time there has been an official strike. There may have been minor strikes but this is the first major confrontation.  It is a shame that the Minister will not sit down and talk to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most crucial problem at present concerns fuel.  The Minister said a few weeks ago there was no shortage and that there was panic buying.  The ordinary man in the street knew there was a shortage of petrol and heating oil.  A <Col N="1868" /> couple of weeks ago the Minister realised there was a shortage.  The price of petrol went up but that did not solve the problem.  Another increase is now being sought and will probably be granted.  The Minister seems amazed that there is still a shortage.  My town is roughly 40 miles from Dublin and the people there drive to the city to work and home again in the evenings, but because of the opening hours of the garages they now have no chance of getting petrol.  The garages are closed in the morning when they are leaving home and again when they return in the evening and they have little prospect of getting petrol elsewhere.  The Minister should make some regulations regarding rationing so that people would know what amount of petrol they could get.  I spent three hours yesterday waiting for petrol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot post out the ration books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Ration books cannot be posted because the Minister will not talk to the Post Office workers. There is no shortage of petrol for people who can go from one garage to another and queue for hours because they do not have to work.  The thousands of manhours lost by queuing must be a matter of serious concern to the Government.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt in the minds of the people I have met throughout Leinster that this is a right-wing Tory Government, the worst ever Government in the history of this country.  Kildare County Council sought £889,000 to build houses.  Housing is one of the most urgent problems in Kildare.  We got only £135,000 and this means that people living in caravans and hovels cannot expect county council houses in the coming year in County Kildare.  That is the message from the Government.  The wealth tax would have brought in £25 million.  The Government had the money to give back to those who do not need it but they have no money to reduce the old age pension age or to build houses for those unable to build their own.  If that is not right-wing Tory government, I do not know what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have every reason to <Col N="1869" /> be ashamed of the record in prices, housing and, in south Kildare, employment. They have the audacity to ask us to approve of the way they have handled the economy.  They have the cheek for anything.  The people will give them notice to quit and anyone who was ever a tenant knows what that means.  They will be given notice on 7 June and the people will carry out the final evictions when the Government give us the opportunity of having a general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>They say that people get the Government they deserve, but I am not sure that statement is correct in the present instance.  It would be unfair to the character of the Irish people to say they deserve this administration. Surely the worst of all possible Governments must be that in which the Cabinet or Executive appear to be incompetent in most areas of serious concern and yet are supported day in and day out by an automatic fixed majority of Deputies. Surely that must be the worst of all possible Governments.  They have a majority which protects a Cabinet in which many of the personnel appear to be totally incompetent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely these must be ideal conditions for a Cabinet to lose all contact with reality.  That marks the present Government. Those who devised that accurate estimate of how to win an election&mdash;the manifesto which segmented the electorate market with such devastating effect on the previous administration&mdash;these close observers of the grass roots now protected in Cabinet by their massive majority have in the past two years grown complacent and no longer understand or know reality.  So the Taoiseach arrives at Dublin Airport from Athens and declares &ldquo;We are not going to bend&rdquo; in regard to the Post Office dispute.  So we have the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, that seer of troubled economic waters, a man known for his frankness, admitting that the Republic is headed for very serious economic troubles.  Of course there was the unmistakable touch of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry in this honest admission.  He said we are headed for troubled waters precisely because we have been so successful.  So heady has <Col N="1870" /> been the experience of prosperity brought into being by such talent in the Cabinet as the Minister for Economic Planning and Development that we are now in economic trouble.  One does not know where the Minister for Fisheries is heading but certainly it is not in the direction of reality.</P>
    <P>I belonged at one time to an administration which in a very difficult period attempted to legislate and change things for the better.  That administration was assailed by many external formidable factors which militated against the success of economic policies here at home, policies based on redistribution of resources and expansion of employment.</P>
    <P>The people who are now over there did not make any allowance for those external conditions.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development would be repaid if he were to read those debates and see the leeway that was offered, the charity that was given, the impartiality that marked the speeches of our adversaries in that period of severe recession, and compared them with the present Opposition.  He should compare the daily attacks then made on national agreements achieved by that Government in such difficult periods with the support now being given from these benches to the national understanding.  If he compares the two he will understand more the success that marked his party's ascent to office and their total decline and incompetence in office.</P>
    <P>Of course, there have been good Fianna Fáil Governments.  I was a Member of the House when the late Seán Lemass was Taoiseach, when he led an excellent Fianna Fáil Government between 1961 and 1965.  Of course Seán Lemass was a man larger than his party.  He was imbued with a passionate concern for the advancement of his country.  The present Taoiseach is a personable, popular man, a good mixer, but he does not have the courage to sack incompetent members of his Cabinet, and sackings are what are called for.  I will not name names, but there are people in this Cabinet who are not worthy of the back benches of a government party.  Because there will not be a chance of a popular testing of this Government until 1982, or until 1985 if they have sense, we are in the hands <Col N="1871" /> meanwhile of an executive protected by a majority of 20 and presided over by a Taoiseach, popular and personable, with such a tender respect for the consciences of his colleagues that he can draw up new rules for voting procedures within that party.  He is the Taoiseach and that is the Cabinet we are being ruled by, and I say that if that Taoiseach was acting up to the full dimensions of his office as Deputy Lemass would have done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is new to the hurly-burly of politics and that present events are upsetting him.  For a number of years he had looked at the political scene but now he finds himself in a ship on fire.  It is uncomfortable and hot, and some reputations will suffer.  I know this Minister well enough to know that he has a conscience, and one of the reputations that will suffer most grievously will be his. The obvious duty of the Taoiseach now is either a reshuffle or, to put it more charitably, a request to some of his colleagues to go into the back benches to join some of the majority of 20 that he has.</P>
      <P>In the fifteenth week of the postal strike the Taoiseach said &ldquo;We are not going to bend&rdquo;.  He said Deputy Faulkner would be making a factual statement in repiy to what he described as a non-factual statement made by the POWU.  That was after 15 weeks of a postal strike which had been paralysing the communications system of a member state of the EEC.  We had negotiation by television, by Ministerial broadcasts, with promises by the Taoiseach that there would be further factual statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What kind of State do they think they are running?  In the national television network system are we to be treated to a weekly broadcast and a recorrection of factual errors for the remainder of this summer while the tourists go up and down the country with vouchers <Col N="1872" /> provided by the Government, and the natives, who can afford to remain at home, presumably travelling within the boundaries of their areas on bicycles listening to how good things are from the local prophets with propaganda provided by Mount Street?</P>
    <P>I do not underestimate the difficulties of running a modern government.  It is no longer an easy matter to run any modern country, but by any of the criteria of a government doing their job, this administration must be faulted. There were more strikes in the first half of this year in the Government's area of responsibility than throughout the whole of last year.  That is the type of industrial relations we have.  If they would take advice from such a sinister quarter, I would suggest that they listen to the advice of the president of the largest union in the country who spoke yesterday evening about the possibility of rescuing some elements of the national understanding.  I endorse his remarks.  After the unions had rejected the national understanding I suggested an initiative should be taken by the Government, if it is not asking too much of this Government for an initiative in any matter.  I asked them to attempt to salvage some of the positive elements of the national understanding.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes I have left I will simply say that we see a Government who claim they are competent because they have fulfilled some of the easier monetary promises of the manifesto but who are failing to run the country&mdash;in industrial relations, in management of the energy crisis.  I am not saying the energy crisis was invented by the Government, but their management of it, their way of dealing with it and their lack of preparation for it have been sadly lacking.  They are a Government who have declared over and over again their commitment to full employment, yet we see more unemployment.  I predict that, in conditions of the EMS, before the end of this year we will be in severe balance of payments difficulties, that the Irish £ will be in difficulties <i>vis-à-vis</i> other European currencies.  I predict that inflation will be more than 14 per cent before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>They are my gloomy predictions tonight, and unless the Taoiseach acts <Col N="1873" /> like a Taoiseach and removes some of the rather incompetent people he has in his Government there is a despairing outlook for this country in the next two <Col N="1874" /> or three years while we are waiting for a general election.</P>

      <Col N="1788" /> The question of the rationalisation of the educational facilities in the parish of Doonbeg has been under consideration by my Department for some time but, unfortunately, it has not been possible to bring any scheme of centralisation of the schools in the parish to a satisfactory conclusion.  I have, in the circumstances, authorised grants for necessary works of improvement to Baltard national school. In view, however, of the small number of pupils from Doonbeg parish who attend Bansha national school and because of its proximity to Baltard national school, I am not in a position to sanction a grant towards the cost of extensive works of repair which would be necessary to put the premises into a satisfactory condition.</P>
