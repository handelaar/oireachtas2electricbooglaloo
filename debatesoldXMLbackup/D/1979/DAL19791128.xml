      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last night I think I had answered most of the points raised during the debate.  The Irish dairy industry has responded positively to the opportunities presented by our EEC membership and with it our access to a market in excess of 250 million people. Our dairy industry is of necessity export oriented.  Despite our having the highest levels of consumption of butter and liquid milk in the Community, only about one-third of Ireland's production of dairy products is consumed at home.  We are therefore heavily dependent on markets abroad.</P>
      <P>Dairying contributed substantially to the balance of trade with milk-based products constituting around 30 per cent of total agricultural exports in 1978. Dairying occupies a fundamental position in the Irish economy.  Half the country's farms are engaged in commercial dairy enterprises and the value of milk produced on these farms, which amounted to over £500 million in 1978, accounts for some 32 per cent of total agricultural production.  The processing of dairy products is one of our main industries accounting for about 15 per cent of total manufacturing output and providing 20 per cent of total employment in the food manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>An Bord Bainne have been successful in finding these markets not only in the Community but throughout the world. For that reason, continuance of State guarantee will help the board in continuing their good work.  I strongly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> In page 5, to delete lines 12 and 13 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  On&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) a sale by competitive tender, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a sale by auction of goods of a type defined by the Minister by order,</P>
    <P>the buyer is not in any circumstances to be regarded as dealing as consumer.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>During the Committee Stage debate reference was made by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Enright to the potential difficulties for the bloodstock industry arising from the Bill and I received many submissions on this question in the last 12 months, particularly from the Irish Bloodstock Breeders Federation who were concerned that the Bill would necessitate fundamental changes in the custom which had grown up in relation to sales of bloodstock, particularly as regards the exclusion of liability in respect of imperceptible defects at time of sale.</P>
    <P>The main concern was that since auction sales were not excluded by definition from the Bill the conferring of the wide range of implied rights contained in the Bill on consumers at bloodstock auctions would create a situation in which foreign or Irish sellers would be reluctant to use Irish auction sales at all, since the conditions imposed on sellers of bloodstock were not as onerous in other countries.</P>
    <P>The crucial issue was, of course, whether buyers at bloodstock auctions would be regarded as consumers as defined in section 3.  I felt they could not be so regarded, that the vast majority of bloodstock auction buyers would be acting in the course of a business, thereby enabling the sellers in such cases to exclude their liability for defects and so on in the animal so far as it was fair and reasonable for them to do so. However, following a further meeting with the Bloodstock Breeders Federation I am satisfied that there is at least a doubt as to whether buyers at <Col N="153" /> bloodstock auctions could be regarded as consumers or business buyers.  In these circumstances I propose, as the amendment provides, that the Minister be given an enabling power to exempt such auctions by order after the Bill's enactment.  This will enable us to see whether the difficulties posed by the federation will exist after the Bill is enacted. If the new range of provisions in the Bill do show signs of creating these difficulties at that stage, the Minister will have power to exempt such auction sales specifically.  The federation have indicated that the course of action proposed would be acceptable to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  While I accept the Minister's view on this matter she has sympathy with the idea behind the whole thing.  She mentions doubt with regard to the operation of bloodstock auctions, sales and so on. Having accepted that there is a doubt and that she may at a later stage be required to produce an order to facilitate those people who would be very badly affected if they were looked on as consumers, she refuses to insert in the Bill a section which would put everything beyond doubt&mdash;to exclude this kind of activity from the liabilities and provisions of the Bill.  It is not good enough to wait and see what will happen.  If that were applied to other Bills we would only have the bones of a Bill and the rest depending on orders to be introduced later depending on the working of the Bill in relation to the people directly concerned with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments put down by Deputies Enright and Cosgrave do a specific job in this case: they exclude people involved in bloodstock sales. There is no ambiguity about it.  The suggestion that their amendments be included is something with which I go along fully on the basis that it is a definite and sure way of avoiding any confusion, litigation or complications that might arise if people are caught up <Col N="154" /> in the provisions of the Bill.  There is no question of their being morally bound by the provisions as the Minister has accepted.</P>
    <P>At what stage would the Minister feel it was necessary to introduce an order excluding this area of activity from the Bill?  It could be too late if somebody was involved in litigation as a result of the provisions of the Bill.  Could the Minister introduce an order which would have retrospective powers to get that person off the hook, a person who, in the Minister's own words, should not have been there the first day?  That is what I am worried about.  The amendments proposed by Deputies Enright and Cosgrave would get over that eventuality or risk.  Waiting to see how it works and then applying a remedy is not the way to do this.  Once it is accepted that these people are at risk the provisions of the Bill should not apply to them.  I see no reason why either of the two amendments could not be accepted.</P>

      <P>At present the bloodstock industry is subject to existing consumer legislation.  To accept amendment No. 3 would create a new dimension because we would be excluding them from any provision of existing legislation or this Bill.  Having had discussions with the federation it was felt that there was a certain doubt.  I had maintained up to then that sales such as those described would not have been consumer sales because the vast majority of them would be in the course of a business.  When we think of the kind of money that changes hands at such an auction we must accept that these sales are business sales and not consumer sales.  To do what Deputy O'Toole suggests and exempt bloodstock sales altogether would not be feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency a very lucrative business goes on in the auction sales of Connemara ponies.  Many of these are bought in the course of business but many are also bought by consumers for their children, family or for use at home. If we were to exempt all bloodstock auctions we would be opening the floodgates <Col N="155" /> and exempting these types of sales as well.  I am satisfied after discussions with the federation that there is some doubt about whether their auction sales are 100 per cent in the course of business or not.  It would be the intention to make an order after consultations with the federation when the Bill is passed, when we see how it works and if these sales are being caught by this legislation.  If there is a necessity for an order the Minister will have no hesitation in making one.</P>

      <P>As advised by the Minister now the section reads more effectively. It could be extended beyond pure reference in future to bloodstock sales as such.  Bloodstock owners&mdash;we are considering here a particular type of bloodstock sale or auction&mdash;by and large should be reasonably happy with the amendment as proposed.  It is not appropriate in a Bill of this kind to have specific reference to specific sales of a specific category.  It has been argued that the inclusion of a specific reference in relation to motor vehicles was somewhat outside the ambit of the Bill but nevertheless motor vehicles are in and so be it.  To have a specific exemption given to bloodstock auctions as such, and we know the different types of categories of such auctions within the industry, would be singularly inappropriate.  The tidying up of that section by the Minister giving sale by competitive tender and then sale by auction of goods of a type defined by the Minister by order meets the demand. I am sure Deputies Enright and Cosgrave will feel that the case they made, which is reasonable, has been met. It is a massive industry and I would go along with the view that where one is selling by auction show jumpers, ponies or a particular type of bloodstock to try and get a definition to encompass the whole industry is not on and it is best done by order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the Minister she has endeavoured to go a little of the way but it is not sufficient in the circumstances.  As Deputy Desmond pointed out the bloodstock industry is a <Col N="156" /> most important one.  Irish racing animals have a worldwide reputation for being top class.  This Bill is running parallel to similar legislation in Britain but the British legislation specifically excludes bloodstock.  What we will have is a situation where people will be selling bloodstock and they will not be selling at the same level or on the same terms as at similar sales in Britain.</P>
      <P>At sales here a person selling a yearling is selling it for racing purposes.  The position now is that if it is later discovered that the animal is not a very good animal the purchaser may try to rely on this Bill as it is presently framed.  The situation in Britain is that they would be excluded from coming back with some complaint.  I would put it to the Minister that the people who are involved in bloodstock, the people who conduct purchases and sales, are not the innocent consumer who comes to buy clothes, television sets or anything else.  They are dealing in bloodstock in the normal course of their business.  They are competent and know what they are about and they are prepared to come in and purchase an animal.  That is the position as it stands at present.  That is the position as it stands in Britain at present. This Bill, as it stood originally, would have left sales of bloodstock here in an unequal situation in comparison with sales in Britain.  The Minister has moved a certain distance towards meeting this situation but she has not moved sufficiently far.  To wait to see how the situation develops and then bring in an order is not enough.  She should include the amendment I put down.  It would be wiser, better and more appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not got the exact figures of the sales returns of yearlings and bloodstock but I am told that we would have about £6 million per year.  In fact, it is really a matter of choice for a bloodstock owner as to whether he will sell his bloodstock here in Ireland or bring it outside the country.  In this situation where there may be a possibility of bloodstock owners selling their animals outside Ireland as distinct from selling them here, we <Col N="157" /> should be exceptionally careful in arriving at a situation where we may through legislation such as this discourage people from selling at home and encourage them to sell in Britain or somewhere else. I know that is not the Minister's intention and I know that is why she has gone some way to meet the situation.  But it is not sufficient under the circumstances.</P>
    <P>This is an important matter to this House and to this country.  We must maintain the situation where we are the envy of many countries around the world because of the type of animals we are purchasing and the type of sales we conduct.  It is in our interests to attract horse breeders from all over the world to come here to purchase animals.  We are doing that at present.  We are also encouraging Irish breeders to breed and sell their horses here.  This legislation, as it is drafted at present, may discourage Irish horse owners and horse breeders from selling in Ireland.  I know this is far from being the intention of the Minister. Although I have no interest in it myself and rarely even go to race meetings, I am reliably informed by people involved in this business that this amendment that Deputy Cosgrave and I placed on the Order Paper is regarded as being of major significance to the bloodstock industry. The Minister spoke of Ballinasloe and the Connemara ponies.  I wander over there annually as well.  People are not that innocent around there either. They are not going to make any mistakes.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's point about the Connemara ponies and so on.  It is a valid point. Many people are buying Connemara ponies for their families.  The situation is that in regard to bloodstock&mdash;and if the Minister includes Connemara ponies in this I will go along with that&mdash;the situation is that the buying and selling of animals requires a certain amount of skill and knowledge and I feel there is a <Col N="158" /> responsibility on the people purchasing them.  But where people go to auctions at a horse fair to purchase animals we have a situation affecting the whole bloodstock industry because of this unique annual fair.  I believe the Minister has met the situation to some extent but she should go the whole way because it is of particular importance.</P>

      <P>I appreciate some of the points made by Deputy Enright.  It would be right to point out, first of all, that the British legislation does not exclude the bloodstock industry from the provisions of their Bill.  What they do exclude are auctions generally, and in that instance I suppose bloodstock auctions would be excluded from their Bill.  However, I have gone as far as I intend to go.  I feel that the amendment as it is would enable the Minister to make an order after the passing of legislation in consultation with the federation when he and they discover that the provisions of the Bill are catching them.  The vast majority of sales that would take place at such bloodstock auctions would be in the course of a business.  The Deputy mentioned the figure of £6 million turnover per year at these sales.  If one were to attend a sale and see the amount of money that changes hands one would realise that certainly the vast majority of buyers at these auctions would not be dealing as consumers but would be dealing in the course of a business.  It would be very wrong if we were to accept either of the two Opposition amendments, because we would be telling a person buying a pony for his child that he has no protection under the Bill and that we, through an Opposition amendment, are ensuring that he is not going to have any rights. The bloodstock industry at present comes under the provisions of the old 1893 Act and to now exclude them under this Act would be creating something new altogether for the industry.  They have lived with the 1893 Act and I feel they can live with the Sale of Goods Act. The federation themselves are fairly pleased with the amendment which is now before the House and there would <Col N="159" /> be no delay in making an order after the passing of the Bill if it was proved to the Minister that the provisions of the Bill were catching these auctions sufficiently to warrant such an order being made.</P>

      <P>When this section was being discussed during Committee Stage Deputy B. Desmond suggested that the period of 12 months during which summary proceedings for an offence could be initiated was not long enough or was unnecessarily short.  Given the type of legislative measures that are in the Bill and taking account of the points that he made, I consider the suggestion a good one and the present amendment reflects my agreement with his suggestion that the period should be extended from 12 to 18 months.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 35, to delete &ldquo;whose business it is to deal in motor vehicles&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the course of a business&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A matter of concern to those engaged in the motor trade full-time and whose main business is selling motor cars is that people are involved in the purchase and sale of motor vehicles as a sideline only, dealing on a part-time basis but, nevertheless, in the course of business.  I want to ensure that the provisions of this Bill are wide enough to encompass all people who are dealing in the sale of motor vehicles in the course of business and far more people than the legislation as drafted at present includes.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied <Col N="160" /> that the wording in section 13 (3) as it stands, describing the kind of person who will be required to issue a certificate, that is somebody whose business it is to deal in motor vehicles, is sufficiently exact to cater for the type of situation which Deputy Enright wants the section to cover.  An important intention of this subsection is to oblige the legitimate dealer and the rogue dealer to issue a certificate the contents of which would be in such form as the Minister may prescribe by regulation.  This certificate would be to the effect that the vehicle is at the time of delivery free from any defects that would render it a danger to the public which, of course, would include persons travelling in the vehicle. Both the legitimate and the rogue dealer are covered in the existing subsection (3). Therefore, the amendment proposed by Deputy Enright would be superfluous and would not add any greater clarity or clarify for the benefit of the consumer what is already in the section.  It would not provide greater protection than the section does at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate the view that I expressed previously, that the proposition put forward by Deputy Enright is fair and reasonable.  A situation could arise where reputable motor traders who are engaged on a whole-time basis in this trade will be reluctant to deal in the second-hand trade particularly and will urge a person who wants to trade-in his car to go away and sell it privately on the basis that they do not wish to incur the possible future litigation which might arise because they will be obliged to issue a certificate, whereas those who dispose of vehicles privately&mdash;and I suppose quite a substantial amount of the trade is done privately&mdash;would not require to produce a certificate.  The incentive to the full-time motor trader to keep out of that end of the market seems to be built into the Bill as it is at present.  On that basis, since the Minister intends to retain the certificate, I would prefer to see that everybody on the point of sale, whether engaged wholly in the business or on a purely casual basis, would have to <Col N="161" /> provide a certificate.  In that context at least there would be a degree of equity between the full-time, reputable motor trader and the part-time individual&mdash;and quite a few part-time individuals are engaged in it even though they have not been tracked down by the Revenue Commissioners as I suppose they will be in due course.  On that basis Deputy Enright's proposition has merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some concern amongst the motor traders that a considerable number of people will endeavour to get around the section.  Such people do not add to the reputation of the motor trade and in fact can do damage to its reputation.  As the Bill is drafted at present there is a danger of accelerating the effort of people to avoid its provisions.  There are many ways of doing that.  People make an effort to get around it by passing a vehicle on to a third party and disposing of it through a private sale using a telephone number. Deputy Desmond informed us during the Committee Stage debate that in one newspaper he noticed 15 to 18 advertisements carrying the same telephone number offering different cars for sale.  The section may encourage people to make greater efforts to get around the law.  In my view it was intended to give protection to the consumer in the purchase of cars.  It will give such protection to those who purchase vehicles from reputable dealers but it will not ensure that other people involved in the sale of cars as a sideline will be caught.  Such people make a lot of money from those transactions. They do not have garages, do not sell petrol or spare parts.  They make profit without responsibility.  If the amendment is not accepted the situation will be left hanging in mid-air.  I have no doubt that such people will come up with many ideas to avoid the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 47 and 48, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" />&ldquo;(5) Regulations under subsection (3) may apply to motor vehicles generally or to motor vehicles of a particular class or description (defined in such manner and by reference to such things as the Minister thinks proper) and different forms of certificate may be prescribed for different classes of descriptions of vehicles.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will recall that during Committee Stage I proposed an amendment to the section the effect of which would have been that a certificate of roadworthiness would have been required only where a dealer was dealing in secondhand cars rather than new cars. The Opposition Deputies who spoke vigorously opposed the amendment on the grounds that the need to ensure freedom from dangerous defect was just as important and applicable in the case of new motor vehicles as it was in the case of secondhand ones.  Deputy Desmond went on to suggest that the Minister be given enabling powers to prescribe one form of certificate for new vehicles and another type of certificate for secondhand vehicles.  I saw merit in that approach and I agreed to look at it between Committee Stage and Report Stage.  It was on that basis that I withdrew the amendment.</P>
    <P>Having considered the matter further since Committee Stage I have decided that it would be useful and desirable for the Minister to have powers to give him several options when making regulations under this subsection.  It could be desirable, for example, that he would have one form of certificate for new cars, another for secondhand cars, another for motor cycles and another for buses.  The amendment I am now proposing contains this flexibility by enabling the Minister to prescribe different forms of certificates for different types of motor vehicles.  Having regard to the discussion which took place on Committee Stage I believe that Deputies Enright and Desmond will accept my amendment on the basis that it gives that flexibility and ensures that a certificate can be prescribed for whatever type of vehicle a person purchases.</P>

      <P>The amendment is reasonable and fair.  I am in agreement with it.  There is a necessity to define the types of certificates and vehicles.  I have some reservations about the implications of some of the items mentioned in the Bill but the amendment goes some way to meeting those reservations.  I have reservations about criminal liability being introduced into some of the consumer legislation.  It is the first departure of such a nature and is something that must be watched to see if it will develop for good or not.  The amendment shows that the Minister has endeavoured to go some of the way towards levelling off the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the debate on Committee Stage I have had an opportunity of consulting with the trade on the situation.  It is only fair to tell the Minister that there is still a great deal of concern about what is intended by the section and the precise effect it is intended that the section should have.  The trade is appreciative of the assistance received in the original discussions in relation to the Bill.  The Bill, I have no doubt, will be debated extensively in the Seanad and this matter will be fully investigated. In my view there is a need for further discussion between the Minister, her staff and the trade to tease out some of the implications which will inevitably arise on the adoption of this substantially revised section.  Inevitably the question arises as to what I meant in the context of the definition of a certificate. We were worried that a certificate solely applied to secondhand cars to the exclusion of new motor vehicles.  It is being put to me that I should explain the kind of certificate that would be issued.  Those engaged on a full-time basis in the trade are worried that they may find themselves in some kind of consequential litigation of a substantial nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In entering into a Committee Stage debate I put those considerations out of my mind.  Since then strong arguments have been put to me that perhaps we rushed that section.  Therefore, there is a need to spell out the exact consequences of the development of a certification <Col N="164" /> system.  It is a most complex matter.  In the definition section there is no mention of what a certificate constitutes.  The matter is up in the air in that sense.  Since this is a big industry in which litigation can be of massive proportions the Minister should have another look at this section before it goes to the Seanad and have further discussions with the trade. This morning the Minister said that there would be certificates for new cars, certificates for secondhand cars and certificates for vehicles such as tractors, trucks and so on.  Only those engaged full-time in the trade will be obliged to provide certificates.  It has been put to me that we might create a situation where the full-time trade would have contractual obligations placed on it and would be perpetually avoiding being dragged through the courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have another look at this section.  My colleagues in the Seanad will be attempting to tease out with the Minister the precise legal implications of the section.  Perhaps further consultations with the trade might be productive.  We have been trying to devise a Bill which would be effective in the long term, even on a co-operative basis.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the points made by Deputy Desmond. The trade cannot say that they did not receive co-operation from me and from the officials of the Department whenever they requested a meeting.  On Second and Committee Stages I said my intention was to have the best possible Bill; that we would not be putting people out of business for the sake of putting them out of business.  I said that we would be providing protection for the consumer as well as providing a measure of protection for the manufacturer and the trader. The amendment being discussed goes a <Col N="165" /> long way towards meeting many of the trade's objections.</P>
      <P>It would have been dangerous to outline in the definition section what a certificate would contain.  It was always the intention that the certificate would be formulated on the basis of discussions between the trade and the Minister after the passing of the Bill.  In other words, the trade would have points to make on what should be included in the provisions of a certificate.  As the people immediately concerned with the matter the trade would have a better idea than most of what should be contained in a certificate. After the Bill is enacted, it may be necessary to amend the types of certificates that would be issued.  Therefore, it is better that the certificate and its provisions are not defined.</P>
      <P>I am sure that there will be a great deal of discussion before the Bill goes to the Seanad.  Many of the Senators have strong views on this section.  If there is any way in which I can co-operate with the Senators and the trade, I shall be delighted to do so.</P>

At the time I felt that it was not necessary to include the word &ldquo;written&rdquo; before &ldquo;statement&rdquo;, and I am still of that opinion.

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 22 after line 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;52.&mdash;(1) (a) If any dispute or question arises with regard to compliance by a person with any provision of this Act, any person concerned may apply to the Director of Consumer Affairs to have the matter determined by his arbitration and any decision given shall be legally binding.</P>
      <P>(b) An appeal shall lie to the Circuit Court against a decision of the Director under paragraph (a) of this subsection.</P>
      <P>(2) The Director of Consumer Affairs shall have power to summon witnesses, demand production of all necessary books, receipts and documents to enable him to investigate and adjudicate on the matter.</P>
      <P>I referred to this matter in detail on Committee Stage.  I have in mind the setting up by the Department of special courts.  The Director of Consumer Affairs should have authority to deal with offences that arise under the legislation. As the Minister is aware, the special courts established in Britain have been successful and I feel that we should set up courts to deal with these matters.</P>
      <P>The number of cases being dealt with by our existing courts is responsible for long delays.  The atmosphere in our existing courts intimidates those who have to attend them.  People are nervous of attending courts.  If a case relating to a faulty television set is being heard on the same day as cases involving serious crimes of violence, robbery, and so on, most people who are affected by this legislation will not wish to go near the court.  By having these cases processed through the courts we are practically negativing this Bill.  We should have special informal courts.  Their decisions would be binding and the atmosphere would be much more informal than in the existing courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person wishes to bring a complaint, the Director of Consumer Affairs <Col N="167" /> will have the power to summon witnesses and to ensure that documents, receipts and papers are produced.  Cases will be dealt with in the same way as they are dealt with in the existing courts. They need not necessarily be heard in the existing courtrooms.  It is essential also that special courts should be set up so that people will not be involved in too much expense.</P>
    <P>Claims could be kept within the limits of the District Court jurisdiction.  This would not cause any difficulty.  I hope that all actions under this Bill will eventually be heard under the jurisdiction of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  If a person is aggrieved at the decision of the Director of Consumer Affairs there will be a right of appeal against that decision to the Circuit Court.  In this way cases could be heard at a reasonable cost and in an informal atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask how these cases will be heard.  It could be something like redundancy payments cases.  They could be heard in all the larger towns.  The Director of Consumer Affairs could appoint people who would appoint others to hear these cases.  The courts would be small.  This would be very helpful and very welcome.  We have delayed too long in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister said she is in the process of having discussions with the Minister for Justice in this regard.  These discussions should proceed.  This amendment would strengthen the Bill.  The setting up of the special courts would cost the State very little.  Their powers would be enormous. They would be able to deal with an amazing number of claims.  They would have the desired affect of allowing people to have their cases heard and decided in an informal session.  If they were aggrieved they could go back to the Circuit Court for a final decision.  This type of smaller special court is necessary.</P>

      <P>I could not agree more with the Deputy on what he has said about the present courts system and how impossible it is for consumers <Col N="168" /> to get their cases heard within a reasonable time.  As he said, the whole atmosphere in a courtroom, for the consumer and for the settling of a small claim, is not conducive to allowing a person to discuss his case in an informal manner.  For a long time I have felt we should have some system for dealing with small claims so that aggrieved consumers could discuss their claims reasonably in an informal setting and get a fair hearing, and a quick hearing which is very important.  Very often under our present court system a case can drag on for months, and even longer.  As a member of the legal profession, I am sure Deputy Enright is concerned about the effect the present courts system might have on any claims consumers might bring.</P>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage&mdash;and this was recommended by the National Consumer Advisory Council in their report&mdash;a small claims system should be set up.  I also made the point that discussions were going on between officials from my Department and the Department of Justice.  To confer arbitration functions on the Director of Consumer Affairs at this stage would be to pre-empt the result of the talks which are going on.  It would be my intention to ensure that the provision of some type of small claims court would not be delayed in my Department or by me.  I will be pressing the Minister for Justice and his officials to ensure that a quick solution to the problem will be forthcoming from that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of Deputy Enright's amendment creates certain problems.  If the director's role was extended to include arbitration matters, it might involve him in acting in a dual capacity. Deputy Enright will appreciate that the director could be acting as prosecutor and adjudicator in certain circumstances. For instance, under section 13 of the Bill, a dispute could arise involving the issuing of an erroneous certificate of freedom from serious defects. In such a case, the director might be in a position to initiate summary proceedings against the person who committed the <Col N="169" /> offence.  However, it would put the director in an impossible position should he also be called upon to adjudicate between the person who issued the false certificate and the consumer who suffered damages as a consequence of the offence.</P>
    <P>From another point of view it would be unrealistic to expect the director, who may have already decided to prosecute a motor dealer for issuing a false certificate, to render an impartial judgment in a related case arising from, say, the same dealer's breach of the implied condition, also contained in section 13, but which could be totally separate from the question of a certificate.  Another argument against the appointment of the Director of Consumer Affairs as an arbitrator in consumer disputes is that the very title of the post might suggest a bias in favour of the consumer though such an assumption might not necessarily be valid.  At any rate I am of the opinion that parties to a dispute who are not consumers might be reluctant on this basis to agree to the director acting as an arbitrator.</P>
    <P>In this context it is legitimate to draw an analogy between the director on the one hand and the machinery we have at present to deal with restrictive practices. Before the enactment of the Restrictive Practices Act in 1972, the then Fair Trade Commission found themselves with both investigative and arbitrary powers, but the 1972 Act removed that anomaly and two distinct entities were created.  There was the Examiner of Restrictive Practices who would have an investigative and prosecuting function and the Restrictive Practices Commission themselves who would have power to make decisions based on the examiner's investigations.  In that case the principle was established that it was better to have two distinct entities. Therefore, I would consider it wrong for us now to bring in a section in this consumer area as proposed by the Deputy when a similar provision was tried originally in the trade area but found to be wanting in that area.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with the general idea of <Col N="170" /> the amendment which is that we should have a type of small claims court system, but as I have said many times the idea of giving the director both investigative and arbitrary powers was found wanting in the trade area and, consequently, should not be attempted now.</P>

      <P>As I said on Committee Stage there is a great necessity for the type of court system that I am proposing. If we fail to set up such a system immediately this legislation may not be strong enough to fulfil its pious aspirations. This is regrettable because the Bill has a lot of merit.  It is going a long way towards protecting the consumer.  While I appreciate that the Minister of State is discussing this matter with the Minister and that, in turn, the whole question is being discussed at senior level with the Department of Justice, I do not believe that during the lifetime of this Dáil we will have courts of the type I am proposing and I am not being anyway political in saying that.  I say this because a long time elapses between the time an idea is mooted here and the time of its actual implementation.  The whole process is prolonged.  I fear that the situation will not be any different in regard to these special type courts, courts to deal with the smaller type of claim.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that on the occasion of this legislation we are failing to take the opportunity of establishing such courts.  I would not foresee any danger in the Minister pre-empting the discussions.  Instead, she would be wise to pre-empt them and to bring in this special type of court without further delay.  The vast majority of those with whom I have discussed this Bill agree with the type of court system I am proposing.  Despite all the talk about civil legal aid, the situation is that we do not have a system of civil legal aid.  In these circumstances a person bringing a case under this legislation, regardless of how small the case might be, would risk a big loss in terms of costs.  That, in itself, would be a deterrent to most people not to get involved in the courts regarding whatever grievance they might have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> The Minister has told us that she would not be in favour of having the Director of Consumer Affairs placed in the invidious position of being both a prosecutor and an arbitrator.  I doubt if that situation would arise, but before the Bill goes to the Seanad I appeal to the Minister to consider an amendment which would provide for the setting up of special-type courts.  If we miss the opportunity of doing this now, many years may elapse before another opportunity presents itself and many people will be greatly disappointed at our failure to grasp this opportunity.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister is aware of the long delays in having cases heard in any of the courts.  In the High Court, for instance, the delay in having a case heard is usually of the order of 18 months.  The people who are likely to be concerned most with this legislation will tend to be the poorer and least educated people who are innocent enough to allow themselves to be wronged in regard to purchases but these are the very people whom the Minister is insisting must go through the courts in the ordinary way in regard to their complaints.</P>
    <P>The smaller-type court would be the ideal set-up for such cases, a court in which the atmosphere would be informal and where people would be encouraged to speak freely.  There would be no necessity for wigs and gowns and there would be no necessity for all the trappings which are at present associated with the legal profession in the courts.  There would be ordinary people in the court I am referring to, dressed in ordinary clothes and speaking ordinary language. The cost involved in civil courts will be greatly reduced in those smaller type courts.  I feel the Minister has an opportunity to set up courts like this under this Bill.  If she misses it the opportunity is lost.</P>

      <Col N="172" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I said earlier, in connection with sections 6 and 13, that we have a new situation developing where criminal law is being introduced into civil law in regard to the sale and purchase of goods for the first time.  I ask the Minister, because of the importance of it and of the fundamental change that is taking place, seriously to consider the situation in regard to the motor vehicle trade as outlined in the Bill and especially in regard to the regulations she is bringing in this morning.</P>
      <P>There is some merit in section 13 in regard to a dangerously defective vehicle at the time of delivery which renders it a danger to the public, including persons travelling in the vehicle.  It is very hard to argue against that.  On the other hand, in regard to the ordinary transactions involving motor cars, people in their ordinary day to day dealings are being placed in a situation where they may find themselves charged in court and liable to jail sentences.  This is a fundamental change.  Before the Bill goes to the Seanad the Minister, as she has done in the past, should meet the people involved in the motor industry once more to see if she can allay their fears.  I am concerned about this matter.</P>
      <P>It is hard to argue against the Bill but I feel we must try to protect consumers. There is also an obligation on all Deputies to ensure that people in their ordinary day to day business are not branded as criminals without taking great pains to ensure that we safeguard their interests and rights.  I want the Minister to appreciate my concern in regard to this fundamental change.  Its consequences may be far reaching and may cause serious difficulties for ordinary people in the motor trade.  The vast majority of those whom I have met in the course of my business are honest people in their day to day dealings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> Those people are going through a difficult time.</P>
    <P>I am worried in case this Bill will have serious repercussions on the day to day affairs of people in the motor trade. Those people are now liable to prosecution and, on conviction, liable to heavy fines and the threat of jail sentences hanging over their heads.  We should be very careful to safeguard against such threats.  A garage owner purchases a vehicle brought into his garage after he has made a careful examination of it.  He examines the vehicle further before he sells it.  Sometimes, through a oversight, a serious defect is not seen on examination. The owner of that garage can still find himself liable to be charged and convicted in court.  I appreciate that the Minister has met the motor trade and I appreciate her goodwill in regard to this. Before the Bill reaches the Seanad and while it is going through the different Stages in that House I ask the Minister to look at this again and to meet the motor trade.  That is my main concern about the Bill, which is a good one.  This is a fundamental change in regard to the ordinary day to day business of people who sell cars and I hope the Minister will give it further consideration.</P>

      <P>I said on Sécond Stage, on Committee Stage and again on Report Stage that it was never my intention to bring the Bill into either House of the Oireachtas and push it through my way without taking into account the opposition which the Opposition might have or indeed any section of the trade might have to various provisions in the Bill.  I have said there were tremendous pressures on me about section 13, which I believe Deputy Enright appreciates. There were pressures on me not alone from the Opposition here but from the trade and from within my own party.  I could have taken the easy way out and left out section 13, exempted the motor trade from any provisions of the Bill. That would have been a cowardly thing to do.  It would have been wrong to exempt <Col N="174" /> any section of the trade or any section of business from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am primarily concerned with ensuring that consumers get adequate protection, which I feel they were sadly in need of up to now.  I reiterate what I already said, that I am prepared to be co-operative, to meet the trade and to try to alleviate any fears they might have about the provisions in the Bill.  In cases where any section of the trade have made a good case for exemption or amendment to the Bill I have been prepared to accept it.  That situation will continue until the Bill is passed by both Houses.</P>

      <P>On section 2, two amendments, Nos. 1 and 2 in the name of Deputy O'Toole, have been ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down two amendments on section 2 (2) of the Bill, for obvious reasons, during debate on Second Stage, with which other members of my Party, and the Opposition in general, agreed.  I appreciate the reasons for the Chair's ruling these two amendments out of order, but section 2 (2) does something which to my knowledge has not been done before, in that it allows the IIRS to raise funds for capital equipment, without these funds being underwritten by the Minister for Finance. On Second Stage, Deputy John Kelly and I and, indeed, others asked the Minister if this approach were applied elsewhere and if there were a precedent for this line of action.  The Minister nodded in the affirmative, but, in reply to the Second Stage debate, did not give any examples of this provision where an institution <Col N="175" /> or State body were being asked to mortgage their fixed assets in order to raise funds for capital equipment or any other kind of capital investment.  As far as I can ascertain, this is new and is not at all acceptable which was why I put down the amendments.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the IIRS are in receipt of a grant-in-aid to which very definitive regulations attach, one being that, under regulations, no excess expenditure may be incurred on grant-in-aid subheads.  This is accepted by this House as part of our financial regulations and is a good thing.  This Bill tidies up this area where the IIRS were coming along with audited figures showing excess expenditure over grant-in-aid allocation; section I regularises that situation, allowing the institute to borrow for current expenditure and show in their books that they have not gone beyond the grant-in-aid allocation.  The sting in the tail is section 2 (2), which is unnecessary.  If the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards avail of this facility and have to pay for availing of this facility out of the grant-in-aid, the Minister will say that, in the case of capital equipment, they need not fall back on grant-in-aid to cover the cost, that the equipment they are using for testing purposes will generate enough revenue to cover the cost of loans raised to purchase the equipment.  This is great in theory, but may be a false assumption. I can envisage certain types of equipment&mdash;possibly very expensive equipment&mdash;which need not necessarily generate the necessary revenue to meet the purchase price and interest rate on loans raised to purchase it.  While in many cases, possibly in most, the Minister is correct in saying that equipment used on a fee basis for testing purposes will generate revenue and pay for itself, there may be cases where this is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in her opening speech on section 2 said&mdash;and I quote from the last sentence of her statement: &ldquo;These borrowing powers should assist the Institute in keeping abreast of technological change in equipment <Col N="176" /> needs.&rdquo;  That is a very lofty aspiration with which we all agree.  However, the institute may be forced because of lack of revenue, into a position where they may not be able to purchase with bank loans this technological equipment to meet the needs of the day, because if they do they will be falling back in their grant-in-aid, which I am sure will be earmarked by them for other purposes within their annual budget.  I see no reason why the Minister for Finance should not underwrite this kind of expenditure. If the equipment generates enough revenue to cover itself, surely the need to call on the Minister to meet this underwriting facility will not arise.  I fail to see the reason for fear or reluctance on the part of the Minister to underwrite this expenditure if what the Minister says is true, as he will not be called upon to meet that guarantee as a guarantor.  If what he says is not true, then the taxpayer is being asked to foot the bill in the form of increased grant-in-aid to meet the payments on this type of equipment.</P>
    <P>A principle has been breached here.  I would ask the Minister, for the second or third time, to give concrete examples of situations where bodies like the IIRS are being allowed to raise funds for specific purposes and where the Minister for Finance is excluding himself from the obligation of underwriting such funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, we on this side of the House are happy with the Bill if the Minister for Finance is prepared to guarantee the borrowings of the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards.  In such instances as they have applied to him for consent to borrow and he gives that consent, then it is essential that the Minister for Finance guarantee such borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I and other speakers pointed out on Second Stage, this Bill has a lot of significance for this country.  Our Institute for Industrial Research and Standards is a most important body for our industrial future.  There are two institutes in this country, the Agricultural Institute and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  I believe that both are <Col N="177" /> regarded with the highest esteem throughout the world.  But we have been solidly starving the latter institute over the years through lack of finance.  We have not provided them with sufficient funds to project themselves and become involved in the industrial research so necessary for industrial expansion here. It is a sad day for this country to have a Bill before this House in which the Minister is not prepared to guarantee their borrowings.  The Minister is obliged to show his confidence in this institute, not through any form of words or hot air but through financial backing.  Indeed he is obliged to add his signature showing that he is prepared to guarantee their borrowings.</P>
    <P>This is a highly important institute in regard to the industrial research they are conducting here and also because of their setting of standards in respect of our industries.  It is a bad Bill that does not permit the Minister to guarantee its borrowings.  Indeed the provision of subsection (2) specifically state: &ldquo;without any guarantee by the Minister for due repayment....&rdquo; I am totally opposed to this.  It is a grave mistake; in fact it is a blunder.</P>
    <P>I quoted previously the figures for 1975 in respect of our gross domestic product being devoted to research and development.  I quoted also the amounts being devoted by other countries.  For example, in 1977 Ireland's share of gross domestic product devoted to research and development was approximately .8 per cent only.  I would ask the Minister to contrast this with the situation obtaining in other countries throughout the world.  To take one example, Germany devotes 2.1 per cent of its gross domestic product to research and development.</P>

But it is not in order to go right back on the Second Stage debate again, and that is what the Deputy is doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not develop the argument any further except to point out to the Minister the seriousness of the situation in which we devote too little of our gross domestic product to research and development.  However, I would reiterate that the total amount we devoted in 1977 for that purpose was similar to the amount in 1975, which I am sure will be somewhat similar to the amount for 1979 when the figures come to hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in this House have a grave obligation to show our confidence in the institute by having the Minister for Finance guarantee any borrowings for the purpose of purchasing capital equipment. If we are to compete with other countries on the industrial development scene we must shoulder our responsibilities by providing the necessary finances for such research and development, equipment and so on, which is of paramount importance to us.  Even if we have not provided sufficient funds heretofore it is essential that we do so now.  I would put the proposition to the Minister that what we are now allowing this institute to do is borrow on the strength of their land and premises, meaning that they mortgage their land and premises without the guarantee of the Minister for Finance.  That is wrong and is a practice we must endeavour to change.  Otherwise it will be questioned by many people and regarded as being serious that the responsible Minister is not prepared to guarantee their borrowings. I cannot put it any stronger than asking the Minister to outline the reasons for his not being prepared to guarantee such borrowings.  There must be a reason and I should like to know what it is.  It is of little use to maintain that there will be an income from capital equipment. <Col N="179" /> That is a weak argument and an insufficient answer.  It may be that when the institute require some capital equipment they borrow on the strength of some project in which they are engaged but, if they require some further equipment, they should not be handicapped in its acquisition.  They are already mortgaged to the hilt, are unable to borrow further and are handicapped in this respect.  We are telling this institute they can go a certain distance only, and that only without the backing of the Minister for Finance, which is a grave mistake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 (2) has been depicted as forcing the IIRS to mortgage their land and buildings to buy capital equipment.  That is not true because the institute purchase already substantial amounts of capital equipment from their grant-in-aid.  The borrowing power for capital equipment is to facilitate the institute in purchasing more equipment where that expenditure can clearly pay for itself out of fees earned. Its rationale is clearly in line with what a frontbench spokesman of the Deputy's party put forward in March last when borrowing powers were being sought for An Foras Talúntais via the AnCOT Bill.  The main point in the Opposition argument at that time was that borrowing should be for profitable capital investment only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 (2) of the present Bill dealing with capital borrowing has this intent. Another point made by the Opposition at that time was that only commercial State bodies with their own source of income should have borrowing powers. This is clearly such a case because the IIRS have a substantial own income. The Opposition made the point that the State would have to repay the borrowings but the overdraft facility in this Bill is simply bridging finance to cover the delays that the IIRS have in receiving their income.  Clients are slow to pay and there is a cash flow problem at the end of a financial year.  At the moment the IDA, CTT, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and <Col N="180" /> An Foras Talúntais have borrowing powers similar to those proposed in this Bill.  To rectify this anomalous situation where the institute did not have those powers, this Bill was brought before the House.  There is nothing new in it and I cannot see why the Deputies have a problem with this section of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the IDA, CTT and BIM.  Can the Minister give the House specific examples where one of these bodies have power to raise money and the Minister is excluded in relation to the borrowing powers?  I know that CTT and a dozen other bodies have power to raise revenue but is there written into the order or the Act empowering them to do so a section specifically excluding the Minister from his obligation to underwrite that borrowing? That is the question at issue.  The Minister has consistently refused to answer it and is now again not prepared to give a straight answer.</P>

The wording here says &ldquo;and without any guarantee by the Minister for the due repayment of any such borrowings, ...&rdquo;.

      <P>Earlier I spoke about ESB fisheries and quoted figures from their 1978 report.  I am sure the Minister read the 1979 figures; if not, I will give them to him.  As I said, the figures for 1978 were alarming but the 1979 figures are <Col N="186" /> disastrous.  If I may quote from the ESB figures at 31 March 1979&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I gave the figure at around 400, but actually 297 salmon went through the ESB hatchery in the River Erne and 42 fish went through the fish pass in the Claddy.  Has the Minister not considered taking over the ESB fisheries?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>We both agree that this Bill is to tie up illegal fishing in the estuaries. Can the Minister give a guarantee that the ESB will restock each river under their control?  Can he guarantee that hatcheries will be opened in the Rivers Liffey, Lee, Shannon, Erne and Claddy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about acquisition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking about restocking and so on which do not come under this section. It is in order to mention acquisition and the fact that the ESB fisheries should be acquired under this section, but we cannot go into the restocking of rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>It is seldom I am out of order and I do not think I am out of order now.  I am making the case under this section for the acquisition of the ESB <Col N="187" /> rivers.  I pointed out that these rivers need to be restocked.  I do not think I am very much out of line when I say that and I am surprised at the Chair pulling me up about it.</P>
      <P>If we do not get a commitment from the Minister that the ESB fisheries should be acquired or transferred by the Department&mdash;they may not even have to be bought because the ESB might give the Department a subsidy&mdash;I am afraid I will have to press this to a vote because this is a very serious matter.  The Department of Fisheries are the body to deal with this.  In my view, all rivers under the control of the ESB should be transferred to the new central board.  We want a guarantee that the hatcheries will be restocked and that eel farming in suitable rivers will be reintroduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is very important and one which we on this side of the House have looked forward to for a number of years.  We have persistently placed before the House in many debates over a number of years the desirability of acquiring the fishery rights of our rivers and lakes for the benefit and use of the Irish people.  We welcome the powers vested in the Minister in this section.  We trust that the section will not prove too cumbersome in acquiring as many stretches of water as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many interested parties concerned with the welfare of our inland fisheries have expressed grave concern about the adequacy of this section to deal effectively with the problem of acquisition of fishery rights, amongst them the Trout Anglers Association of Ireland.  They are concerned, as we are, that the Bill does not seem to be adequate or effective to do the job which we all desire.  Is it not a fact that there is no intention in section 36 or in the Bill generally to take into care the hundreds of miles of potentially good rivers and streams which are at present derelict and unproductive?  If that is the truth of the matter, then it can be said that this section is lacking substantially in effectiveness.  I urge the <Col N="188" /> Minister to take on himself the power, duty and responsibility to take in charge these potentially good rivers and streams which are falling into a derelict condition. It is the obligation of the Minister to intervene in this situation.  Is it the intention to allow these rivers and streams to go by default altogether?  That would be a scandalous state of affairs.</P>
    <P>The section is unsatisfactory and I urge on the Minister the desirability and great need to take into account these large sections amounting to hundreds of miles of rivers, streams and lakes which have been abandoned, are without clear ownership and are utterly unproductive. They could and should be put to good use.  The Bill should include the stipulation to vest all unclaimed waters in the State and, if necessary, use compulsory acquisition procedures in respect of any remaining rivers that may be involved.  It is the belief of many people that the provision of the section is so cumbersome that it may conceivably be ineffective in acquiring a typical 10-mile stretch of free fishing on a brown trout or coarse fish river with perhaps 100 or more riparian landowners.  These are some defects we see in it.</P>
    <P>We welcome the powers vested in the Minister but they should be more embracing and comprehensive to take into account all potential fishery waters.  That is not being done in the Bill and I deplore it.  I would ask the Minister to deliberate deeply on it and perhaps bring in on Report Stage an amendment which will empower him to do as I request: take in charge all unclaimed waters.  They are many in number and many miles in stretch.  They are potentially great waters if treated properly.</P>
    <P>It has been said that legal problems will arise under this section as to whether a stretch of water is comprehended by the phrase &ldquo;a particular fishery&rdquo; in section 36 (a), as to the grounds needed to satisfy the Minister under section 36 (5) that a public right to fish exists, and from the point of view of constitutional rights on the lack of any specific provision for an appeal to the courts from the decision of the Minister or the arbitrator. <Col N="189" /> We must not pass this section without bringing these matters to the attention of the Minister and asking him if he will have second thoughts on tidying up this section so that we can leave the Bill, in its passage to the House, in the knowledge that the State has control over all inland fisheries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and extend my congratulations to the Minister for what is contained in the Bill.  I am seeking to strengthen the Minister's hand in giving effect to a measure which will have control over all our inland waters. In order to avoid the pitfalls and trauma of compulsory acquisition it is recommended that the Bill provide, in addition to the powers of acquisition, that after a date to be appointed no charge may be made for fishing or for access to fishing on any unrated fishery without the approval of the central board.  The Minister will see the significance of that.  Others may take over the rivers I referred to and seek to use them for their own purposes outside the Bill in years to come.  The appointed date to which I have referred could be so arranged that existing owners of fisheries which are valuable would have enough time to enable them to have their value assessed by the Valuation Office beforehand.  They could be given two or three years from the passing of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of what Deputy White said about acquisition and about the role of the ESB, I am not certain if this is the appropriate section to deal with it but I have already gone on record in the House in my speech on Second Stage and on Committee Stage as seeking to impress upon the Minister the need to ensure that all bodies interested in fisheries are taken under the umbrella of this Bill.  That would include the ESB.  I know of no good reason why the ESB Salmon Research Trust or indeed the Department's own fresh water research unit should not be included.  If we do not bring these bodies under the aegis of this Bill we are clearly allowing fragmentation of work and interests which would <Col N="190" /> be inefficient, costly and cumbersome.  I would deplore a situation where the Minister, while leaving the ESB off the hook, acquiesced to pressures in that area.  It would be a far more effective Bill if the ESB were seen to be included.</P>
    <P>We have seen the sorry situation which can result from a number of bodies, the ESB Salmon Research Trust, and in particular the local authorities, seeking to do the same job.  We have seen lakes and rivers virtually die while all these various bodies fiddled about.  In a situation, as can be borne out, where the ESB have failed in their responsibility to maintain the fishery waters under their control, where stocks are down and they have failed to replenish the stocks, there is a bounden obligation on the Minister to bring the ESB under the control of this Bill.  They were established to provide electric power.  It was only by accident rather than design that they came into control of fisheries and lakes.  This Bill seeks to tidy up that situation and there is no justification whatsoever for leaving the ESB outside the ambit of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I raised on Second Stage was that approximately 50 per cent of the salmon rivers and estuary salmon fisheries are in private ownership at present.  I am aware that the Minister did a very good deal in purchasing the Corrib fishery two years ago and he has developed it along the right lines and with great benefits to the nation. However, I suspect that the moneys will not be available to acquire the bulk of fisheries presently not being utilised to the fullest advantage.  For instance early this year or late last year the Screebe fishery came on the market.  At the time the Minister said he did not regard it as being sufficiently important to acquire for public ownership but I suspect that the finances were not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That deal is still open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not move at that time.  I wonder if the Minister could quantify the proportion of the 50 per cent in private ownership <Col N="191" /> which are neglected and the proportion which are utilised to good effect.  Has the Minister any idea how much of that total should be acquired?  Many of these fisheries are being neglected because the owners are absentee landlords and pay little or no attention to the fisheries in question.  It has also been pointed out to me by people interested in the inland fisheries that a number of lakes, especially in the midland counties of Cavan and Monaghan, are not controlled at all; there is no development of what could be very good fisheries.  What steps does the Minister intend to take to see that these are developed in the public interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been made.  I would just like to clarify one aspect and that is in regard to the ESB.  Under this legislation the ESB are in precisely the same position as any private owner of a fishery.  Under this section which is a very global section the central board, provided the Minister is satisfied, are enabled to acquire any fishery in the country so therefore any of the ESB fisheries can be acquired under this section.  That is the position.</P>
      <P>What I was concerned to say on the last occasion was that, as matters stand now, by reason of the substantial investment by the ESB in their fisheries, particularly in the Shannon fishery, and their commitment to the development of fisheries I would not envisage moving against them in any way at present.  But I can do it and any successor of mine could do it and if the ESB drop their commitment to fishery development in the waters under their control at some future date then the central board can, on application to whatever Minister is here, move against the ESB.  Certainly as of now, the ESB have set up a magnificent fisheries division; they have a fisheries research station on the Shannon which is one of the best in the world; they have a magnificent stock there; they have excellent salmon hatcheries. They are losing £250,000 a year on it but they are committed to it.  I asked them not to lose faith in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> It was largely they and other people who are interested in fisheries who induced me to bring in the strong regulations last year for the preservation and conservation of salmon because I am convinced that unless we tackle the illegal fishing in our estuaries there is no point in the ESB, the State or anybody else embarking on a national hatchery policy.  I agree that there should be a national hatchery policy.  It is essential for the future that there be such allied with a natural rehabilitation of the existing spawning beds.  The two go hand in hand and there is no point in putting the cart before the horse.  The first priority in this area is to stamp out the high incidence of illegal fishing that has taken place particularly over the past ten years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in the estuaries only that is taking place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Illegal fishing covers an even wider area than the estuaries as Deputy Deasy reminds me.  In that context I was thinking in particular of the Shannon.  The wholesale buccaneering that has gone on in the Shannon Estuary over the past five to ten years has been nothing short of a national scandal.  We have done what we can and Deputy Deasy is aware of the fact that we have enabled controls to be exercised for the first time ever.</P>

      <P>They are doing this for the national benefit.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If at any future date the ESB, for instance, lose interest in fishery development, effectively the position is the same as that of a private fishery owner.  They can be proceeded against under this section and any ESB fisheries can be acquired, as any private fishery can be acquired, by the central board on application to the Minister of the day on his being satisfied that it can be acquired. The Deputy will find that stated in section 36 (1) in clear, unambiguous English.  The Salmon Research Trust are mentioned as are Bord na Móna.  Any State body who may require a fishery are in the same position as any private owner.  No distinction is drawn.  Subsection (1) (a) states: <Col N="195" /> .... it is necessary that a particular fishery be acquired under this section,</P>
      <P>It cannot be plainer than that.  That means that any and every fishery within the State is open to the acquisition procedures set out there in section 36.  I hope that is clear.</P>
      <P>I am very proud of this section.  This is the first time that such a section has been introduced and the first time the State is taking on to itself this power to acquire such fisheries in the national interest either voluntarily or compulsorily.  It is an historic occasion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy raised a point about stretches of water with no title, or unclaimed waters.  I assure the Deputy that I have a lot of sympathy with the point of view that he expressed and when we were preparing this Bill I went into this point in very great detail.  As he said, quite rightly, representations were made to me by angling bodies, the Trout Anglers Federation in particular, in regard to the acquisition of such waters. I am going to be frank as to why we did not include this in the Bill.  It comes down to the legal question of making title, the rights of riparian owners, the rights to private property under the Constitution and so forth.  We would be getting into a tangled legal undergrowth of trouble and we would have to build up a whole staff to deal with it and there would be no end to the difficulties involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not mind facing up to that if there were not enough waters that we can acquire fairly quickly and immediately provided the money is available for the purpose, but there are so many waters in the country and so many rights-of-way that can be acquired and so many waters that can be developed without getting into any legal tangle or tussle, that there is enough work in that area for the Central Fisheries Board for decades ahead.  In other words, it is not as if waters with no title were the only waters in the country. They are not.  I appreciate that there are many desirable waters which could be <Col N="196" /> acquired which have no title and so on, but we face the problem of acquiring them and then facing legal action, being brought into the Supreme Court and so forth by some riparian owner who imagines that he or she has the right to such waters.  That would be the situation, especially in an area like a stretch of water where hundreds of such people could be claiming a right to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know very well what he was talking about, but if you start to move against unclaimed waters a lot of claimants arise.  Any lawyer will tell you that if you start to move against an unclaimed plot of land plenty of people will arise who will claim it and if you start to move against unclaimed waters every riparian owner will be in with some imagined right or other.  I have examined the point fully and I recognise its merits, but on balance I came to the view that it is as well to get this legislation through, get this section on the Statute Book for the first time, deal with the waters that can be acquired and to which title can be ascertained and obtained, and deal with the access.  I place greater importance upon the access than upon the waters themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying to Parliamentary Questions on Government policy in relation to Northern Ireland on 17 October last I indicated our belief that ultimately the way to reconcile the two major traditions and to create permanent peace and stability in Ireland lay in the free and voluntary coming together of the people of Ireland under agreed political structures.  I also said that the process of discussion and negotiation we favoured to that end would be promoted, without any question of imposing a solution, by a declaration by the British Government of their readiness to encourage the unity of Ireland, by agreement, in independence and in a harmonious relationship between the two islands.  That remains our position.  I indicated also that the immediate need was to end the political vacuum and stalemate in the North and that the immediate priority was therefore to establish in Northern Ireland a system of devolved administration which the majority of people in both sections of the community could support and sustain. The major responsibility for devising the form and substance of such a system rests with the British Government but a solution will require the co-operation of the two Governments and of both parts of the community in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, in their statement of 21 November 1979, following publication of the British Government's Working Paper for the proposed conference, recalled the indications given in that reply and on all other occasions of the way in which the Government would wish to see progress made.  We indicated that we would be observing developments closely with a view to assessing whether any combination of the elements outlined in the British Working Paper was likely to meet the basic criteria of acceptability to both sections of the community in Northern Ireland and of bringing about the appropriate climate in which further political progress could be made in relation to all the aspects of this <Col N="198" /> tragic and complex situation.  I would draw attention here to the reference to &ldquo;all the aspects&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government who had deliberately left it to the parties in Northern Ireland to give initial reactions to the Working Paper have now noted that the paper has not met a basic criterion, referred to in our statement of 21 November, of acceptability to both sections of the community in the North.  We would urge that further consideration be given to those aspects of the paper which are the subject of current controversy so as to ensure that an appropriate climate for political progress is brought about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what all that was about.  Can he tell us specifically what is left, after the production of this document, of the Government's recently announced policy?  In other words, what has happened and what is to happen in relation to the ignoring of the Irish dimension, to the abandonment of any thought of unity of the country and since power sharing is not on?  This situation would appear to have taken care of all that was left of Fianna Fáil policy.</P>

      <P>Regarding the first part of the supplementary, I appreciate that the Deputy was not here when I started the reply but I will ensure that a copy of the full reply is made available to him afterwards so that he may read it in detail. Regarding the Deputy's question about the Irish dimension, the Government's policy has been outlined in the House on innumerable occasions and that policy remains as it has been.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am really asking is, in view of the fact that through all the recent issues of Government policy in respect of the Six Counties, we would appear to have been left with but three aspects&mdash;the Irish dimension, eventual unity, which is a sort of pious wish, and power sharing-since all three of those aspects are now effectively wiped out and just not on so far as Mrs. Thatcher is concerned, where do we go from here in so far as Government policy is concerned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>First, the Deputy is being premature in assuming that all these aspects are now being left aside.  There is continuing discussion and development in relation to the recent British proposals and the Government, as I said in the reply initially, would urge that further consideration be given to those aspects of the paper which are the subject of current controversy.  I understand that the other participants in these discussions are making their points of view quite clear also.</P>

However, can the Minister say whether the statement made by the Taoiseach during an RTE radio interview to the effect that at this time he would not insist on an Irish dimension, still holds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be false to suggest that the Taoiseach made such a statement or to take out of context in such a way what he said.  The Taoiseach indicated that he would not press the formal structures at that stage but at all times he has continued to represent to the British Government in particular the need to encourage the ultimate unification of Ireland and the need for the British Government to make clear their position in that respect.  I might add that the House would appear to be forgetting that the Taoiseach was the first person to get from the British Government an official recognition of an Irish dimension.</P>

What, therefore, remains to be done in the sense of getting a declaration which, as far as I am concerned, the British have already given?

I should like everybody to be clear about the fact that that is not being critical of the agreement, but in the development of policy subsequently one must take into consideration the after effects of the Sunningdale Agreement.  The Taoiseach has made it clear that he continues to support an agreement and procedures within the North of Ireland which will receive the support of the majority of both communities, whatever name is put on such arrangements and agreements.

      <P>Following negotiations between the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board and the Local Government and Public Services Union on a claim on behalf of town clerks generally, agreement was reached on a number of issues. Part of the agreement provided that town clerks would, where appropriate, be granted an annual travelling allowance, in lieu of travelling expenses for each individual journey, to cover their expenses for travel on official business.  It was agreed also that the method referred to by the Deputy would be employed in determining the allowance in each case.  This is the procedure adopted in similar cases throughout practically the entire local authority service and it is considered to be the fairest way of relating a fixed allowance to the officer's mileage in the course of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy, the following are the relevant facts:</P>
      <P>In 1977 and 1978 my Department applied for FEOGA aid totalling £5.05 million on behalf of 101 group water schemes in various parts of the country. In July 1979 the EEC Commission allocated FEOGA aid totalling £697,807 to 29 group schemes.  The balance of the FEOGA aid applications in respect of group water schemes were, I regret to say, unsuccessful.  I understand that the reason why so many applications were unsuccessful was the inadequacy of the funds which could be made available under the FEOGA regulations then applicable. New proposals put forward by the Commission are at present awaiting the approval of the Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>My Department did not lead any group to believe that they would receive a FEOGA grant in advance of the decision of the EEC Commission.  The covering letter to groups issued by the Department with each FEOGA grant application form included the following paragraph, which I will read out in full:</P>
      <P>A considerable time (12 months or more) may elapse before the decision on the applications for FEOGA aid for co-operative water supply schemes is known.  The decision as to whether or not to grant FEOGA aid is solely a matter for the EEC Commission.  Projects are assessed by the Commission in accordance with priorities laid down by EEC regulations and many projects fail to compete successfully for the limited funds available.  It must, therefore, be emphasised that any co-operative which commences work prior to the decision by the EEC should plan the financing of the scheme so that the scheme is viable, in the event of an unfavourable decision.</P>

      <P>We have had instances of a shortfall due to the failure of the FEOGA grants being given in two counties in particular, in Monaghan and Cavan.  I received a deputation and we discussed this.  I said I would be prepared sympathetically to consider making a special capital allocation and loan finance available to the county councils to enable the payment of the contributions to take place before the end of 1979 and also approving payment of State subsidy covering 60 per cent of the annual charges incurred by those councils arising from the payment of these special contributions.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am grateful to the Minister in so far as he has gone in the case of Monaghan and Cavan but does he realise that 40 per cent of the charges must still be paid by the counties concerned? Is it not a fact that notwithstanding the warning paragraph to which the <Col N="212" /> Minister has referred these group water schemes in the counties concerned were planned and budgeted for with the co-operation of the Minister's Department on the basis that FEOGA grants would be forthcoming?  The fact that the FEOGA grants have not been forthcoming has doubled and sometimes trebled the local contribution and placed promoters and people participating in an impossible position.

      <P>The existing sewerage scheme in Kilrush includes a treatment works which is overloaded.  It is subject to back-pounding or flooding and discharges into an area of the harbour where the dilution is inadequate.  The proposals on the new scheme are for the discharge of a comminuted sewage into a tidal storage tank at a suitably located sea outfall in the vicinity of Skagh Point. Comminution will aid oxidation and dispersal. The outfall pipe will be located 11 <Col N="213" /> feet below low tide level and discharge will be on the ebb tide.  This is an accepted method of disposal for coastal towns and the local authority's consulting engineer's investigations, including sea surveys, show that no offshore pollution should result or any contravention of the guidelines prepared by the Technical Committee on Effluent and Water Quality Standards.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the proposals do not conflict with any objectives or principles of EEC environment policy as expressed in the action programme on the environment or with the requirements of any current directives on water quality.</P>

In addition my Department have already approved three special contributions totalling £5,750 to cater for future development, including the servicing of additional houses outside the immediate area of the group scheme. Very little work is necessary to complete the scheme and this should be carried out before 31 December 1979 so that the small balance of State grants outstanding can be paid.</P>
      <P>It has been represented to me by Donegal County Council that if slow sand filters were now provided, the scheme could be extended to other areas, and that these and other works would increase the capacity of the scheme to 150 houses.  It is open to the county council to consider including appropriate proposals for this in their small schemes programme since it appears that there is a prospect of a further group being formed to undertake the initial sections of the extension envisaged.</P>

      <P>Is the gist of what the Minister is suggesting that this should be done in two schemes rather than in one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there was a small amount of work to be carried out on the existing scheme and that it should be done before the end of December to draw on the amount of grants still available to complete that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this then leave it open to an extension of the grant-aid to the enlarged scheme, or would it be regarded as a sort of a new scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, a new scheme would be the obvious thing.  I presume there is adequate supply available from existing sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is assured. However, I wonder if the Minister is aware that his suggestion may not in fact be the case&mdash;that it has been growing and enlarging in numbers.  Would the <Col N="215" /> Minister be able to assist in sorting out the overall contributions of the various new and old elements in this scheme if it comes to be treated as two separate schemes, although it is in practice one scheme?  There are all sorts of difficulties in doing what the Minister has said.  It would make sense, perhaps, to start with on the ground&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if it is proposed to grant full driving licences to persons whose applications were with the motor registration departments of local authorities although such licences might not yet have been formally issued prior to the date of his decision on the new driving licence regulations and, if not, why.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will amend the recent regulations relating to driving licences so that an applicant for a third provisional licence, who had applied for the licence prior to the 11 October 1979 and may not have received it by that date due to administrative delays, will qualify for a full driving licence as if a current provisional licence was held on the 11 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> A person who had applied for a provisional licence but who had not yet been issued with such licence on the 11 October 1979 is in fact outside the scope of the recent concession relating to the grant of a driving licence.  Furthermore, licensing authorities are precluded by law from issuing either a driving licence or a provisional licence with effect prior to the date of issue.  On the other hand, a person already holding either licence is free to apply for a further one at any time within one month prior to the expiration of the existing licence and is thus afforded a reasonable opportunity of maintaining continuity of licence.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate in my opinion to make further changes in the law for the purpose of embracing the type of case to which the Deputies refer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say first that I disagree entirely with what the Minister has done but, that having been said, let us apply it to everybody in the same way. In the case of people who had two provisional licences, who applied months before 11 October for a driving test&mdash;without which confirmation they could not get a third licence&mdash;and that confirmation did not arrive before 11 October, does the Minister consider that they should be barred from getting a full licence while people who had a second licence for only a few days could get a full driving licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>A definite date had to be set and that date was 11 October.  The second provisional licence had to be current on that date in order that a full licence could be issued.  If the previous licence had lapsed for whatever reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If somebody with two provisional licences applied to a local authority in the normal way for a full licence, the local authority would seek confirmation that the person had applied to do a driving test.  The person would then apply for a test and if, due to the postal authorities or the Minister's Department, the person did not get an acknowledgement of his application <Col N="217" /> before 11 October, would the Minister consider it fair that he through the failure of some Government Department should be deprived of a licence while a person unable to drive properly would be able to get a full driving licence just because he had a second licence current on 11 October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person did not have a current licence on 11 October for whatever reason he could not get a full licence.  All a person needed to get a further provisional licence was an acknowledgement of his application for a driving test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not know that, if somebody applies to a local authority for a driving licence, the local authority cannot issue that licence straight away?  They ask the applicant to apply for a driving test and they do not issue an acknowledgement of his application. The person will then apply for the driving test.  If an acknowledgement of that application came back before 11 October the person would be all right but, if not, the person would not be entitled to a licence.  That is a lot of nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>What was required by the local authority was an acknowledgement of an application for a driving test from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Only an acknowledgement of the driving test application was required by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What if the acknowledgement did not come back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt mistakes can be made, but on examination in my Department I found that driving test applications are immediately acknowleged because a receipt must be sent out for the money received.  There have been complaints by people who have not received acknowledgements, but it must <Col N="218" /> also be understood that a person can very easily cast aside an acknowledgement. There have been mistakes on both sides.  If a licence was not current on 11 October under these regulations a person cannot get a full licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if a person had lodged an application for a further licence with the local authority and had not received that acknowledgement before 11 October, the local licensing authority cannot issue licences to them. They cannot back-date licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quoting the regulation as if it were a sacred reason for not doing something.  Is the Minister aware that up until mid-day on the date of the order the licensing authority in the Dublin area were still issuing provisional licences because they had not even heard from the Department? Does the Minister consider it just that people who got a second provisional licence under those circumstances subsequent to the Minister's announcement were able to get a full driving licence while those who in good faith applied in writing two weeks before were deprived of the licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who got licences on the date I signed the regulation could not have known what was going to happen.  It was just a sheer coincidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It had been announced on the news at 9.30 on the previous evening.  The next morning at 12 o'clock the licensing authority had not heard from the Department.  The Minister did not notify the licensing authority until they contacted him the day after he signed the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being inaccurate. Would the Minister check up <Col N="219" /> in the Dublin metropolitan area to confirm the fact that the licencing authority were not told by the Minister's Department until they contacted the Department at mid-day the day after the Minister had made the order and during that period they carried on as before issuing hundreds of provisional licences? In view of the many anomalies in this scheme, including the fact that people who may have had full licences which had expired for a period of about five years must do a driving test before they can get another full licence, and in view of the fact that this scheme must surely rank as one of the most reckless and irresponsible decisions of a Minister, will the Minister reconsider amending the regulations to get rid of the anomalies which have been brought to his attention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> If the Minister wants to stand over this change, would he not consider that the reasonable thing to do would be to allow a person to be exempted from doing the driving test if he held a second licence or subsequent provisional licence on 11 October last or if he at any time held a second provisional driving licence which had expired not more than 12 months previously or during any given time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the number awaiting driving tests at present and an estimate of the reduction in this number by virtue of the implementation of the recent driving licence regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The recent regulations, which provided <i>inter alia</i> for recognition of EEC driving licences, for issue of driving licences without driving test in certain cases and for extension of the validity of provisional licences from six months to 12 months, have effected a significant reduction in the rate at which applications are now being received for tests.  At the same time an individual survey is now being made of the backlog, which had risen to 60,000 by 11 October last, due primarily to the prolonged postal dispute, in order to determine the number of those applications for which tests will have to be arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate therefore that the total number of tests to be arranged on foot of applications current at a given date will depend on the outcome <Col N="222" /> of this survey, coupled with the intake of new applications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, since by direct regulation he has decreed that it is no longer necessary for a provisional licensee to be accompanied by a qualified driver, this has led to an idea among provisional drivers that there is no need for them to apply for a full licence or for a test and that this has led to a considerable reduction in the number of people applying for tests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence of that yet.  There could not be at this stage. In the case of the previous six months provisional licence a person was not issued with a third one until he proved he had applied for a test.  The same procedure will now apply.  There should be no question of people getting the idea that they will not be required to have a test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 to 29 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The number of driver testers and supervisor testers employed by my Department at present are 61 and six respectively.  Arrangements are in progress to fill seven further posts of driver tester and one further post of supervisor tester.</P>
      <P>Competitions for appointments as driver tester were held by the Civil Service Commission in 1977 and 1978, and a further competition is in progress. There were five appointments from each of the 1977 and 1978 competitions.  Appointments in these cases were made approximately eight months from the dates of advertisement.  No appointment to the supervisor tester grade was made in the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> The qualifications for posts as driver tester are set out in the conditions issued from time to time by the Civil Service Commission.  Competitions comprise a written examination, an interview and a practical driving test.</P>
    <P>Each supervisor tester exercises continuous supervision over the work of a number of driver testers in a district, including checking on their work.  His other normal functions include the survey of test routes, advice on location of premises and the carrying out of particular types of test.  Details are not readily available in regard to numbers of checks on testers carried out by supervisory testers over a period.</P>
    <P>The work assigned to driver testers does not include the preparation of replies to Dáil questions.</P>
    <P>While formal refresher courses are not normally held, various conferences for the staff, at tester and supervisor tester levels, and at central and district levels, coupled with continuing advice to testers by supervisor testers, fulfil the appropriate function in this regard.  All the staff participated in a four-day conference this year and supervisor tester staff participated in a conference in 1978.</P>
    <P>A request for a meeting from the union representing the testers and supervisor testers reached me on 22 October 1979.  In reply the union were assured that officers of the relevant section of my Department would be readily available to discuss with the union any issues affecting their members' conditions of employment. Such discussions are normal and a further one has been arranged for a date this month.</P>

      <P>May I put one final question to the Minister about this whole matter and in support of the general thesis of Deputy Belton?  Would the Minister now give a categorical assurance that there will never again be the kind of amnesty or step which he took on this occasion and which, in my view, was seen to be reckless and irresponsible, that this will never again happen so long as he has responsibility <Col N="227" /> in respect of it and that therefore anybody at present awaiting a test should not believe that clemency of the kind extended to other drivers on a previous occasion will ever again recur in the interest of public safety, if nothing else?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is considerable disquiet among those people who were fortunate enough to get a driving test prior to his October decision and among tutors in driving schools, relating to the uneven standard that driving testers apply to applicants for driving tests?  Would he not consider <Col N="228" /> that there is a need to improve the methods of recruiting and the methods of training so that the schools which train people for driving tests would have a much better understanding of what it is in fact they are trying to educate people for?</P>

I am simply asking the Minister if his attention has been drawn to representations which have been made to me about the disquiet among certain people because of the unevenness of standard of the driving test put by driving testers?  For example, one driving tester would ask one question on one day and the same question on another day and look for contradictory replies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Title>European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1979: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill before the House&mdash;the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1979&mdash;is to amend the definition of &ldquo;treaties governing the European Communities&rdquo; as set out in the European Communities Act, 1972, by the addition of the treaty relating to the accession of the Hellenic Republic to the European Economic Community and to the European Atomic Energy Community and the decision of the Council relating to the accession of the Hellenic Republic to the European Coal and Steel Community.  The effect of the Bill, when enacted into law, will be to make the treaty and the decision part of the domestic law of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of the distinction between the procedures necessary for accession to the EEC and Euratom and those necessary for accession to the European Coal and Steel Community.  In the case of EEC and Euratom, the conditions of admission of a new member state and the adjustments to the treaties necessitated thereby must be the subject of an agreement between the existing member states and the applicant state. This agreement must be ratified by all the contracting states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. For accession to ECSC a decision by the Council only is required.  The constitutional requirements in Ireland are that both the treaty relating to accession to EEC and Euratom and the decision relating to accession to ECSC shall be made part of the domestic law of the State.</P>
      <P>This, as I have stated, is the purpose of the Bill.  But, in addition, since the treaty is an international agreement, it has been necessary to satisfy the requirements of Article 29 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> Hence, the motion seeking the approval of Dáil Éireann of the terms of accession of the Hellenic Republic to the European Economic Community and to the European Atomic Energy Community which was approved yesterday.</P>
    <P>Perhaps at this stage it would be useful if I were to outline the history of the relationship between the Community and Greece.  The links date back to the conclusion of an association agreement between the Community and Greece in 1961 under which the Community pledged itself to support the efforts of the Greek people to improve their standard of living.  Eventual accession to the Communities was envisaged once the operation of the agreement had advanced far enough to enable Greece to undertake the full obligations of membership.</P>
    <P>Since the coming into operation of the Athens Agreement in 1962, considerable economic and social progress was achieved by Greece despite the fact that the harmonisation process provided for in the agreement was suspended during the period of the dictatorship.  With the return of democratic government it was only natural that Greece should seek to consolidate her rediscovered freedom by aligning herself even more closely with the democratic nations of the European Community.  It was this concern as much as the desire to join for reasons of economic progress and development which motivated the government of Prime Minister Karamanlis to submit an application for Greece to accede to the European Communities in June 1975.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the treaties, the Commission examined the application and presented its opinion to the Council in January 1976.  It recommended that a clear affirmative reply be given and that accession negotiations be opened without delay.  In February 1976 the Council accepted the application and at its meeting on 19-20 July 1976 agreed to open negotiations leading to accession.  A formal opening session of negotiations was held on 27 July 1976 and meetings were held on a regular basis until the substance of the negotiations was declared concluded early this year. <Col N="257" /> The decision of the Council of the European Communities on the accession of the Hellenic Republic to the European Coal and Steel Community was signed on 24 May 1979 as were the Council decisions on accession to the EEC and Euratom.  The treaty between the existing member states and the Hellenic Republic concerning accession to the EEC and Euratom was signed in Athens on 28 May 1979.  The Instruments of Accession were ratified by the Greek Parliament on 28 June 1979 and, following ratification by the existing member states, Greece will become the tenth member state of the Communities on 1 January 1981.</P>
    <P>Before I deal specifically with the Irish position as regards the Greek application and the general question of enlargement, I would like to refer briefly to the outcome of the negotiations in the various sectors.  Copies of a volume entitled <i>Documents concerning the Accession of the Hellenic Republic to the European Communities</i> have been circulated to Deputies.  This volume contains the Act of Accession which sets out the arrangements, conditions and adjustments to the treaties resulting from the negotiations. Since these provisions cover in detail the effects of Greek accession on the entire <i>acquis communautaire</i> it would be impossible to attempt to synopsise them. However, it might be useful to draw attention to some of the more important aspects of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Negotiations were conducted on the basis that Greece would accept the <i>acquis communautaire</i> as it exists on the date of accession subject to transitional arrangements.  I should note here that an information and consultation procedure similar to that which operated in the case of Ireland, Britain and Denmark in 1972 has been established whereby Greece is advised of and can submit views on proposed developments of the <i>acquis communautaire</i> in the period between the signature of the treaty and the proposed date of accession.</P>
    <P>As regards the length of the transitional period Ireland insisted from the outset that what was described as the <Col N="258" />&ldquo;classical&rdquo; period of five years, which was agreed at the first enlargement in 1973, should apply also to Greece.  Indeed, this was the position of the Greek delegation, too.  In the event, the transitional period was set at five years apart from some minor exceptions which were not of concern to this country.  I might mention that in the agricultural sector we were particularly concerned that the transitional period should be as short as possible, especially for beef and dairy produce for which a lucrative market exists in Greece.  We argued successfully that the transitional period for these products should be five years instead of the seven-year period originally proposed by the Commission. Otherwise, Ireland did not encounter any particular difficulty in the course of the negotiations and it may be safely said that the agreements reached do not adversely affect the interests of this country.</P>
    <P>As I have said, Greece will accept the provisions of the <i>acquis communautaire</i> as from the date of accession subject to the agreed transitional arrangements. This means that Greece will be represented in all the Community institutions and will participate in the decision-making process.  Accordingly, to give but two examples, Greece will be represented in the Council of Ministers in its various formations, and will have 24 representatives in the European Parliament.  Initially, these members will be appointed by the Greek Parliament but it has been decided that direct elections should be held during 1981.</P>
    <P>Customs union between the existing member states of the Community and Greece will be completed fully after the five-year transitional period.  Indeed, all duties on Greek industrial imports into the Community have already been abolished under the association agreement. As regards the common agricultural policy, the alignment of prices of Greek products to those of the Community will be completed during a five-year transitional period with the exception of two products&mdash;peaches and tomatoes&mdash;for which a seven-year <Col N="259" /> period has been agreed.  The only other exception to the five-year period is in relation to freedom of movement of workers between Greece and the existing Community, for which a seven-year transitional period has also been set.</P>
    <P>Greece will also participate in the European Regional Development Fund and the Social Fund as from the date of accession and the Accession Treaty includes a protocol relating to the economic and industrial development of Greece similar to the protocol which Ireland negotiated at the time of its accession.</P>
    <P>I must now, however, refer to the broader concerns which Ireland has expressed in regard to the further enlargement of the Community.  At the Council of 9 February 1976, which, as I have said, resulted in the Community stating that it accepted the Greek application for accession, Ireland laid stress on the necessity for strengthening the Community institutions in preparation for enlargement and on the need to set aside additional resources to cater for an enlarged Community.  Subsequently, in July 1976, when the question of opening accession negotiations with Greece was being discussed, Ireland proposed and had accepted by the Council, a Council statement which declared&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  that the consequences&mdash;in particular the financial consequences of an enlargement must not be detrimental to the common projects and policies of the Community or to those which it intends to carry out in the future.</P>
    <P>(2)  that enlargement must help strengthen a Community dynamic in its aspirations and not weaken or reduce in effectiveness its institutional structures and possibilities for action and</P>
    <P>(3)  that, with this view, the Council were agreed that subject to usual budgetary procedures, on Greek accession appropriate provision would be made for the needs of the enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>At later discussions I reiterated this position and received support from my colleagues in the Council and from the <Col N="260" /> Commission.  I made it clear, however, that Ireland was not setting preconditions for enlargement which would have to be fulfilled by the applicant countries.  Rather, were we asking that enlargement be used as an occasion for strengthening the Community as regards the budget, in the working of the institutions and in other aspects of progress towards closer integration.  Particular emphasis was placed on the need to deal with the present regional imbalances in the Community and a certain amount of success has been already achieved in this area.  I refer to the aid for drainage schemes in the west of Ireland which was obtained as a balance to the aid granted to the Mediterranean regions of the existing Community to help prepare for enlargement and I would draw attention also to the fact that further Commission proposals for aid for infrastructural development in the West have been submitted to the Council.  I do not suggest that these measures and other moves towards convergence represent an adequate response to our needs but they do indicate a recognition of the fact that there are serious disparities in the Community and that positive and direct action must be taken to eliminate them.</P>
    <P>As regards institutional reform, Deputies will know that the report of the Committee of Three Wise Men is being made available to the member states in time for consideration by the European Council in Dublin on 29/30 November. Their reactions cannot be anticipated but there is general acceptance in the Community that changes will have to be made particularly in the context of enlargement.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to draw attention to the historical significance of the Greek accession to the European Communities.  All Europe owes a debt to Greece and certainly no European Community of nations would be complete without her as a member.  It is entirely appropriate and right that Greece will shortly be joining more closely with a Community to which it has already contributed so much and with which it already shares so much in terms of <Col N="261" /> culture and history.  The very word &ldquo;politics&rdquo; indeed the word &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; itself are part of the inheritance that the Community owes to Greece.  It is, then, particularly fitting that she should join in an endeavour which I have no doubt will influence not only the future of the people of Europe but the future of mankind also.</P>
    <P>Given that Ireland has consistently welcomed the application of Greece for membership of the Communities and that the terms of accession arrived at in the negotiations are satisfactory in so far as this country is concerned, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has outlined the background to the proposal to accept Greece as a full member of the EEC.  Beginning with the Athens Agreement of 1961, Greece has had an association agreement with the Community. The major point we can make from this is that the association of Greece with the EEC goes back long before our accession to the Community. Therefore, there is not involved a question of dealing with a fresh application from a European state that is not aware of the mechanisms and workings of the Community.  Instead, when we talk about the Hellenic Republic we are talking of a nation that has had a substantial working arrangement with the Community for a long period.</P>
      <P>One's natural inclination is to welcome the Bill, but before putting one's final views on record it is important that the various political and economic implications be examined dispassionately and objectively.  The Irish people are entitled to be briefed fully on the effects of Greek membership. Clearly, there are advantages and disadvantages in regard to the membership of Greece from our point of view.  Our duty is to ensure that our own people are aware of both rather than to decide blindly own way or the other without a full realisation of the consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Historically, as the Minister mentioned, when we talk of democracy Greece is the country that springs to <Col N="262" /> mind.  Indeed, Greece can be regarded as the cradle of democracy, but they have had their ups and downs.  They have had problems like most nations of invasions and civil wars and had a period of dictatorship under the colonels from 1967 to 1974.  It is clear that full membership of the EEC should buttress the modern democratic system which now exists in Greece.  That must surely be a major factor for all of us interested in the maintenance and spread of democracy.</P>
    <P>That overriding situation, coupled with what I hope will be the natural Irish response to any reasonable application to join the EEC, provides an immediate favourable reaction to the Bill.  Looking at the picture in its overall context we have to see the problems I mentioned earlier.  The application of Greece raises the question of disagreements between Greece and Turkey&mdash;we must remember that the latter is an associate member with full membership as a stated final objective. Unfortunately, there are conflicts between the Greeks and the Turks over Cyprus.  In this area also the talks following the Kyprianou&mdash;Denktash Agreement do not appear to be making a lot of progress.  There are also difficulties between those two nations over the division of the potential natural resources in the Aegean Sea.</P>
    <P>It is important that the European Community should not adopt a partisan view in these disputes and that Greek membership does not affect relations between the Community and Turkey.  It is also important that the rights guaranteed by the association agreement with Turkey will not be affected thereby.  On the other hand, it is to be hoped that the umbrella provided by the European Communities with Greece as a full member and Turkey as an associate member would help in furthering a solution to these conflicts.  That may be a pious aspiration and, to some extent, may recall similar sentiments expressed on the national question here at the time of our application for entry into Europe.  In the long term I hope, and expect, that, not alone in relation to the problems between <Col N="263" /> Greece and Turkey but also in relation to the problems in these islands, membership of the EEC will help in making a major contribution towards solving such problems.</P>
    <P>It is clear that for the Council of Ministers the political benefits of enlargement have predominated and overridden objections that might be made on the grounds of institutional or economic difficulties.  I believe, however, that it is essential that the political commitment in the Community must be matched by an economic commitment if enlargement is not to result in a weaker Community which would be unable to meet either the aspirations of new members or existing members.  That is the main point in this debate and one which has considerable implications for us.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the commitment to enlarge the resources of the Community proportionately with the extended membership. The decision of the Council of July 1976 was outlined by the Minister, but bearing in mind the commitment made then and the present prognosis with regard to Community finances, we must face what appears to be the real issue highlighted by the application of Greece.  The advance publicity for the Dublin Summit, largely generated by the British press, indicates that the prime problem facing the Council meeting in Dublin is the amount of the reduction to be allowed to the UK in their annual contribution.  This is not the problem facing the European Communities from the point of view of finance.  The real difficulty being obscured by this issue is the bleak prospect of the bankruptcy of Community finances unless positive decisions are reached in this area as a matter of priority.  The attempt to undermine the provisions of the CAP must also be considered in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The accession of Greece will highlight the question whether there is a real commitment by the larger nations to implement the letter and spirit of the Treaty of Rome.  The doubts that have been expressed about the financial position of the Community&mdash;by coincidence the present indications are that the crisis will be upon <Col N="265" /> us by 1981&mdash;coincide with the entry of Greece.  We must bear in mind that the estimates that have been prepared at Community level indicate that bleak prospect but do not take into account the funds that would have to be additionally raised to cover the net benefit which Greece will derive from full membership. In that context we have to mention the overall Community financial position at present, the problems of the diminution of the income from sources other than VAT, the common customs tariff, the agricultural levies and so on and the difficulty in regard to the upper limit of 1 per cent on VAT yield.  The accession of Greece to the Community highlights even further the need to establish as a matter of the utmost priority a situation whereby it will be able to provide the finance needed to run the Community in the future, bearing in mind the additional financial burdens that will be on it after 1981.  That seems to me to be an absolute essential.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the 1 per cent limit should be raised and there will be the question of the correct mechanism in regard to the difference that exist between the VAT yield as a percentage of overall Community yields and the percentage of Community GDP of that country.  I impress upon the Minister&mdash;and I heard him dealing with this and other points on the radio today&mdash;that this is an absolute priority.  I had hoped that there would be some considerable progress made in this area during the term of the Irish Presidency.  I appreciate the intricacies involved but urge from this side of the House that we would give him support in anything he can do to bring this real, basic problem in the Community to a head as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives us here the opportunity to indicate the areas of operation of the European Community where we ourselves have been considerably disappointed&mdash;in particular in regard to the regional fund and a proper regional policy implementing the spirit of the Treaty of Rome.  Apart from the problems involved with the present <Col N="266" /> assault on the CAP, one main area of disappointment in Ireland in regard to the European Community, is the lack of a proper regional policy at Community level.  Such a policy would require proper funding and it is in that context that we face the new commitments that will be made to new members, and, in particular, to Greece.  There must be no dilution of Community resources to meet the payments that Greece will be entitled to; otherwise we will find a situation where the rather sparse funds already available to fund the regional policy will be reduced, to the detriment of this country. I appreciate the commitment that there is to be no reduction.  Bearing in mind inflation and the fact that regional policy has never been fully and properly developed, such commitment is not enough.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects arising from the accession of Greece.  This has major institutional implications, from the point of view of the EEC.  These institutions, it must be borne in mind, were originally designed for six members, then it became nine, by 1981 it will be 10 and probably within the not too distant period thereafter it will be 12, with the likely accession of Spain and Portugal.  It is clear that these institutions are already under considerable stress and strain and this obviously makes decision-making more difficult. There must be a substantial improvement in the efficiency of the Community decision-making process and a strengthening of the common institutions.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the report of the Three Wise Men on the restructuring of the Community is to be made available now.  There was concern expressed about the delay in its publication, but no doubt it will be fully available shortly.  I hope there will not be any delay in implementing the main recommendations of that report, so that the Community structures will be strengthened.  The accession of Greece will further highlight, and give greater impetus to, the need to achieve this.  It is premature for me to comment on that report as I have not yet seen it, but I understand that there have <Col N="267" /> been suggestions from the French in regard to the confining of the chairmanship of the Commission to the larger nations.</P>
    <P>Such a suggestion should obviously not be implemented quickly, or at all. That leads me to the next point which is of relevance to a debate of this nature, particularly considering that Greece, which is a relatively small country with a population of about nine million, is joining the Community.  There appears to be a development in the Community of a two-tier system, where the larger nations are established at one level and the weaker, or smaller nations, such as ours, are, to some extent, regarded as second-class members.  This would constitute a most dangerous development.  I would see that Greece, with its similarity of problems to ours and the fact that its population is not that much greater than our own, would be an ally to us in our efforts to ensure that this two-tier system would not develop.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which will have to be considered is the question of representation of the different member nations amongst the officials of the institutions. Greece, if it is to be fairly treated, must be enabled to have its fair share of its nationals working in the institutions of the European Community.  There have been complaints about the present representation.</P>
    <P>In the inevitable shake-up that will occur, with places being made available for people from the Hellenic Republic among the Brussels bureaucracy&mdash;I hope an effort will be made to ensure that there is a fairer and more even divide.  There are at present nine member nations of the EEC.  If one looks at the figures obtaining at present one can see that there are considerable disparities.  At present there is a total of 10,722 officials in the EEC.  I am quoting from figures which were correct as at March last, the latest figures available.  Of that total of 10,722, the number of Irish nationals was 158.  It seems to me that this is a figure to which we should draw attention. I appreciate that our population is <Col N="268" /> considerably smaller than that of any of the larger nations, but if we are to be members of the Community on a full and equal basis population is not the only factor that must be considered.  Indeed, if one looks at the figures relative to the other countries, it is obvious that population is not the guiding factor, because I see Italy with 2,588, Belgium 2,474, Germany 1,699, France 1,438, the United Kingdom 826, the Netherlands 664, Luxembourg 462, Denmark 323 and ourselves with the lowest figure of all, less than half the next lowest number, 158.  Therefore, it is a factor to which attention needs to be drawn.  When the shake-up occurs providing for places in the Brussels bureaucracy for citizens of the Hellenic Republic I would hope a more fair and equitable distribution would be achieved.</P>
    <P>In debating this Bill we must look at the direct effects of Greek accession on Ireland.  If one looks at industry, the position is that duty-free arrangements operate already in respect of Greek industrial exports.  Furthermore, under the terms negotiated, Greece is obliged to discontinue its import deposits scheme within three years and its administrative requirements in respect of <i>pro forma</i> invoicing on accession.  Therefore, if one looks at the direct effects of Greek accession on Irish industry there should be a benefit to Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>In regard to agriculture, the products giving rise to surplus difficulties in the Community markets form a relatively small part of domestic output in Greece. Greece is an importer of dairy products, meat and sugar.  It is clear that Greek agricultural products are not likely to be in competition with Irish products.  I do not foresee any direct adverse effects on Irish agriculture.  In fact, I would foresee, resulting from Greek accession, further opportunities opening up to exporters of Irish agricultural products in that Greece is an importer of those items of agriculture in respect of which we have such a substantial export trade.</P>
    <P>One must look also at the indirect effects of Greek accession on this country and here the position is not as bright. <Col N="269" /> Unless substantial steps are taken at Community level, it appears to me that there could be adverse indirect effects on this country.  Greece will be a net beneficiary of the Community.  This raises the question mentioned earlier: is there to be a sufficient increase in Community resources to cover this, or is there to be a dilution of existing funds? That is the basic question in so far as it affects us and indeed, let us be fair, is also a very basic question as far as Greece is concerned.  There are already insufficient funds available in some areas, particularly in the area of regional policy.  Even if there were to be no reduction in those areas, increases urgently required may not come now unless there is a strong resolve at Community level to provide the necessary additional resources.</P>
    <P>If we examine the position in the main areas from which funds can flow from the Community, as far as agriculture is concerned Greece has a very substantial proportion of its population engaged in agriculture.  They have serious structural problems, with small farm holdings fragmented into unconnected plots&mdash;indeed reminiscent of some of the worst structural problems experienced in this country.  This situation certainly impedes the adoption of modern technology for its improvement.  There are further problems resulting from the absence of appropriate marketing facilities, further aggravated by the absence of a comprehensive network of co-operatives. Obviously, taking that into account, Greece will and should be a substantial beneficiary of the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>In regard to the regional fund, there are in Greece substantial requirements for industrial and agricultural restructuring and for the development of infrastructure. The regional disparities are related to problems of modernisation of agriculture and the problems of industrialisation, compounded by geographical and demographic handicaps. Therefore, Greek membership will result in extended development assistance within the framework of the regional fund.  This brings us back to the <Col N="270" /> main problem: will this effect the amount required on behalf of the handicapped regions of the present member states?</P>
    <P>The same situation arises in regard to the social fund.  Greece would be regarded as socially underdeveloped, possibly even behind Ireland in some areas, particularly in regard to the status of women.  Inevitably this will make additional demands on the social fund, resulting in a dilution of that fund.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I come to the net question, the real issue which faces not just those of us in this House but the entire European Community&mdash;it is highlighted by the accession of Greece and perhaps that is just as well&mdash;whether there will be a renaissance of a true European spirit.  Is Greece to be welcomed into the Community with a full commitment to implement the letter and the spirit of the Treaty of Rome?  These are major questions to be answered by the Community as a whole.  In my opinion these questions will not be answered properly by the Community unless it organises its financial situation and its institutional structures so that, as a whole, it will be able to implement fully the principles on which we as a nation, applied to join the EEC, and indeed on which I have no doubt Greece has applied for full membership.</P>
    <P>That therefore is the net issue as far as I and my party are concerned.  As a nation I feel we have much in common with Greece in the context of the problems I have mentioned in the Community, in the context of the situation that I believe has developed to some extent between the <i>bloc</i> of larger nations and the <i>bloc</i> of smaller nations, in which we have a natural ally in Greece acceding to the EEC.  I extend the hand of friendship to Greece as the tenth member of the EEC and I wish them céad míle fáilte.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome this legislation and the motion being taken with it and we also welcome the people of Greece into the Community.  We do that not with anything like the naive belief expressed <Col N="271" /> by Deputy O'Keeffe with regard to the aspirations and ideals of the Community. We do it as a party which opposed our entry into the EEC in contrast to both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and in the knowledge that the Community will not do what it says it will try to do, that is, live up to the sort of aspirations Deputy O'Keeffe is talking about.  In effect what Deputy O'Keeffe was asking is &ldquo;Does capitalism have a human face?&rdquo; It does when it has continuous growth and healthy profits.  However, since the oil crisis of 1973 there has been no human face and no generosity of the kind we saw prior to 1973.  This example illustrates what I mean.  In the opening ceremony at the end of May, President Giscard d'Estaing of France, on behalf of the Community, welcomed Greece into the EEC and said that France would not regard Greece as a daughter but as a sister.  I am sure that was a lot of consolation to the Greeks who in the last few weeks watched how France treated her sister across the English Channel when she tried to export lamb and sheep meat products into France.  If that is sisterly treatment, I do not know how Greece can handle it or how much she needs it.  Let us have no illusions about the Community into which Greece is entering. I hope she has made the right decision.</P>
      <P>We in this House must be concerned with the changing of treaties to which we were signatories, the reasons for them and the consequences of the changes for us within our obligations to the treaties. In his opening speech the Minister, regrettably, did not refer to the fact that the Joint Committee of these Houses has published a report which deals specifically with the question of enlargement generally and precisely with the entry of Greece.  In that report are some of the facts and figures which I sought from the Government by way of an assessment of the effects on us of the entry of Greece.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 8 May last during Question Time I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if the Government would publish a document <Col N="272" /> outlining this Government's assessment of the entry of Greece into the EEC in terms of how it might affect our economy.  The Minister acting for the Minister for Foreign Affairs was Deputy Lenihan and he stated at column 32 of the Official Report for that date that:</P>
    <P>There are no plans to publish a document of the sort described by the Deputies but, as I said, the Dáil will have an opportunity to discuss the terms on which Greece will enter the Community.  Deputies will also be aware that I have on many occasions expressed support for Greek membership while at the same time advocating measures to alleviate structural and regional disparities in the existing Community.</P>
    <P>We have not yet seen the sort of balance sheet I sought.  I hope that the Minister of State will be able to offer such a balance sheet by way of indicating to the House the benefits and disadvantages for us as a result of the entry of Greece.  If we have such a balance sheet we can monitor progress over the years.  If we had the records of the fulsome promises made by the two major parties here in relation to our entry into the EEC to compare with what we now have it would make very interesting reading.</P>
    <P>Another important point that the Minister glossed over in his speech was the two preconditions that the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy FitzGerald, stressed in the Council's agreement to the accession of Greece to the Community, when the negotiations were opened in 1976.  On 8 May, at column 34 of the Official Report, Deputy FitzGerald stated:</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that the Irish Government, at the time the Greek application was made, made two preconditions in no unfriendly spirit towards Greece.  The precondition to the opening of negotiations was that additional resources should be provided <i>pro rata</i> with the expansion of the Community and this was accepted. The second precondition was that the conclusion of negotiations would <Col N="273" /> be preceded by a significant improvement in the decision-making mechanism of the Community.  Will the Minister say what has happened to the second Irish precondition?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the report of the Three Wise Men; but, frankly, the Labour Party are concerned at the lack of progress made in the general area of dealing with the essential problem of the EEC budget during our period of the Presidency of the Community. The regional and social policies and funds are a part of that.  There is no evidence to suggest, having regard to what happened over the last six months within the Community and bearing in mind the political reality of the federal elections in Germany next year and the French presidential elections of the following year, that there will be any significant increase in either the social or the regional funds that will meet the needs of the Greek people without our interests being seriously damaged&mdash;and that is the point.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the first point of this debate, which is the reason for the entry of Greece into this Community. The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>With the return of democratic government it was only natural that Greece should seek to consolidate her re-discovered freedom by aligning herself even more closely with the democratic nations of the European Community.</P>
    <P>That makes liberal reading and it is a sentiment with which no one could argue, but would the House not accept that if the Community incorporate in a large trading area, a growing and in many areas, fragile and structurally weak economy, without a consequent firm commitment to alleviate and correct the growth distortions that a capitalist economy will produce, very quickly the social unrest and disparities of wealth distribution within that country will become a greater cause for the distruction of freedom than the take-over of power by the colonels in 1967?  If the Community is sincere in attempting to consolidate the post-dictatorship regimes <Col N="274" /> of not only Greece but Spain and Portugal as well, it must make a reality out of words such as an effective and reasonable social and regional policy.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that this House should be discussing this Bill on the eve of the Dublin Summit when the big issue is that one of the wealthiest post-imperialist countries in the world &mdash;despite her <i>per capita</i> income today&mdash;the wealth is buried in the roads, the buildings, the underground and so on, wealth she took from other countries&mdash;is quibbling about the amount of support she has to give to the EEC.  It is the first time Britain has paid anything to anybody and she complains about it; it is sickening.  We shall come to Mrs. Thatcher later.</P>
    <P>Within the context of the Bill I suggest to the House, and I should like the Minister to give a clear refutation of this if he can, that there is another dimension to Greece's welcome into the Community by the other eight member states: I say eight because we are not members of NATO.  I suspect that the Community's concern with freedom <i>á la</i> Greece is much more directed towards southern European security for northern Europe and that, having got Greece into the Community because it was potentially unstable&mdash;Iran has displayed to the West what an unstable dictatorship can do&mdash;Spain and Portugal will bring up the rear and that the well fed and wealthy nations of northern Europe can relax without honouring their obligations.</P>
    <P>That view is not just held by me. Because we are not members of NATO we frequently fail to recognise the implications of the fact that the other members are, even allowing for the weird and extraordinary position of France <i>vis-á-vis</i> NATO.  In an article in <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper of May 29, on page 7, the final paragraph refers to Greece's entry. It is from a noted European correspondent, John Palmer, who states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Karamanlis, faced with a vociferous and apparently growing opposition to membership, insists that a simple majority in the Greek Parliament <Col N="275" /> will be enough to authorise Greek membership but the opponents of Greece's EEC vocation&mdash;to be found mainly among the supporters of Mr. Andrea Papandreous' Panhellenic Socialist Party and the pro-Moscow Communist Party of the Exterior, will demand ratification by a two-thirds majority.  Even so&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is the point of the quotation:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;Mr. Karamanlis will secure his 10-year objective of bringing Greece into the EEC (and in the process full membership of NATO) but by a more modest majority.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in the final weeks of our EEC Presidency we have an obligation to ensure that membership of the Community by Greece will be met by a much firmer commitment than we have seen to date from the heads of the nine member states, including our own, to an effective regional and social policy.  I can say that to the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, this afternoon; I could not have said it to him in May and it cannot be said after Christmas.  The opportunity extends from now until 31 December.  I can understand Fianna Fáil's difficulty in this regard.  I can understand their failure to get an effective and regional social policy.  Without doubt they failed. The decision of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in conceding the shuffling of the allocations to the regional fund is as good an indication of failure as we want.  I am sure that Deputy O'Donnell the European Member for Munster will in his own way illuminate that failure and what it means to us.  There is no way in which a party like Fianna Fáil, even with 84 seats, in the Presidency of the EEC can argue with any kind of moral strength for an effective and regional social policy&mdash; which is in effect a redistribution of wealth within the Community&mdash;when everybody around the council table knows that at home they abolished wealth tax.  I am saying&mdash;do not interrupt me, please.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to argue with the Chair as I recognise he has a job to do.  But let the Chair also recognise that I have a job to do and frequently over the last two and a half years we have claimed that this Government are supporting demands for an effective regional and social fund on which we all agreed, but they are only claims.  The accession of this state, which is as poor as, if not poorer than we are, is the largest single threat to the few miserable pounds we get out of the regional fund as it is.</P>
      <P>We paid to enter into the EEC.  Many industrial jobs were lost here.  They will be lost in Athens and Piraeus and in Thessalonica and if there is no compensating regional fund to undo the damage that the open free market of the EEC will wreak on that economy, then the conditions for freedom in Greece will be eroded as quickly as they were before and the whole objective of taking in this country will be lost sight of.  That is the essence of the argument.  I should like to hear the Government refute it if possible. I would be much more comfortable if it could be refuted.  Without doubt that is what is at issue, because after Greece comes Spain and after Spain, Portugal or in the other order, or they will be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening is that the EEC is putting a brake on the industrial development of certain countries saying: &ldquo;We already have enough steel, thank you; we already have enough shipbuilding, <Col N="277" /> thank you and you may not produce any more.  So, we are not going to increase the Community's budget by more than 1 per cent of GNP.&rdquo; It is that distortion that is implicit in the whole argument going on at present.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow in this city the heads of the nine states already in the EEC will quibble about the size of the CAP, its percentage of the total EEC fund which is now just 80 per cent of 1 per cent of our GNP, and a particular Prime Minister will wax eloquent about how much they are subsidising the inefficient farmers of Europe without any reference to how much all the northern European industrial states subsidise their industry. How much subsidy does the British taxpayer pay directly to the car workers of British Leyland?  In terms of productivity and efficiency they make some of the German hill farmers appear extremely productive.  This is the dishonesty of the argument.</P>
    <P>I want to hear our Government and our Minister who have democratic responsibility arguing that case.  I have not heard it done to date, nor have the Labour Party.  If we slide into 1981 with Greece in tow, full members of the Community and no extracted commitment to an effective regional fund or a social fund or a commitment to maintain the principle of the CAP whatever about its structure and price levels, not only will Greece be poorer but we shall be poorer, all of us.  It will not be any consolation then to hear the mellifluous tones of President Giscard telling us that he treats us more like a sister than a daughter.  Democracy even with 84 seats has its responsibilities.  There is the veto and it is like a bee's sting; you can only use it once if it is to be effective.  The ground was set in 1976 for this country to use that veto with full moral authority.</P>
    <P>The two preconditions that Dr. FitzGerald sought were laid down, the effective <i>pro rata</i> increase.  The <i>pro rata</i> increase means nothing if the resources of the EEC budget are going to self-destruct in the middle of 1981.  A reasonable interpretation today of that commitment was given by the other <Col N="278" /> member states to our Foreign Minister who occupied the democratic seat that the Minister of State now holds and holds in trust, who has my full democratic support and he is no mean arguer when he wants to be.  That precondition unequivocally put down by this country can reasonably be interpreted today as an effective commitment to extend the resources of the Community and to raise the ceiling.  In no way must it be allowed to enable Britain or any other country to effectively distort the miserable commitment of just on 1 per cent of GDP that the EEC makes through the three funds.</P>
    <P>The relevance of that argument has been made extremely more acute in the last two months as a result of what has happened and as a result of the kind of campaign that the so-called Iron Maiden is attempting to conduct.  It should be confronted head on.  It gives me a certain amount of personal satisfaction that the Irish Presidency is in a position to do it. What right has Britain got to complain about contributing to anybody?  She spent 300 years taking from the rest of the world.  For the first time in her life she is being asked to give £8,000 million or thereabouts.  She has got her infrastructures built; she has got her industry; she has got her schools; she has got everything that Greece, Spain, Portugal and this country do not have. There is a side to that argument that I know cannot be frequently made in public by a Minister of State because that is not the way diplomacy works and I recognise that, but, for God's sake, let him make it in private.</P>
    <P>Last week we discussed in this House the fifty-second and forty-seventh reports of the Joint Committee in relation to the problems of the EEC budget, and so the record of the House is quite fresh in that regard and everybody recognises the extremely difficult position. What I said on that occasion stands today.  The Joint Committee of this House, on a visit to Brussels, was sought out by both Commissioner Tugendhat and President Jenkins in order that they might emphasise and underline the importance <Col N="279" /> of the budgetary problems that we are faced with.  If any country thinks that the accession of Greece is not going to make them worse off they are crazy. It is definitely going to make them worse off.  What we are not witnessing is resolute political action by the party and country that is most affected by the consequences of such an upheaval of our budget.</P>
    <P>We frequently hear from the two major parties that we are net beneficiaries from membership of the EEC.  Not all of us are beneficiaries.  This country may be but not all of us are.  If the impact of Greece's entry into this community&mdash;leaving aside whatever damage it does to the position of industrial workers in Greece&mdash;has the added affect of breaking down fragile budgetary relations within the EEC, then the honeymoon, even for those people in our economy who are beneficiaries as a result of our membership of the EEC, is undoubtedly going to be over.  All the money that went into the agricultural sector, from Wexford through to Limerick East, did not find its way into Ringsend or some of the industrial areas that I represent and there are fellows unemployed today who will remain unemployed because of our accession to the EEC.  The failure to recycle and turn around that net benefit that we got from the EEC, albeit our own, is no consolation to the people who lost their jobs as a result of free market entry.</P>
    <P>This entry of another state with similar problems, in some instances more aggravated than our own, will aggravate the situation unless we get resolute political action from the Government.  That resolute political action will have to concentrate on and obtain, as was promised, an effective regional policy.  In our fifty-first report attention was drawn to the fact that regional internal imbalances in the African countries are already considerable and could be aggravated following the liberalisation of trade after accession and that in the Commission's view corrective measures in the form of <Col N="280" />&ldquo;large-scale regional policies&rdquo; would be required.  We have about five weeks left of our Presidency and there is no evidence that any large-scale regional policy is coming out of that six months of heaven.  The federal elections in Germany are going to concentrate the minds of the FDP and particularly the Social Democrats; the position in France is equally going to occupy domestic politics there.  Yet we will decide this afternoon on a course of action that will, by January 1981, add to the Community over nine million, and probably ten million, people who will put a hand into the miserable cookie jar of the regional fund as it is today.</P>
    <P>There is not much time and, regrettably, there does not appear to be a lot of political commitment to actually produce the goods as distinct from aspiring to them.  I have already made the political observation about the difficulties that the Minister will encounter. What I am asking the Minister to do is not easy.  I have no illusions about the lack of generosity on the part of the different members of the EEC on the other side of the table.  They rushed to welcome Greece into this Community; they did not put down the preconditions; there were no preconditions from France and in particular there were no preconditions from Germany.  Indeed they overruled the recommendation of the Commission which said at the time that Greece was just not ready to come into a full trade membership of the EEC.  The Commission were more cautious because they work with the political reality of the Council and they recognised that the military considerations of Greece's entry into the EEC were one thing and the post-1973 willingness of Germany or France or Belgium or Holland to actually contribute effectively to the regional fund was another.</P>
    <P>Never has a country been so armed in terms of argument as we are now at the time of the Presidency before the Summit. I would earnestly request that the Government would use their position, which was prepared for them by the <Col N="281" /> previous Government in 1976, to argue the case as loudly and as strongly as possible.  I would hope that we will not get the same repetition we had some weeks ago when the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Professor O'Donoghue, conceded an effective reduction in the regional fund.</P>
    <P>The trade between Ireland and Greece is very much in our favour at the moment. Hopefully it will remain so. However, I suspect if we were to put the net tourist earnings of Greece from this country against this the balance would be somewhat evened out.  We export to Greece three times the amount we import from them.  Their imports from Ireland amounted to $10.6 million and exports to Ireland to $2.3 million approximately, according to <i>Facts About Greece</i> published in Athens in 1979.</P>
    <P>I have not got the figures for the amount of revenue which Greece would gain from our economy via tourism because they would be Greek figures, but it has been growing and probably will continue to grow.  Therefore, we are interdependent economies and I would like to think that that interdependence can be developed and enhanced.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has seen opportunities for sales, particularly of beef and milk, within Greece.  The Minister and Deputy O'Keeffe have referred to the trading difficulties. It is to be hoped that these can be sorted out without delay.  I am referring to the deposits, the three-year phasing and so on.  If Greece recognises that in Ireland they have a very willing ally around the council table at various meetings of the Community and the Commission, then the capacity for co-operation between our two communities undoubtedly will be enhanced.  People do not forget their friends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They should not forget their friends.  More important, we should know where to look for our friends in the first place.  There is the potential for an <Col N="282" /> alliance between our two economies by virtue of common interest.  I hope that the State now will follow up the Minister's recognition of positive trading possibilities for beef and milk products by establishing a positive trading presence by the State in the Greek Republic.  About two years ago Córas Tráchtála looked at the question of establishing an office in Athens and then did not proceed with it.  I regret that decision. It was a bad one, made in an internal assessment relative to a variety of factors which really were commercial which a semi-State organisation must consider.  It was wrong in that it ignored the political dimension that the presence of such an office would have had combined with our Embassy there.  It took us about a year to get our Embassy out of the Hilton Hotel and into their office.  Effectively we were not represented properly in a physical sense as distinct from the quality of the diplomatic representation, with which I have no argument.</P>
      <P>Regarding the statement about the recognition of trade in Greece, the Minister should ask CTT if this is a separate departmental responsibility.  He should look again at the whole question of CTT, the Meat Marketing Board, Bord Bainne or some other body getting into Greece in a physical way.  Nobody is going to come along, knock on our door and ask if we have any meat or milk to sell.  Certainly the Greeks are not.  Their door is being kicked every day by people who are selling.  Unless we get in there too and sell as aggressively and commercially as others, they are going to take the goods from the people who are there beside them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must recognise that there is an added political dimension that will not show up in any cost-benefit analysis of such an operator.  We, as a poor, peripheral nation are going to need allies around the council rooms of the EEC and Greece is the first nation which is effectively as poor as if not poorer than we are to join the EEC.  We should get to know her very well, and I do not mean by two weeks in Rhodes on a charter <Col N="283" /> flight but by our physical presence in the economy and in the capital of Greece.  That does not apply only to the State.  Once Greece becomes a full member it is up to the trade unions and the political parties to do the same.  The Minister of State has responsibility in that area.</P>
    <P>There is one point to which the Minister has not referred and it is considerably important.  Greece is a maritime nation with an enormous registration of merchant ships amounting to something like £38 million. In the <i>Fifty-First Report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities,</i> paragraph 23, there is reference to sea transport, which will now be affected as a result of Greece's entry to the EEC.  I quote:</P>
    <P>In the course of its examination of the accession of Greece the Joint Committee observed that the fact that Greece is one of the major shipowning countries in the world should assist the measures being taken by the Community to combat marine pollution by tankers, with which the Committee dealt with in its thirty-eighth report of 7th March, 1979 (Prl. 7928).  With Greek accession the Community's percentage of the world fleet will be increased from 20 to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>In other words, Greek merchant shipping is effectively half the size of the Community's merchant shipping at the moment.</P>
    <P>This will be an important aid to the Community in seeking to bring the IMCO Conventions, MARPOL and SOLAS into force.  Moreover on accession the Greek fleet will become subject to the legislation adopted by the Community on the subject of tankers.</P>
    <P>This is a complex area in which I am in no way an expert.  I simply draw the attention of the House to the implication of Greece's membership of the Community. IMCO are not, as may be <Col N="284" /> thought, the cleaners who used to be located on Merrion Road, but the International Marine Co-ordinating Organisation, who have attempted over the years to raise the standards of shipping and the conditions of the seafarers who work in shipping.  MARPOL are concerned with anti-pollution and SOLAS with safety of life at sea.</P>
    <P>For many years back Greece has had an enormous and continued involvement in shipping.  We, to our shame, have not. However, we have as a percentage of our land area, the largest coastline of any member state in the Community, with the exception of Greece if we take into account all her islands.  The potential of our maritime resources is as enormous as our ratio of coastline to our land area. The volume of traffic in our waters, particularly up and down the Irish Sea, is of such a scale that any kind of disaster could have tremendous implications for this country in terms of damage to the environment and so on.  Two weeks ago we passed an Estimate in this House to cover some of the costs of the Whiddy Island inquiry alone and the amount involved would have built quite a number of houses in my constituency.</P>
    <P>The possibility of a major marine accident occurring is growing.  The benefit of Greece's entry is evident when we remember that the EEC now have within their collective membership sufficient tonnage to attempt to have some of the conventions of IMCO made effective law within the Community.  I do not profess to be an expert in this area.  I do profess to have responsibility in the Labour Party for the environment and to recognise that a unique opportunity is occurring at the point of Greece's entry. We will have not only the scale of Greek merchant shipping; we will have also their undoubted expertise and accumulated experience.  I would like to see our country, with its vested interest in the whole question of developing our marine resources, trying to benefit from the association of Greece with the Community as full members, by doing two things: first, attempting to ensure that near accidents such as the <i>Cristos Bitos</i><Col N="285" /> incident will not occur again and that if there is a gap in standards, whether on shore or otherwise, that it be closed in so far as is possible.  I recognise that Community ships are not the only ones to use the Irish Sea.  Consequently, there is a considerable limit to the argument I am putting forward, but that does not invalidate our pursuing that argument.  The second benefit would relate to direct connections between the large merchant shipping fleet of the Greek Republic and our own Irish Shipping.  Again, this is an area in which contracts should be made without delay by Irish Shipping and the various shipping concerns in Greece.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the situation of a shortfall of technical personnel in our Department of Tourism and Transport particularly in regard to monitoring shipping&mdash;the whole question of standards, regulations and so on&mdash;while Greece obviously has much expertise and experience in this regard.  By developing connections in this area it might be possible to have some people from Greece here for a period of time to work in co-operation with the Department of Tourism and Transport.  The Merchant Shipping Bill, which has not come before the House yet, has been delayed for some time because of pressure of resources within the very limited resources of the Department.  That is a shameful situation but one that has been in existence during the terms of office of many administrations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome Greece's entry to the Community.  The Labour Party believe they will have allies within the Greek Republic with whom we can work.  We hope that in time, with the reality of Greek membership, our working alliance with those allies will be cemented.  Similarly, I should hope that the Government party will find suitable allies, too, within the Greek Republic, but perhaps that courtship has begun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> Whatever about the degree of co-operation that exists between the two countries, our Government, with their new democratic allies from within the democratic party in Greece, will have to show a little more performance in relation to the regional and social funds than has been the case up to now.</P>
    <P>In the September 1979 issue of the <i>Community Report,</i> which is issued from the Dublin office, there is an article on Greek entry terms which contains the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>During the period between May 28, 1979 and January 1, 1981, when accession will come into full force, a consultation procedure will be applied, whereby the Community will communicate to Greece drafts of decisions to be taken on which Greece will express its opinion and will discuss subjects deemed of interest with the competent Community authorities.  Greece has made it clear that it does not oppose the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Communities.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to let us know when replying what kind of consultation has taken place between the Community and ourselves.  Obviously, the details cannot be revealed to us, but only three days after the signing by Greece of that interim agreement as part of the overall package, the Government assumed presidency and, consequently, responsibility for implementing that particular section of the overall accord. Presumably, Greece has been consulted in relation to aspects of the budget, for instance, and in relation to aspects of the regional and social funds.  Respecting the privacy of the Government in regard to such Community responses, I would however like some indication from the Minister as to how effective has been that whole process of consultation.  The House is entitled to know what has been the outcome in that regard.</P>
    <P>When people talk about Greece's accession to the Community they talk about that country's marvellous democracy, about its traditions of creating European democracy. <Col N="287" /> However, to me that is as false as the French talking about our marvellous contribution to christianising Europe. Having regard to the way France treats us sometimes, one would be forgiven for thinking that we failed to christianise anyone in Europe.  Therefore, we can afford to be a little generous in regard to Greece's creation of democracy and to our efforts in the area of christianity in the Dark Ages.  The Greek's have a great modern literary tradition.  Recently, the Nobel Prize was awared to one of their poets.  Another of their poets, Mr. Kavafis, wrote a poem called &ldquo;Waiting for the Barbarians&rdquo;, from which the following is an excerpt.  I quote from page 583 of <i>The Penquin Book of Greek Verse</i></P>
    <P>&ldquo;What are we waiting for, gathered in the market-place?&rdquo;&ldquo;The barbarians will come today.&rdquo;&ldquo;Why is there no activity in the senate?  why are the senators seated without legislating?&rdquo;&ldquo;Because the barbarians will come today; what laws can the senators pass now?  the barbarians, when they come, will make the laws.&rdquo;&ldquo;Why has our emperor risen so early, and is seated at the greatest gate of the city on the throne, in state, wearing the crown?&rdquo;&ldquo;Because the barbarians will come today ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The poem continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why has this uneasiness suddenly started, this confusion?  how grave the faces have become! Why are the streets and squares quickly emptying and why is everyone going back home so very concerned?&rdquo;&ldquo;Because night has fallen, and the barbarians have not come.  And some men have arrived from the frontiers and they said that there are no barbarians anymore.&rdquo; And now, what will become of us without barbarians?  Those people were a kind of solution.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the barbarians of 1979 might very well be the EEC if it does not live up to the social promises that are embodied in the kind of phrases that Deputy O'Keeffe referred to but which <Col N="288" /> so far we have failed manifestly to put into reality.  The Minister has a difficult task; but, in so far as this party can support the leverage and argument of our Government in attempting to bring about effective social and regional funds, they will have our full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to congratulate Deputy O'Keeffe on his first speech as spokesman for Foreign Affairs.  I noted with delight, too, the contribution from Deputy Quinn, especially his earlier remarks.</P>
      <P>I rise to participate in this debate because I am not sure that the unanimity being expressed in this House is the sort of unanimity that would be expressed in the country having regard to the fact that 90 per cent of the Irish people do not know the Community is being enlarged while 99 per cent of them do not care.  It is the duty and the responsibility of those of us here to let the people know that the Community is being enlarged.  In particular it is the duty of the Government to draw to the attention of our people the possible implications of this enlargement.</P>
      <P>I have a sneaking suspicion that in a few years somebody will make a fortune by writing a book on why Ireland slept. Without any national debate or real discussion we are drifting into a situation whereby we are approving on the nod the enlargement of the Community.  I joined this debate to pose the question: should we not be opposing the entry of Greece into the Community or, to put it more accurately, should we not be opposing the enlargement of the Community until we know more about the implications?  I pose those questions in the knowledge that they will not make any difference.  The Bill will be passed.  I am only posing the questions so that we can shake ourselves out of the apathy and laziness with which we approach public affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the accession of Greece because I have great affection for that country which must rate as one of the most beautiful countries in Europe.  I welcome the possibility that the accession <Col N="289" /> of Greece to the EEC will help towards the stabilisation of democracy in that country.  I should like to pose another question?  Is the opposite true? Will the accession of Greece, rather than benefiting that country and improving its stability, threaten the stability of the EEC?  I pose that question not because I believe that to be likely but because that question ought to be answered.</P>
    <P>We tend to approach our public affairs in a sort of lazy and apathetic fashion.  More than any other Department, as far as politicians and the public are concerned, that is true of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Foreign Affairs is not a local issue; there are no votes or interest in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must have been misunderstood because I did not intend to say anything concerning the officials of the Department or the Minister.  I was pointing to the lack of public and political interest in foreign affairs.  I am not talking about the officials but about the politicians and, to a great extent, the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tend to approach public affairs with a certain amount of apathy and laziness.  One example is that we have allowed an important decision such as the enlargement of the Community to pass on the nod.  There is not a lot of interest in foreign affairs by the public at large.  The fact that there is no interest does not mean that such matters are of less importance.  Such matters are very important and we should express our dissatisfaction at the absence of a public debate on this question.  We should also express our dissatisfaction at the absence of a White Paper on the implications of <Col N="290" /> the accession of Greece, as was requested.</P>
    <P>I should now like to ask some questions about the accession of the Hellenic Republic.  In doing so I am glad to note that the Greek Ambassador, and other members of the diplomatic staff are present.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be sidetracked into a row with the Chair.  I welcome the accession of Greece and I hope that country will benefit from such a move and that Europe will also benefit. Deputy O'Keeffe raised the question of Turkey in this context.  We are all aware that for a long time there has been troubled relations between Greece and Turkey.  Like Greece, Turkey is of strategic importance to the security of the West.  Deputy Quinn referred to the <Col N="291" /> strategic position of Greece but that argument is more important in relation to Turkey because of the Islamic nature of the Turkish Republic.  It is important because of the Islamic solidarity that exists between Turkey and the Arab world. The relationship between the EEC and the Arab world needs strengthening. Although the EEC has announced a sound policy on the Palestine question, it must be stated that not many Palestinians or Arabs have much conviction in that policy.  On that basis our relationship with the Arab and Islamic world needs strengthening.</P>
      <P>I understand that Turkey is anxious to have stronger ties with the EEC and that many people in that country aspire to eventual membership of the Community. We have not asked why Greece which has indicated that it will not veto the further enlargement of the Community to incorporate Spain and Portugal, has not given such a commitment in relation to Turkey.  As far as I know such a commitment has not been sought.  It would be too bad if the eventual enlargement of the Community to include Turkey were to be vetoed by Greece because of the troubled relationship between the two countries.  Has this question been raised and, if so, what are its implications, or what is its answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be more acute problems as we seek to embrace Spain, Portugal and whatever other countries aspire to join us.  What impact will this have on the decision-making process in the Community, which to some people is already cumbersome and inefficient, to say the least?  Will enlargement make it more inefficient and more cumbersome?  What plans are in train to tackle the decision-making problems, following enlargement? Are there going to be another one, two, three Director Generals, and Directors and other staff to represent adequately Greece, Spain and Portugal?  If this is so, will it mean additional staff or displacement of present staff and how much will this all cost?  There is the additional factor of coping with another language, which adds to the cumbersomeness <Col N="292" /> and inefficiency of the bureaucratic machine of Europe.  Would the Minister tell the House what provisions are being made as far as staff and the whole decision-making process are concerned, for the present time and for the future?</P>
    <P>I add my voice to those of Deputy Quinn and Deputy O'Keeffe, especially about the regional fund.  What will be the impact of Greece's accession on the regional fund?  Has any account been taken of the total Community budget in the context of enlargement?  In relation to the bilateral relations between Greece and ourselves, will that accession bring a greater political, social, cultural, trade and communication contact between Dublin and Athens, between Ireland and Greece?  I am not aware of any increased political, social, cultural or trade relations between our two countries.  The only two observable developments in this regard were the appointment of an Irish Ambassador to Athens and of a Greek Ambassador to Dublin and, since then, the visit of Mr. Karamanlis.  Would the Minister tell the House what plans are in train, or what discussions have taken place, about improving the political, social, cultural and trade contacts and communications between our two countries? It would be helpful to encourage understanding and an alliance between what will be two small countries in a large Community.</P>
    <P>This debate is appropriate and timely as it precedes the meeting of the European Council in Dublin, starting tomorrow.  Issues and questions will be discussed tomorrow and the following day, which may be looked at differently because Greece is now entering the Community, though that may not be the case.  It is a pity that almost exclusive attention by the media to the forthcoming Summit Meeting has been about Britain's net contribution to the Community budget&mdash;the £1,000 million which Mrs. Thatcher has all Europe hopping about.  Regarding net beneficiaries and net contributions, Deputy Quinn referred to the fact that we in this party and the Government <Col N="293" /> party are always saying that we are net beneficiaries of the EEC.  I have said before in this House, and repeat, that nobody is in the EEC for benevolent purposes.  Nobody is in the EEC to give away money&mdash;least of all Britain.  Britain is not giving £1,000 million to the Community for nothing; the Federal Republic of Germany is not continuing as a substantial net contributor to the Community for nothing.  There are massive trade benefits to them by the existence of the Community.  It should be driven home tomorrow to Britain that they are not in the Community for charity and are not giving charity.  They are benefiting from the EEC.  It also should be driven home that earlier £1,000 million net contribution is not unconnected with the fact that Britain's relationships with some of her former colonies and the Commonwealth countries like New Zealand are closer than Britain's relationship with the EEC.</P>
    <P>Greece has been referred to as a likely net beneficiary in the context of the EEC budget.  Greece had better watch out. Greece ought not to take it for granted that because, on paper, they are getting more money from the EEC budget than they are contributing, in the overall context they are net beneficiaries.  It does not follow that they benefit from trade and so on; I hope they will.  As I said before, I hope that Greece and the Community alike benefit from Greece's accession; but it does not necessarily follow that those who are getting, on the face of it, most out of the EEC budget are getting most out of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude in the hope, or the knowledge, that the Bill and the motion will be passed without a division in this House.  I wish Greece every good fortune as a member of the EEC.  I hope, when it comes to future enlargements, that we as a country will closely examine the implications of that enlargement and not&mdash;as we seem to be doing now&mdash;apathetically approve the enlargement on the nod, only to find out in a few years' time that we really made a mistake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity <Col N="294" /> of welcoming the latest addition to the EEC.  I speak here in my capacity as a member of the European Parliament.  I look forward in due course, on 1 January 1981, to welcoming an additional 24 colleagues to that European Parliament.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the contributions of the last couple of speakers.  I am at a disadvantage in that I did not hear the contribution of Deputy O'Keeffe.  I have no doubt he welcomed the enlargement of the Community, the fact that we are, in an economic and political sense, extending co-operation across Europe. While the present Nine form a bloc in their own way of western European nations, taking in all of Western Europe with the exception of the Iberian peninsula, we are now breaking into new ground, opening our doors, taking the Hellenic Republic into the EEC.  I take this opportunity of welcoming our new collegues from Greece who will be joining us as from 1 Janaury 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Mitchell talking in terms of Greece wanting to watch out; that they might not be getting the economic benefit they may be expecting in this regard.  I suppose this is speaking in a reflective way about the economic benefit that membership of the EEC has been to Ireland since our entry on 1 January 1973.  I am glad to see that Deputy O'Donnell is here and will be contributing.  People who have visited the European Parliament, who have seen it in action, may comment, perhaps legitimately, on its being a mere talking forum, a talking shop, with its powers and functions subject to question.  This is where our priorities lie.  I have no objection to the European Parliament being described as a talking shop.  At present we have members from nine different countries contributing to debates on a variety of subjects, some extremely controversial from a political point of view. As from 1 January 1981 we will have members from ten countries, people of all shades of political opinion across Europe, arguing the toss, generally discussing their problems and certainly not all of them agreeing.  And this is the <Col N="295" /> bright aspect of it: all of them agreeing to disagree, being willing to talk about it rather than taking up arms, which has been the history of Europe on two occasions within this century.  The latter part of this century has been devoted to the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community, subsequently the European Economic Community, then the nominated Parliament of the Six, now the nominated Parliament of the Nine, with the elected parliament of the ten from 1982.  The 24 new representatives from Greece will be nominated as from 1 January 1981.  At present we have a directly-elected parliament; for 12 months we will have a proportion of that parliament being nominated but, as from some time in 1982, we will again have a directly-elected parliament.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the economic benefits which allegedly each country is anxious to get out of this amalgamation of nations of Europe, the priority benefit&mdash;the one which should stand over and above all others&mdash;is that of countries getting together, with representatives of their people getting together saving millions of pounds and millions of lives by being able to talk about their problems and resolving them rather than taking up arms in an effort so to do, because inevitably these are problems which must be solved eventually around the conference table.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the fact that nobody is in the EEC to give away money.  I accept that.  Certainly the attraction offered at the time we were joining was the pronounced economic benefit membership would bring to this country.  That was one of the reasons we found the overwhelming majority of our people in favour of joining, despite the opposition of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Quinn saying that the people in Wexford, Limerick and all over the country, with the exception of those in Ringsend, had derived an amount of benefit from our membership. This brings me to a major criticism of Deputy Quinn.  He has been consistent in so far as he is obviously still opposed to <Col N="296" /> the principle of our membership of the EEC.  His party opposed our membership originally.  But Deputy Quinn is talking about the fact that, while other people have benefited therefrom, the people in his constituency have not derived any such benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall say something about the protocol that the Hellenic Republic have built into their treaty protecting their capacity to attract industrial development to Greece.  I note that the protocol built in to their accession treaty is exactly the same as was built into ours to enable us continue with the industrial development that had been building up here before our entry, again one of the reasons which accounted for our having been successful in selling membership to our people&mdash;we being the Government of the day and the main Opposition party, with the backing of the farming community.  Our contention was that we would be able to maintain our attractiveness as an industrial base for foreign industrialists who might come here to manufacture goods for export to the Common Market.  But then Deputy Quinn and his colleagues might express opposition to a number of those multi-nationals we attract here, contending that, while they give a lot of employment and apparently give people more profits, it appears that sometimes they use employees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not invent anything.  I referred to Ringsend, and Deputy Quinn by way of interruption came in to explain himself.  I am working on that supplementary explanation now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stood in Europe as a member of the European Progressive Democrats with whom Fianna Fáil are associated and we recently discussed the budget there.  During <Col N="297" /> the course of the European election campaign Fianna Fáil were criticised for saying that we did not subscribe to the view that the European Parliament should have the overall power and should have their powers increased.  Both Fine Gael and the Labour Party claimed that it would be far more beneficial for us if additional powers were conferred on the European Parliament so that more Fine Gael and Labour representatives could be elected to the European Parliament in order to use their undoubted influence on the parties with which they proposed to be associated when elected to Europe.  I have no doubt that if Deputy Quinn checks with his four colleagues who are members of a Socialist Group in the European Parliament they will confirm that it was embarrassing for them to have to stand up as four almost isolated men in the Socialist Group in their efforts to defend the common agricultural policy.  They were supported by the French Socialists, whom, Deputy Quinn was critical of in his contribution.  There was no evidence that they succeeded in exerting any influence on this tremendous group of which they were members.  During the campaign they said &ldquo;Elect us and let us be members of the largest group in Europe and we will use our influence for the benefit of this country&rdquo;.  Deputy Quinn should direct his words in relation to additional social and regional fund moneys to his colleagues in the influential Socialist Group.  My four colleagues in the European People's Party were not as lonesome when they stood up to protect the CAP as were the four people in the Socialist Group.  The extent of their influence in that party did not appear to be as extensive as was conveyed by their leader, Deputy Cluskey, when he was stomping the country campaigning on their behalf prior to June last.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why I welcome Greece into the EEC is because they will have pretty much the same type of interest in the preservation and the protection of the CAP as we have.  Greece will stand in the way that all of the 15 Republic of Ireland representatives and <Col N="298" /> the French, Scottish and Danish people stood in a bloc, irrespective of what party bloc they were in, for the preservation of the CAP.  I was in the happy position of being able to stand in a group, even if small, who were all standing for the preservation of the CAP.  Deputy Quinn's colleagues in Europe were not in a position to influence even one member of their group.  The actions of every Frenchman and of every Irishman were predictably for the protection and preservation of the CAP.  Our 24 new colleagues from Greece will also seek to protect the CAP.  As far as I am concerned, the Greek representatives cannot come in quickly enough to prevent Deputy Quinn's Socialist colleagues from crippling the CAP to the detriment of this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell wondered if the Government were conscious of the provisions for the entry of Greece into the EEC and wondered if the EEC were prepared for the expansion.  Deputy FitzGerald was a member of the Council of Ministers away back in 1976 when the decision was taken to admit Greece into the EEC, so Deputy Mitchell's question was ill-timed.  Deputy Mitchell should not have posed the question whether we should oppose the Bill until we knew the implications.  In fairness, Deputy Mitchell answered his own question and said that he was in favour of their entry.  I would have expected a Fine Gael front bencher to have been positively in favour of their entry without raising questions in view of the fact that his party leader was the Irish representative and the member of the Council who handled this at the time when Greece was signed up.</P>
    <P>Another point about Greece's entry, from the agricultural viewpoint, to which the Minister drew attention when making his Second Stage speech, was that we were concerned that the transitional period, which is the same as our five years, should be as short as possible, especially for beef and dairy produce, for which a lucrative market exists.  From that point of view we cannot get Greece in quickly enough and the transitional <Col N="299" /> period cannot be short enough to meet our requirements.</P>
    <P>My contribution as a member of the European Parliament is to welcome the accession of Greece to the EEC.  There is no reason why anything that will emerge as being to the economic benefit of Greece, from a policy point of view, will not in the same way be a benefit to us.</P>
    <P>I took a note of a statement made by Deputy Quinn and I cannot be contradicted because I wrote it down.  This gets me back to what I was saying a few moments ago about the contribution that can be made by Parliament in support of representatives at council who will be fighting in the national interest.  He said they hoped they would have allies within the Greek Republic with whom they could work.  I understand he was speaking as a Labour Deputy looking forward to having socialist colleagues coming to the European Parliament, either nominated or directly elected.  He went on to speak about the new democratic party, but one may assume he will not be drawing his colleagues from them.  I hope that the colleagues, if he attracts or joins colleagues there, will be colleagues of the French type who will have some regard for the preservation of agricultural interests rather than colleagues who would be looking over their shoulders at their next door neighbours who wear the red tie.</P>

Oireann sé go mór le gluaiseacht chuig aontas na tEorpa go mbeadh an sean tír seo ag teacht isteach, tír atá mar chliabhan do chultúr, daonlathas agus polaitíocht na hEorpa.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the House, but both as a Dáil Deputy and as a Member of the European Parliament I feel I should make a brief contribution to this discussion.  The Bill is to be welcomed. The accession of Greece to the European Community will be regarded by most people in our country and by most peoples in the present member states of the Community as a very significant and historic milestone on the road to European unity.  It is a singularly appropriate development and worthy of special welcome, that Greece, which can be described as the cradle, source and fountain of European civilisation, should now be about to join the broader European community known as the EEC.</P>
      <P>The attitude of Ireland as represented by the present Government, and by the previous Government of which I had the honour to be a member, towards the possibility of Greek accession has been sympathetic, positive and constructive, but most of all our attitude as a nation has been logical.  In his opening speech, the Minister gave an interesting résumé of the various events leading up to the present situation when Greece will shortly become a member of the EEC.  I am sure that Greece will send, initially on a delegated basis, members to the present European Parliament.  Judged by the welcome that has been extended and the consensus that has been reached in relation to Greek membership I am confident that the members who will be coming from Greece to the European Parliament can be assured of a hearty and very warm welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a little time the question of the accession of Spain and Portugal will also come up for discussion.  While we welcome enlargement and would particularly welcome the accession of <Col N="301" /> Greece, Portugal and Spain to the EEC we must not close our eyes to the harsh economic realities of EEC membership. We must be conscious of the implications of enlargement.  I have no intention of following Deputy Lalor in recrimination and in pointing out that his group were better than my group or Deputy Quinn's group&mdash;this is irrelevant.  I want to repeat what I said yesterday in the debate on the Dairy Produce Bill.  The 15 members who have the honour to represent this State in the EEC have worked together.  We have indicated our opposition or approval of various motions, but notably in relation to the CAP when there were a number of votes recently on the occasion of the budget debate.  We have shown our solidarity.  We stood up and were counted whether we are Christian Democrats, Socialists or Gaullists. One of the most pleasing aspects of the short experience I have had so far as a Member of the European Parliament is that the 15 of us have established a rapport and are conscious that while we are committed to the European ideal we are also conscious that we are representatives of a small peripheral island nation with immense economic and social problems.  We can be relied on, while we have our political differences, to stand up and be counted when the interests of this nation are at stake.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to prolong the discussion because I shall have an opportunity of speaking in another forum on this subject, but there has been one rather worrying reaction in Europe.  I have the privilege of being involved in regional policy there.  It is my great personal interest, and probably one of the reasons which motivated my candidature for the EEC.  The question of enlargement has immense implications for regional policy.  References were made in the debate to the disparity existing between the better-off regions of Europe and the weaker ones.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a comparison between the standard of living and income of the people in Hamburg and those in the west of Ireland or in the south of Italy indicated that there was a difference <Col N="302" /> of one to four.  That has now worsened; the difference is now one to six.  It is estimated that when Greece, Spain and Portugal come in the difference will be one to 12.  This is an alarming situation.  It is frightening, because one can look at the situation and say that Greece, Spain and Portugal have immense regional problems; they have large regions which are underdeveloped, very similar to our own country and in particular the western regions.  Will they all be drawing from the same cake? Unless the EEC cake is greatly enlarged matters will be much worse.  The Minister very rightly referred to the effects of enlargement in relation to the budget, the social policy and, in particular, the regional policy.  The realistic way to look at the implications of enlargement is that it provides a unique opportunity to get down to tackling the enormous challenge of formulating and implementing an appropriate regional policy for the entire Community which will ensure that the weaker regions can evolve and can make economic and social progress.  This matter is coming up for urgent consideration by the Council of the committee dealing with regional policy and planning of which I have the honour to be a member.</P>
    <P>I would like to talk at length on the subject of regional policies which is a hobby-horse of mine but I will not detain the House.  I welcome the accession of Greece.  I am also satisfied that our attitude here to the application by Greece for membership has been the right one.  I want to give due credit to the previous Government of which I was a Member, to the present Government, to the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and to the present Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I hope that all the institutions of Europe will, as a matter of extreme urgency, tackle what is the top priority now in relation to the EEC, and that is the formulation and implementation of an appropriate, realistic regional policy which will be backed by a realistic and adequate regional fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="303" /> came in at rather short notice because the senior Minister in the Department had to take himself from this hallowed chamber to another place in the context of tomorrow's EEC summit.  In the circumstances I apologise to Deputies if I cannot reply as adequately as I would wish to do in normal circumstances.  The circumstances of my presence are rather abnormal to say the least of it, but that is the way of politics.</P>
      <P>I would like to join the other Deputies in congratulating Deputy O'Keeffe on making his maiden speech as spokesman for Foreign Affairs on the Fine Gael benches.  It takes some considerable time to read oneself into a new brief, but it is quite clear that Deputy O'Keeffe has grasped the fundamental issues in the very short time that he has been in his present position.</P>
      <P>In addition I welcome the general support given to the Bill by the generality of the Deputies who spoke.  Deputy Mitchell was critical in a very general way.  Nevertheless at the end of his speech he was able and willing to accept the importance of the Hellenic Republic's accession to the Community.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned the question of relations between Greece and Turkey.  Obviously the position of Turkey as an associate member of the Community did not arise during the accession negotiations with Greece. However, Prime Minister Karamanlis and the other Greek politicians have stated on many occasions that their country will not block a future application for membership on the part of Turkey.  That is a very generous attitude on the part of Greece, and it should be recognised and given credit.  It is an attitude which found acceptability with the other nine existing members of the EEC when Greece came to make their application in July 1976.  In their turn, while they found acceptability in the common market, they are prepared to extend a generous attitude to Turkey in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Present financial difficulties were raised by Deputy O'Keeffe.  They are a <Col N="304" /> much wider problem which would have to be dealt with irrespective of Greek accession. In fact they would form a debate on their own.</P>
    <P>In regard to the financial implications of Greek accession the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to the Council commitment which was made in July 1976 during the negotiations.  We had a reiteration of this statement from our partners and from the Commission itself. Let me refer specifically once more to the Council's statement as outlined in the Minister's introductory speech.  It is stated:</P>
    <P>In July, 1976 when the question of opening accession negotiations with Greece was being discussed, Ireland proposed and had accepted by the Council a Council statement which declared&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  that the consequences&mdash;in particular the financial consequences&mdash;of an enlargement must not be detrimental to the common projects and policies of the Community or to those which it intends to carry out in the future.</P>
    <P>(2)  that enlargement must help strengthen a Community dynamic in its aspirations and not weaken or reduce in effectiveness its institutional structures and possibilities for action; and</P>
    <P>(3)  that, with this view, the Council was agreed that subject to usual budgetary procedures, on Greek accession appropriate provision would be made for the needs of the enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>At later discussions I reiterated this position and received support from my colleagues in the Council and from the Commission.  I made it clear, however, that Ireland was not setting preconditions for enlargement which would have to be fullfilled by the applicant countries.  Rather were we asking that enlargement be used as an occasion for strengthening the Community in relation to the budget.  That has been a very <Col N="305" /> reasonable approach acceptable to successive Governments.</P>
    <P>It is important to place on the record, particularly for the benefit of Deputy Mitchell, that his own party leader presided over the Greek application in the first instance in July 1976.  He and others were worrying about enlargement and Greek accession since they applied in 1976.  Deputy Mitchell came into the House in 1977.  Both prior and subsequent to that year there has been much public debate, and his own party were involved in it when they were in Government and his own political leader was Minister for Foreign Affairs.  There have been many parliamentary questions over the past four or five years in relation to Greek accession.  In the <i>Fifty-First Report of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities</i> the problem of enlargement was discussed.  The Committee on Secondary Legislation is a Committee of this House.  The report was printed pursuant to the orders of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann on 13 and 14 December 1977 respectively.  We should stop trying to suggest that there has not been public discussion on enlargement generally and Greek accession specifically.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe made the point that the accession of Greece would be a renaissance of our true European commitment. There is no answer to that.  He posed the question of whether the Hellenic Republic would answer to the spirit and letter of the Treaty.  There is no doubt about it.  It is a generous nation and the Greeks are a generous people. Perhaps we should not be asking questions of this nature, but the answer to that question is yes, they will approach it in the spirit of the Community and commitment to the Community in both the letter and the spirit of the Teaty.</P>
    <P>Ireland has much in common with Greece.  I do not for one moment concede that we are a poor nation.  We may not have as many resources as some other members of the Nine and there is the reality of our peripheral geographical position in relation to the rest of Europe. <Col N="306" /> Our country was not blessed with natural resources which are available to and worked by the other richer nations of the Community, but as members of the Community we have not done too badly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of clarification, when I referred to welcoming Greece in the full letter and spirit of the Treaty of Rome my reference was to the Community implementing the Treaty, not Greece.  I have no doubt about the position of Greece.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected by that clarification.  Deputy O'Keeffe also made the point that he would extend the hand of friendship.  That has been the common thread throughout the whole debate.  All Deputies, even those who raised questions which were rather obscure, still in the final analysis extended the hand of friendship to the Hellenic Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may seem out of order in referring to a point made by Deputy Quinn on a matter which has concerned me in the past two or three weeks.  That is the prominence given to the British Prime Minister coming to this country.  One would imagine that she was the only person coming to this Summit of nine nations who are equal, and that she was coming to re-colonise this part of the country.  I find the hysteria propagated by the very sycophantic British press nauseating.  However, the British media are very good at supporting the British establishment.  We are all entering into this council tomorrow as equal members of a very strong economic unit.  To suggest for one moment that the question of the budgetary contribution of Britain will be the only item and the only concern of the Council tomorrow and the following day is false.  Many issues were raised here which Deputies were concerned should be on the agenda for tomorrow and the following day and I have no doubt that they will be on this agenda in addition to the British problem.  However, as Deputy Quinn says, perhaps the least said soonest mended when a Government representative <Col N="307" /> is expressing the views that I have expressed. In general I agree with what the Deputy said on this issue.</P>
    <P>The question of the assessment of the cost to the Community of Greek accession was referred to.  Again we rely on the July 1976 statement of the Council that the necessary additional resources will be provided, and there is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>On a liberal reading of the Minister's speech, Deputy Quinn made the point that the Hellenic Republic was a fragile and structurally weak country.  If I am wrong he can check me on that.  He will agree that with the return of a democratic government, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in his opening speech, it would be only natural that Greece should seek to consolidate her rediscovered freedom by aligning herself even more closely with democratic nations of the European Community.  Of course Greece is structually fragile.  The Hellenic Republic may be fragile and have a structurally weak economy, but surely if those conditions exist in that wonderful country it should not be prevented from joining a stronger economic unit because of the existence of those conditions.  It should be welcomed in, if for that reason alone. Another reason for welcoming it is support for the return to democracy in that nation which has been described throughout this debate as the cradle of democracy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn made much of the regional fund and social fund.  It is interesting to look at the improvement of the figures over the years.  I intend to read them into the Official Report.  The regional fund has been increased substantially since its inception in 1975. Irish receipts from that fund and from the social fund mentioned by Deputy Quinn have increased steadily.  Nobody suggests that they are the ultimate as far as this country is concerned.  Of course we want more from the regional fund and from the social fund, and we are moving very steadily towards achieving reasonably realistic figures.  We are not <Col N="308" /> satisfied with what we are getting in receipts from the regional and social funds.  However, we are fighting our corner very strenuously and with considerable success, as these figures will prove to the House.</P>
    <P>The following are details of Irish receipts from the regional fund: 1975, £1,757,568; 1976, £8,541,000; 1977, £8,496,101&mdash;a reduction between 1976 and 1977; 1978, £11,103,000 and in 1979 from the beginning of January to 7 October the figure has increased to £18 million.  There are ascertainable facts and it would be no harm if those people in the Opposition who are critical of the Government in relation to the regional fund, would look into their own hearts. Of the total quota Ireland received 6.46 per cent.  Regarding the social fund Irish receipts have been as follows: 1974, £3,631,850; 1975, £4,029,866; 1976, £4,616,758; 1977, £8,173,266; 1978, £19,337,591 and 1979, to the beginning of this month, £25,900,000.  Those figures speak for themselves and those who express unhappiness in regard to them might look to the achievements of the past number of years in relation to a definite and dramatic increase in receipts from the regional and social funds though these funds are still not adequate from the national point of view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn made the point of there not being an Irish trading presence in Greece and said that Córas Tráchtála moved away from Athens some years ago.  I do not have any knowledge of that offhand, but it is something that I shall check out and communicate with the Deputy on.  However, I would remind the Deputy that we have an embassy in Athens, in other words, that we have full diplomatic relations with the Hellenic Republic.  We are represented there by a first-class diplomat, while Greece also has an embassy here at which they are represented, too, by a man of whom Greece can be proud.</P>
    <P>In recent years it has been the policy of the Department of Foreign Affairs to ensure a strong trading presence in all countries with which we have full diplomatic relations.  While there may <Col N="309" /> not be an identifiable trading presence in Greece, Deputies may be assured that should anybody go to the embassy in Athens inquiring about trading prospects, he would be well received and be given whatever information he might require.</P>

      <P>I do not agree. There are Irish people who can speak the Greek language.  I might add that we have an Irish diplomat in our embassy in Japan who can speak Japanese and from first-hand knowledge I know that we have a representative in Saudi Arabia who can converse with the sheiks and princes in their language so we have quite a multi-lingual diplomatic service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak a little Irish, a little English and my French is not too bad either.  With the accession of Greece to the Community there will be a greater awareness of an Irish presence in Greece, but through our respective embassies we have maintained social, cultural, economic, and other very strong links with Greece and these links will become stronger when Greece takes her rightful place among the nations of the Community.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn went on to talk in terms of Greece being a major maritime nation and to the fact that with her accession the Community merchant fleet will increase from 20 to 30 per cent.  I should like to assure the Deputy that that is an important aspect.  It is an increase of 10 per cent on our existing 20 per cent in terms of our merchant fleet within the Common Market and this again will be an additional bonus to the Community as a whole in that we will have at our disposal the experience of a first-class maritime nation with all the additional technology and other advances that will mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the question of consultation <Col N="310" /> between the Hellenic Republic and the EEC prior to Greece's application being received and accepted in July 1976, there have been ongoing consultations and these have been as effective as the Greeks would wish them to be.  I think they would agree that these consultations have been most effective.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell in his general remarks made the point 90 per cent of the Irish people are not aware that the Community is being enlarged and that 99 per cent of them do not care.  Such an assertion is an insult to the intelligence of the Irish people.  How has the Deputy arrived at these figures?  Is he suggesting that only 10 per cent of the nation is aware that Greece is joining the Community, that only 10 per cent know that Spain and Portugal are interested in becoming full members?  I do not know where he got those figures from but to say that 99 per cent of the nation do not care is a gross misrepresentation of the position.  It is not true.  I would be prepared to argue further with the Deputy on this matter on a different occasion if he produced the basis for his argument.  He appeared to give figures off the top of his head thrown out to be destructive rather than constructive. They might be damaging to the prospects of Greek-Irish relations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell said that the Community was being enlarged without any national debate.  This matter has been debated over the years through the participation of his political leader in the original application by Greece, through Dáil Questions, other debates and in the proceedings of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  According to the 51st report of that committee that matter was specifically discussed.  Deputy Mitchell also made the point that public representatives, and Members of the Dáil in particular, were lazy in their approach to public affairs.  I must defend the hard working Dáil Deputies of all parties.  Deputy Mitchell uttered the sort of throwaway line that brings this House into disrepute and the Members specifically.  Nothing could be further <Col N="311" /> from the truth.  Dáil Deputies give a 14-to 16-hour day whether they are in government or in opposition.  I do not need to outline how hard Government Ministers work, senior and junior Ministers.  The majority of Members work very hard in one way or another whether through Committees or answering replies to constituents.  The sophisticated say that Members should not do that, that it is not part of the work of a Member but the sophisticated have never been in the Dáil and it is most unlikely that they ever will be elected.  Such a statement does not measure up to the reality of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>The charge that Dáil Deputies are lazy and approach public affairs in a lazy fashion is irritating.  If Deputy Mitchell puts such a value on himself the public will accept that valuation.  I get hot when I speak about such matters and I should not because I have been working very hard on humidity in the last couple of years.  I should like to tell Deputy Mitchell that the Euro-Arab dialogue is continuing all the time.  I participated in that dialogue on a number of occasions.  In fairness to <Col N="312" /> him, he ended on a positive note in that he welcomed the entry of the Hellenic Republic into the EEC.</P>
      <P>In his thoughtful speech Deputy Lalor outlined the role played by the European Parliament.  He dealt with the situation that will exist after the accession of Greece and pointed out that the Parliament would welcome 24 additional members to the existing 410 members. He made the point that one of the great merits of the Common Market, and the European Parliament as an institution of the Common Market, was that it had brought peace.  We had world wars between 1914 and 1918 and 1939 and 1945 but, thank goodness, we have achieved a reasonably peaceful state in the world context since.  Deputy Lalor discussed the difference between himself and Deputy Quinn and referred specifically to the performance of the socialist comrades of Deputy Quinn in the European Parliament, but that is a matter between the two Deputies.  Deputy Lalor pointed out that in the accession of Greece Ireland would have an additional ally in the context of the preservation of the CAP.  We welcome that because there are members of the EEC who would try to erode the benefits that countries like Ireland receive under the significant common agricultural policies.  With or without the accession of Greece we will continue to defend the CAP as strongly as we have been doing in the past.  As far as we are concerned the CAP is unassailable. I know that the Hellenic Republic when it becomes a member will feel as strongly about the CAP as we do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell, in his fair-minded speech, welcomed the Bill and praised the attitude of this and previous Governments in their positive, sympathetic, constructive and logical approach to the accession of the Hellenic Republic to the EEC.  He wisely made the point that we must not lose sight of the harsh realities of the enlargement of the Community and the economic prospects of existing members when Greece becomes a full member in 1981 and with the accession of Spain and Portugal.  I have referred to the EEC as an economic bloc but there <Col N="313" /> is more to it than that.  There are cultural and other aspects to the Community which do not receive much prominence. I also welcome the statement of Deputy O'Donnell that he had seen the solidarity of the Irish 15 from the southern part of the island in defence of the CAP.  That defence across the political divide is as it should be.  The Deputy mentioned the question of regional imbalances which exist within the Community.  The richer nations have a lot of responsibility to ensure that the less well-off countries are given a fair deal.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell mentioned, particularly, the west of Ireland.  We are very conscious of our obligations to the west of Ireland in the context of the regional imbalances which exist in the EEC.  The Deputy made the valid point that the accession of Greece was a unique opportunity for the Commission, the Parliament, the Economic and Social Committees of the Parliament, the Council and the Ministers to restate formal, proper and cohesive regional and social funds.  This Government are quite clear on their obligation to ensure that Ireland receives greater amounts from these funds; their philosophy is quite clear in regard to these funds.  Anything which can be done to improve the situation should be done, and I welcome Deputy O'Donnell's original idea in that regard, immediately subsequent to the Hellenic Republic's accession to the EEC.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much more for me to say.  I understand that the Bill can be passed with the agreement of the House but I restate the pleasure of the Government and of the people of Ireland in being associated, in a very positive way, with the Hellenic Republic's accession to the EEC.  It is an established fact that successive Irish Governments have consistently supported from the beginning the Hellenic Republic's application to become full members of the EEC.  We have pursued the application of this great country consistently and positively.  I know that I am speaking on behalf of the whole House in welcoming the Hellenic Republic's becoming, after 1981, a full member of the EEC.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress last evening I was about to refer to the complaints of recipients of social welfare, and many others, with which public representatives were confronted in the past year, problems never before experienced in our history, occasioned by the postal strike and the many other problems caused internally and externally, which meant that recipients of social welfare in particular had a very rough time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing in mind all of those experiences of the past year this Bill affords us a tremendous opportunity to move towards the appointment of an ombudsman.  Practically all other countries, with the exception of one or two in the EEC, have already made that appointment. I am sure that it was after many years of difficult experiences and unpleasant happenings that those governments were forced to make that decision.  I am delighted that we are almost at the point of that appointment. Irrespective of whoever may claim credit for its introduction, it must be regarded as a much needed Bill.  Such an appointment is necessary in the interests of the defence of individuals, at a time of growing bureaucracy with much paper work and generally the work of the Government being spread over many areas. Because of this phenomenon many individuals fear that their grievances will not be taken seriously and will be cast aside.  There is no greater danger of a break-down in democracy than having people who, even without a grievance, feel they are being victimised.  People who wish to have an objective examination of their case are so entitled; indeed it is their right more than their privilege.  It is above all important that they have that <Col N="316" /> right and that the ombudsman would be seen to be a man of independence, playing an independent role.</P>
    <P>In addition to the many grievances that will be placed on the table of the ombudsman I am sure he will have many initial grievances of his own because no doubt, in investigating other grievances, he will discover many an injustice that has not come to light.  In itself I believe that will form a major part of his functions and I sincerely hope he will not be hampered in that role in any way.</P>
    <P>A special section of the office of ombudsman should be devoted entirely to dealing with the problems of women, particularly issues of marriage and those of children's rights, an area in which we fall down.  As public representatives we are approached daily by heartbroken women complaining about their family life.  Certainly that aspect should be included in the functions of the ombudsman because he would be in a better position to take decisions than even the courts or our public representatives.  He could use his role to great advantage in that respect.</P>
    <P>In other countries the investigatory powers of the ombudsman are very great, allowing him to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.  The very fact that those powers obtain acts as a disincentive to people making deliberately wrong decisions. I am not for a moment suggesting that anybody in the civil service would do a deliberate disservice to an individual or in any way deny him his rights.  But mistakes do happen, and happen very often.  Very often civil servants are misinformed.  I had experience of a particular individual who approached me having been cut off from his unemployment benefit for 3 months as a result of a letter sent to the Department to the effect that he was working and simultaneously drawing unemployment benefit.  When that case was investigated&mdash;and it took a long time&mdash;it was ascertained that the letter in question had been written by a crank who had a personal grievance with the applicant. Very often a civil servant may not <Col N="317" /> be prepared to come out and admit that such has happened, resulting in continuing injustices, upsetting not alone the individual concerned but his family because there may be no money coming into that household.  These are the types of matters we should examine carefully.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the appointment of an ombudsman, we must not think in terms of police officers, army officers, who can obtain justice in their own fields.  The ombudsman will be more important to the under-privileged than any other sector of the community.  For that reason, I am very happy to know that this Bill, or one of the two Bills, will be passed through this House.  I understand the other Bill is at present in circulation. I welcome that; it is an incentive to people on this side of the House to introduce more Private Members' Bills.</P>

      <P>We cannot ignore the indecent haste with which the other Bill was introduced.  The Opposition should never pass up an opportunity to introduce important legislation.  Were it not for this Private Members' Bill we would probably never have heard about the second Bill for many years.  It is important that we have achieved the speedy introduction of the second Bill.  I pay tribute to the all-Party Committee who worked so hard on this report.  It was a bit embarrassing for the people from the Government Party who were represented on that Committee that no progress was made to date.  The indecent haste tonight is an indication of bitterness which I do not like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the reported grievances of constituents are not due to maladministration. The ombudsman has the choice as to whether or not he will proceed with a case.  I hope that the small unimportant things will not make the ombudsman's role impossible although I am aware that he will have a <Col N="319" /> full time staff to lighten his burden.</P>
    <P>Will more legislation be introduced or will a provision be included in the next Bill to deal with people who wilfully obstruct this ombudsman in the course of his duty?  Will the ombudsman be likened to a court and will the same type of penalties apply which apply to those who obstruct the court in the performance of its duty?</P>
    <P>When this Bill was first spoken about I wished it to cover local authorities in general.  I understand that health boards are not covered.  Last Friday in my county we had the unique experience of a court of inquiry where a medical surgeon who was acting in a temporary capacity for 20 months in the Regional Hospital in Limerick was called before the Appointments Commission but was not successful in his application and another surgeon was appointed.</P>

      <P>The debate on this Bill so far has been rather interesting and very peculiar in many respects.  There appears to be an idea on the Government side that there is something wrong with introducing a Private Members' Bill.  It is provided in the rules of the House that such a Bill can be introduced.  For a debate which is considered important, very often a Private Members Bill is the only way in which the matter can be brought before the House.  The introduction of this Bill was very wise.  As events have turned out, it appears to have had some of the desired effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seem to be mixed feelings among the Members of Fianna Fáil as to whether or not we need an ombudsman. By way of interruption one prominent Fianna Fáil backbencher suggested that we were doing very well without an ombudsman and that an ombudsman was hardly required.  A number of speakers on all sides of the House gave the impression that the appointment of an ombudsman would automatically ensure that the role of Deputies in making representations for constituents would cease.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  If an ombudsman is appointed I assume he will deal with important matters. I am as anxious as anybody to ensure that people get their entitlements without having to pull strings as they <Col N="321" /> must at the moment.  If it is only through the Members of Parliament or through the local councillor that a person can get his entitlement he should use that vehicle. If anybody believes that the appointment of an ombudsman will automatically cut out this type of work for Deputies so that all Members of the House would spend their time legislating, they are entirely wrong.  I know of a Deputy who years ago was approached by a number of constituents to make representations to a certain Minister but he said that he was not a messenger but a legislator.  There was nothing strange about the fact that he was not returned to the House.  I make no apology for making perhaps 40 or 50 representations in writing and by telephone on behalf of constituents and I have done so for 25 years.  I am sure everybody in the House who wants to remain here must do the same.  We are easily contacted.</P>
    <P>When we come to the question of what the ombudsman should do, I would hate to see a proposal coming before the House with the waving of flags and the blaring of trumpets, which would suggest, that an ombudsman would be appointed and yet the very Act of Parliament which established his office would preclude him from dealing with many things which need to be investigated.  If a Government have the majority Fianna Fáil have, all they have to do is bring in a Bill, have it debated in both Houses and by weight of their majority pass a Bill which will exclude for good any reference to matters they do not want dealt with.  All they have to do is to add a special section which says that the Minister may in writing at any time prevent any matter being discussed if it is politically embarrassing.  That is the kind of thing I would be afraid of.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see any whitewashed ombudsman coming in here.  I do not want to see a Bill introduced which will given the impression that the wrongs done to the people will be redressed and then find the people are not getting anything.  What is important to a Government is one thing but what is important to our citizens may be an entirely different matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> This evening I had a phone call from a very irate lady.  She made representations to me last week.  A school bus took children from her area to the secondary school and the only child not being carried was her daughter aged 12.  She wanted to know why this was so.  It turned out to be a mistake.  The child was not going to a convent but her name was on the list for the local technical school. Pending the difficulty being straightened out, a temporary ticket was issued to the child.  This evening an inspector got on the bus and put the child off, not at her own home but a good bit down the road. That is not important to the Government but it is very important to the woman whose child was put off the bus and to the 12-year-old girl.  This is the sort of small thing about which we make representations and in which apparently there will be no way an ombudsman can be involved.</P>
    <P>The Government may feel it would be grand to have on the Statute Book, like every other country in the EEC except Luxembourg, legislation providing for an ombudsman.  His appointment would mean that, if people had grievances, they could be redressed.  However, from the approach to it by the Government so far, I believe nothing could be further from the truth.  I believe an effort is being made to try to pull the wool over the eyes of the people and, in my view, it will not be of any use.</P>
    <P>If there were an ombudsman, in time he could do a lot of good.  But what exactly is he supposed to do?  Where does he start?  What provision will be made for staffing his office?  How many of a staff will he have?  It is a great distance from Donegal to Cork.  How would he operate so that everybody would get a certain amount of justice and not only somebody living a couple of miles from the centre of Dublin?</P>
    <P>Take a matter which will be completely excluded from any Bill coming before this House&mdash;and this question is causing endless trouble&mdash;that is, the state of houses, the conditions under which a man buys a house, estates on which houses are bought but which are <Col N="323" /> not properly finished and which turn into slums in a very short time.  Somebody wrote to the <i>Irish Independent</i> last week and complained about their house, which was built in 1970.  In some peculiar way I was held responsible, although I had not been appointed as a Government Minister until 1973.  Despite the fact that that information was incorrect, that kind of thing will have to be covered by an ombudsman.  There is no point saying that that matter is difficult to deal with. Of course it is, but we must be prepared to deal with matters of this kind and to have some arrangements made to ensure that there will be an investigation into matters which are causing uneasiness.</P>
    <P>Various speakers referred to social welfare.  I do not know how far it is proposed to deal with social welfare matters in this Bill.  Over the last six or seven months letters from the Department of Social Welfare said that the reason some poor old age pensioners have not got the books to which they were entitled some months ago was because of the postal strike.  This is November 1979.  Is there not an necessity to have this sort of thing investigated?  There must be something seriously wrong here.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest respect for civil servants because most of them do a tremendous job, particularly those in the Department of Social Welfare with whom I had many contacts over the years.  I always found they were prepared to deal immediately with complaints, but they are not doing that now. There must be some reason for that.  I believe it is because of intereference by somebody else.  That is why I am very suspicious about the suggestion that a Minister might be able to write off any complaint simply by saying &ldquo;This cannot be investigated because I say so&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When there is a shortage of money it is the easiest thing in the world for a Minister to slow down the paying out of money from Departments, such as the Department of Social Welfare, and save a tremendous amount, although this may cause untold misery to unfortunate people throughout the country.  Hardly a <Col N="324" /> day passes that I do not get at least a dozen complaints.  I do not believe that the ombudsman, as we seem to be envisaging him here, would be in a position to take up these matters because they require instant attention.  They must be dealt with now, not in three or four months' time.  A person who does not get his social welfare benefit and has no other income would be dead from hunger in two or three months' time.</P>
    <P>In my view these matters will continue to be dealt with by Members of this House and people like them, even if an ombudsman is appointed, unless specific arrangements are made whereby certain sections in the ombudsman's office can be set up specifically to deal with such complaints which at present are very numerous.  The same applies to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the ESB.  If a person comes to me and says he paid £300 to the ESB last summer for a connection to his new house and he still has not been connected, what will I say to him?  The other day a person told me he paid £147 for a telephone connection and was told the phone would be connected as soon as the money was paid, but it still has not been installed.  He was told there was a shortage of wire or a dispute in telecommunications last February or something like that, and that the job cannot be done.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about an ombudsman we are talking about somebody who can investigate complaints which affect ordinary people.  Listening to and studying this debate, I am of the opinion that many people here do not have the slightest intention, particularly those on the Government side, of allowing an investigation of that kind to be carried out. They want to see a job done and to give the appearance of having somebody to do the job, and then forget about it.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of talk about youth employment.  Parks, walks along rivers and so on were being dealt with under youth employment and a certain amount of money was made available.  I found that after a certain amount of money was given to one section for employment <Col N="325" /> and a certain amount for materials required, such as occurred at the sports ground in Navan, there was no money left with the result that employment could not continue.  However, as far as the Government were concerned they had made available money for employment. Elsewhere one would find youths aged between 17 and 21 being employed for between £17 and £20 per week. Those youths were sent from AnCO to jobs where they were supposed to be learning a trade.  AnCO paid £20 a week for them but in a lot of cases the employer did not give them anything on the basis that they were being paid by AnCO.  Is there any hope of having such matters investigated by the type of ombudsman the Minister for Finance is considering appointing?</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has already told us that the Bill which was introduced this evening could not be discussed. I accept the ruling, but it was most unfair of the Government to make that Bill available immediately before this evening's debate commenced.  In other words, they were having it both ways.  The Fine Gael Bill must be voted on because we have seen another example of Fianna Fáil treating the House with disrespect.  The whole idea of an ombudsman is that a person should be appointed who would be able to do a job we have been all crying out for.  It should be remembered that the last Government set up a Committee in 1975 to consider this matter.  That committee worked very well.  I read the comment of the Minister for Finance about whether or not there was a trick before the last election to try to rush the appointment of an ombudsman through.  The Minister took long enough to consider this matter, almost two-and-a-half years.  It is correct that the last Government did not introduce a Bill, but the bones of such a piece of legislation had been put together.  I would prefer the earlier suggestion to that put forward by the Minister as being the ideal way of dealing with the question of an ombudsman. We should have an open debate on legislation of this type and, if a reasonable suggestion is put forward, it <Col N="326" /> should be accepted, as happened on many occasions when I was on the Government side.  The Government appear to be of the view that any amendment to their Bill will not be accepted.  I gather from the Minister's comments last week that whether the Opposition like it or not Fianna Fáil will put through their type of Bill.  The fountain of knowledge does not rest on the Government benches alone and the Minister was wrong to shoot down the Bill under discussion, saying that there was no merit in it.  In preparing their own Bill the government should have taken into consideration the good points in the Bill under discussion.  Instead they completely ignored them.</P>
    <P>An ombudsman should be appointed for the purpose of carrying out investigations which affect our people.  The person appointed should investigate specific complaints made by people here.  There is no point in saying that this Bill is not acceptable to the Government and then introducing a Bill bereft of so many provisions that it would be impossible to have a full investigation into any complaint. I hope the Government will not continue with this attitude when they put their Bill before the House.  If that happens the Bill will not help to redress the numerous wrongs which have occurred because of the failure of Fianna Fáil to do what they were supposed to do since returning to office.  They made trouble enough with all their omissions, their failure to pay grants and loans and their misinterpretation of certain matters relating to this House.  Two weeks ago the Minister for Agriculture gave me a reply to a Question which I accepted in good faith, but within one hour I got information to the effect that half of what I had been told by the Minister was entirely incorrect.  The Minister was either misinformed or misunderstood the reply given to him.  That cannot be dealt with here because it is under the Minister's wing but it could be dealt with by the Department of Agriculture.  I am referring specifically to the payment of debts for services rendered.  If somebody is preparing a Bill for the Government attempting to see to it that the Government <Col N="327" /> are pleased by ensuring that everything they can be caught on is excluded then the discussion of such matters here is a waste of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I question the commitment of the Government to establish an independent fully operational ombudsman. My reasons go back a long time.  The post of ombudsman has a long and honoured history in many parts of Europe and throughout the world.  The name comes from the countries where the idea originated, Scandinavia, and this idea has been under discussion here for many years.  During the term of office of the last Government a Member of the Fine Gael Party tabled a motion asking the House to approve the appointment of an ombudsman.  After a debate that motion was accepted unanimously an all-party Committee was set up to discuss it. Some Members of that Committee are now senior members of the Government. That Committee presented a draft report in February, 1977, and it was published the following May, but two-and-a-half years later we are discussing legislation to appoint an ombudsman.  If there was a commitment on the part of the Government to establish the post of ombudsman why was a Bill not introduced in the early days in the term of office of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say that the action taken by the Government only came to a head, as far as I am concerned, at a quarter or 20 minutes to seven this evening.  I then received a copy of the Bill being circulated by the Government.  This is the fourth day on which we have been debating the Fine Gael Bill to establish the appointment of an ombudsman.  It is important that we look at the action as well as the inaction of the Government in this regard.  If they were committed to the appointment of an ombudsman, why did they not accept the Fine Gael Bill and put down amendments to it on Committee Stage if they felt amendments were necessary?  Is there some sacrosanct rule that no legislation can be put on the Statute Book except by the <Col N="328" /> present Government?  It seems clear that Standing Orders provide for the introduction of Private Members' Business and in that situation an explanation is due from the Government as to why, if they are committed to the appointment of an ombudsman in the context in which we see it they did not accept our Bill and amend it if necessary on Committee Stage?  Their inaction for two and a half years is to me the first clear indication that they have no commitment to the establishment of such an office.  Only now are they taking steps in response to the Private Members' Bill put down by Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>There are other grounds.  There was an all-party committee to which contributions were made by five representatives of Fianna Fáil three of whom are now members of this Government.  That committee came to the conclusion that it was absolutely necessary that an ombudsman if appointed should have his or her independence emphasised and his acceptability across the widest spectrum of Irish society ensured by requiring the appointment to be made by the President and to have the support of two-thirds of the Dáil and the Seanad.  Yet, in the Bill produced by the Government at the last minute&mdash;I am open to correction here, because I have had a very short time to go through it&mdash;I find that the appointment of the ombudsman is to be made on a simple majority.  Am I correct?  Is there some provision in the Bill that my necessarily hurried perusal caused me to overlook?  The Minister, by his silence I assume, accepts that this is not so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am actually referring to the all-party report and the provisions of section 3 of the Fine Gael Bill before the House which require that the ombudsman shall be appointed by the President on the nomination of each House of the Oireachtas by resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the Members present and voting.  That is the provision which an all-party committee of the House decided was necessary to ensure <Col N="329" /> the independence of the person appointed and to ensure the widest possible acceptability of his appointment to all sections of our society.  Are the Government accepting that provision or are they reneging on that report of the all-party committee to which they were a party? This is an absolutely fundamental point if there is to be any semblance of independence and if we were to discuss a Bill which did not include such a provision, one of the most fundamental aspects of the independence of an ombudsman would be lost.  On that basis I am asking the Government to think again.  I do not intend to go into the details of their Bill. The suggestion that the ombudsman should be appointed by a simple majority giving an absolute fiat to the Government of the day to appoint the ombudsman is completely contrary to the letter and spirit of the all-party report.  Therefore, I suggest that is further ground for believing that the Government do not want to have a fully independent ombudsman.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, one would expect that if an ombudsman were to be fully independent and effective he should have the widest possible powers.  That would mean that all matters which would appear to be proper for investigation should be capable of being investigated by the ombudsman. Our Bill provides that the ombudsman would have power to investigate a very wide range of activities including Departments of State, local authorities, health boards and a very considerable range of State-sponsored bodies.  This would seem to make sense to anybody interested in establishing an independent and effective ombudsman. If one were attempting to establish a person in such an office, wishing to ensure that the ombudsman did not have fully effective powers, the obvious thing to do would be to try to limit the powers. Again, it appears that the lack of commitment of the present administration to the appointment of an ombudsman is clearly indicated by the limitations imposed in its own Bill in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation, which does not apply to our Bill where we have provided for a <Col N="330" /> very wide range of activities to be capable of investigation by the ombudsman, makes it clear to me and to any independent observer that what the Government are trying to do is to establish a paper ombudsman, a paper tiger.  Why is this happening?  Last week in the Dáil the Minister for Finance referred to a reservation of the all-party committee in regard to&mdash;and I quote&mdash;</P>
    <P>certain decisions by Ministers where they were required or allowed to make value judgments should be subject to investigation, probing and censure only by the Houses of the Oireachtas themselves and should, therefore, be excluded from the ombudsman's remit.</P>
    <P>That is an extract from the all-party report.  It raises a point which should have been covered on Committee Stage by an amendment excluding the item mentioned in the all-party report.  Certainly it would be in no way covered by giving power to a Minister to exclude any and every item merely by writing a letter to the ombudsman to that effect. That indicates that the Government wish to establish an office but to exclude from investigation by the ombudsman anything which they would find embarrassing. Such a person would be appointed without the full support of this House or at least appointed only by a weighted majority.  He would be in the situation where anything could be excluded from his investigation merely on receipt by him of a letter from a Minister.  How could such a person function as a fully independent and effective ombudsman?  All of these matters make it clear that the Government do not want an ombudsman.</P>
    <P>That raises the question as to why this should be so.  Certainly on paper in the past and in public pronouncements the leaders of this administration, when in government and when in opposition, indicated their anxiety to have such an office. If we are faced with the situation whereby all matters can be excluded from investigation by an ombudsman merely on a request in writing from a <Col N="331" /> Minister of the Government, I believe we might as well not establish the office at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the point as to whether this Bill, put down by Deputy Richie Ryan of my party, will be coming to a vote.  Surely it is quite obvious that it must come to a vote.  Indeed even more so, any Member of the Government who genuinely believes in the establishment of an effective and independent ombudsman should vote for our Bill.  I am not saying that the terminology in it is perfect.  What I am saying is that the principles underlying the Bill are the ones which have been accepted by an all-party committee and are ones which I believe would answer the calls of those people here who really believe that we need such an ombudsman.</P>
    <P>If the Members of the Government march into the lobby tonight and vote against our measure and then insult the electorate of this country by proceeding with a toothless Bill providing a paper ombudsman, then they will be attempting to play the ultimate joke on the electorate; but the last joke may be on themselves. It is quite clear that the provisions in the Government Bill to which I referred make the whole exercise a joke and it calls at this stage for a serious comment and a serious reply from the Government as to their intentions on this matter.</P>
    <P>Do the Government believe that there is a need for a fully independent ombudsman here?  Do they not accept that in this present century, because of the complexities of modern legislation which has to be implemented by human beings so that there is always the danger of human error and of maladministration&mdash;and that situation applies to virtually every democracy&mdash;the problem has been resolved by establishing an offence similar to the one which we now wish to establish here and which we propose to appoint?  The name of the person varies from country to country but the general purpose remains the same.  The situation therefore is that <Col N="332" /> with the complexity of modern life it is accepted by every thinking person that there is a need for this office.  But certainly there is a need for one which will be beyond reproach; there is a need for one that will have the full weight of public support behind it; there is a need for one that will be totally independent and fully effective.  It is on that basis that we in Fine Gael presented this Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>At this stage it appears that the reaction of the Government is that they will not accept it because it is initiated by a Member of the Opposition and that they are not prepared to accept the fundamental principle of the establishment of the office of ombudsman.  As we see it on that basis they have circulated their own Bill, refusing to accept the one initiated by us.  They circulated their own shortly before the conclusion of the debate tonight.  It was obviously circulated and produced in such an unseemly rush that I see they did not even spell the word &ldquo;initiate&rdquo;, correctly on the very front page.</P>
    <P>We are facing a fundamental situation. We have had a lot of discussion over the four days during which this Bill has been debated on the role and functions of different persons and bodies to whom complaints can be made in regard to malpractice, maladministration, human error and mistakes made in the exercise of administrative justice.  It is clear that, while a role can be played by the various institutions that have been referred to in regard to many areas which need to be covered, the courts, for instance, are not the answer to the problem.  We have had a role for the courts and they fulfil a very basic function in our society, but there are difficulties in regard to expense and problems which often can be the subject of complaint are such that they are not capable of resolution through the courts system.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the role of TDs and to Members of this House carrying out their functions as what are termed messenger boys.  It is good for a <Col N="333" /> Deputy to have a function of listening to the problems of his constituents and trying to help them as best he can.  It keeps his feet on the ground and gives him a broad knowledge of the problems affecting particularly the weaker sections of his constituency.  However, the actions of a Dáil Deputy in helping to resolve these problems are, of necessity, limited.  These matters have all been considered in the past and were dealt with in great detail in the report of the all-party committee.  The unanimous opinion of that committee was that the office of ombudsman, fully and freely independent, should be established.  It referred to the existing main avenues of redress which I have touched on and to the possibility of appeals under legislation passed by this House.  The committee decided to recommend that that system of appeals should not be extended, favouring instead the establishment of an ombudsman. The clear indications in that report were that such an office should be filled by somebody of very high calibre with a personality that would leave him open to deal with human problems rather than a cynical approach which one might expect from somebody who had only a lawyer's qualifications. Above all, such a person would be acceptable <Col N="334" /> to the widest possible spectrum of the community and would have powers which could not be interfered with by anybody.</P>
    <P>On that basis this Committee reported and that report has been gathering dust during the two-and-a-half years during which this unfortunate country has been ruled by the present administration.  The suggestions made by the Minister for Finance and the Public Service of tremendous activity in the light of this report are false.  He attempted to explain away the delays but it is quite clear that those explanations were purely sham. Therefore, we have before this House a Bill which almost totally carries out the recommendations of the all-party committee. We have proposed this Bill ourselves without any assistance from the civil service, parliamentary draftsmen and so on.  It incorporates the principles required to establish a fully free and independent ombudsman.  If the Government believe that such an office should be established, they should vote for our Bill.  If they do not, they should vote it down and proceed with their toothless Bill to establish a paper ombudsman.</P>

      <P>It is for the individual sanitary authorities to formulate and submit proposals for the treatment of effluent from sewerage schemes in their areas. To assist them in the selection of the extent of the treatment works required guidelines have been prepared by the Technical Committee on Effluent and Water Quality Standards.  The guidelines take into consideration the quality and quantity of the receiving waters and indicate the extent of the treatment required to ensure that no harmful pollution of these receiving waters occurs.  It is not always necessary to provide for the elaborate treatment of the effluent. This is particularly so when the effluent is being discharged to tidal waters.  In such cases maceration or comminution <Col N="235" /> of the sewage may be provided to break up solids and assist in their dispersion.</P>
      <P>Financial assistance by way of loan and subsidy is provided for the treatment of effluent from sewerage schemes under the water and sewerage programme. Each proposal is considered in the context of the amount of capital available, the number of schemes in progress and the need to conserve capital for the schemes of the highest priority.  If we set excessively high standards and spend money on treatment works where they are not justified by local conditions, it will mean delays in providing basic facilities in other areas.</P>

      <P>The question of the provision of finance for such schemes will not arise until the sanitary authorities concerned have schemes fully planned and approved. I may mention that a scheme for Carrick-on-Shannon, involving treatment works, is nearing completion. Preliminary proposals are under consideration in my Department in respect of four village sewerage schemes on the Shannon while contract documents are under consideration in respect of two other village schemes.  These proposals must be considered in the light of the capital available for water and sewerage schemes generally, the number of such schemes in progress or getting to construction at the present time and the need to conserve capital for schemes of the highest priority.  If a scheme discharging untreated sewage were causing serious pollution I would accept that this would affect its priority.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to amend the Road Traffic Acts in so far as powers are already available for the control and regulation of traffic, including speed, weights and dimensions, and the parking of vehicles.  With regard to the relief of traffic congestion in towns, I would refer the Deputy to Chapter 7 of the Road Development Plan for the eighties, which deals with traffic management and also indicates a range of proposals for new bridges and for bypasses of towns on the national road network.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report in question. In so far as it implies that there has been a progressive disimprovement in Dublin air quality over recent years, it is completely at variance with the air monitoring results in the environmental pollution report 1978-79 prepared by the chief health inspector for Dublin Corporation. Attached is a copy of a table from that report which summarises the winter and summer averages and the mean annual levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide levels for the past six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The table shows that winter levels of smoke decreased over the six years 1973-74&mdash;1978-79 by 36 per cent and the mean annual levels for smoke by 31 per cent.  In the same period, the data for sulphur dioxide, despite some increase last year which was very much colder than the 30-year average shows an <Col N="251" /> overall decrease of 39 per cent for winter levels and 31 per cent for mean annual levels.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the press report to the effects of increased use of solid fuels as a result of the oil shortage. In fact, measurements taken during the period April to September 1979 show a reduction in both smoke and sulphur dioxide concentrations compared with the corresponding period in 1978. Results for the winter period will be examined when they become available in due course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> In regard to EEC Directives, I would like to mention that a proposal for a Directive on Health Protection Standards for Sulphur Dioxide and Suspended Particulate Matter has been discussed in the Council of Ministers on a number of occasions.  The fact that agreement has not been reached is not due to any difficulties raised by the Irish Delegation.  On the contrary, we have been making every effort during our Presidency to secure the agreement of member states and I am hopeful that these efforts will bear fruit at the next Council meeting.</P>

      <P>The National Manpower Service report a significant number of vacancies in the licensed trade at present. In the past the majority of vintners handled their own recruitment and did not have recourse to the service.  Recently, however, inquiries are being received from the trade and these inquiries suggest that the number of vacancies runs to some hundreds.</P>
      <P>Job seekers have been interviewed by the National Manpower Service and some placements have been made.  Some job seekers have informed the service, however, that they consider the work unattractive for a number of reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> I understand that the Licensed Vintners' Association are currently researching the whole area of recruitment within the trade.</P>

    <P>I can, however, assure the Deputies that it has been the practice in my Department, in the case of all educational buildings for which my Department have any financial responsibility, for plans to be approved and <Col N="254" /> moneys made available on the basis of consideration being given to the needs of the physically handicapped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will make a statement on the anticipated need for student places at first, second and third level education in the light of the census returns and if departmental estimates have been revised upwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information given in the preliminary census data does not have serious implications for the statistical data in relation to student places at first, second and third levels as already calculated.  The relevant statistics for this purpose are collected on an institutional basis, that is, from schools, colleges and so on and accordingly are not, for the most part, subject to automatic adjustment arising from the publication of the census figures.  The only statistics which would be affected directly are the age participation coefficients which are published in the annual statistical report.  A revision of these ratios will need to await the publication by the Central Statistics Office of the estimates of population classified by age.</P>
      <P>I may add that a review of the anticipated need for student places at the different levels of education will be contained in the White Paper which is in course of preparation in my Department.</P>
