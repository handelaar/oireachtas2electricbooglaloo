      <P>I can tell the Deputy that after the sentence had been imposed originally, and during the course of the hearing of the appeal, representations were made through ordinary diplomatic channels.  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Foreign Affairs was in Brussels yesterday.  I have arranged to discuss the matter with him this morning. I consider it appropriate that we should do what the Deputy has suggested.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is an amendment to the 1921 Act, an old statute passed during the reign of the late George V.  It is not a very long statute&mdash;indeed this Bill is nearly as long.  Did the Minister and his advisers give any thought to producing a totally fresh Bill, not merely a piece of legislation <Col N="527" /> amending the 1921 Act?  That would seem to me to have been more satisfactory, that 50 years later we should have a totally Irish statute rather than an amendment of a UK Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration was given to what the Deputy has suggested, but to have done what he has suggested would have entailed a much longer delay in bringing this legislation to the Dáil.  The Deputy will be aware that in introducing new legislation all Government Departments must be consulted to get their observations, and no matter how much goodwill one would get from the other Departments, it is a fairly slow process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I was not aware of the mechanics involved, but I still suggest that we should have a new Irish statute rather than an amendment of an English one.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I endorse Deputy O'Keeffe's point that it would be more satisfactory to have a complete new statute to deal with the present situation. Indeed the introduction of this Bill at this time is a classical example of never do today what you can put off until tomorrow. In 1970 it was obvious that the 1921 Act had broken down, and an attempt to amend it at that time fell foul of the Supreme Court.  It has taken eight years and the Bantry Bay disaster to get this Bill into the House.  I appreciate the present Government were not in office all that time but I suggest Dáil Éireann should take note of the dereliction of duty on somebody's part in not moving after 1970 when the thing was fresh, when everybody had very striking warning that the machinery for inquiries like this was inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I do not intend to embark on one, but it is unsatisfactory that we should be amending general laws in this way.  The House and indeed the country <Col N="528" /> take this Bill to be in the context of the Bantry Bay disaster only, and I think that is unsatisfactory.  It is not a good way to amend the general law.  We should not be dealing with the Bantry Bay disaster only, but the general law relating to tribunals of inquiry.  If anyone were to attempt to drag this out&mdash;I do not intend to do so&mdash;the Minister would reply, in effect: &ldquo;Hit me now with the child in my arms.  You are holding up the inquiry.&rdquo;  I do not think I would be discharging my duty if I did not say this is not the way to change the general law. That should have been done years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the fault is as much, if not more, the Deputy's as it is mine if we could each represent this Government and the last one.  Of course what the Deputy speaks of is desirable but it is not always feasible.  He knows very well from his experience in Government that there are not always staff standing by for the purpose of updating legislation at all times.  Unfortunately, the resources for such activity are not available.  But the Deputy knows also that if an Act is found to be unworkable it is made workable in as short a time as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Although, like any other Bill, this Bill is a general measure, it was drafted mainly as a result of the Bantry disaster, a disaster that nobody could have foreseen.  The Minister has assured the House that this Bill is closing the loopholes that were to be found in the 1921 and 1970 Acts.  We are taking that assurance at its face value but I am satisfied to accept it in the knowledge that the Minister has had the advice of the Attorney General and of others on the matter.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters on this section on which I should like to hear the Minister.  The section provides that the tribunal may consist of one person or of more than one person.  This gives rise to the thought that the tribunal may consist of two members or of three members and it raises the question of decisions, majority or otherwise.  I presume what would be in mind in the event of there being more than one member is that there should be an uneven number, possibly three, but that is not spelled out in the Bill.  It would seem to be a desirable situation.  Should we not write into the Bill a provision for a majority decision to apply in the event of a tribunal consisting of three people not reaching unanimous agreement?  What concerns me is whether a point could be raised later in court to the effect that the decision of the tribunal would need to be unanimous.  In the Supreme Court decision in the Haughey case in 1971 which, as the Minister will be aware, related to a similar type of Bill, Mr. Haughey had as one of his grounds an objection to the certificate of the Committee of Public Accounts on the basis that it should have been made by way of the unanimous decision of all members of the committee.  This situation was referred to by the late President, Mr. Ó Dálaigh, at page 260 of the <i>Irish Reports</i>, 1971.  In fairness I should say that the then Chief Justice held that a majority decision suf-ficed at common law but we are not merely dealing here with a common law situation.  We are dealing with a tribunal that is being set up under statute and I am wondering whether the Minister and his advisers have considered the <Col N="530" /> desirability of making it clear in the Bill that in the event of the tribunal consisting of more than one member, a majority decision would suffice with, possibly, the casting vote of the chairman in the event of there being an even number of people on the tribunal.</P>
      <P>The other point on this section is the position of the assessor.  The section provides that the tribunal may consist of one or more persons with or without an assessor or assessors.  The section does not deal further with the position of the assessor except in the negative fashion of specifying that he shall not be a member of the tribunal.  Has any thought been given to clarifying in a more cogent way the position of the assessor by defining his position and his functions, whether, for instance, he is entitled to participate in the hearing other than in an advisory capacity?  I could envisage a situation in which some complex and technical evidence would be given during an inquiry when it might be of assistance to have an assessor question a witness on such evidence.  What is envisaged in respect of the assessor?  Would it have been wiser to spell out his position in more detail?  As the Minister will undoubtedly have considered this situation, he will be able to supply the answers to these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is clear regarding the composition of the tribunal in stating that the tribunal may consist of one member only or of more than one member.  The Principal Act was silent on this point and there was a doubt as to whether it authorised a one-man tribunal.  This section provides for the appointment also of one or more assessors. This is a point also on which the Principal Act was silent.</P>
      <P>The function of the assessors is to consult with and advise the tribunal. Their role could be of great value in relation to an inquiry or to evidence of a technical nature.  The section provides that the assessors shall not be members of the tribunal.  Therefore, they would not be involved with the tribunal in their findings.  There is analogous procedure in the High Court whereby a judge of that court can appoint an assessor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the assessor be entitled to cross-examine a witness or participate in the actual proceedings by way of questioning witnesses and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be entirely a matter for the tribunal.  If they thought it necessary they could ask the assessor to make inquiries or carry out any cross-examination.  His function is to help the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a danger that the assessor would be in a quasi-judicial position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No. His function is to help and advise the tribunal.  The tribunal would lay down its own procedures in this matter.  I am satisfied it is not appropriate to spell out the procedures, it is left to the tribunal to decide how best the assessors can help them to do the job they have to do.  It is not always necessary to spell out that a majority decision is necessary.  It has always been the practice that the majority decision is what comes up.  The Deputy will appreciate that only one report is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the tribunal president have the right to determine whether the assessors will have the right to ask questions?  I assume that the assessors would have special qualifications to deal with the subject matter of any inquiry that may arise.  In the same way, I assume that the assessors in the pending inquiry in Bantry will be suitably qualified and, that being the case, one would assume they would have the right to ask technical questions of witnesses. Their knowledge in that field would surely supersede the knowledge of the presiding judge or chairman.  The point is whether they must give their advice to a member of the tribunal and let him ask the questions or whether they may have the right to ask the questions directly themselves.  It would be highly desirable that the assessors, by virtue of their qualifications, should have the right to question witnesses directly even though they have no say in the final report of the inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I must confess I have not seen the original 1921 Act.  I assumed that there was something in that Act about assessors but there is nothing in it concerning assessors at all.  It appears to me that section 2 is pretty loose and it just deals with assessors as if everybody should know all about them and as if the law in regard to assessors was already laid down.  Perhaps assessors are defined in some other Act but if not then section 2 is inadequate and assessors need to be defined.  Their duties and rights would need to be spelled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The rules of the Superior Courts take the same line as is taken in this Bill.  They state that the judge may appoint assessors in any admiralty action either at the instance of any party or in case he shall deem it requisite for the due administration of justice.  Order 36, Rule 40 states that trials with assessors shall take place in such manner and upon such terms as the court shall direct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Section 4 of this Bill would probably come to the assistance of the tribunal.  It states that the tribunal may make such orders as it considers necessary for the purposes of its functions and it shall have in relation to their making all such powers as a judge of the High Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has put his finger on the situation.  It appears to me that the assessor is introduced into the tribunal procedure for the first time. It seems to have been left somewhat afloat.  I am not an expert in parliamentary draftsmanship but I would have thought that he should have been covered by some definition and that the <Col N="533" /> scope, role and functions of the assessor should have been spelt out either directly or by implication.  Here there seems to be some suggestion that, because a High Court judge can appoint an assessor, the same rules and regulations, role and functions in regard to the assessor will apply in the tribunal as apply in the High Court.  If the Minister is satisfied that that is the situation I am happy about it.</P>

    <P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a couple of points on this section and no doubt Deputy Fitzpatrick who raised some points on it yesterday will also have a few queries to raise.  It seems to me that the section, as now drafted, covers in general the points raised in the <Col N="535" /> Supreme Court in the 1971 case.  The 1970 Act merely referred to a refusal amounting to a contempt of court.  In this section doing any of these things amounts to an offence and a person is liable to be charged with that offence in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>I wonder why the Minister did not consider applying more serious penalties.  I could envisage a situation where it might be considered by somebody who was called before a tribunal to be worth while to chance the possibility of 12 months in jail or a fine of £500 by refusing to give evidence or produce documents or things.  The matter could be of a very serious nature.  I wonder whether the penalties are too light for failure to comply with the directions of the tribunal by not obeying the summons to attend, or refusing to take the oath, or refusing to give evidence or answer questions.</P>
      <P>We cannot say this would not happen. It did happen under the 1970 Act.  A witness appeared before the committee set up under that Act.  He read a statement and in effect he refused thereafter to answer any questions put to him by the committee.  That witness was prepared to take the chance of being hauled up before the court, which he duly was.  It transpired subsequently&mdash;&mdash; possibly he was advised in this regard&mdash;that the powers of the Act were ineffective.</P>
      <P>Here we have a procedure which will probably stand up, but are the penalties too light?  Huge sums of money could be involved in the discussions before the tribunal.  I do not in any way want to prejudge what will happen at the Bantry tribunal but a figure of £30 million has been mentioned as being possibly at issue in deciding the body or bodies responsible.  In that context, does the offence which is now created by this Bill carry heavy enough penalties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that in regard to an offence which is chargeable on summary conviction we are limited as to penalties.  Two question arise here.  One is whether he is satisfied that these penalties will stand up on summary conviction. Deputy Fitzpatrick raised this <Col N="536" /> point yesterday and no doubt will be developing it.  The second point is the one I want to develop myself.  In many similar types of Bills where it is desired to have a heavier penalty it is not possible to have the Bill drafted on the basis of the offence being triable before the District Court only, but there is an alternative. Very often the alternative is that a person guilty of such an offence is triable on indictment before the superior court where much heavier penalties can be imposed.</P>
    <P>Would it have been wiser in this Bill when the offence is created to provide that the penalty could be decided on summary conviction with the fine and imprisonment mentioned here or, at the discretion of the DPP if he felt the matter was serious enough, the accused could be tried on indictment before the superior court and face there a much heavier penalty?  I have some recollection that this point came up with regard to the penalties which could be imposed for oil pollution.  Perhaps it is by chance that this aspect comes into my mind, but I recollect in defending oil pollution charges years ago that a very derisory penalty was possible because the matter could be dealt with only in the District Court and £500 was the maximum fine. Changes were made.  If I remember correctly the alternative I am suggesting was included and it was made possible in serious oil pollution charges to have the defendant brought before a superior court and faced with much heavier penalties.  I hope the Minister sees the point I am making.  It would strengthen the Bill considerably if an addition of that order were made.</P>

      <P>How does this section relate to non-nationals, to witnesses from outside the country?  Is section 3 binding on our own citizens only?  At any tribunal, and particularly the one which is pending, witnesses from foreign countries may be called to give evidence.  If, for instance, a person from France or Spain or any other country is called to give evidence and actually attends the inquiry but refuses to answer questions, or otherwise hinders the hearing in the opinion of the tribunal, what punishment, if any, can be meted out to <Col N="537" /> such a person having regard to the fact that he is not a citizen of our State and may say the laws made in this House do not bind him?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The point I want to make is different.  At first sight it may appear to be in conflict with the view taken by Deputy O'Keeffe, but it is not.  Deputy O'Keeffe's trouble is that the penalties are not severe enough.  Indeed, a very good case could be made for that view when we are dealing, as he said, with damage involving millions of pounds and, more serious and important, the loss of human lives.</P>
      <P>I know why the penalties are kept at that level.  The Establishment are always afraid of juries.  They believe that, if they bring somebody before a judge and jury for contempt of court, their chances of getting a conviction are not as good as they are on summary trial.  An excellent case can be made for the point put forward by Deputy O'Keeffe but, if you up the penalties, you get outside the realm of doubt and you must go before a judge and jury on indictment.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I suggested to the Minister that, because a penalty of 12 months imprisonment is provided in this section, the offence created by the section will cease to be a minor offence fit to be tried summarily under Article 38 of the Constitution. In reply, the Minister told me that for the last 30 years sentences of 12 months imprisonment were provided in various Acts and imposed by district justices and that they had never been queried.  I must say I was somewhat surprised to hear that sentences of 12 months were provided so frequently for summary offences.  My recollection is that the 12 month sentence in the District Court was a comparatively recent thing.  When one talks about a thing being comparatively recent, it depends on one's age and how far one can look back.  I wonder is it imposed in defended cases or is it imposed in cases where the accused consented to the jurisdiction of the District Court and pleaded guilty?</P>

      <P>Article 3 of the Consitution provides, subject to certain exceptions, that no person may be tried on <Col N="538" /> any criminal charge without a jury.  One of the exceptions states that minor offences may be tried by courts of summary jurisdiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I meant Article 38.  The Supreme Court has decided that the most important factor in determining what is minor is the punishment which the offence may attract.  It is stated in several cases that a penalty of six months imprisonment does not take an offence out of the category of minor.  It has never pronounced expressly on the question of 12 months.  Numerous statutes passed since the foundation of the State have empowered District Courts to impose sentences of up to 12 months imprisonment.  These powers are frequently availed of and have never been challenged.  Examples of these powers&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  Examples of these powers are found in sections 2 and 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1951, under which in certain circumstances indictable offences can be dealt with by the District Court and are subject to a penalty of 12 months imprisonment, in section 4 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972, in sections 5(4), 6(2), 7(2), 10(4) and 12 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, and in section 27 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Conroy v. the Attorney General, page 411, 1965 <i>Irish Reports</i>, the Supreme Court approved of a provision in section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, whereby a District Court was <Col N="539" /> empowered to impose a penalty on conviction for drunken driving of up to six months imprisonment, a fine of up to £100 and a disqualification from holding a driving licence, and recognised that upon failure to pay a fine a District Court could impose a sentence of a further term of six months imprisonment. Though there is no decision of the Supreme Court in the matter of a summary penalty of 12 months imprisonment for an offence, it has approved of provisions under which a District Court may sentence a person to imprisonment for terms totalling 12 months.</P>
    <P>In the case of Melling v. O Mathghamhna, page 1, 1962 <i>Irish Reports</i>, the Supreme Court accepted that summary penalties of up to nine months imprisonment did not exclude certain customs offences from the category of minor.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy O'Keeffe, that is, the severity of the sentences, the penalty of imprisonment is considered to be a sufficient deterrent for the type of offence envisaged by the section.  The procedure on indictment is more protracted.  We are satisfied that the penalties are sufficiently severe.</P>

      <P>Would it not be possible to have a heavier penalty?  Appreciating the problems of cumbersome procedures in criminal trials, if the matter were not so serious the State could issue a summons and have the person brought before a District Court.  If the matter were serious the State could involve the more cumbersome procedure of the criminal courts.  I appreciate that even on a minor charge brought before a local court an accused would probably have the option of a trial by judge and jury.  I am concerned that we do not have a situation arising under this Act which arose under the Oil Pollution Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the falling value of money particularly, a fine of £500 is not very great in the context of the stake that might be before such tribunal.  As the years go by it may be regarded as purely nominal and I would even say that at this stage if anything serious were involved it could be very nominal.  We did have that situation in regard to oil pollution and we had to face it by way of amending legislation&mdash;perhaps Deputy Fitzpatrick was responsible for bringing in the amending legislation&mdash;where oil pollution cases were brought before the local court and these derisory penalties were inflicted.  You could have a situation where it might be necessary to prosecute companies and under the Interpretation Act, I imagine a person includes a company. <Col N="541" /> The company might refuse to produce documents or things.  You cannot put a company in jail.  If that company were directed by the tribunal to produce what they regarded as highly sensitive documents or highly incriminating documents and if the company failed to produce them they would be guilty of an offence.  They would consult their lawyers and would be told that they could be fined £500.  In that situation I do not think the fine they would have to pay would be the slightest indocument to them to comply with the order of the tribunal if for their own reasons they decided otherwise.  From my own experience I found as a lawyer that the laws in some cases were, I shall not say virtually ignored, but certainly could not be heavily enforced because of such minor penalties.  Are we walking into the same trap here?  I believe there should be an alternative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It might be taken from what the Minister said that I agreed that the penalties provided here are adequate. That is not my line.  The penalties could be regarded as totally inadequate and a good case can be made for that view.  I also realise that offences carrying higher penalties could not be tried in the District Court.  Most Bills passed through this House create summary offences and indictable offences and in many Bills that I have seen going through here and in Acts that I have read there is a provision something like this: &ldquo;A person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of £500&rdquo;&mdash;and I think there should be six months imprisonment just to be certain&mdash;&ldquo;or on conviction on indictment to a fine of up to £10,000,&rdquo; or perhaps £50,000 as should be here, &ldquo;or five years imprisonment.&rdquo; There are innumerable precedents for that sort of thing in Acts of Parliament.  I do not know why it was left out here.  I agree entirely with the point made by Deputy O'Keeffe that £500 to some of the people or institutions or companies that could be involved in this would be like the price of a box of matches and would not concern them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I think this legislation should provide for an indictable offence also with extreme monetary penalties. I do not think the Minister need have the same fear of juries in a case like this as he might have in a smuggling case, for instance.  There will be I think a far better chance of getting a conviction here.</P>
      <P>Another point was raised about the position of people abroad, foreigners.  It appears that it could happen that a company registered and based here might have indirectly in its control abroad, outside the jurisdiction, information which could be brought here through witnesses who are not resident here and ordinarily might not be under the jurisdiction of our courts.  Could we in this Bill impose an obligation on a company registered here to furnish such information and evidence as is under its control whether it is based abroad or not?  If that is possible this is the very type of Bill in which that provision should be made.</P>
      <P>My original point was that I think there is doubt&mdash;I shall put it no stronger&mdash;as to whether an offence which carries 12 months imprisonment remains a minor offence.  The Minister has had some research done and has told me that the Supreme Court has ruled that a sentence of six months imprinsonment does not exclude an offence from the summary category but that it has not gone farther than that.  We know that the Supreme Court will decide in a case before it what it is necessary to decide in that case but will not speculate as to what it might do if it were seven months, eight months or nine months.  In these days when sentences tend to be low it might well be that the Supreme Court would hold that 12 months' imprisonment removes an offence from the minor category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should give serious consideration to three things: one is in addition <Col N="543" /> to the summary offence created here, the creation of an indictable offence which would carry much heavier penalties.  As Deputy O'Keeffe said, if we get the principle we can go on from there.  Secondly, consideration should be given to placing an obligation on a company based here to furnish information under its control from abroad or elsewhere.  Thirdly, so that we may be sure that the summary offence will not cease to be a summary offence the prison sentence in that case should be reduced to six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the statement by Deputy O'Keeffe that you cannot put a company in jail if it refuses to co-operate or provide documentation, I think the answer is that the company is represented at the tribunal by a witness and if the witness were to say that he is not furnishing the evidence which the tribunal requests him to provide, would not the terms of section 3 apply to him? So also they would apply to the managing director or to other senior executives of the company who could also be called. We could end up by having all the directors under lock and key.  Does this section not provide for that kind of happening? They cannot answer questions themselves, they must answer them through some representative, and the representative would be liable for penalties which the section carries.  So would other witnesses from that type of company who would be asked to appear and similar sentences could be imposed on them, because the section does not limit the number of people who can be punished at any tribunal hearing.</P>

I recognise and appreciate fully the views put forward by the Deputies as to whether the penalties are sufficient.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers of tribunals to make orders are confined to the making of such orders as they consider necessary for the purposes of their functions.  This is restricted accordingly. They are given the powers, rights and privileges that are vested in the High Court in relation to the making of orders.  These are the only orders tribunals have the power to make.  Administration of justice involves the determination of issues arising between parties in civil matters and the determination of guilt or innocence in criminal matters and the enforcement, where appropriate, of such determinations. Tribunals have no powers whatsoever to determine issues, whether civil or criminal, and of course no powers of enforcement. The functions of tribunals are to inquire into definite matters and to <Col N="545" /> find facts.  Therefore, exercise by tribunals of powers under section 4 of the Bill to make orders does not amount to the administration of justice.  Even if it does, it is clearly of such a limited nature as to be within the scope of Article 37 of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I observe that under the Bill statements or admissions made before the tribunal shall not be admissible as evidence against the person making them in any criminal proceedings. What is the position in regard to civil proceedings?  If somebody makes a statement which amounts to an admission of liability before a tribunal are we in a situation that such a statement can be admitted before a civil court?  If that is the situation, will that be a restraining influence on somebody before the tribunal?  Will that person be entitled to plead privilege in that situation?  A point was raised in the Haughey case that statements which reflected on him were being made before the committee and that the statement which he would make to the committee could be used against him.  This was all thrashed out in the Supreme Court in 1971.  I imagine that this section goes into the Bill arising out of that decision, but why is it confined to criminal proceedings?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to section 5, the principal Act has no corresponding provision and it is thought that at an inquiry under that Act a witness need not give evidence that tends to implicate him in a criminal offence and that the tribunal should inform him on his right to remain silent.  That situation obviously could hinder a tribunal seriously in their task of finding all the relevant facts.  This section removes the possibility of such a hindrance.  It provides that a statement or admission made by a person before a tribunal or when being examined in pursuance of a commission or request, for the taking of evidence abroad, shall not be admissible <Col N="546" /> in evidence against the person in any criminal proceedings other than proceedings under the principal Act for giving false evidence to a tribunal. Therefore, a witness before a tribunal cannot lawfully withhold evidence from them.  The concluding words of the section:</P>
      <P>... of that section) and subsection (3) of that section shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
      <P>ensure that section 1 (3) of the principal Act, which confers on a witness before a tribunal the same privileges as a witness before the High Court, will not be construed as enabling a witness before a tribunal to claim High Court privilege in relation to incriminating evidence.  The words remove any possibility of a conflict between the two sections.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about protection in regard to a civil claim.  The Minister makes the point that if he did not have immunity he might not be co-operative. I appreciate that the Minister has given that immunity in regard to criminal proceedings, but if this witness is not concerned about his criminal position but about maybe huge claims being made against him or possibly against his employer or company, will that witness have immunity in regard to such civil claims arising out of statements he will make to the tribunal?  If he has not, is there not a danger, as the Minister pointed out, that he might not be anxious to co-operate?  The Minister has covered the position in regard to immunity in criminal proceedings.  Why is not a similar immunity provided in relation to civil proceedings?</P>

      <P>I am interested in the points made.  Section 5 goes far enough.  A witness has immunity so far as criminal proceedings are concerned. Surely it should not be by any act of this House that we will give him immunity so far as civil proceedings are concerned. There is personal immunity so far as criminal proceedings are concerned but so far as civil proceedings are concerned I do not think the evidence given should carry immunity.  It should be a matter for future courts to recall the witness or to make him answer in other courts with regard to civil proceedings.  Civil immunity should not be given.</P>

      <P>The Minister accepts that the fact that he is providing immunity from criminal proceedings will encourage witnesses to be more free and co-operative before the tribunal.  My only point in regard to raising civil proceedings is not that anybody can get total immunity from any civil claim against him but that in the same way as the co-operation which is encouraged by giving immunity from criminal proceedings would be given by extending it to civil proceedings.  I am not talking of immunity from a claim being made against a person but immunity from the statements made before the tribunal being used later in an incriminating fashion against him.  That is the only point and I do not wish to press it beyond that.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Section 6 provides that the tribunal or the chairman of the tribunal if he thinks it equitable to do so, and having considered all relevant matters, may award costs to a party before the tribunal and to order that the party should pay the costs of another.  I am fearful that that is unconstitutional because Article 34 of the Constitution states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1. Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges <Col N="549" /> appointed in the manner provided by the Constitution, and, save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law, shall be administered in public.</P>
    <P>I do not think there can be any real doubt but that the chairman of the tribunal or the tribunal in coming to a decision whether it is right and equitable to award costs is administering justice.  I do not think there can be any real doubt about that.  When I raised this matter yesterday on Second Stage the Minister relied on Article 37 of the Constitution which I admit I did not refer to.  Article 37 provides:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Constitution shall operate to invalidate the exercise of limited functions and powers of a judicial nature, in matters other than criminal matters, by any person or body of persons duly authorised by law to exercise such functions and powers, notwithstanding that such person or such body of persons is not a judge or a court appointed or established as such under this Constitution.</P>
    <P>I concede that this is something that must be taken into consideration but in my opinion the all-important word there is &ldquo;limited&rdquo;.  Does it mean limited in the number of occasions that the person is to exercise these judicial functions, or does it mean limited in the account or the value of the thing involved?  Obviously this inquiry will last a long time and witnesses will be brought from all over the world.  I could see the cost in respect of one set of people running into hundreds of thousands of pounds.  Can it reasonably be said that that is a limited exercise or a limited administration of justice?  I do not think it can.  I think a valid and learned argument could be put forward by saying that &ldquo;limited&rdquo; means only limited in value and trivial or minor. I admit that the word &ldquo;minor&rdquo; is not used there whereas it is used in regard to offences on the criminal side but I think there is a real danger that section 6 would not stand up to the constitutional test that justice must be administered by judges appointed under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that that <Col N="550" /> would not be the end of the tribunal.  It would only be hard luck on the poor man who was awarded costs.  If the Minister for Justice was ordered to pay, then I suppose he would be the only person who would question them. However, it does not end there because the section states:</P>
    <P>may by order direct that the whole or part of the costs of any person appearing before the tribunal by counsel or solicitor, as taxed by a Taxing Master of the High Court, shall be paid to the person by any other person. ... </P>
    <P>That is where we get into trouble.  I could see that some person could get a substantial award for costs against a big corporation or some wealthy person before this tribunal and that that other person or party would come into court and say he was not liable to pay the costs because they were ordered to be paid by a person purporting to exercise judicial functions and who was not a judge.  The person who was awarded the costs might never be able to collect them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 contains a new provision, as the House is aware. Under the Principal Act the tribunal did not have power to award costs and this was seen as being a very serious defect. The new section gives a tribunal or the chairman of a tribunal, if the tribunal has more than one member, full power to order that the whole or part of the costs of any person appearing before the tribunal by counsel or solicitor as taxed by a Taxing Master of the High Court shall be paid to the person by any other person named in the order including the Minister for Finance if the tribunal is of opinion, having regard to its findings and all other relevant matters, that there are sufficient reasons rendering it equitable to do so.  An order in relation to costs does not involve the determination of a dispute between parties and is therefore not an administration of justice.  The Chairman of a tribunal in making such an order is bound to act judicially and constitutionally but this does not make the function an administration of justice.  Even if it were <Col N="551" /> considered to be an administration of justice it would be saved by Article 37 of the Constitution which provides for the exercise of limited functions and powers of a judicial nature in matters other than criminal matters by persons or bodies other than courts and judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I do not accept the Minister's contention that the Chairman of the tribunal in deciding whether one of several parties before it should pay the cost of another party, would not be administering justice.  The tribunal is not administering justice when inquiring into how something happened but when it comes to the question of awarding costs the tribunal is really deciding who is at fault, who behaved well before the tribunal, who prolonged the inquiries and so on, it is deciding who is entitled to be indemnified in respect of his costs by another person.  If that is not the administration of justice, I do not know what it is.  It is the virtual determination of who has made the inquiry necessary and who has behaved reasonably before the inquiry.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that because the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; is there Article 37 would not invalidate the determination under Section 6 which would otherwise be unconstitutional. Is there any way in which it can be written into the Bill that the judge for the purposes of this tribunal would be acting as a judge of the High Court and not as a chairman of a tribunal. Something like that might save the matter. It should be given some thought because the thing is not watertight as it is.  In most cases the State would pay costs but here there is a real possibility, because a number of wealthy people are involved, that a person or corporation could be ordered to pay the costs of another, and he might escape under this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated earlier that the function of the tribunal is to ascertain the facts and report them to the Government and that it has no other functions.  If that is so how could section 6 give the right to the chairman or to the tribunal to ask one party to pay the costs of another?  By <Col N="552" /> saying that A must pay B's costs the tribunal is finding A wrong and B correct and that is making a decision.  One does not need a legal qualification to see that.  Section 6, whether we like it or not, is giving the tribunal power to make a decision and is extending the tribunal's fact-finding role into making decisions. The tribunal can make an assessment as to who is right or wrong.  Having analysed the facts and made the necessary assessments the tribunal can ask one party to pay the costs of another. The tribunal will have a dual role, to report the facts to the Government, and to make a decision in this case.  It is reasonable to assume that whichever party is asked to pay the costs of another is, in the opinion of the tribunal, the guilty party.  By finding a party guilty one is making a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will comment briefly on three points on this section and on the point raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  The first subsection of section 6 is not drafted as well as it might be.  The usual formula in such matters where power to award costs is conferred expresses that power as being to award costs to some person appearing or represented against another person appearing or being represented.  This subsection as drawn does not contain that qualification in the case of the victim of the order for costs. As the section stands it might be some person to whom it comes as a complete surprise that his behaviour is before the tribunal at all.  I know that is not the intention and I have no reason to suppose that anyone would interpret the section like that, but that is how the section looks as it stands.  There is a rule of construction now which the courts apply whereby when a power is conferred on somebody by a statute, they read the power as tacitly containing the condition that it must be exercised in a constitutional manner so that the High Court or the Supreme Court would interpret this power as requiring that tribunal not to make an order for costs against a person who has not been present, who has not had an opportunity of explaining his conduct or making representations about his part in the affair, so as to render it therefore possibly <Col N="553" /> an arbitrary act on the part of the tribunal if they were to make an order for costs against him.  If I am right about this, this is only a drafting point and it can be improved by amending line 30 to read &ldquo;any other such person&rdquo;, in other words a person appearing before the tribunal by counsel or solicitor or by any other person appearing or represented.</P>
      <P>The second and third points both arise on the point raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick. One is that this very point illustrates as indeed the next Bill to come before the House will illustrate the extremely unsatisfactory nature of Article 37.  It was an innovation in the 1937 Constitution.  I expect to give a history of it when the next Bill comes up for discussion. Nobody knows what a limited power or function is.  It is true that the boundaries of the functions we are talking about were equally hard to define under the old Constitution but this Article has only made the confusion worse because it has created what appears to be a third category, for which there is no need, where formerly there were only two.  I believe there is precedent in other statutes, although that in itself would not cure the matter, for Ministers having power to award costs.  One instance is the Ministerial function in deciding disputes on insurance policies.  There is precedent there for that power being conferred, rightly or wrongly, but I believe Deputy Fitzpatrick has a powerful point.</P>
      <P>It is quite arguable that if a hefty order for costs is made for several thousand pounds that could plausibly be represented as the exercise of a function which, if it is a judicial function&mdash;I could not be certain about that; that is another of the uncertainties which Article 37 has made worse&mdash;it could be argued, as Deputy Fitzpatrick did, that it is not limited and that, therefore, it should not be made by somebody who is not a judge or by an authority which is not a court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My final point arises also from the unsatisfactory nature of Article 37 which I believe should be scrapped instead of being tinkered with in the way the next Bill before the House proposes.  The unreality of it can be seen in this matter. <Col N="554" /> Deputy Fitzpatrick made the point&mdash; and he is absolutely correct&mdash;that this Tribunal of Inquiry is not a court: although it is presided over by a judge, it is still not a court in the sense of Article 34.  This difficulty could arise on it.  Of course, the same tribunal could sit with Mr. Justice Costello wearing the same clothes in the same hall in Bantry, or the centre chosen, and do exactly the same job; but if we had legislation which conferred upon the High Court a special inquisitorial or inquisitional function in matters like that as an aspect of the High Court's own jurisdiction&mdash;it could be the Circuit Court; I do not mind which&mdash;this difficulty would disappear.</P>
    <P>The Constitution permits, under Article 36, the Legislature freely to create, change and chop jurisdictions in the various courts, with some exceptions. For example, the Legislature cannot interfere, obviously, with jurisdictions which the Constitution confers, particularly the constitutional jurisdiction to adjudicate on the validity of Acts but, short of that&mdash;may be in one or two other exceptions also&mdash;the Legislature can confer whatever jurisdiction it wishes on the courts.  There is nothing to stop this House and the Seanad from conferring on the High Court a special inquisitorial jurisdiction which would absorb or subsume or replace the function of the Tribunal of Inquiry we are dealing with here.  In that event Mr. Justice Costello could sit on the same bench, have the same assessors and do exactly the same job, and this difficulty would not arise.  In doing that job he would be acting as a judge of High Court in the High Court, even if he was sitting in Bantry.  The latter two points illustrate the unsatisfactory and troublesome nature of Article 37 and provide a fitting preview for what I will have to say on the next Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Kelly for his contribution, which is probably the best way of replying to what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question raised by Deputy Murphy in relation to costs.  The position is that the 1921 Act, the principal Act, did not have power to award costs and that was seen as a <Col N="555" /> serious defect.  We could have a situation whereby a wealthy party could spin out the proceedings for weeks, months or years and the ordinary person would not be able to afford to pay counsel or a solicitor.  That is why I am trying to help the ordinary person.  The tribunal can say, if the wealthy party is spinning things out unnecessarily, that he must pay the costs and the Taxing Master will determine the amount.  That is the purpose of the section.  With regard to the scope of the possible order for the costs, the Supreme Court has held that there is a presumption that discretion or power conferred by post-1937 Acts, such as this Bill, will be exercised by those upon whom power is conferred within the scope of the Constitution.  If there is, as Deputy Kelly said, scope for improvement on the drafting of the Bill, I am prepared to have a look at it and, if it can be improved, we will do so in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I accept, as the Minister stated, that he will look at the section again in the light of the excellent points made by my colleagues in Fine Gael and by Deputy Murphy, but he may be on a wrong tangent in regard to the question of a possible spinning out of the tribunal.  The section clearly states that the tribunal can make this order having regard to the findings of the tribunal.  That was the point excellently put by Deputy Murphy.  I agree that the words &ldquo;of all other relevant matters&rdquo; are included, but it clearly states &ldquo;having regard to the findings of the tribunal&rdquo;. We all agree that the tribunal should have this power.  We are concerned as to the constitutionality of the power and to ensure as far as possible that it will stand up.  If this power is exercised the figures involved could be very big and it might be worthwhile for lawyers representing individuals or a corporation to make a constitutional issue of it.  I hope the Minister will look into those points carefully to see if the difficulties mentioned can be overcome.</P>

      <P>Go léifear an Bille an Dara hUair.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for a constitutional amendment which would ensure that adoption orders made by the Adoption Board cannot be declared to be invalid on the grounds that they were not made by a court.  If the Bill is passed the issue will be put to the people by referendum.  I am sure that I am expressing the view of the entire House when I say that it is my sincere hope that the people will approve of the proposal and that I have every confidence that they will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a straightforward measure which will, I hope, receive general approval. I think that technically it is a better provision than the similar one in the Private Members' Bill which was defeated here on 25 October.  Later on, I propose to explain why the Government have decided to confine the Bill to this single issue but I must first of all indicate <Col N="557" /> why a Bill to amend the Constitution on the lines of the present one is thought to be necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>In 1976, in McL. v. An Bord Uchtála and the Attorney General, the Supreme Court declared that a particular adoption order was invalid.  They did so on the basis that there had been defects in the processing of the case and the court did not have to decide whether there was any basic constitutional defect in the Adoption Acts by reason of the fact that those Acts provide that adoption orders are to be made by a body which is not a court.  The processing defects revealed by the Supreme Court's decision drew attention, in turn, to procedural difficulties which the Acts themselves gave rise to, but those difficulties were dealt with by a number of provisions in the Adoption Act, 1976.  Accordingly, the present Bill does not arise from anything that was decided by the Supreme Court in that case.  Nevertheless, the case has a bearing on the introduction of the Bill because ever since the Supreme Court judgment there appears to be no doubt that the opinion has been held in legal circles that if the court had had to deal in that case with the constitutional position they might have considered themselves obliged to find that, in making adoption orders, the Adoption Board were purporting to exercise powers of a kind that the Constitution reserves to the courts. The Government accept that there were grounds for fearing that that might have been the outcome.</P>
    <P>I am not of course saying that, if the issue were now to be raised before the Supreme Court, the court would necessarily rule against the validity of the present system.  On the contrary, I am advised and believe that a strong argument could be put to the court in favour of validity.  That view is strengthened by observations made by Mr. Justice Walsh in giving judgment in the Supreme Court in the case of G.v. An Bord Uchtála as recently as 19 December last.  The case did not raise an issue as to the validity of the adoption system but in the course of his judgment Mr. Justice Walsh considered the essential character of adoption in relation to family rights and duties and stressed that he was, I quote, &ldquo;not to be taken as in any way impugning <Col N="558" /> the validity of statutory provisions allowing for legal adoption&rdquo;.  A little later in his judgement Mr. Justice Walsh, after mentioning that there were &ldquo;instances where the Board ... is bound to act judicially,&rdquo; pointed out that it was well established that &ldquo;the obligation to act judicially does not mean that the body or the person or persons so bound are thereby deemed to be exercising a judicial function or powers of a judicial nature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>None of the other judgments in that case contains any statement casting doubt on the constitutionality of the present system.  Neverthless, differences of judicial opinion are always a possibility sooner or later, and there seems to be no avoiding the conclusion that there would be a risk of an unfavourable decision and that such a decision, if made, might well have&mdash;though I do not say it would necessarily have&mdash;retrospective effect in the sense of invalidating all orders made up to now.  I am aware that there is a great deal of unease among adoptive parents and others in regard to the present position.  Approximately 26,000 adoption orders have been made since the system was introduced and the effects of a finding that they were invalid would be nothing short of disastrous. One must remember that an adoption order, unlike an order for custody for example, involves a fundamental and permanent change in the relationship between the adopted person and his natural and adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>The draft amendment proposed in the Bill is retrospective in its effect, as of course it needs to be in order to achieve its objective.  It is wide enough in its scope to permit of an adoption system involving an agency other than the Adoption Board as the authority in adoption matters if the Oireachtas should think fit to provide for such a system in the future, though I would like to emphasise that no such change is in fact envisaged.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that the Bill does not and cannot guarantee that there will never again be a danger of an adoption order being held to be invalid. It would be impossible to provide such a guarantee unless the Constitution were to go so far as to provide a time limit <Col N="559" /> within which an adoption order is to be challenged if it is to be challenged at all.</P>
    <P>Such a provision would be open to the most serious objections.  It would mean that an order obtained in violation of the most basic provisions of the law would be upheld.  It would mean that issues of fraud or misrepresentation could not be raised.  It would mean&mdash;and I would like to emphasise this&mdash;that even if it could be shown that the child had been ineligible for adoption because, for instance, of his being legitimate, and that the existence of the adoption order was depriving him of a right of inheritance, and that he himself wished to have the adoption order set aside, nothing could be done.</P>
    <P>There are other objections.  To provide that an adoption order in a particular case would be immune from challenge after a specified period would be to open the way for carelessness if not worse on the part of some people dealing with adoption.  It would encourage the taking of risks where risks ought not to be taken.  It would create a situation in which an order of the board would have a higher status than an order of a court, since of course an order of a court is liable to be set aside on the basis that it was wrongly made.</P>
    <P>There is no way, realistically, that we can offer to adopters an absolutely watertight guarantee that an adoption order cannot be challenged.  All we can seek to do is create a situation in which the risk of a successful challenge is so small that it would not in practice be a source of concern to the general body of adoptive parents, just as people who get married are not worried by the risk that a court may some day declare that a particular marriage was null and void.</P>
    <P>A declaration that an adoption order is invalid does not, of course, mean that the court will necessarily give custody of the child to the successful challenger. Custody is a separate issue, as I shall be saying in more detail later.</P>
    <P>I now turn to certain matters that are not in the Bill but which, for one reason or another, have been advocated by some interested persons or groups.  I think it is both right and necessary to do that, especially against the background <Col N="560" /> of the debate that took place here last October on the Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy Mrs. Desmond.  It is my hope that, when the issues are analysed, there may not be very much difference between those who supported that Bill and those, including myself, who opposed it.  There will no doubt be some issues on which differences of opinion will remain but there are certain fundamental points on which I believe there is likely to be basic agreement if the issues are first of all clearly identified. I hope that what I have to say will help towards their identification.</P>
    <P>The point was made by Deputy Barry Desmond when seconding the Private Members' Bill that that Bill was essentially put forward as a basis for discussion and I accept that.  Some speakers on that occassion also made the point that we are dealing with delicate issues and I accept that too, but I think it may be even more important to realise that the issues involved are not only delicate but also complex and that it is necessary to be very careful about the implications of particular proposals.  I hope therefore that it is clear that nothing that I propose to say is intended in any way as point-scoring over anybody who spoke on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>There are, I suggest, three seperate even if in some ways related questions to be looked at and they might conveniently be taken in the following order: first the question of the child's welfare being, I quote &ldquo;the first and paramount consideration&rdquo;, second, the general question of distinctions in status between legitimate and illegitimate children and, third, the question of adoption being confined to illegitimate children and orphans.</P>
    <P>Statements such as that the welfare of the child must always be the &ldquo;first and paramount consideration&rdquo; have been made from time to time by various people as if that were a simple straightforward proposition the meaning of which was clear and the principle underlying which was self-evidently right as a principle to be applied in all cases and circumstances.  In fact the phrase &ldquo;first and paramount consideration&rdquo; is one the meaning of which has been the subject of much argument and which, if <Col N="561" /> adopted as a universal principle to be applied in all circumstances and if interpreted in a way in which it certainly could be interpreted, would be likely to lead to consequences which would be unacceptable to the great majority even of those who have advocated it.  This is especially true in the context in which we are now considering it, namely, the context of a constitutional provision.  Before I come to deal in any detail with that, however, I think it is necessary to put what I propose to say in its proper context by correcting the frequently repeated but entirely erroneous statement that, as matters now stand under our Constitution, children have no rights, or that they have no rights as individuals, or that they have no rights otherwise than as members of the family where they are subject to their parents.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it seems that, when somebody publicly says something like this, and says it confidently enough, it is taken up by others who do not bother to check whether there is any basis for it. Nobody has ever produced any statement from any reputable legal authority in support of the proposition that children have no rights as individuals under the Constitution, and obviously they could not do so.</P>
    <P>The Constitution guarantees various rights for people&mdash;and children are people. Indeed it may be that the courts would hold that children, especially young children, have certain natural rights over and above the natural rights of adults, such as rights of support.  Be that as it may, the Constitution itself makes it explicitly clear that children have constitutional rights.  It refers, in Article 42.5, to the &ldquo;natural and imprescriptible rights of the child&rdquo;, not as rights which the Constitution finds it necessary to guarantee in explicit terms to children in particular, but as rights which are already guaranteed to them. The Article quoted takes the existence of those rights for granted and refers to them on that basis.</P>
    <P>In looking at the question of the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;first and paramount consideration&rdquo;, it may be convenient to begin with the Private Members' Bill.  In part II of the schedule to that Bill, it was proposed that the following <Col N="562" /> sentence, amongst others, should be included in the Constitution:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the enactment of laws relating to children, the welfare of the child shall be the first and paramount consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is, I believe, the first time I have seen that particular proposal put forward and I am not sure whether it was a considered proposal meant to be accepted as it stands or whether it was meant as a rough draft intended to give expression to something that is really quite a different idea.  It is, on the face of it, similar to a provision in a draft&mdash;I emphasise the word draft&mdash;convention on the rights of the child which is at present under examination under United Nations auspices but, apart from the fact that that text is not finalised, the context is different, partly because it is a much narrower and more specific context than that proposed in the Private Members' Bill but also because, even if the convention was finalised in its present form and this State became a party to it in that form, the provision in question would be in the nature of a guide for Parliament rather than a rigid legal document to be interpreted by the courts.</P>
    <P>Taken as it stands in the Private Members' Bill, the proposal would mean that any and every enactment relating to children would be open to be challenged in the courts on the basis that the legislation did not reflect the principle that the welfare of the children concerned was the first and paramount consideration. Virtually all social legislation could be challenged on the basis of such a provision and the courts would be liable to be called on to decide what the principle meant in the context of any particular piece of legislation and whether the legislation complied with it.  There could of course be wide differences of opinion on both those issues and the effect of the proposal would be to transfer a very large area of decision-making on social issues and priorities from the Oireachtas to the courts.  Such a transfer would be inappropriate and undesirable.  The courts would have an impossible task and the Oireachtas would be in an impossible position.  It is quite a different <Col N="563" /> matter to ask the court to decide a question concerning the welfare of a particular child in a particular case, but that is not what was proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from that fundamental objection there is another equally fundamental one which can be illustrated by an example. If the Oireachtas passes an Act providing, for instance, certain succession rights for a spouse and for children, that Act is a law &ldquo;relating to children&rdquo; even if it relates to a parent as well, and it would therefore be affected by the proposed provision.  It is, however, immediately apparent that there could be no possible ground for having a constitutional requirement that such an Act should comply with a principle that the welfare of what is called &ldquo;the child&rdquo; should be the first and paramount consideration. If that were the principle, it could be argued that the whole estate, or at the very least the greater part of it, must be left to or for the benefit of &ldquo;the child&rdquo;.  There are other, equally basic, objections but perhaps I have said enough on the particular proposal as put forward in the Private Member's Bill.</P>
    <P>The more usual, and on the face of it more acceptable-looking, proposition is that the law should provide&mdash;and in the present context that would mean that the Constitution should provide&mdash;that in any dispute or question concerning the adoption or custody of a child, a court or other authority should make its decision on the basis that the welfare of the child is the first and paramount consideration. In fact I assume that is really all that the sponsors of the Private Members' Bill had in mind but, even if it was not, it is certainly included in what they proposed.  For that reason and because it is an idea that has been put forward on various occasions it is essential to examine its implications.</P>
    <P>I think it as well to say at once that I believe I can show that the enactment of such a provision in our Constitution, far from being, as is sometimes suggested, self-evidently necessary and right, is on the contrary both unnecessary for the protection of children and highly undesirable&mdash;that it would in fact be a potential threat to the well-being of families and therefore of the children in <Col N="564" /> those families.  I would add immediately that it could pose an even greater threat to adoptive families than to other families, and I think from some statements I have seen that many adoptive parents are coming to appreciate that. Furthermore, I think I am justified in concluding from certain things said by Deputy Cluskey and Deputy Mrs. Desmond here last October that both of them, at all events, whatever about other Deputies, would agree with me once they realise certain implications of this possible innocent-sounding formula if it were elevated to the status of a constitutional principle and made to be of general application.  I shall come back later to those particular remarks of theirs that I have in mind because I think they are important and reflect some fears that I share.</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;first and paramount consideration&rdquo; is to be found in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, and in the Adoption Act, 1974.  It is not at all to be assumed, however, that an expression would have the same meaning if enacted as part of the Constitution, where it would have equal status with other provisions of the Constitution, as it has in an Act of the Oireachtas where it has to be interpreted on the basis that it is subsidiary to the provisions of the Constitution.  In considering this point, it is first of all necessary to look at the phrase &ldquo;first and paramount consideration&rdquo; both in its present setting as part of the Guardianship of Infants Act and in its setting as part of the Adoption Acts&mdash;and, in my view, there are important differences between those two settings.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately there has been, in many contributions to this area of discussion, a confusion between two different things, namely, on the one hand a specific right such as right of custody, which is something that is both limited in scope and essentially temporary in character&mdash;in the sense that it is subject to periodic review&mdash;and, on the other hand, general parental rights and obligations whether in the context of the ordinary family, so to speak, or the family based on legal adoption.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court has more than once made it clear that the courts will <Col N="565" /> make this distinction and possibly reach different decisions on the different issues, not only as between one case and another but even in relation to a single case.  Thus, in a dispute between a father and mother, or between parents jointly and a third party, the fact that the court awards custody to one claimant by no means indicates that it will not in appropriate cases uphold the right of the other party to have a say in such matters as the education of the child.  When the Supreme Court quashed an adoption order in the 1976 case, McL. v. An Bord Uchtála and the Attorney General, the order of the court did not award custody to the natural parents despite the fact that they had married.  It left the question of custody to be decided separately. Failure to appreciate that point, and the distinction which it reflects, has led to misunderstanding.  It is therefore essential, in the context of our present debate, to look separately at the two issues which for present purposes can be stated to be custody&mdash;or custody and guardianship&mdash; on the one hand and adoption on the other.</P>
    <P>Custody is governed by the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, which, as I have said, provides that the welfare of the child shall be the first and paramount consideration.  It has been repeatedly alleged&mdash; and I concede with some apparent justification&mdash;that there may be some cloud or question-mark over the constitutionality of that provision.  Why, then, do we not take steps to remove that question-mark?  Basically, because of a combination of three reasons.  Firstly, it is, I suggest, apparent rather than real.  Secondly, it cannot be removed without the risk of creating far greater and potentially very harmful doubts in other respects.  Thirdly, even if it should ever transpire that there was some basis for the doubt, the consequences of such a finding would be likely to be minimal, as I shall explain presently.</P>
    <P>It is impossible, of course, to be certain beyond all possibility of doubt that the constitutionality of any provision of the law may not be called in question, but I am advised and believe that the provision in question, in the Guardianship of Infants Act, is quite safe unless it is some day given an interpretation <Col N="566" /> different both from what it was generally thought and intended to have when it was enacted and from the interpretation which the courts have given to it since its enactment up to now.  If, on the other hand, it were on some future occasion to be given an interpretation different from what it was generally believed to have, and from what the courts have in practice been giving to it, it might of course then be declared unconstitutional but, in that event, what the courts would be doing would be striking down something that was never intended in the first place, and the presumption must be that we would be left with a position in which the law would still be what it is at present believed to be.  To explain this, I have to refer briefly to the history of the provision.</P>
    <P>As a statutory phrase, &ldquo;first and paramount consideration&rdquo; was first used in the English Guardianship of Infants Act, 1925.  The phrase was, as I understand, selected in order to establish or to clarify that, in a dispute between parents about custody, the two parents were to be on an equal footing.  In other words, the Act put an end to any idea that the father had a superior right. What the phrase &ldquo;first and paramount consideration&rdquo; means in the English Act when the dispute is not between the parents but between a parent or parents on the one hand and a third party on the other is of course another question.  It is, however, a point of interest to us here because a look at what I might call the history of its interpretation in the English courts can help to throw light on the underlying problem of finding words to reflect accurately concepts that are difficult to formulate precisely.  For the moment, however, I shall concentrate on developments here.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the Constitution in 1937 meant that, by reason of its provisions, the father and mother were joint guardians of the children and that, in the event of a dispute about custody, there was no presumption in favour of one as compared with the other.  The old common law rule had been that the father was the legal guardian.</P>
    <P>The courts, for their part, developed a jurisprudence which, broadly speaking, meant that in any dispute between <Col N="567" /> parents concerning the custody of a child, the welfare of the child was the predominating principle and that in any such dispute between a parent and a third party, while there was a clear presumption in favour of the parent's claim, this would be set aside if the welfare of the child required it.  A leading case&mdash;and I would like to emphasise the importance of this for reasons that will appear later&mdash;was In re Kindersley [1944] I.R. III in which the then Supreme Court laid down the principles to which I have just referred.  More specifically, the Supreme Court, in Kindersley, made it clear that in applying the concept that the predominating principle was the welfare of the child, the Court must act (I quote) &ldquo;with circumspection&rdquo; and in accordance with other established principles that had been set out earlier in the same judgment in the following words at page 130:</P>
    <P>In exercising the jurisdiction to control or to ignore the parental right, the Court must act cautiously, not as if it were a private person acting with regard to his own child&mdash;and acting in opposition to the parent only when judiciously satisfied that the welfare of the child requires that the parental right should be suspended or superseded.</P>
    <P>This was the background against which the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, was enacted.  That Act provided, in section 3, that where in any proceedings before a court a question arises concerning such matters as the custody, guardianship or upbringing of a child, the court in deciding that question shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  The Official Debates show quite clearly that, as far as the Dáil and Seanad were concerned, that provision was intended to be declaratory of the existing law&mdash;no more and no less.  There is weighty judicial opinion, to which I shall refer presently, in favour of the proposition that it achieved precisely that objective and, by implication, that it is not unconstitutional. However, even if that weighty opinion were to be overruled, and the Supreme Court were some day <Col N="568" /> to say that the words of the Act must be interpreted as having gone beyond the objective of being merely declaratory of the previously existing law, that those words allow no presumption in favour of the parental claim and that they go so far that they must be declared unconstitutional, no actual harm would result. There might be some inconvenience in the fact that the statutory provision as such could no longer be invoked but we would be left with the position as declared in Kindersley which is what at the moment we all believe to correspond with the present law.  It is scarcely to be contemplated that the statement of principles made by the then Supreme Court in Kindersley as recently as 1944, and therefore well after the enactment of the Constitution, might itself be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>It is nevertheless appropriate to examine more fully the question whether the 1964 Act seems to be in any danger of being declared to be unconstitutional. The point that is usually made against it relates to a statement made in a High Court case in 1966, by Mr. Justice Henchy, now a Judge of the Supreme Court.  In his judgment in that case&mdash;In re J. an Infant [1966] I.R. 295&mdash;he said the following at page 308:</P>
    <P>Having regard to the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide for the education of their children, and their right in appropriate cases to obtain custody of the children for that purpose, I consider that s. 3 must be interpreted in one or other of the following ways: First, by regarding it as unconstitutional, or, secondly, by reading it in conjunction with Articles 41 and 42 as stating, in effect, that the welfare of the infant in the present case coincides with the parents' right to custody.  I need not choose with these two approaches, as neither would affect the conclusion I have already reached that the parents must have the custody.  I wish, however, to make it clear that I expressly reserve an opinion (counsel not having raised the matter) as to whether it was competent for the Legislature to provide that in a case such as this, where the parents are jointly seeking custody of <Col N="569" /> their child for the purpose of giving effect to their inalienable right and duty to provide for its education, the Court should be bound to decide the question of custody by regarding the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that Mr. Justice Henchy made it abundantly clear that in making these observations his purpose was to indicate that on one&mdash;and one only&mdash;of two possible interpretations of section 3 of the 1964 Act he&mdash;or another judge or judges&mdash;might at some time have to decide that the section was unconstitutional. The reason why he expressed no opinion on this question was that this was unnecessary for the purpose of his decision in the particular case and the matter had not been argued before the court.  Moreover, the possible interpretation of the section which might have made it unconstitutional was an interpretation quite different from what it was intended to have if one is to judge by the Official Reports of the Debates in the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>Another case that is sometimes thought to cast some doubt on the 1964 Act is one that arose in 1950, namely In re Corcoran [1950] 86 I.L.T.R. 6, where in a 2-1 majority decision of the then Supreme Court it is suggested that the English provision on guardianship, which was similar in terms to what was introduced here in 1964, would be inconsistent with our Constitution.  By way of explanation, I should mention that the reference to the English Act arose from the fact that the case had strong English &ldquo;associations&rdquo;.  However, it is quite clear that the interpretation ascribed in that judgment to the English Act is materially and relevantly different from that subsequently ascribed by at least two members of our Supreme Court to the same phrase in our Act of 1964.  That subsequent case is B. v. B. [1975] I.R. 54&mdash;a case which was decided in 1970 though not included in the Reports until 1975.  It is to be noted that in that case the Supreme Court actually applied the provisions of the relevant section of the 1964 Act, something which is, I suggest, highly unlikely to have been done by the court if the section were unconstitutional&mdash;highly <Col N="570" /> unlikely even though no constitutional challenge was raised, just as no such challenge was raised in the 1966 case.  Not only did the Supreme Court&mdash;and it was the full Court sitting with five members&mdash;apply the relevant section of the 1964 Act but there are various references by the then Chief Justice, the late Mr. Justice Ó Dálaigh, and Mr. Justice Walsh which suggests positively&mdash;and not only by the negative evidence that the court was willing to apply the section to the case before it&mdash;that those two judges at all events had no doubts as to its constitutionality. Moreover, while the case concerned two parents who were in dispute, there are references in the judgment of Mr. Justice Walsh which clearly imply his acceptance of the validity of the provision not only in relation to a dispute between two parents but also in a case involving a third party against both parents because he refers in at least two separate places to a parent or parents and the references to parents must relate to a dispute involving a third party against both parents jointly.</P>
    <P>I propose to read for the House from the judgment of Mr. Justice Walsh the following brief extract which explains what I have been referring to:</P>
    <P>The Act does not purport to encourage any alteration of the established practice of the Courts that they must act very cautiously in exercising the jurisdiction to interfere with parental rights, and the court will act in opposition to the parent or parents only when judicially satisfied that the welfare of the child requires that the wishes of the parent or parents should be overruled.</P>
    <P>It will be noticed that the wording clearly echoes that used by the Supreme Court in the Kindersley case in 1944 about the Court having to act &ldquo;cautiously&rdquo; in interfering with parental rights and it expressly says that the Act does not purport to encourage any change in the established practice.  I suggest, therefore, that there is something very close to a specific decision that the 1964 Act provision, properly interpreted in the Irish context, is not unconstitutional. <Col N="571" /> For the sake of completeness I should add that in the recent case of G. v.  An Bord Uchtála to which I have already referred there are references in the judgments to the 1964 Act provision without any suggestion that it is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Why then, it may be asked, can we not put those words &ldquo;first and paramount consideration&rdquo; into the Constitution, seeing that there is such high authority for the proposition that they give due weight to the parental claim while at the same time guaranteeing that the welfare of the child is the dominating principle?  Would it not be helpful to do so and what are the objections?</P>
    <P>The answer&mdash;confining ourselves for the moment to the question of custody, as distinct from adoption where entirely different issues and much more serious objections arise&mdash;is, firstly, that on that very argument there is no possible need to do so, since the argument is that the law, at all events the law as the Oireachtas intended it to be, is safe from challenge, and secondly that it could be dangerous to do so.  What courts and individual judges have said about the phrase so far is said in its context as part of an Act of the Oireachtas which has to be interpreted in the light of overriding constitutional provisions and, to an extent, in the light of previous court decisions, for the courts, of course, do not approach the interpretation of a statute in an historical vacuum.  Indeed, as I have already mentioned, there are natural rights in connection with the family which the Constitution recognises and protects, though without specifying them, and these rights, when they are relevant, are necessarily a part of the background against which statutory provisions fall to be interpreted.  If, however, such a provision were to be enacted as part of the Constitution, it would then be in a new setting and context and the courts might find themselves compelled to give it a different interpretation from what it has been thought to have up to now and one that would be quite unacceptable to the great majority of the public.</P>
    <P>The history of the interpretation of the phrase in England gives grounds for <Col N="572" /> such a fear.  When the Oireachtas in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, adopted the phrase from the English Act of 1925, it did so against a background of post-1925 English case-law which gave solid reason for believing that the phrase accurately expressed the idea that it was intended to express here&mdash;in other words, the idea, broadly speaking, that the child's welfare should be the dominating principle but with a clear presumption in favour of the parental claims.  Subsequent decisions in the English courts modified that position and the present interpretation in England is that laid down in the House of Lords decision of 1969&mdash;J. v. C. [1970] A.C. 668&mdash;a decision which seems to amount to saying that, since the welfare of the child is the first and paramount consideration, it must prevail over all other considerations combined.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, where the welfare of the child is at issue at all, the practical result is the same as if it were declared to be the sole consideration, though of course parental claims are still relevant to the extent that they can be shown to be for the welfare of the particular child in the particular case.</P>
    <P>From time to time after the decision of the House of Lords in that 1969 case, English courts, in an effort to do justice as they saw it to the claims of an unimpeachable parent in a dispute with the other parent in a custody case, seem to have striven to avoid the implications of the decision.  In so doing they relied to some extent on a decision of the Court of Appeal in 1962 in which the court said that, although the welfare of the child was the first and paramount consideration, yet it was not the sole consideration. But the Court of Appeal has since stated firmly that, since the House of Lords case, the earlier case can no longer be regarded as good law in so far as it might be relied on to justify preferring the claims of an unimpeachable parent to the welfare of the child.</P>
    <P>Obviously it remains true that, as the Court of Appeal pointed out, to say that something is to be the first and paramount consideration is not the same as saying that it is to be the sole consideration; and in the recent case of G. v. An Bord Uchtála Mr. Justice Walsh <Col N="573" /> made the same point in relation to the similar provision in our 1964 Act.  Yet the fact remains that some English decisions suggest that it is possible for a court to interpret the expression &ldquo;first and paramount consideration&rdquo; in such a way that, although it is admittedly something less in law than the sole consideration, it in practice outweighs the combined effect of all other considerations.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that it is certain or even that it is likely that our courts would adopt such an interpretation just because the provision had been elevated to the status of a constitutional provision but only that we certainly could not by any means exclude the possibility that they might at some stage consider themselves obliged to do so.  In fact, if contrary to what I have myself argued the judgment of Mr. Justice Henchy in the case In re J. an Infant were to be interpreted as casting a serious doubt on the constitutionality of the 1964 Act, that same process of reasoning would inescapably lead to the conclusion that to elevate the provision to that of a constitutional principle would be likely to change the law in a way that was never intended by the Oireachtas when enacting the 1964 legislation.</P>
    <P>We therefore can see that, even in the limited context of custody, risks would attach to the use of any such phraseology in our Constitution where the overriding constraints of the existing constitutional provisions would no longer operate as such.  I repeat that I do not, of course, say that if such phraseology were adopted in the Constitution, our courts would necessarily interpret it as it has been interpreted in England but only that they might feel obliged to do so and that it is unnecessary to take the risk.  I am even prepared to assume that where the issue is one of custody the differences between the English interpretation and that heretofore adopted in Ireland may possibly be more important in terms of principle than of practical consequences in particular cases.</P>
    <P>Even if that is so, I would see no possible ground for throwing overboard the principle now underlying our law.  I think it will be the view of most if not all <Col N="574" /> Deputies, as it is, I have no doubt, the view of the vast majority of the public, that where there is a dispute about a child's custody between a parent and a third party, the policy of the law should continue to be that there should be a clear presumption in favour of the parent, though one which will be set aside where the welfare of the child requires it.</P>
    <P>What I have just been saying concerning the phrase &ldquo;first and paramount consideration&rdquo; has been said in the context of possible disputes about custody of children.  When it comes to the question of its possible introduction into the Constitution on the basis that it would also apply to the field of adoption, where what is at issue is the permanent vesting of parental rights in an adoptive couple, the objection becomes far more pronounced both as regards the principle involved and as regards the obvious practical consequences.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to bear in mind that, when one is speaking in this context of the field of legal adoption, one in practice is referring to disputes about the consent of the parent and, in Ireland, to the question whether or on what basis a mother's refusal to consent to the adoption of her child may be overruled.  It is this question of adopting against a mother's wishes that has to be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of some interest that quite a few of the criticisms that are voiced from time to time against certain aspects of our adoption system tend to be linked with suggestions, expressed or hinted, that we should apply English procedures and regulations.  It is all the more remarkable, then, that there appears to have been no advertence whatsoever to the fact that although English law, as I said earlier, has since as far back as 1925 applied the phrase &ldquo;first and paramount consideration&rdquo; to the law governing custody of children, it has never done so in relation to the law of legal adoption.  The fact that it has not done so is all the more significant for the fact that it is a matter of public record that such a proposition was considered in England but rejected as inappropriate; and the relevant English statute, which was enacted as recently as 1975 and re-enacted <Col N="575" /> in a consolidating Act in the following year, uses instead the phrase &ldquo;first consideration&rdquo;.  Since both countries are what are called common law countries and have many legal principles in common, it is instructive to look a little more closely at the English experience.</P>
    <P>The English Act of 1975&mdash;now re-enacted in the consolidating Act of 1976&mdash;was largely based on the Houghton Committee Report of 1972. That committee issued a working paper in which they floated the idea that the &ldquo;first and paramount consideration&rdquo; formulation applicable to custody proceedings should be imported into adoption law.  Subsequent developments are interesting.</P>
    <P>Partly because of submissions made to them, partly because they had the benefit of a House of Lords clarifying decision in a related area in the meantime, but mostly it would seem because of their own further analysis, the committee when they came to make their report, positively rejected this formulation on the basis that it was inappropriate for adoption.  Their main reason for rejecting it was that, when analysed, it becomes clear that acceptance of it as a principle would mean that where, as would normally be the case, the issue was whether the court could or should overrule a parent or parents who was or were refusing consent to adoption, the court would in fact be obliged to overrule the parental wishes even if reasonable&mdash;I emphasise the words &ldquo;even if reasonable&rdquo;&mdash;if the court was of opinion that another decision by the parents would be better.</P>
    <P>To add further to the point, the Government-sponsored Bill that was introduced likewise refrained from using the &ldquo;first and paramount consideration&rdquo; formula even though it used a different formula from what the committee recommended: the Bill as introduced required the court &ldquo;to take full account of&rdquo; the welfare of the child but in the House of Lords an amendment was made adopting for all practical purposes the wording recommended by the committee, which was &ldquo;first consideration&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One further point may be noted from <Col N="576" /> English experience.  If a court had the right and duty to overrule the wishes of a parent on the basis of the court's own opinion about what would best serve the interests of the child and to do that even though the parent was unimpeachable and the parent's wishes reasonable, the court would be exercising a jurisdiction on the basis, only, of its own opinion and, certainly at times, on the basis of its idea of a balance of probabilities.  The British Association of Social Workers, commenting on a Home Office consultation paper which apparently was issued before the enactment of the 1975 Act, said that it was</P>
    <P>dangerous to imply that parental rights should rest upon a balance of probabilities about a child's future welfare; the logical extension of this could be arbitrarily to decide which families within the community are the most suitable for bringing up children and to transfer children from other families to them.</P>
    <P>The quotation is as given in &ldquo;The Children Act, 1975; Text with Concise Commentary&rdquo; by M. D. A. Freeman, at page 72/3, and the author goes on himself to comment:</P>
    <P>Myth would then supplant reality and poor parents would lose their children to middle-class families (cf. Jordan, Poor Parents, 1974).</P>
    <P>I refer to these matters because I believe that they serve as a salutary warning against the grave danger of assuming that propositions that might sound&mdash; and even actually be&mdash;innocuous in a sociological essay can validly and safely be transplanted into a legal context, whether it be a constitutional context or even an ordinary statutory one.  Words in the Constitution or a statute must be able to stand up to the scrutiny to which they are liable to be subjected in proceedings in the Courts and it is too late at that stage to say: &ldquo;But that is not what I meant.&rdquo;  True, a statute can be amended but, in a context such as the present one, not so easily as to prevent damage being done; and of course a constitutional provision, even if found to have repercussions of an unforeseen and undesired nature, is very difficult to change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> In setting out for the information of the House some material about experience in England as to the possible implications of the phrase &ldquo;first and paramount consideration&rdquo; when not subject to the overriding constraints of provisions such as the present provisions of our Constitution, I am not to be taken as saying that I regard the other phrase, namely, &ldquo;first consideration&rdquo;, as suitable and appropriate in the context of a constitutional provision governing adoption. All I am saying is that, in such a context, it would be less objectionable than &ldquo;first and paramount consideration&rdquo;, but neither phrase is necessary, or acceptable, in a constitutional context.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out already that, when one speaks of disputes in the context of legal adoption, one is generally if not invariably speaking of a situation where there is a refusal to consent, or a withdrawal of a consent already given. Accordingly, I was glad to note that several speakers on the Private Members' Bill adverted more or less directly to this question of consent.</P>
    <P>I refer first of all to the contribution made by Deputy Dr. Browne because he brought out very clearly the possible conflict involved and the need to recognise the role of the parent.  In a less direct but nevertheless very significant way, the problem was touched on both by Deputy Cluskey and, in her reply to the debate, by Deputy Eileen Desmond. They spoke of the problem of the mother of an illegitimate child giving her consent to adoption when the child is only six months old, the problem being that, because of various pressures, some mothers might not be able to make a considered decision at that stage.  In effect, these Deputies wondered if we should substitute a longer period for the period of six months to which they referred. It is those remarks that I had in mind when, towards the beginning of my speech, I said they had expressed fears which I shared.</P>
    <P>Having regard to what they said, I think it may come as something of a shock to both Deputies to hear that the period is not six months but only six weeks.  It was six months on the introduction of legal adoption in 1952 but the Oireachtas reduced it to six weeks in <Col N="578" /> the Adoption Act, 1974.  In other words, that Act allowed a mother to give a valid consent to the making of an adoption order when the child is only six weeks old and, apart from any waiting period that might be required by statutory regulations, it allows the Adoption Board to make an adoption order immediately after that period of six weeks. Even if such a period were to be prescribed&mdash;which in fact has not been done&mdash;the law is such that the board are authorised to give an exemption in any particular case.  It is true that, in practice, the board would be most unlikely to be able to be satisfied with the suitability of a placement as early as six weeks after the birth of the child even if the placement were made immediately after birth, but the House should be under no illusion about the fact that, by the Act of 1974, the Oireachtas certainly envisaged that adoption orders could properly be made well before the expiry of the six-month period which Deputy Cluskey and Deputy Mrs. Desmond thought was already possibly too short.  There is therefore much less legal protection than they thought for the mother's interests.</P>
    <P>The law gives even less weight to the mother's interests than what I have said so far would indicate.  One of the well-known features of adoption law is that a consent may be withdrawn up to the date of the making of an adoption order and accordingly it might be argued that, although a consent may be given when the child is six weeks old, the adoption order will not in practice be made for some time after that and the consent can be withdrawn if the mother meanwhile changes her mind.  The position is not as straightforward as that because the withdrawal of consent may, in effect, be overruled.  The reason is that the 1974 Act also introduced a provision to the effect that, if a mother agrees to place her child for adoption but later refuses formal consent, or withdraws a formal consent already given, an application may be made to the High Court for a custody order in favour of the people with whom the child is placed and the High Court may also authorise the Adoption Board to dispense with the mother's consent.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the very existence of those provisions for an <Col N="579" /> application to be made to the High Court, no matter how reasonable they may be in themselves, can act as a deterrent to a mother who might be disposed to withdraw a consent already given, even if the consent was given as early as six weeks after the birth of the child.  I think I would be correct in assuming that at least the three Deputies I have mentioned might be unhappy about this situation and I, for my part, believe that it needs to be looked at again.  I have mentioned it now because it underlines in a very useful and specific way the grave dangers associated with any idea of a constitutional requirement that, in this area and irrespective of circumstances, the welfare of the child must be paramount.  Putting it shortly, if the Constitution were to have such a requirement in relation to adoption, it would be open to be construed as meaning that a child could be taken from a mother against her will and adopted on the basis that, as a single parent, she would be unlikely to be able to provide for the welfare of the child as well as a suitable married couple with a confortable home and the means to provide the best possible education for the child.</P>
    <P>If anybody were to say &ldquo;But that is not what I mean&rdquo;, I would have to reply that that is not what some people mean, but it is not what they mean that counts but what the Constitution would say. Furthermore, let us be under no illusions about this.  There is a school of thought which does not hesitate to say that neither unmarried mothers nor married parents should have any rights at all in relation to a child and that the value of the blood-tie is a myth.  I received, shortly before Christmas, a document from a certain organisation which I do not intend to name for reasons that will be apparent in a moment but which is actively engaged in lobbying in relation to legislation governing children.  Since the document, though written in 1976, was sent to me officially by the organisation only very recently, it must be taken as representing their current policy also.  I will quote from it the following:</P>
    <P>In judgments on consent, as in other matters, the welfare of the child <Col N="580" /> should, if necessary, supersede parental rights where these conflict.  Indeed, parents have duties, not rights.  While having due regard to the rights or needs of a child to belong to his own natural family, the blood-tie in itself should be seen to be of little value to good parenting.</P>
    <P>The statement that &ldquo;parents have duties, not rights&rdquo; is startling and, some might think, especially so where as in this instance the context in which it is made concerns the question whether a child should be taken away permanently from its natural parent against the wishes of that parent.  It may seem possible at first sight to take such a statement as just a rhetorical flourish.  But it is clear from the sentence that precedes it and the sentence that follows it that the statement that parents have no rights cannot be taken as just a rhetorical flourish.  The preceding sentence, if it is to have any real meaning, must mean that where the parent concerned refuses consent to an adoption the question of whether the child should be adopted should depend entirely on the view taken by the court as to what will best conduce to his welfare.  That, in turn, inescapably means that the court deciding the question would be required to disregard entirely the wishes of a parent, if the court considered that the child's welfare would be better served by his being adopted. As I have already mentioned, precisely that proposition was rejected in England in the context of the 1975 Act.</P>
    <P>Let me say immediately that I feel sure that most of the people involved in that organisation would not really wish to see a baby taken away from its mother against her will simply on the basis that this would be for the child's welfare and that the mother has no rights.  Yet, as I have said, that is what the document implies and I am afraid that that is precisely what some people, a minority, mean.  I am happy to think, from what was said here in the debate on the previous Bill, that it is a view which would get little support in this House.  I want to make it quite clear that it will get no support at all from me.  It ought not to get support from adoptive parents or prospective adoptive parents because, if <Col N="581" /> the rights of natural parents can be set aside, then likewise the rights of adoptive parents can be set aside and there will be no security in legal adoption.  I fear that that is an aspect that has&mdash;quite understandably&mdash; not always been fully appreciated by some persons whose immediate interest was to bring to an end a possibly anxious waiting period and to obtain as soon as possible an adoption order for which they had applied, though on the other hand I believe that most adoptive parents would recognise the implications and would not in fact wish to see such a principle introduced.</P>
    <P>The House will no doubt be glad to hear that that is all I have to say on the proposal for a constitutional amendment on that particular issue, but Deputies who have patiently borne my lengthy comments will have appreciated the serious reasons for the rejection in England of the expression &ldquo;first and paramount consideration&rdquo; as one appropriate for adoption law; and since our Adoption Act, 1974, incorporates that formula, they may wonder if what I have said against it implies that our 1974 Act is open to those objections or is likely to be interpreted as meaning that the wishes of a mother even if reasonable are liable to be overruled.</P>
    <P>I am not dealing here today with that Act and I shall confine myself to a few brief comments.  The provision in the 1974 Act was not in the Bill as introduced but was the result of an amendment put down in the Seanad and accepted by my predecessor.  There are, therefore, no official records to show what meaning it was thought&mdash;or intended &mdash;to have in situations such as I have posed today.  However, there were some references to that provision in the judgments in the recent Supreme Court case and, while I shall need more time to study their implications, I am glad to be able to say that they appear to suggest that the provision would not be interpreted as requiring or authorising either a court or the board to disregard the wishes of a mother, even a mother acting reasonably, merely on the basis that that would in the opinion of the court or the board be for the greater welfare of the child.  I think it will be clear from what I have already said that, <Col N="582" /> if the courts were in fact to give the provision any other interpretation, it would create a position calling for an immediate change in the law.</P>
    <P>I cannot say, however, that I am entirely satisfied that the references in the two judgments I have mentioned are sufficient to obviate the need to study the provision further and I intend to do so as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I now return to the text of the Private Members' Bill.  It contains provisions which propose the deletion from Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution of the words &ldquo;inalienable&rdquo; and &ldquo;imprescriptible&rdquo;, which are used in those Articles to characterise the rights of the family.  It also proposes that equality of rights be accorded to all children without regard to status at birth.  It further proposes to authorise the enactment of laws providing for the transfer of parental rights to substitute parents.  These provisions could have very far-reaching consequences indeed, consequences which many people might find wholly unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I recognise, of course, that one of the motivating factors of those who drafted the Private Members' Bill was the desire to remove the disabilities that attach to illegitimacy and I think that the overwhelming majority of people would sympathise with that aim.  I doubt that anybody with a normal human sense of concern for others would want to see disabilities imposed or maintained for their own sake, or would want to punish innocent children.  The general objective, therefore, would undoubtedly command almost universal support if and in so far as it can be achieved without undermining the legal support for the family unit in our society.  That, however, is a difficulty and one which we have to face.</P>
    <P>We ought first of all to recognise that there is a difference between social stigma and legal rights or lack of them. The social stigma of illegitimacy is no doubt considerably less now even than a generation or so ago.  But in the matter of certain types of legal rights we ought not to adopt uncritically changes that have been made in other jurisdictions.  It is a matter of fact rather than opinion that in the background to some of those <Col N="583" /> changes is a widespread rejection in some countries of the institution of marriage by couples who, for a longer or shorter term, choose to enter into what is often called a &ldquo;stable relationship&rdquo;.  Thus in many instances, the approximation of the legal rights of legitimate and illegitimate children reflects a trend towards the rejection of marriage.</P>
    <P>There are a number of differences in law between the position of the legitimate and illegitimate child.  One of these is the right of inheritance.  The consequence of the proposals in the Private Members' Bill would be that the illegitimate child would have the same rights as the legitimate child to succeed to his parents' property on their death. Apart from the principle involved, the unqualified elimination of the difference in the position of the legitimate and illegitimate child in this respect would, in practice, apply to some very different situations.</P>
    <P>Thus the child born of a single encounter between a married man and a chance acquaintance would benefit to the same degree as the child of a long-term though irregular union.  There are of course, some who will ask, &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; and, if one had to think only of the particular child, that too would be my attitude.  But it really is not as simple a matter as that.  In recent years our law has more and more come to recognise that the property of a family man is not something over which he ought to have unrestricted power as against his wife and their children.  For example, we have on our Statute Book the Succession Act which effectively means that, to a significant extent, the property of a man at his death is to be regarded as family property.  In more recent times&mdash;and with the support of all sides in the House&mdash;the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 and the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, reflect a growing awareness that a man's wife and family have rights in respect of what the law had traditionally regarded as his exclusive property.</P>
    <P>There are sound practical reasons as well as reasons of major principle for those developments, not least being the <Col N="584" /> fact that in most cases a wife and family make a large contribution one way or another towards the accumulation of whatever property may come to be possessed by the husband.  A change in the law which, in practice, could result in a stranger to the family becoming entitled to an equal share with the child or children of the family or entitled to share in a way that diminishes the right of a wife or widow, could be very unfair as well as being, arguably, a very bad principle. We must remember also that in the normal course of events the person who succeeds to a parent's property is likely to be a middle-aged person rather than a minor.  If, however, the person in question were in fact still a minor, there would be a very real possibility that it would be the child of an irregular union in which the male partner was a man who had deserted his wife and their family.  That, of course, is not the child's fault but the law does not require that the child be ignored for inheritance purposes. A man or woman is perfectly free to leave property by will to his or her illegitimate child.</P>
    <P>The central point at issue is that, as I believe, the vast bulk of the people in this country would not wish to see either the Constitution or the ordinary law changed in a way that could involve any serious erosion of the position of the family founded on marriage.  That is not to say that no change in the law is feasible or desirable in regard to illegitimate children.  My view at this stage is that a full analysis of all the factors might very well lead to an acceptance that there should be certain changes that would accord greater rights to illegitimate children than is now the case.  That is the kind of analysis that I am confident the Law Reform Commission will in due course provide.  I do not think there can be any doubt that the Oireachtas is quite free under the Constitution as it stands to make changes in that direction.  It is, of course, possible that the provisions in the Constitution for the protection of the family founded on marriage might set some limits to legislative change in this area&mdash;it might be, for instance, that a law that deprived a wife and the minor children of a marriage of a proper share in the inheritance of property that the <Col N="585" /> family had been involved in would run into constitutional difficulties.  I do not think the Constitution ought to be changed on that account.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the question of adoption of legitimate children, I would not be at all happy about a provision, such as that proposed in the Private Members' Bill, which would permit parental rights to be transferred against the wishes of the natural parents or which would permit parents, of their own volition, to divest themselves permanently of their parental duties.  Obviously the law should, and does, provide that a child may be taken away and kept away from its parents if they ill-treat it intentionally or otherwise.  The Constitution as it stands makes explicit provision for that and, as I say, the law already provides for it and there is no reason why the law in this area cannot be strengthened if the need for that arises.</P>
    <P>But the pressure for a change to permit the adoption of legitimate children continues.  A recent statement on this point as quoted in <i>The Irish Press</i> on 31 January is to the effect that this Bill does nothing to alter the position of those legitimate children whose parents are unable or unwilling to provide them with a stable home background.</P>
    <P>People who make such statements should examine them more closely and consider where what they are proposing can lead.</P>
    <P>There is no possible way of devising a system for the adoption of legitimate children which would not lead to the possibility of parents giving their children for adoption even if they were perfectly capable of rearing them themselves.  No criteria of neglect or abandonment could eliminate collusion between natural and adoptive parents to fabricate neglect or abandonment.  In any case, by what principle could the law provide that parents would be able to divest themselves of responsibility for their child by neglecting it&mdash;and thus freeing it for adoption&mdash;and not be able in a more responsible, even if still basically irresponsible, way to arrange for the adoption of their child by agreement with a more affluent couple?  If <Col N="586" /> adoption of legitimate children were to be allowed, there would be no valid option but to permit parents to hand over their children for adoption if they themselves so desired and I doubt that many people would seriously wish to see adoptions on this basis become possible.</P>
    <P>Even if the adoption of legitimate children could be confined to abandoned or seriously neglected children, serious problems relating to the consent of the natural parents would arise.  I must stress the uniqueness of adoption: it is permanent and irreversible; no change in the behaviour or circumstances of the parties can affect it.  I do not believe that the public generally would accept a situation where parental rights&mdash;not just custody rights but all rights&mdash;would be permanently transferred against the wishes of the parents.  That appears to me to be what the Private Members' Bill would involve in certain circumstances. Moreover, the argument that the proposal in this regard is not mandatory is not sustainable.</P>
    <P>We must remember that, with the exception introduced in 1974, to which I have already referred and about which I have misgivings, the adoption procedure is based on the free consent of the parties. Supposing that a parent of a child who, for one reason or another, is not able or is not willing to rear the child in a manner that some of us might consider appropriate refuses to give his or her consent to its adoption, is the consent to be dispensed with at the behest of some agency?  A great number of people would, I have no doubt, be very disturbed to think that they might be at risk of losing their children because some official felt that the children would be better off adopted.  I have already quoted from two Supreme Court judgments which emphasise that the courts are most reluctant to disregard the wishes of parents in regard to the custody of their children.  The need for caution is, of course, far greater when what is in question is adoption rather than custody.  But some of those who advocate change in this area appear to think that such caution is unwarranted.  Some people appear genuinely to believe that parents have duties not rights.  In the matter of a <Col N="587" />&ldquo;stable home background&rdquo; we might ask ourselves if any of us would pass the test of some psychiatrists and psychologists. I would like to make it quite clear that while these observations are being made in the context of arguments about the adoption of legitimate children I would apply what I have said about parental consent equally to the mother of an illegitimate child.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must make the point that legal adoption, while it is a great boon and far too valuable to be put at hazard by experimental ideas that have not really been developed, is not a cure-all for child care problems.  It has to be borne in mind that children who have to be taken from their parents are often beyond the normal age at which adoption takes place and integration into a new family is not realisable in many cases.  In most such cases, legal adoption would in fact be a very risky undertaking.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I am convinced that it is necessary to amend the Constitution in the manner proposed by this Bill and, on the other hand, I believe that not only is there no demonstrable need for any further changes on the lines proposed in the Private Members' Bill but, on the contrary, that such changes would be very inadvisable.  In fact some of them would, I believe, be unacceptable to some of the Deputies who spoke in favour of the Private Members' Bill because they themselves made observations &mdash;very important observations&mdash;which are really incompatible with what was actually in the Bill.  For the benefit of any Deputy who may be disposed to look at English experience, I would reiterate, briefly, that they have consciously rejected, for instance, that adoption law should have a provision about the welfare of the child being first and paramount.  All this is not to say that there is no room for change in, for instance, the laws affecting illegitimate children.  Such changes can be made under the Constitution as it stands but the question of accepting or rejecting any such change should await the outcome of the deliberations of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Col N="588" />
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear initially that my approach to this Bill is very much on a non-political basis.  Such a serious matter should not divide us on party lines.  I have not been in this House very long, but I am aware of the genuine concern amongst Members on all sides of the House to ensure that, if possible, our laws in this area are improved.  I hope the Minister will consider in an objective way the points I am about to raise and try to meet them by an extension of this Bill.</P>
      <P>As it stands, the law relating to children in general and adoption in particular is riddled with difficulties, inadequacies, anomalies and anachronisms. Now that this matter has come before the House it is our duty as legislators to try to ensure as far as we can that those anachronisms, anomalies, inadequacies and difficulties are removed.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a very comprehensive speech which I intend to study.  Obviously, when one stands up to speak immediately after him, it is not possible to deal with all the points he mentioned, or to deal with the results of what must have been very considerable research.  I compliment the Minister's advisers on the lengths to which they went in researching this subject.  I feel that research was mainly directed towards seeing the obstacles to any change, and towards proving the case for retaining the <i>status quo.</i>  Having made that point, I accept that the research will be invaluable to all of us who have an interest in this matter.</P>
      <P>Looking at adoption our first job is to try to find out what is the ultimate solution at which we are aiming and then, with the help of the departmental advisers, the lawyers and the judges, if necessary, try to find the necessary formula to achieve that aim.  From that point of view I will be making my comments on the general tenor of the Minister's speech.  It is not clear from his speech exactly what the Minister would like to do if it were possible.  He has made clear what the difficulties are if we want to make changes.  I welcome the Bill and I will support it.  On behalf of myself and my party I reiterate that we welcome and support it for reasons I will mention later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> We have a golden opportunity to extend our thinking in this area and to achieve the very necessary constitutional change so that this matter can be constitutionally covered and guaranteed in the long term.  A constitutional change cannot be made overnight.  It requires very serious consideration.  Five amendments have been proposed to the Constitution. This is the sixth.  Of those five, two related to the PR issue in 1959 and 1956 and were defeated.</P>
    <P>The question of amending our basic document, the Constitution, is very serious.  It has not been done very often. It requires a great deal of thought and deliberation.  It involves a great deal of expense.  Looking at the history of our Constitution stretching back over 40 years, I believe I am right in saying only three amendments to it have been carried. I mention that in the context of the difficulty involved in changing the Constitution and the need, now that we are putting the amendment before the people by way of a referendum, to ensure that all the points we wish to include in that amendment are included.</P>
    <P>The question then is: what are we aiming at generally?  Obviously we are aiming to ensure that the adoption procedure is constitutionally guaranteed. I am in total agreement with that aim.  I approve of the measure which will so provide.  I will give it my full support. There are broader issues involved. Before I come to them I want to make something very clear in case there might be any misinterpretation.  Neither I nor members of my party would wish in any way to undermine the position of the family in our society.  At the same time, in dealing with an individual child we must ensure that the welfare of the child is the first and paramount consideration. We need to look at the entire problem in a child-centered way rather than as formerly.  Having established exactly what we are aiming at, let us put our heads together and see how it can be done, and how the difficulties quite rightly pointed out by the Minister can be overcome.  Whether in politics or otherwise, I believe if there are difficulties the formula one should use is to look at them, assess them, judge them <Col N="590" /> and then overcome them.  This should be our approach to adoption.</P>
    <P>In general, my comments will be from the point of view of providing a constitutional framework which will permit our adoption laws to develop in the years ahead.  We will have an opportunity on June 7 next to ensure that that development is not restricted.  In that context I ask the Minister to have a further look at the situation.  I do not say this in any party political sense but out of a genuine concern and a genuine compassion for the situation in which many children find themselves and out of a sincere desire to ensure that our laws will provide fair play for them all and reflect the aim of our 1916 Proclamation, of our Constitution, that all the children of this nation shall be cherished equally. That is the general background to my thinking on this matter and I hope the Minister will accept what I have to say in that spirit.</P>
    <P>The Bill relates to the amendment of Article 37 of the Constitution.  There are a number of Articles which need to be looked at in the context of the Bill and in the context of the comments I make.  Article 37 reads:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Constitution shall operate to invalidate the exercise of limited functions and powers of a judicial nature, in matters other than criminal matters, by any person or body of persons duly authorised by law to exercise such functions and powers, notwithstanding that such person or such body of persons is not a judge or a court appointed or established as such under this Constitution.</P>
    <P>That is the Article which we propose to amend by the addition of the words in this Bill.  In the course of my remarks I shall be referring to Article 40, paragraph 1 of which provides: &ldquo;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law&rdquo;, and to Article 41.1. in regard to the family.  Here we have the clause: &ldquo;The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive <Col N="591" /> law.&rdquo;  Those words which I stumbled over are words which have been used many times in court decisions and which are to some degree an addition to the problem.</P>
    <P>The other very relevant Article, which relates to education, is Article 42.1. which reads:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</P>
    <P>Again, the word &ldquo;inalienable&rdquo; is used. These Articles will be referred to during the course of the debate and these are the Articles which we have to look at when deciding whether any amendment should be made to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The background to the Bill has been outlined by the Minister.  Whatever about the legalities involved, it is clear that there has been a considerable amount of worry, distress and insecurity for adoptive parents.  I accept what the Minister said in regard to the actual decision.  Arising out of comments by judges, particularly the Chief Justice, and informed comment thereafter, I have seen this insecurity.  I commend the move that is being made to remove this form of insecurity.  It is as well that we should be clear that we are talking about the insecurity arising from one constitutional point&mdash;the constitutionality of the Adoption Board in making decisions because of Article 37.  I accept that this is the main problem.  The Minister made the point that adoption decisions could not be totally constitutionally and legally guaranteed.  I do not entirely accept that view, although I accept the difficulties which he mentioned in regard to a time limit.</P>
    <P>He dealt with the question of fraud and misrepresentation.  The Minister has highlighted these problems but further initiative might find solutions to these problems.  This is the only criticism I have to make.  The solution which he has provided in regard to the position of the <Col N="592" /> Adoption Board is one that is needed whether the legal or constitutional doubts have total validity.  There is a strong feeling on the position and it needs to be dealt with.</P>

      <P>I did suggest publicly that the adoption referendum might be held in conjunction with these two elections. The Government have not taken a decision on it but we have consulted with the returning officers of the four Euro-constituencies and we are still considering their opinions, our main concern being to avoid any confusion and, having regard to my own experience at election time&mdash;and I have some experience at both ends, the official and the public <Col N="593" /> end&mdash;I would have some concern about what confusion might be caused if we had all three issues on the same day, particularly having regard to the fact that in some local areas there would be two ballot papers, one for county councils and one for urban councils or commissioners. It is purely from that point of view that we are considering the matter.</P>
      <P>Secondly, as far as the other two issues are concerned, the bail issue and the NUI and Seanad representations, we have not yet, as the Deputy is aware, enacted the necessary legislation but it would be our hope to have these three referenda together if that were necessary and possible but, above all, to have the referendum on adoption at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Taylor</b> asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he is aware of the grave concern regarding recent proposals by Aer Rianta to reduce services and staff at Shannon Airport; if so, if he has approved these proposals; and if he will make a full statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Dublin South-Central) Thomas J. (Dublin South-Central) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Dublin South-Central</i>): Shannon Airport is managed by Aer Rianta who, following a number of press reports on this subject, issued a statement on 19 January.  In their statement Aer Rianta pointed out that the increasingly seasonal nature of traffic at Shannon, where currently less than 25 per cent of total business is handled in the period November to April, is resulting in unacceptably high losses in the off-peak periods and that this trend, allied to escalating payroll and other costs, is seriously threatening the viability of the total Shannon operation.  The statement further pointed out that Aer Rianta have for some time been indicating concern in this matter to employees and union representatives and that proposals in regard to reductions in the hours of operation of certain non-essential commercial activities during the winter months have recently been conveyed to employees and unions and discussions are in progress.  The statement further indicated that it is not envisaged that there will be any loss of jobs among permanent staff employed at Shannon.</P>
      <P>These discussions are still in progress and it would be inappropriate for me to make any statement in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that, as emphasised in their statement, Aer Rianta are actively pursuing a policy of developing Shannon by attracting new business and creating productive employment at the airport. <Col N="597" /> For example, an additional 80 jobs will be created in the Shannon mail order business over the next five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to press the Minister to inform the House if there were consultations before Aer Rianta arrived at this decision and had consultations with the unions.  Does the Minister agree with the policy of Aer Rianta in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>People were employed in a temporary capacity during the peak period from April to November who would normally after two years service be retained and made permanent.  Is it now the intention of Aer Rianta to let those people off without making them permanent employees?  Does the Minister approve of this policy?  Is it true that as members of the Aer Rianta staff become redundant it is the policy of Aer Rianta, and I assume the policy of the Minister, that those people will not be replaced and that there will be a rundown of the staff from 900 to 700?  Is this in line with the Government's job policy and job-sharing with the public sector having to take up its proper proportion of workers?</P>

The decision being taken now is to ensure the long-term viability of the company.  I have already said that 85 new jobs will be created in the mail order business to ensure that we build up Shannon as a viable unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State realise that the concern that has arisen has been based on two very important facts?  Firstly, there is a proposed rationalisation programme by Aer Rianta which is designed to achieve two objectives, one to reduce staff and the other to reduce services.  Instead of Shannon being a 24-hour airport as it <Col N="599" /> has always been, it is going to have limited services now.  The Minister of State could agree to consult with his Minister, and then they could both take up the matter with Aer Rianta.  It must be possible for a semi-State body with the assistance of SFADCo and other semi-State bodies to generate that little bit of extra business which would ensure that the existing workforce, both permanent and temporary, are maintained in employment and the airport can remain open for 24 hours.</P>

There are at present no proposals with my Department for the operation of a scheduled air service to or from Donegal.  Any application for the operation of a scheduled service must be supported by adequate evidence of the viability of the proposed service and the capacity of the operator financially, technically and otherwise to mount and sustain the service.</P>

      <P>The Minister may not have understood the full impact of my question.  I am asking for a scheduled air service to Donegal.  The implications there would be that the State would, first of all, provide an airport in order that the service might be provided.  Secondly, I ask the Minister whether, if no survey has been done, a survey might be initiated by the Department to ascertain the viability of and the necessity for this service.  If such were undertaken, would the Minister take into account the isolation of County Donegal, the lack of rail services to Donegal which we once had, the lack of shipping transport to Donegal which once upon a time was available through Derry, the almost total absence of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am asking him to take into account the lack of these modes of communication.  Further, will he take into account the almost total absence of a telephone service and the near nonexistence of a television service?  Would he also take into account that such an airport and such a service would surely serve not only Donegal but the greater part of Derry, all of Tyrone and parts of north Fermanagh?  If all that is taken into account it can be seen that we need this badly and that it would be viable. Surely the State owes this to a county that has otherwise been totally neglected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

If any commercial company carries out a survey as regards the viability to sustain that company, and submits that survey to my Department, we will examine that application very closely.

I would ask the Minister to check in his Department for such a report and the request for it that was made repeatedly many years ago. Further, I would ask him to take into account the availability of funds from the EEC Regional Fund, money that was not available to governments in the past.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 8, 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>CIE's capital allocation is fixed each year by the Government as part of the capital budget, with due regard to the requirements of urban public transport.</P>
      <P>When setting up the Transport Consultative Commission I asked that priority be given to an examination of the problems in relation to the provision of urban passenger transport services, particularly in the Dublin area, and the commission have initiated their investigations in this matter.  I have no doubt that the commission's deliberations will cover all relevant considerations, including energy conservation and the relative merits of alternative modes of transport.  The implications for investment in public transport of whatever recommendations are made by the commission will, of course, have to be considered in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE's proposals for the electrification of the Howth-Bray suburban railway are at present being considered independently of the studies being carried out by the Transport Consultative Commission but a decision on these proposals has not yet been taken.  If these proposals are approved, <Col N="603" /> it follows that CIE's capital allocation will be increased, as necessary, to provide for the implementation of the proposals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>All of these documents are updated and amended by CIE from time to time to take cognisance of changing work practices and conditions.  Completely new editions of the Signalling Book and Appendix to the Working Timetable are in the course of preparation by CIE and are shortly to be issued.  The new editions will not be fundamentally different <Col N="607" /> from the existing amended publications. The responsibility for carrying out these rules and regulations rests with the rail operating and engineering staff.  At management and supervisory level CIE have a continuing monitoring system in operation.</P>
    <P>I have also been informed by CIE that the passenger rolling stock in use on mainline and suburban rail is subjected to regular safety examinations and only vehicles which satisfy fully these examinations are allowed to operate.  The rolling stock used on the Dublin suburban railways complies with CIE's safety regulations.  Passenger loading at the peak periods is of crush loading dimensions because of the increase in demand for these services.  I have, however, been assured by CIE that while this overcrowding is uncomfortable it is not in itself unsafe.  The condition of the rolling stock is not covered by statutory regulations.</P>

However, my Department have reason to believe that in recent months it was using unlicensed wireless telegraphy apparatus in contravention of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926.  Equipment was seized on 26 January 1979 on foot of a search warrant issued under section 8 of that Act.  Legal proceedings are being instituted and in these circumstances I consider it inappropriate to comment further on the matter at this stage.</P>

      <P>This budget initiates the second stage of the Government's strategy for economic and social development, presented in various planning documents, notably the recently published White Paper &ldquo;Programme for National Development 1978-1981&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The first stage of this strategy was marked by direct Government action to boost growth, increase employment and reduce inflation.  In the second stage, public sector resources will continue to be applied so as to maximise their ability to induce growth.  At the same time, the increased dynamism of the private sector, resulting from the success of the Government's policies, will enable the contribution to growth from the public sector to be scaled down.  The success of the strategy depends on confidence in the ability and the willingness of the private sector to avail itself of the momentum which Government action has generated.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Economy in 1978</i>
      </P>
      <P>The current state of the economy has already been reviewed in the Economic Background to the Budget, as well as in the White Paper on National Development. I will therefore confine myself to a comparison of the principal economic targets and achievements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's targets for the economy in 1978 were demanding. Indeed some thought that we aimed too high.  What is the record?  The growth rate was about 7 per cent, a rate which, for the second year running, was the <Col N="633" /> highest in the EEC and in the larger group of OECD industrialised countries. Our figure was almost double the OECD average, and almost treble that for the EEC.  This was a remarkable performance by any standard and one of which the community as a whole can be proud.</P>
    <P>We also had the biggest annual increase in employment in decades.  In this our experience was quite unusual internationally. Figures published by the EEC Commission show that unemployment in the Community as a whole rose last year.  In contrast, it fell here, and by a much bigger amount than in those other member states where it was also reduced.</P>
    <P>Next, the rate of inflation was dramatically reduced, from 13.6 per cent in 1977 to 7.6 per cent in 1978.  The constant worries which double digit inflation brought to many people over the past few years have been dramatically lightened.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments provided one of the most heartening aspects of our economic performance last year. Our initial White Paper&mdash;on National Development 1977-1980&mdash;made it clear that faster growth would be accompanied by some increase in the balance of payments deficit.  In last year's Budget Speech, I thought it only prudent to contemplate the possibility that the deficit could rise to £350-£400 million.  I am glad to say that, as a result of a number of favourable factors, including exceptionally high EEC transfers, the deficit amounted to only about £150 million.  The official reserves stood at £1,252 million at end-1978, which was £51 million higher than the previous record level at end-1977.</P>
    <P>Not only the moderate size of the deficit, but also the satisfactory trade pattern that underlies it, gives grounds for satisfaction.  Exports were buoyant. The dynamism of the various sectors of the economy was illustrated by the fact that, as the latest figures show, industrial exports were higher by 17 per cent in value and agricultural exports by 18 per cent.  Imports were also buoyant, but higher imports are inevitable in an expanding economy, and to the extent that <Col N="634" /> they assist expansion are acceptable. The category that showed the largest rise last year&mdash;30 per cent&mdash;was that of producers' capital goods; these imports go to widen the productive base of the economy, and are welcome on that account.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Economic prospects for 1979</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government's economic targets for 1979 have been set out in the White Paper on National Development.  They are for a growth in national output of 6½ per cent, a reduction of 25,000 in the numbers out of work and a reduction in the rate of inflation, so that by end year it will be no more than 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>These are targets, not forecasts of what will happen if events are let run their course without real effort on anyone's part.  Their achievement depends upon a coherent communal effort. The aim of the Government's economic planning is to give a sense of purpose and direction so as to evoke that communal effort.  If the effort is not strong enough, then the targets will not be reached.</P>
    <P>Growth of the right kind develops a momentum of its own.  The seeds of further growth lie in the achievements of 1978.  Fixed capital formation grew by about 15 per cent last year, and investment in plant and machinery rose even faster, by 18 per cent.  The productive capacity of our economy was considerably strengthened and there is every reason to expect this process to continue this year, buoyed up by a substantial increase in public capital investment.  We have, in other words, the capacity to produce considerably more this year.</P>
    <P>Can we find markets for higher output? This depends on our competitiveness, and I will return to this point.  The required market growth should be there.  The forecasts of the EEC Commission and of the OECD for the countries which provide the bulk of our markets project some increase in their growth rates in 1979.  External market conditions should therefore enable us to repeat, and possibly to better, the large increase in exports last year.  It is true that the forecasts to which I referred do not take account of <Col N="635" /> the recent OPEC price increase, but the increase, which is phased, is not a major one and should not make a great difference in our export markets.  Consumer demand at home should be buoyant.</P>
    <P>The forecast balance of payments deficit, at £300 million, is supportable, given the buoyancy in our reserves.  But the need to maintain confidence in our currency adds to the significance of the size of the deficit.  It must not be allowed to increase much above the forecast level.  Therefore, fast growth must be accompanied by increased competitiveness so that we can have the greatest possible export growth.</P>
    <P>The target of a fall to 5 per cent in the inflation rate by the end of this year is ambitious but realisable.  Its achievement will depend upon there being the minimum possible internal contribution to inflation.  Participation in the EMS, to which I shall now refer, should reduce the imported element of inflation.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM</P>
    <P>
      <i>Exchange Rate Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Government have announced their intention that Ireland should participate in the new European Monetary System.  The commencement of the system, unfortunately, has been delayed because of the problem dealing with monetary compensatory amounts in agricultural trade. Discussions to solve this problem are continuing and it is hoped that the system will get under way shortly.</P>
    <P>This budget is framed on the assumption that the new system will be established soon but its strategy, which pre-dates the EMS and is based on the need to achieve fundamental national objectives, will be valid whether or not the system starts to operate in the near future.  That said, it must be added that our prospective entry into the European Monetary System brings a new dimension to budgetary policy and to economic policy in general.  In the past, policy has been framed on the almost unquestioned assumption of continued <Col N="636" /> parity between the Irish pound and sterling. Within the EMS, there will be a separate exchange rate for the Irish pound.  While there may not be a departure from the present one-for-one relationship with sterling for some time at least, I must nevertheless take account of the new parity obligations which participation in the EMS will involve for us. We shall be required to keep the parity of our currency stable, subject to narrow fluctuation margins, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other currencies in the system, which include some of the strongest currencies in the world.  Participation in the system will undoubtedly be to our benefit and will make a significant contribution to the achievement of the Government's objectives. Through its beneficial effect on import prices, it will assist in reducing the rate of inflation.  The greater monetary stability deriving from it will help promote the growth of trade and investment.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to understate the obligations of our participation.  We have at all times made it clear that the benefits of the new system will not accrue automatically.  The price to be paid by the participating countries for these benefits will be the pursuit of economic policies and disciplines appropriate to membership of the system.  This was clearly recognised in the Resolution of the European Council in Bremen last July which said that the member countries were &ldquo;firmly resolved to ensure the lasting success of the EMS by policies conducive to greater stability at home and abroad for both deficit and surplus countries&rdquo;.  It is my task to present today a budget which will promote stability, while also contributing to continued economic and social progress. The Government are committed to achieving a low rate of increase in domestic costs, irrespective of our joining the EMS.  Clearly, however, our performance on this front will be of crucial importance in the EMS context if strains are not to be placed on the exchange rate.</P>
    <P>Given the impressive performance of our economy over the past year or so there is every reason to feel confident about Ireland's ability to participate successfully <Col N="637" /> in the EMS.  Nevertheless, it will be clear that, in order to ensure sustained successful participation in the new system, management of the economy will involve paying particular attention to the balance of payments and the level of reserves.  In this, fiscal, incomes and monetary policies will all have a role to play.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Monetary policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>Monetary policy in 1978 was designed to maintain the external reserves at a level consistent with the longer-term economic aims of the Government in respect of output and employment.  In the event, the reserves at the end of the year, at £1,252 million, were higher than a year earlier. However, there were some less favourable aspects of the monetary scene in 1978.  For much of the year, domestic credit grew rapidly, helping to promote consumer spending and, for a time, putting considerable pressure on the reserves.  Some of the growth in the reserves over the year as a whole might be attributed to capital inflows in anticipation of Ireland's participation in the European Monetary System, but the prevailing position is a strong one and gives us a good base for participation in the EMS.</P>
    <P>It will be a major aim of fiscal and monetary policy during the year to maintain a strong external reserves position. The reserves are high by international standards, but the rapid economic development to which the Government are committed may increase balance-of-payments pressures. Given this situation, and at a time when an independent Irish currency will be seeking to establish its position on the international exchanges, it would not be appropriate to pursue policies that would tend to weaken the reserves.  At the same time, the Government's economic objectives require a positive approach to fiscal and monetary policies.</P>
    <P>The monetary policy measures for the year will be announced by the Central Bank.  The aim will be to ensure that the rate of increase in domestic credit will be sufficient to meet the genuine needs of <Col N="638" /> the community for productive investment and reasonable levels of consumption expenditure&mdash;thereby promoting the Government's objectives in relation to employment and inflation&mdash;without weakening the external reserves.</P>
    <P>Because of the unsettled conditions in international financial markets, largely on account of the difficulties experienced by the US dollar, the downward trend of interest rates was reversed in 1978.  The current high level of interest rates, which imposes extra costs on businesses and house-purchasers, is a cause of concern to the Government.  Successful participation in the EMS holds out the prospect of a greater degree of control over domestic interest rates.  The situation will be kept under close review, but we must not expect too much too soon.  In a world of mobile capital, no country can ignore global trends.  Within the EMS we can attain the lower interest rates some members already enjoy only if we follow the appropriate policies.  Membership gives us the potential to achieve interest rates more relevant to our requirements. It does not enable us to have lower rates unrelated to our inflation and balance of payments.</P>
    <P>Monetary policy must not be viewed in isolation.  Together with fiscal and incomes policies, it provides a set of instruments which, if applied coherently and, equally important, if accepted by the community, can contribute to the achievement of our economic strategy. A responsible attitude on the fiscal and incomes fronts will enable us to avoid sudden changes in monetary policy that might set back our economic plans.  The more we shirk moderation in fiscal and incomes policies, the greater the burden that will be thrown on monetary policy to maintain a balance in our external position.</P>
    <P>The foreign exchange markets, and international traders and investors, will be watching closely the direction of the Government's policies as an indicator of its determination to ensure the stability of the exchange rate.  The EMS, therefore, provides a further cogent argument in favour of adhering to the Government's commitment to reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement as <Col N="639" /> a percentage of GNP and to redirecting expenditure to productive purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Exchange control</i>
    </P>
    <P>As the House is aware, exchange controls now operate between this country and the UK.  This step was necessary to counteract the possibility of speculative currency movements as a result of the decision of the UK authorities not to enter the EMS for the present.  There has been a certain amount of uncertainty about the new controls.  The Central Bank and my Department have been engaged in clarifying various aspects with the financial institutions and individuals and I am satisfied that matters will settle down after a necessary period of adjustment.</P>
    <P>I want to stress again that the new measures do not affect the majority of people in any way.  Their purpose is to control capital outflows and to supervise inflows, so that the inflows can be regulated should the need arise.  Given public co-operation, I believe the controls will be effective in these respects.  It is not my intention to apply them in a punitive manner.  I would like to be able to ease their impact and I have asked my Department and the Central Bank to keep their operation under close review and to bear in mind the desirability of introducing relaxations whenever possible, consistent with the national interest.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Incomes policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to incomes policy, before going on to present the fiscal aspects of the Budget.</P>
    <P>Although a framework for wage determination is still under consideration, I have to form a view on the development of incomes in general, including wages and salaries, because of the importance of incomes for budgetary policy and the budgetary aggregates.  I reject as unduly pessimistic the proposition that the unrestricted pursuit of self-interest will prevail in pay negotiations this year.  Price restraint and the creation of jobs on the scale needed in our country would be totally incompatible with such an irresponsible attitude.  I believe that concern for the weaker sections <Col N="640" /> of the community and for the unemployed, particularly our youth, will evoke a responsible attitude on the part of all sectors.  As I shall show, this budget has been drawn up to give expression to that concern on the Government's part.</P>
    <P>In my Budget Speech last year, I announced personal tax concessions which would, in conjunction with pay increases of 5 per cent, improve real disposable incomes significantly.  These tax concessions and the earlier reliefs on rates, motor taxation, and social insurance contributions, expanded disposable incomes substantially in 1978 and will continue to do so during 1979.  The implication is that the scope for further increases this year is limited.  This view must influence claims and settlements over the next few months if we are to avoid inflicting major damage on the economy and, in particular, on job prospects.</P>
    <P>This conclusion is borne out by international comparison of unit costs as a measure of our competitiveness.  To achieve the White Paper employment targets, much larger markets must be created for Irish output at home and abroad in the face of competition from foreign output.  The average rise in unit wage costs in the European Community in 1979 will, on the basis of forecasts for the individual member states, be about 6 per cent; the rise projected in our main non-Community markets is of the same order.  An increase in unit wage costs in Ireland could be kept within such a figure only if further income increases this year are small.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on National Development said that, within the context of a ceiling on pay increases and a major effort to secure industrial peace, the Government would welcome an understanding with employers and unions on targets for the creation of employment and, possibly, changes in working conditions and policies in relation to non-wage incomes.  This approach has been developed by the Taoiseach who recently proposed that the trade union movement should come together with other community interests to give their full support for a five-year national <Col N="641" /> effort to achieve full employment.  Such an approach could assist an orderly development of industrial relations and incomes in 1979 and later years.  The 1978 National Agreement provided, ofcourse, for a basic increase of 8 per cent in 1978 and provided for the negotiation of a further 2 per cent at local level.  This limit was to be exceeded only where the Labour Court or an Arbitration Board so recommended or where a productivity agreement meeting certain conditions was made.</P>
    <P>In the event, the increase in average earnings per worker in 1978 worked out at over 16 per cent.  As the average increase in consumer prices was 7.6 per cent, real earnings per head rose by about 8 per cent.  This is among the largest rises in the standard of living of the average worker ever recorded in this country.</P>
    <P>This rapid growth in nominal and real earnings may have given satisfaction to those who enjoyed it, but its effects were neither universal nor were they economically commendable.  The inflation rate for 1978 could, but for the high growth in incomes, have been about 1 per cent lower and we could have got more jobs than the net 17,000 we achieved.</P>
    <P>Incomes clearly should not continue to grow in 1979 at the rate set in 1978.  It is only reasonable that a year which saw one of the highest recorded increases in real per capita income should be followed by one of pay moderation.  Largely as a result of the size and phasing of increases obtained in 1978, average per capita earnings this year will rise by as much as 6 per cent, even if there are no fresh pay settlements.</P>
    <P>The approach to an incomes policy set out in the White Paper and developed by the Taoiseach is based on understanding and consensus.  I earnestly hope that it will succeed.  I must make it clear, however, that if it does not the Government will not abdicate their responsibilities. We cannot allow a &ldquo;free for all&rdquo; to take place which would damage everyone's prospects but especially those of the weakest and poorest people in our community.</P>
    <P>There are some who might feel it unrealistic <Col N="642" /> to expect the degree of moderation in income increases needed to achieve our employment, growth and budget targets.  I want to emphasise that this restraint is not intended as a method of restricting the pace of improvement in living standards.</P>
    <P>We are confident that our growth target of 6½ per cent can be achieved provided the right policies, including the right degree of income restraint, are followed. If this is not done, and if excessive income increases were to occur, then our growth target would not be met, and living standards would rise at a slower and not a faster rate than we are aiming at.  The path of fastest improvement in real incomes lies along the route we have mapped out, and not in a paperchase pursuit of large money rises which are then devoured by large price rises.</P>
    <P>Increases in non-wage incomes this year must also be moderate.  There is a degree of discontent about disparities in the disposable incomes of different sections of the community.  The Government will pursue a comprehensive and equitable incomes policy to minimise these disparities as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Policy will be supplemented by measures to control price increases more rigidly if this becomes necessary.  While price control is working reasonably well, the Government will continue to monitor it to ensure the optimum degree of regulation consistent with economic efficiency.  I am also taking steps, as I shall explain later, to increase our capacity to counter tax evasion.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of 1978 Budget Outturn</i>
    </P>
    <P>I would like now to review briefly the outturn of the budget for last year, before going on to deal with the 1979 Budget aggregates and policy decisions.</P>
    <P>The 1978 budget provided for an Exchequer borrowing requirement of £821 million, or 13 per cent of GNP.  The outturn was £810 million, or 12.9 per cent of GNP.  Three hundred and ninety seven million pound of this was for the deficit on the current budget and £413 million was for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Current Budget 1978</i>
    </P>
    <P>The current budget deficit, at £397 <Col N="643" /> million, was £6 million below the estimate. This arose from changes both in revenue and expenditure.</P>
    <P>Tax revenue showed an increase of £74 million on the budget estimate because the growth in incomes led to more buoyant receipts from income and expenditure taxes than had been expected.</P>
    <P>Non-tax revenue was £14 million, net, less than the budget estimate.  The main reason for this was a shortfall in receipts from Post Office services, most of which, however, will be collected this year; provision for this has been included in the 1979 estimate.</P>
    <P>Current expenditure was £54 million over the budget estimate.  Sixteen million pound of this excess was for higher debt service charges and £38 million for excess expenditure&mdash;mainly pay&mdash;on the non-capital Supply Services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Expenditure 1978</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Public Capital Programme accounted for £798 million of the £843 million of capital expenditure in 1978. Thirty million pound more was spent on the programme than was originally foreseen and £139 million or 21 per cent more than in 1977.  The programme, by design, had a major stimulatory effect on the economy.  For example, £139 million was spent on industrial investment, mainly by the IDA, and industrial and agricultural credit between them accounted for £154 million of capital expenditure in 1978.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure outside the Public Capital Programme increased by £21 million, mainly as a result of the issue of £15 million equity capital to the air companies.</P>
    <P>Exchequer borrowing for capital purposes was £413 million, which was close to the original estimate of £418 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Exchequer Financing 1978</i>
    </P>
    <P>Sales of Government securities provided most of the new finance for the 1978 borrowing requirement, receipts from that source totalling some £554 million.  During the first quarter of the <Col N="644" /> year, no new money was raised on the gilt-edged market, but after that sales progressed satisfactorily and considerably exceeded initial expectations. Sales to the domestic banking sector accounted for some £67 million and to the domestic non-banking sector £187 million. A substantial part of the receipts, in the region of £300 million, came from abroad.</P>
    <P>The indications are that a considerable portion of this inflow may have arisen from external insurance companies and pension funds covering their Irish liabilities with assets denominated in Irish pounds in anticipation of our joining the European Monetary System. There was also some evidence of investment from abroad of a speculative nature.  If this investment flows out, it will have to be replaced with funds from other sources, but there are no indications so far that we are likely to be faced with a major problem.</P>
    <P>In 1978, six new stock issues were made.  Five of these were conventional fixed interest stocks and proved useful in adding to the range of securities available to potential gilt investors.  A variable interest rate stock was issued in July and though the initial response was disappointing, demand for the stock increased substantially towards the end of the year and an additional tranche of £10 million had to be issued in November to meet market requirements. Small savings through the Post Office and Trustee Savings Banks in 1978, at £65 million, were the second highest on record.</P>
    <P>New direct Exchequer foreign borrowing was kept to a minimum.  At £23 million net it was at its lowest level since 1972-73.  There was a considerable amount of activity during the year of a refinancing nature, either to repay maturing foreign loans or to replace loans with new loans on better terms. The new loans involve longer terms of maturity and lower interest rates than the loans which have been prepaid. These operations have reduced foreign debt repayments, relative to what they would have been in the absence of rescheduling, by £54 million in 1979, <Col N="645" /> £45 million in 1980 and £80 million in 1981.  The capitalised value of savings to the Exchequer in interest payments abroad is estimated at some £5 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Job creation 1978</i>
    </P>
    <P>In last year's budget, I described the Government's plans for a wide-ranging short-term programme of direct job-creation under which almost 22,860 jobs were to be created by the end of 1978. This programme&mdash;the most radical and ambitious in the history of the State &mdash;was vigorously pursued throughout 1978.  The overall results achieved exceeded expectations&mdash;24,533 jobs were created under the programme and 22,491 of these actually had been taken up by the end of 1978.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public sector</i>
    </P>
    <P>Job-creation in the public sector concentrated on areas of greatest need.  A total of 12,529 new posts was created, consisting in the main of extra health service jobs, additional teaching and clerical support posts in the education sector and additional civil service posts in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Prison Service and the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;10,487 of these posts had been filled by the end of the year.  The balance of 2,042 posts, reflecting the normal time lag between the decision to authorise a new post and the recruitment of a person to fill that post, will be filled early this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Building and Construction</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government's initial employment target for the building and construction sector was 5,000 extra jobs.  This was increased in last year's budget to 6,610 jobs, but the number of jobs actually realised, at 5,592, fell below this figure mainly because of industrial disputes, notably in the cement industry and local authority services.  The major contributions to the Government's job-creation programme for the construction sector came from industrial, education and hospital building projects.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Youth employment</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government's efforts to promote employment opportunities for young people met with a particularly heartening <Col N="646" /> response.  Last year I announced that the Government had given the go-ahead for four youth employment schemes suggested by the Employment Action Team, namely the work experience programme, the environmental improvement schemes programme, the recruitment of construction industry apprentices by local authorities and the Ballyfermot Community Survey of unemployment problems.  A total of 3,800 people participated in these schemes during 1978.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department of Education temporary youth employment projects scheme provided short-term employment for 1,170 young people and the numbers participating in AnCO's community youth training programme increased by 1,442 during 1978.</P>
    <P>The additional employment opportunities provided under the Government's special youth employment schemes in 1978 amounted, therefore, to 6,412 which, I am happy to say, exceeds by more than 1,400 the target set in last year's budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employment incentive scheme</i>
    </P>
    <P>Since taking office, the Government increased the weekly premium payable in respect of school leavers under the employment incentive scheme from £10 to £14.  In addition, the coverage of the scheme was expanded to include building and construction, hotels and catering and the services sector generally. Employers clearly found the expanded scheme to be a worthwhile incentive to take on additional workers during 1978: 10,410 new jobs were supported, 7,712 more than in 1977.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Overall results</i>
    </P>
    <P>All in all, therefore, the Government job-creation effort since taking office, through both the direct job-creation programme and the employment incentive scheme, resulted in the filling of well over 25,000 extra jobs.  I shall return to the subject of job-creation later.</P>
    <P Just="Center">GENERAL BUDGETARY REQUIREMENTS 1979</P>
    <P>Before I turn to deal in detail with the budget of 1979, I want to recall some <Col N="647" /> remarks I made on this occasion last year.  In my Financial Statement then, I singled out certain points for special emphasis.  These were:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the Government's overriding and firm intention to come to grips with unemployment and inflation,</P>
    <P>&mdash; the Government's determination to restore stability to our national finances,</P>
    <P>&mdash; the Government's expectation that the stimulus being provided by the budget would create conditions in which the private sector would take over as the engine of growth, and</P>
    <P>&mdash; deriving from these, the acceptance of an increase in public borrowing as a temporary feature of our overall strategy, with a reduction in the following years.</P>
    <P>The results of the Government's fiscal and economic policies are now on the record.  It is obvious that these policies had the desired effect of stimulating economic activity and generating the desired momentum.  As a result the Government revenues and capital resources were particularly buoyant.  We are confident that this buoyancy will be experienced also in 1979.</P>
    <P>Details of revenue and expenditure were provided last week in three documents&mdash;in the volume&mdash;Estimates for the Public Services; in the paper&mdash; Public Capital Programme, 1979; and in the White Paper: Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure, 1979.  I do not propose to delay the House except to mention a few points which might otherwise escape attention.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-capital Services 1979</i>
    </P>
    <P>Non-capital expenditure falls under two headings&mdash;the Supply Services covering day-to-day departmental expenditures and those services charged directly on the Central Fund.  If it were not for the extra provision which I am making today, mainly for public service pay, improvements in the social welfare services and job creation, the non-capital Supply Services, at £2,095 million, would register an increase of £140 million <Col N="648" /> or only 7 per cent on the 1978 outturn.</P>
    <P>The Central Fund Services show an increase in cash terms of £114 million, almost 25 per cent above the 1978 outturn. Two significant items account for this&mdash;debt service and the Irish contribution to the budget of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>Debt service costs are estimated at £512 million in 1979, an increase of £94 million, 22 per cent on the 1978 outturn. They reflect the full year impact of the higher interest rates which emerged during last year, as well as the full year cost of servicing the 1978 borrowing and the new debt to be raised in 1979.</P>
    <P>Ireland's estimated contribution to the EEC budget this year, at £64 million, shows a substantial increase over the 1978 outturn of £45 million.  This is due in large measure to the fact that we are now almost fully on the contribution system known as the &ldquo;Own Resources&rdquo; system.  Our 1978 contribution would have been significantly greater but for the transition provisions in the Treaty Concerning the Accession to the EEC.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Capital Programme 1979</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government's aim to redirect public expenditure as far as possible towards productive purposes can be seen clearly on the capital expenditure side.  Compared with the pre-budget increase of 7 per cent for the non-capital Supply Service, the provision for the Public Capital Programme this year, at £974 million, is 22 per cent greater than the 1978 outturn.  Of the total figure, an amount of £428 million, or more than 40 per cent, is being devoted to productive purposes such as lending by the Agricultural Credit Company and the Industrial Credit Company, grants by the IDA for industrial development and the farm modernisation scheme.  Some £277 million, or almost 29 per cent, will go to infrastructural expenditure&mdash;on roadworks, water supply and sewerage works and on electricity and telephone development.  More than £250 million is being provided for social investment, particularly housing and educational buildings and equipment.</P>
    <P>Of the total expenditure of £974 million <Col N="649" /> on the Public Capital Programme, almost two-thirds or some £640 million will be financed by the Exchequer. Another £39 million has to be added for capital requirements other than for the Public Capital Programme, bringing total public capital expenditure in 1979 to £1,013 million.  Resources available to defray this capital expenditure are estimated at £523 million, leaving £490 million to be found by borrowing.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Revenue Buoyancy 1979</i>
    </P>
    <P>On the revenue side, that is the resources available to finance non-capital expenditure, total receipts for 1979 are estimated at £2,467 million, an increase of £444 million, 22 per cent, over the 1978 outturn.  The tax revenue estimate of £2,092 million assumes a continuation of the buoyant conditions of 1978 and is based on a 6½ per cent growth rate for the economy.  It also takes account of the additional buoyancy that will be generated by the budgetary adjustments today.  The non-tax revenue estimate of £375 million includes an estimated £17 million in Post Office revenue under-collected in 1978.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Opening Deficit 1979</i>
    </P>
    <P>With a revenue estimate of £2,467 million and estimated expenditure on current services of £2,675 million, the opening deficit on current account is £208 million.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement on capital account is £490 million.  My opening borrowing requirement is therefore £698 million.  However, both the revenue and the expenditure sides of the account will be affected by the provisions which I am now going to propose.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE ALLOCATIONS 1979.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Job-Creation</i>
    </P>
    <P>The first proposal I wish to discuss relates to job-creation.  I have already reported on the success of last year's programme.</P>
    <P>Our primary national objective must be to ensure that employment is available for everyone seeking work. This is the main theme of the Government's <Col N="650" /> programme for National Development, which envisages a total reduction of 75,000 in the numbers out of work over the three-year period to 1981.  Our target for 1979 is quite specific; it is to get the numbers out of work down by 25,000.  The Government will spare no effort to achieve this goal. The importance of the attack on unemployment cannot be overstressed in the context of the Government's social policy.</P>
    <P>The recent White Paper describes the sectoral policies which are directed to the attainment of the Government's employment targets.  The main growth in employment this year is expected to come from the continued expansion of industry and the inflow of new projects through the efforts of the industrial promotion agencies.  The capital resources at the disposal of these agencies this year amount to £131.5 million, which is 38 per cent more than they spent in 1978.</P>
    <P>The Government, too, have reoriented their spending programmes in order to increase their contribution to job-creation. The 1979 Public Capital Programme and non-capital Estimates published last week provide for substantial additional job-creation in the public sector and in building and construction.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public sector</i>
    </P>
    <P>About 5,250 extra posts will be created in the public sector; 2,500 of these, the provision for which is £5.2 million, are civil service posts, mainly in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office.  New teaching posts account for a further 1,250, while the continuing expansion of the health services will provide an extra 550 jobs.  The balance of almost 1,000 posts will arise mainly in the Statesponsored body sector.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Building and construction</i>
    </P>
    <P>The overall provision for building and construction-type spending in the Public Capital Programme, at £600 million, represents an increase of 27 per cent on the corresponding 1978 allocation.  This is expected to give rise to the creation of <Col N="651" /> almost 4,400 jobs on various projects during 1979.  Hospital building, roads, sanitary services, AnCO training centres, State office building, harbour works and ESB projects will account for most of these extra jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special job-creation package 1979</i>
    </P>
    <P>The scale of job-creation in the agriculture, industry and services sectors, including the expansion of public sector and building and construction employment is unlikely of itself to ensure the attainment of the overall target of reducing the numbers out of work by 25,000.  I propose, therefore, to make a special provision of £20 million for further measures to support employment creation and maintenance in the economy, including a programme of residual employment activity along the lines described in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Civil Service posts</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have been reviewing the scope for a further contribution to job-creation by stepping up recruitment for the civil service in areas of particular need.  I am allocating an additional £2.2 million for this purpose which I estimate will support the creation of 700 extra posts, mainly in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Revenue Commissioners. The latter includes a special allocation of £0.5 million for the recruitment of staff to intensify the campaign against tax evasion.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Extra gardaí</i>
    </P>
    <P>A special provision of £0.8 million is being made to enable the authorised strength of the Garda Siochána to be increased by a further 500 in 1979.  This will bring the overall authorised strength of the force to 10,000.  The additional strength is designed to meet the growing demands on Garda resources, including the need for an improved police service in the cities.</P>
    <P>I am allocating an additional £5.2 million to the Department of the Environment for a special programme of job creation on environmental improvement schemes and road works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" />
      <i>Environmental improvement schemes</i>
    </P>
    <P>With regard to environmental improvement schemes, an extra allocation of £2.6 million is being made over and above the estimates provision of £1.68 million.  The total allocation of £4.28 million will enable local authorities to continue and expand the scheme, which is aimed primarily at the employment of young people; £0.5 million of the allocation is being specially set aside for work in the Dublin inner city area.  The total allocation is expected to support 1,000 man-year jobs in 1979, 250 more than in 1978.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Road Works</i>
    </P>
    <P>An allocation of £2.6 million is being made to increase employment on road works by up to 275 man-year jobs in 1979.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Retention of employment maintenance scheme</i>
    </P>
    <P>I announced in my budget last year that special assistance would be afforded to firms in the clothing and footwear sectors and some areas of the textiles industry, owing to the increased competition arising from the adoption of special employment measures in the United Kingdom.  This assistance took the form of a payment of £5 per week in respect of each worker on the payroll in the industries mentioned.  This measure is intended to be a temporary one, but the Government propose to retain this assistance in operation for a further year after 31 March 1979.</P>
    <P>To allow for the extension of the scheme, I am providing a sum of £3 million in addition to the allocation of £5 million included in the Estimate of the Department of Labour for 1979.  I am glad to say that employment in the areas in question, which have been hardest hit by the advent of free trade, was stabilised by and large during 1978.  The Government have taken this step notwithstanding the introduction of the pay-related social welfare contribution scheme in April 1979, which will redress to some extent the competitive disadvantages of the sectors of Irish industry concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" />
      <i>Work Experience Programme</i>
    </P>
    <P>The work experience programme, recommended by the Employment Action Team and announced in my last budget, encountered some administrative difficulties which delayed its launching until September.  Nevertheless, in the few months in which it was in operation, the programme met with considerable success and, by the end of the year, 1,685 young people had been placed with employers.  In view of this very promising start, I am making available an additional provision of £1.8 million which will permit the participation of approximately 6,000 young people in the programme during 1979.  The total provision for the work experience programme is, therefore, £3 million, which represents an increase in the man-year employment level on the programme from 1,500 to 3,000 man-years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Job creation in the education area</i>
    </P>
    <P>A sum of £1.4 million is being provided for job creation in the education area.  One million pounds of this is to enable the temporary scheme for youth employment operated by the Department of Education to be continued for a further year but at a higher level.  This scheme, which operates on the basis of proposals submitted by youth and sports organisations, has proved very successful both in creating employment for young people and in generating enthusiasm at a local level for worth-while community works.  The additional provision brings to £1.1 million the total available for this scheme in the current year and will enable 1,300 temporary jobs to be created, representing about 400 man-years employment activity, about 25 per cent more than in 1978.</P>
    <P>In addition, a sum of £0.2 million is being provided for the employment of 50 adult education officers, mainly in the vocational service, and a further £0.2 million is being provided for the appointment of 70 child-care assistants in special schools for the physically and mentally handicapped.  These appointments will be made in the course of the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" />
      <i>Employment of young people as development officers</i>
    </P>
    <P>On the recommendation of the Employment Action Team, a scheme will be introduced whereby voluntary organisations will qualify for special development grants to enable them to recruit young people for development work.  The scheme, which will be operated by the Department of Education, will meet the greater proportion of the cost of employing these young people for the first four years.  I am making a special allocation of £0.5 million for this purpose and this, I estimate, will allow for the creation of 100 jobs.  The details of the scheme will be announced at a later date.</P>
    <P>
      <i>AnCO</i>
    </P>
    <P>The allocation made in the Departmental Estimates for 1979 would allow AnCO to increase the number of training places available in its own centres, in spare capacity in private and public enterprises and under its community youth training programme, by 860 to 6,150.  In accordance with the Government's policy to ensure that adequate facilities are available to enable AnCO to improve considerably its contribution to the development of Irish industry, I now propose to make available an additional provision of £0.4 million. This will enable AnCO to increase by a further 220 places its training activities through the co-operation of external organisations, thus bringing the total number of training places to be made available in 1979 to 6,370.</P>
    <P>I propose also to make a special allocation of £1.5 million for the introduction, initially on a trial basis, of two schemes, first advanced in the Green Paper on Full Employment last June, which represent an imaginative and innovative approach to job creation, namely a Temporary Hire Agency and taxation relief in respect of residence-related work.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Temporary Hire Agency</i>
    </P>
    <P>The purpose of the Temporary Hire Agency would be to develop new opportunities for employment.  One major area where this could occur would be in <Col N="655" /> placement of workers on a temporary basis to deal with situations such as holidays, sickness or seasonal fluctuations in demand.  It is also expected that the agency can play a major role in arranging employment in local areas especially with residence-related works to which I will come shortly.  The agency itself would act as the employer for the personnel meeting these temporary or local employment needs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Relief in respect of residence-related works</i>
    </P>
    <P>In order to improve job opportunities, a scheme will be introduced, to operate on a pilot basis from 6 April 1979 to 5 April 1980, to give tax relief within certain limits for the labour element of expenditure by householders on their residences.  The relief will apply in respect of improvement and maintenance work for which the householder would not otherwise be reimbursed.  The operational details will be announced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Further provision to support employment creation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Many of the measures which I have described, particularly the increased provisions for the work experience programme, the environmental improvement schemes programme, the Department of Education temporary grant scheme for youth employment and the employment by voluntary organisations of young people as development officers, will improve the employment prospects of young people.</P>
    <P>The Government are also considering other possibilities for expanding employment opportunities, particularly for young people, including some further proposals which the Employment Action Team has recently made to the Minister for Labour.  I am, therefore, setting aside £3.2 million for the implementation of further employment creation measures which will be directed, for the most part, at young people.  The details will be announced later, but I would expect these measures to result in the generation of at least 1,000 extra posts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> The total of these special job-creation additions to the Estimates is £20 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Sector Pay</i>
    </P>
    <P>Expenditure on pay and pensions accounts for 49 per cent of the public service Estimates.  The total estimated requirement under this heading for 1979 in the Estimates as already circulated is £1,026 million.  This contains no provision for increases of a general nature which may follow the standard increases under the 1978 national agreement, or for any special increases other than those sanctioned by 31 December 1978.</P>
    <P>In the light of the Government's general approach to incomes, I am setting aside a sum of £75 million to cover all further pay increases, standard and special, and any additional cost arising from the annual revision of public service pensions.</P>
    <P>There are many claims for substantial increases in various parts of the public sector which, if conceded, would involve imposing savage tax increases.  Even if this burden were to be placed on the tax-payer, what would be the result?  The result would be a fresh wave of price rises, a further series of pay claims in private and public employment alike, until any apparent gains were quickly swallowed up by inflation.  We have only to look back to 1975 to see what happens when inflation takes hold.  Prices in that year rose by 21 per cent.  No one wants to start down that road again.</P>
    <P>If we are to make real progress, we must get this inflationary fever out of our system, and recognise once and for all that the only sound basis for increasing living standards is to have income increases which are related to increases in output.  While the size of the pay increases in such an arrangement may seem small, their real value can be greater, because the extra money holds its value.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear that I wish to see all public sector employees share fully and fairly in the fruits of economic progress.  There is no point, however, in groups pressing unreasonable claims to the stage of serious disputes and disruption. The resulting losses, as well as the consequential rises in costs, leave the <Col N="657" /> community poorer rather than richer at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable if the funds which might have been devoted to improving social services, meeting reasonable pay claims, or creating employment are swallowed up in losses arising from serious disruption of services or production.</P>
    <P>While many of the current claims are at a level which puts them completely out of court, I recognise that there are genuine problems in regard to special increases in the public service.  I propose to enter into discussions soon to explore the possibility of arriving at an orderly solution to these problems within the resources available.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government's foremost social priority will continue to be the creation of employment.  Job-creation benefits not only the individual but also his family circle; it deals with much of the poverty in our community at source rather than merely treating the symptoms.  Palliatives for unemployment are more easily prescribed than cures but they can be just as costly.  Until the cure is effected, however, we must be concerned to alleviate the symptoms and the Government are determined to maintain progress over the broad range of social services.  The opening up of new job opportunities in the health services and the provision of extra teaching and support staff in education are enabling significant improvements to be made in these services.</P>
    <P>For social welfare recipients, an integral part of the Government's programme has been to maintain living standards at least in line with the cost of living.  Excessive income increases do not make this task any easier: they both push up the cost of living and, by making industry less cost-competitive, hamper the reduction of the numbers of claimants for unemployment payments. Despite this, the Government have ensured during 1978 that social welfare recipients, with a year-on-year average increase of more than 14 per cent in the value of their payments, have not only kept pace with the cost of living but have <Col N="658" /> had a share in the general improvement in disposable income and living standards. The winding-down of price inflation has, of course, protected social welfare recipients from a rapid erosion of the real value of their weekly payments between one revision of rates and the next.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Increased Weekly Payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that the community would wish that social welfare recipients should continue to share in our growing economic prosperity by a further real improvement in the various allowances payable to them.  The Government have, accordingly, decided that there should be a general increase of 12 per cent in weekly rates of short-term social welfare payments.  The payments include unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit and maternity allowances.  Thus, in the case of a married man with three children receiving unemployment benefit, the increase will be £4.20, giving a total of £39.60 per week.</P>
    <P>In the social welfare context, the Government see old age pensioners and other long-term recipients, including widows, as deserving of special consideration. Their capacity for work and their living requirements are adversely affected by advancing years, chronic ill-health or the exceptional pressures of widowhood.  As a recognition of this, the Government have decided that the increase in the rate for long-term recipients and their dependants should be 16 per cent.  This will mean a total increase of £4.50 a week in the maximum contributory old age pension for a married couple, both of pension age and under 80.  A contributory widow pensioner with three children will receive an increase of £4.80, bringing her pension to £34.10 a week.</P>
    <P>The additional Exchequer cost of the foregoing proposals, all of which become effective from the beginning of April, is £40.1 million in a full year and £30.1 million in 1979.  I am sure that taxpayers will not begrudge this transfer of resources to the most needy section of society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" />
      <i>Children's Allowances</i>
    </P>
    <P>The scope for expenditure in the social services is such that the problem of improvements comes down to one of priorities.  Additional expenditure in recent years has favoured areas other than the social welfare children's allowances scheme, perhaps because of the fact that the scheme is not related specifically to need.  The Government have decided to give the scheme a priority this year.  I am providing accordingly for an average increase of some 28 per cent in expenditure, distributed as follows: 1st qualified child, from £2.30 per month to £3.50; 2nd qualified child, from £4.10 per month to £5.50; 3rd and subsequent qualified children, from £4.85 per month to £5.50.  It would not make sense if these increases were granted indiscriminately and without reference to relative needs.  They will be directed mainly to families in the lower and middle income groups and, as in the case of the other improvements in social welfare benefits, will help alleviate the impact of the reduction in food subsidies.  The direction of the benefits in this manner will be effected by reducing the child allowance in the income tax code by £22 per child.  Families not liable to income tax will benefit in full from the increases in the social welfare children's allowance. For income tax payers, the benefit will be the greater the lower they are on the income tax scale.  The increased allowances will be payable from the beginning of April next.  They will cost £11.7 million in 1979 and £14.6 million in a full year, against which there will be an offset of £3.5 million in 1979 and £5 million in a full year from the reduction in the income tax child allowance.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Unemployment Benefit for Married Women</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are committed to work towards the elimination of discrimination against women in the social welfare code.  They have actively supported the recent adoption of the EEC directive requiring the progressive implementation, within a period of six <Col N="660" /> years, of the principle of equality of treatment for men and women in matters of social security.  A first step in the implementation of Government policy, which I announced in last year's budget, was the removal of the special conditions for receipt by single women and widows of unemployment assistance. The White Paper on National Development indicated that the situation of dependent spouses in the social welfare code is being examined by an interdepartmental working party.  In the meantime, the Government are satisfied that a further substantial step should now be taken towards eliminating discrimination and they have decided to double the maximum duration of payment of unemployment benefit for married women, from the present 156 days to 312 days.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Means Test and Minor Improvements</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are also resolved to remove anomalies in the social welfare means test.  I am providing in this budget for a number of significant measures in this respect, together with certain other minor, but still important, improvements.</P>
    <P>These changes which, together with the longer duration of unemployment benefit for married women, will take effect from next April at a cost to the Exchequer of £0.7 million in 1979, are listed in a document which I shall make available setting out the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pay-Related Social Insurance</i>
    </P>
    <P>The changeover to pay-related contributions for financing social insurance benefits will commence in April. Contributions will then become broadly proportionate to earnings.  Lower-paid workers will benefit from this change and there will also be significant relief for industries, employing such workers, which are sensitive to competition from low-cost countries.  The new system will also bring an increase in maximum short-term pay-related benefits since these will now be related to a new ceiling of not less than £5,000 as compared with the existing ceiling of £2,500.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" />
      <i>Ex gratia Public Service Widows' Pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Ex gratia</i> pensions are payable to the widows and children of pensionable public servants who retired or died prior to the introduction of contributory widows' and children's pension schemes. Originally, these <i>ex gratia</i> pensions were at half the rates applicable under the contributory schemes.  In 1977 the proportion was increased to two-thirds of the contributory rate.</P>
    <P>Having considered further the position of these widows, I have decided to increase the rate of <i>ex gratia</i> pension, as from 1 July next, to five-sixths of the rate payable under the contributory scheme.  The estimated cost of this concession will be £675,000 this year and £1.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Veterans of the War of Independence</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am also providing some further improvements for veterans of the War of Independence and their dependants. Special allowances are paid to veterans who satisfy a means test and who are, therefore, in the less well-off category. Apart from revisions in line with increases in public service pensions generally, the basis of these allowances has not been altered since the early sixties. In view of this and the necessitous circumstances of those concerned, I have decided that the means test ceiling should be raised by £100.  This will give an increase of that amount to all allowance holders, over and above the increase which they will receive as a result of the annual revision of public service pensions.</P>
    <P>Last year, I introduced a telephone rental subsidy scheme for veterans living alone.  I now propose to extend this scheme so that a veteran living with his wife, or with an invalid, or with a person looking after him will enjoy the concession.</P>
    <P>I also propose to extend the scheme of funeral grants so that it will apply in respect of holders of &ldquo;duly awarded&rdquo; service medals.  I also propose to increase the grant under the scheme from £100 to £200.</P>
    <P>These concessions, which will apply from 1 July next, will cost an estimated <Col N="662" /> £600,000 this year and £1.2 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Education Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>A total of £399 million has been provided for education in the Estimates. With the approval of the Government, I am making an extra £2 million available in the budget to be devoted to improving educational service, in addition to the £1.9 million allocated to education for the purpose of job creation.  The Minister for Education will announce the details tomorrow.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Supplementary aid to the Arts</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have been in consultation with the Taoiseach regarding the financial difficulties of several of our theatres and other arts enterprises, particularly where capital sums are involved which are substantial in relation to the operational costs and the ability of theatres and other organisations to generate their own income.</P>
    <P>I have set aside, therefore, a sum of £500,000 to meet this particular need. Details of the assistance will be announced later, following consultation with the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Revenue Changes</i>
    </P>
    <P>The additional expenditure allocations which I have announced will add a total of £141 million to my starting current deficit of £208 million.  From this I am deducting £40 million for unspent balances in the hands of Departments at the end of 1978, giving a current deficit of £309 million.  Thus, taking account of the Exchequer borrowing requirement for capital purposes of £490 million, the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement for 1979 stands at £799 million at this point.</P>
    <P>Before presenting my specific tax proposals, I should like to stress that the Government's objective is to minimise the tax burden, to ensure that it is spread equitably and does not discourage personal and corporate initiative.  Many significant changes in taxation have been introduced already by the Government from which all sectors have benefited. The personal and corporate taxation concessions in last year's budget will cost some £130 million this year.  The <Col N="663" /> abolition of rates on domestic dwellings and the removal of motor vehicle duties from all but large cars will cost about £124 million this year.  The proposals which I will outline today are designed to carry our policies a stage further.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Personal income tax &mdash;Allowances, rates and bands</i>
    </P>
    <P>The increases provided last year in the main personal allowances for income tax purposes were unprecedented in size. They have been, and continue to be, of substantial real benefit to all income taxpayers.</P>
    <P>It is not to be expected that reliefs of such a large order could be repeated this year.  Nevertheless, subject to the resources constraint, the Government wish to give further expression to their policy of reducing the disincentive effects of personal taxation.  With this in view I propose a further improvement in personal allowances combined with an amendment of the lower income tax bands.</P>
    <P>The increases in the personal allowances will be as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the single allowance to be increased from £865 by £250 to £1,115</P>
    <P>&mdash;the widowed allowance to be increased from £935 by £250 to £1,185, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the married allowance to be increased from £1,730 by £500 to £2,230.</P>
    <P>The structural modification consists of abolishing the 20 per cent rate of income tax payable at present on the first £500 of taxable income and applying the rate of 25 per cent to the first £1,100 of taxable income, that is after the personal and other allowances, including the increases I have just mentioned, have been taken into account.</P>
    <P>These changes will benefit all married taxpayers, of whom some 21,000 will be completely freed from tax liability.  The great majority of other taxpayers will also benefit and about 19,000 of them will be freed from any liability to income tax.</P>
    <P>In the case of married taxpayers without children the liabilities, if not <Col N="664" /> removed altogether, will be cut by amounts ranging from £100 to £135 a year, depending on income.</P>
    <P>The effects for married couples with children will be broadly similar, but here it is necessary to take into account also two other budget changes which I have already outlined, namely, the increases in the social welfare children's allowances and the associated reduction of £22 in the income tax child allowance of £240 per child.  For those not removed from tax liability, the combined effects of the changes in income tax and in the social welfare children's allowances will be to benefit married couples by amounts varying upwards from about £100 a year in cases where their children qualify for the social welfare allowances.</P>
    <P>As regards taxpayers who are single or widowed without children, most of these will benefit by varying amounts. For those of them who are not entitled to any allowance other than the single or widowed person's allowance and whose incomes exceed £7,715, or £7,785, as appropriate, there will be tax increases not exceeding £15 a year.  If these taxpayers are, in fact, entitled to other allowances, these income points will be higher.</P>
    <P>The document &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo; gives further examples of the effects of the various changes I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The cost of these changes in personal allowances and in the tax rates and bands will be £30 million in 1979 and £47 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>For single or widowed taxpayers with dependent children there will be a substantial new relief which I shall now indicate.</P>
    <P>
      <i>One-parent families</i>
    </P>
    <P>A category deserving of particular consideration is the one-parent family. Where the parent of a dependent child or children is widowed, deserted, separated or unmarried, the special circumstances justify, in my view, the giving of additional tax relief.  I have decided that this should be done by the introduction of a special allowance of £250.  The allowance will apply as from 6 April next <Col N="665" /> and will be in addition to whatever other allowances and reliefs are available under existing law.  The cost of the relief will be £700,000 in 1979.  The necessary provisions will be contained in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Interest relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, income tax relief is given in respect of personal interest, including house-mortgage interest. This relief is a valuable one for householders who, it must be remembered, have also benefited from the abolition of domestic rates.  Since 1974, there has been a limit of £2,000 a year on the amount of personal interest qualifying for relief.  There have been many representations for an increase in the limit to take account of changed circumstances. I have decided to raise the limit to £2,400 a year, with effect from 6 April next.</P>
    <P>I have decided also that the relief ordinarily allowable should be scaled down appropriately in cases where an employee enjoys a preferential rate of interest. The reduced relief in such cases will be computed by reference to the proportion that the actual rate of interest paid bears to a specified rate.</P>
    <P>The necessary provisions to give effect to these changes in interest relief will be included in the Finance Bill.  There will be no net cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Trustee savings banks</i>
    </P>
    <P>The increase in the limit on interest relief will benefit house-buyers, so this is an appropriate point at which to mention a measure which will increase the amount of funds available to house-buyers.</P>
    <P>I propose to empower the trustee savings banks to grant house mortgage loans.  The overall limit on lending by these banks will still apply&mdash;15 per cent of the balances due to depositors&mdash;but, since their aggregate lending has generally been well within this limit, it still leaves them worth-while scope for additional lending in the housing area. The same requirements will apply in regard to the allocation of mortgage funds and certificates of reasonable value as are being applied by the <Col N="666" /> Minister for the Environment in the case of the building societies.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Permanent health insurance policies</i>
    </P>
    <P>At present, premiums paid under permanent health insurance schemes, which are schemes designed to maintain earnings during illness, are not allowed as deductions for tax purposes.  The benefits payable are not regarded as income chargeable to tax unless and until they have been received for more than a year.  It is now proposed that tax relief will be given in respect of such premiums but the benefits under the policies will be treated as taxable income from the outset. The change will take effect from 6 April 1980.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Business incentives</i>
    </P>
    <P>The tax and other measures taken by the Government during the past 18 months have afforded very considerable stimulus to enterprise and have created a climate in which the business world can plan ahead with confidence.</P>
    <P>The various substantial tax reliefs for families and individuals have operated to boost demand.  In addition, I introduced in last year's budget a package of tax changes designed to ensure direct relief for businesses.  Chief among these changes were the large increase in the profits thresholds for corporation tax and the improvement of the three-year scheme for an incentive rate of 25 per cent for manufacturing companies.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Export sales relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>I should also mention the new scheme, already announced by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, for the replacement of export sales relief.  The 10 per cent rate of corporation tax, which will be applicable to manufacturing profits earned from January 1981 to the end of the century, should act as a dramatic stimulus immediately and lead to continuing growth during the years ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stock relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have been asked to consider sympathetically the continuation of stock relief which, under existing legislation, is available for stock increases in accounting periods ending before 6 April <Col N="667" /> 1978.  This <i>ad hoc</i> relief was introduced as a temporary measure in the 1975 budget in recognition of the fact that, because of very heavy inflation, a substantial portion of the accounting profits of many businesses was, in practice, tied up in increased costs of trading stock.  It has since been continued, with some modifications.</P>
    <P>In considering the question of a continuance of the relief, it is appropriate to have regard to the reduction of the rate of inflation which has taken place.  The rate is now down significantly below the level which led to the introduction of stock relief and the grounds for continuing it have diminished, to say the least. However, I have decided to give it for a further year, on the basis of allowing threequarters of the relief granted up to now.  The renewal will cost the Exchequer £5 million this year.  The detailed technical provisions will be contained in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Investment Allowances&mdash;Designated Areas</i>
    </P>
    <P>I intend to move in the Finance Bill that the existing legislation governing the special investment allowance of 20 per cent for new plant and machinery in the designated areas be renewed for a further period up to the end of 1980, after which the proposed corporation tax scheme for manufacturing companies will apply throughout the State.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Allowances</i>
    </P>
    <P>At present capital allowances on new plant and machinery are given on the basis of gross cost; in other words, no deduction is made in respect of grants payable from public funds.  The effect of this is that the Exchequer gives tax relief in respect of a considerable element of expenditure which the Exchequer itself has borne.  This has always been recognised as anomalous and there can be no reasonable ground for complaint if this anomaly is removed.  I intend to do so in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Industry: General</i>
    </P>
    <P>Clearly, the direct Exchequer cost of tax incentives is not the only indicator of the Government's priority for industrial <Col N="668" /> expansion.  So, also, are the massive increases in the expenditure allocations for industrial promotion, development and credit, and for the infrastructural development needed to support industry. The general regime for industry is one of the most favourable in the world, comprising as it does an impressive array of incentives.</P>
    <P>The Government now look to private sector enterprise to make decisive progress this year towards achieving the national investment and employment targets.</P>
    <P>All enterprises, irrespective of size, have a part to play.  The contribution that can be made by small and mediumsized firms should not be underestimated. The Government are gratified by the tremendous response from such firms to the special investment loan facilities that are being provided for them by the Industrial Credit Company in conjunction with the European Investment Bank.  The favourable interest rate charged on such loans is made possible by the fact that the foreign exchange risk on the loans is being borne by the Exchequer.  This assistance will continue to be available.</P>
    <P>For business as a whole, 1979 is a year of opportunity and challenge.  Part of the challenge will be provided by participation in the EMS.  The potential benefits from participation are considerable. For their part, the Government stand by the assurance already given that, if any significant short-term difficulties should arise from our decision to participate in the system, the Government will respond in a positive and sympathetic way.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Value-Added Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>I come now to a proposal affecting value-added tax.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, one of the changes required by the EEC Sixth Directive on VAT, which was adopted by the Community in 1977, is the abolition of the first tier of the special two-tier VAT which applies at present to a limited range of goods.  As announced some time ago, the general intention is that from 1 March 1979 the first tier of the two-tier VAT will be replaced by appropriate <Col N="669" /> excise duties designed to match the part of the VAT revenue foregone.</P>
    <P>I have, however, received representations seeking a variation of that intention in so far as certain goods handled by the electrical trade are concerned.  The representations made have stressed the adverse effect on traders in the State of cross-Border smuggling of these goods and have sought an alleviation of this position through a reduction of tax.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are, of course, making every effort to prevent this smuggling and the associated tax evasion.  Having reviewed the position, I have decided, by way of concession, to refrain from imposing excise duties on two of the categories of goods in question, namely, radios and record players, but a VAT rate of 20 per cent will apply to them instead of 10 per cent.  This will bring the VAT treatment of these goods, from 1 March 1979, into line with that of other related items.</P>
    <P>The concession will cost about £1 million in 1979, inclusive of £0.3 million in respect of a special relief required in order to avoid double taxation of stocks which will have already borne the first tier of VAT.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agricultural Sector</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation of Farming Profits</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is estimated that total farm income last year was almost 140 per cent higher than in 1973, the year of our entry to the EEC.  That figure understates the actual improvement in the fortunes of individual farmers because farm income is now divided among a smaller number of farmers than was the case six years ago. Our main agricultural products have had the benefits of guaranteed prices and unlimited outlets.  Investment in farming is continuing at a high rate and the prosperity of agriculture&mdash;and of rural Ireland in general&mdash;is plain for all to see.</P>
    <P>This prosperity is highlighted by the 1977 farm management survey of An Foras Talúntais, published last August. The survey noted that:</P>
    <P>the standard of living enjoyed by a sizeable proportion of our farmers must have improved out of all recognition and that modernised <Col N="670" /> farming is very prosperous, with many farmers having assets, investment levels and incomes formerly associated with the world of commerce only.</P>
    <P>During these years, the farming community have continued to benefit from a degree of State support which is very considerable.  The Estimates for 1979 contain a total provision of £160 million for State aid to agriculture.  In addition, it is estimated that the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund will benefit Irish agriculture to the extent of some £385 million.  It is clear that Irish agriculture can no longer be regarded as an underendowed sector of our economy.</P>
    <P>It is against this background of increasing prosperity that we must look at the question of farmer taxation.  Farmers will pay about £16 million in income tax in 1979 and about £36 million in rates on land.  This total of £52 million represents a contribution of 5½ per cent of farm income.  Last year the contribution was £38 million, or 4½ per cent of farm income.  Making due allowance for investment needs in agriculture, the farmers' contribution falls far short of the share of income contributed in taxation by the rest of the community, as is clear from the fact that employees paid about £526 million in income tax in 1978, representing about 16 per cent of their earnings.</P>
    <P>It is equitable that such a thriving sector of the economy should move as rapidly as possible, without damage to its continued expansion, to the stage of full acceptance of its share of funding the community's needs.  It is only fair to say that comments from individuals and those in a representative capacity would indicate that the general body of farmers is willing to do so.</P>
    <P>In line with this principle, I am taking further measures this year to increase the farming sector's contribution to the cost of public services.  The threshold for liability to income tax will be reduced from £60 RV to £50 RV, making a further 6,000 full-time farmers, or 27,000 in all, liable for tax.  Also, the <Col N="671" /> multiplier which is used to calculate farmers' income on the national basis will be increased from 90 to 125.  This new multiplier is fully justified by reference to farm incomes in 1978.  As a result of these changes, farmers' income tax will yield about £30 million in the income tax year 1979-80, almost all of which will accrue in the calendar year 1980.</P>
    <P>There are two other income tax matters I should mention.  The farming organisations have drawn my attention to the possibility that a farmer who had opted to have his income assessed on the notional basis could find himself then being taxed on an income assessment appreciably in excess of his actual profits, because, under the provisions of the Finance Act, 1978, he must continue on that notional basis for two subsequent years.  This could happen, particularly in a case where stock losses occurred by reason of disease.  I arranged to have this problem examined in discussions over the past year between the farming organisations and the Revenue Commissioners. These discussions have now resulted in an agreed recommendation to the effect that a farmer may opt out of the notional basis at any stage, provided he remains on accounts for the year concerned and the two subsequent years; the Revenue Commissioners would have the right to demand accounts for the preceding one or two years of notional assessment and to reassess accordingly if the accounts indicated a higher tax liability.  I am pleased to accept this recommendation, and I will include provisions accordingly in this year's Finance Bill.  I consider that this arrangement will remove any danger of a farmer having to pay tax on an income he did not have, while at the same time it guards against the possibility of tax avoidance, which is the basic aim of the three-year requirement.</P>
    <P>The second matter concerns income averaging.  I announced in last year's budget that discussions were to take place between the farming organisations and the Revenue Commissioners about the possibility of providing for a suitable system of income averaging.  These discussions <Col N="672" /> are now nearing completion and I expect to be in a position to make the necessary provision in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agricultural levy</i>
    </P>
    <P>My final item concerning farmers relates to the cost of services.  In addition to the measures which are being taken to recover a proportion of the cost of the animal disease eradication programmes, the Government consider that the farming community is now in a position to pay for the cost of the education, research and advisory services specially provided for agriculture.  These are estimated to cost about £30 million in the current year.  The cost will be recovered by means of a levy of 2 per cent on the following agricultural products&mdash;cattle, milk, pigs, sheep, sugar beet and cereals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>These products will account for an estimated 90 per cent of total agricultural output this year.  The levy will be charged at the point of sale of the products into the processing stage and on unprocessed exports.  It will be introduced as from 1 May 1979 in the case of cattle and milk and as from 1 August 1979 in the case of the remaining products.  These are the earliest dates from which the necessary statutory and administrative arrangements can take effect. It is estimated that the levy will produce about £16 million in this financial year.</P>
      <P>It would defeat the purpose of the levy if it were to be passed on to domestic consumers through the price of food. The Government will be concerned to ensure that this does not happen.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Excise duties</i>
      </P>
      <P>The Government have decided that the various additions to the deficit on current account should in part be offset by an increase in indirect taxation.</P>
      <P>It is three years since the excise duties on tobacco products and alcoholic beverages were last raised and it is appropriate to look to these for an additional contribution this year.  I propose increases as follows&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" />
      <i>Tobacco products</i>
    </P>
    <P>An increase of 6p is proposed in the tax element in the retail price of the packet of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category.  Pro rata increases are proposed for cigars and other tobacco products.  These increases are estimated to bring in extra revenue of £16 million in 1979.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Spirits</i>
    </P>
    <P>An additional 6p is proposed in the tax element in the retail price of a glass of spirits.  This will mean an extra 3p on the normal half-glass measure.  This is estimated to bring in extra revenue of £10.5 million in 1979.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Beer</i>
    </P>
    <P>An increase of 2p is proposed in the tax element in the retail price of the pint of beer.  This is estimated to bring in extra revenue of £9 million in 1979.</P>
    <P>I also propose to increase the duties on wine, cider and perry.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Wine</i>
    </P>
    <P>An increase of 10p is proposed in the tax element in the retail price of a bottle of table wine.  In the case of stronger wines and sparkling wines the proposed increase is 20p per bottle.  These increases are estimated to bring in extra revenue of £2 million in 1979.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cider and Perry</i>
    </P>
    <P>The existing rate of excise duty of 5p per gallon on cider and perry has not been altered since 1940 and is now completely out of line with the duties charged on other alcoholic beverages.  Moreover changes in traditional methods of manufacture have led to a situation where it is feasible to produce cider and perry at a much higher than usual alcoholic strength.  Whilst this very strong cider would not constitute a significant proportion of total sales it is proper, nevertheless, that the excise duty structure should reflect the differences in strengths.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the excise duty will in future provide for three categories.  The rate for the lowest category, which includes ordinary cider and perry, will be 30p per gallon.  The rate for the intermediate <Col N="674" /> category will be £1.25 per gallon and the rate for the strongest category will be the same as the new rate for made wine, that is £2.466 per gallon. These changes represent an increase of roughly 6p in the tax element in the price of an ordinary flagon of cider.  The increases for the stronger cider and perry would be greater depending on their alcoholic strength.  It is estimated that these changes will bring in extra revenue of £200,000 in 1979.</P>
    <P>The various increases in excise duties will operate from midnight tonight.  They will yield £37.7 million of extra revenue this year.  It is estimated that they will have the effect of increasing the consumer price index by about 1.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy will make an announcement shortly about price increases on some of these commodities which have been recommended by the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Small Breweries</i>
    </P>
    <P>By way of concession, I intend to continue for a further year at a cost of £270,000 in 1979 the scheme, introduced in the 1978 Budget, which readjusts the incidence of excise duty on beer so that the smaller producers bear a somewhat lesser burden of duty while the larger producers pay somewhat more.</P>
    <P>TAX EVASION</P>
    <P>I indicated when dealing with the provisions this year for job creation that I propose a substantial strengthening of Revenue staff to intensify the campaign against tax evasion.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that some selfemployed persons, such as traders, landlords of residential premises and professional people, who would be liable for tax, are not making any returns of their income to the Revenue Commissioners. Even in those cases where accounts are furnished, there are indications that there may be evasion.  Some people in the community may not be making any contribution at all to the Exchequer when they should be doing so, or may be making a grossly inadequate <Col N="675" /> one.  I am determined that this situation must be tackled as a matter of urgency. Progress has been made already in combatting evasion.  Forms of evasion have been identified and dealt with by devising systems of control, as for example in the case of the taxation of certain groups in the building trade.  Back duty inquiries have been intensified in the special cases which come to the attention of the Investigation Branch.  These measures, however, are proving inadequate and it is clear that existing Revenue staff resources are not sufficient to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I am therefore making provision for a substantial strengthening of the staffing of the Revenue Commissioners in order to enable them to mount an effective and comprehensive attack on evasion.  The campaign will include such measures as examination in depth of particular accounts and, where there are indications of evasion, reconciling them with the general state of the business and the taxpayer's life style.  Evasion will also be followed up more intensively in the case of PAYE and VAT.  In future, more emphasis will be placed on legal proceedings, rather than compromise action, where the making of false returns is uncovered.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this deployment of resources will prove worthwhile from the point of view of revenue collection and equity among taxpayers.</P>
    <P>DEFICIT</P>
    <P>The revenue changes which I have outlined involve tax concessions amounting to £37 million in 1979 and tax and other revenue increases which will bring in an extra £57 million in 1979.  This gives a net increase in revenue of £20 million.  The current deficit will therefore be £289 million, compared with £397 million last year, a reduction of £108 million or 27 per cent.</P>
    <P>My final Exchequer borrowing requirement is £779 million, which is 10½ per cent of GNP, in line with the Government's policy commitment.</P>

      <i>Financing the 1979 Borrowing Requirement</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Domestic Resources</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards financing the borrowing requirement, it continues to be the Government's general aim to raise as much from domestic sources, particularly from the non-bank public, as is consistent with not depriving the private sector of credit for productive purposes and with not competing unfairly with other savings institutions.</P>
      <P>The ways in which funds are raised from domestic sources, in particular from the gilt market, will be kept under review.  I have recently added three new stocks to the range available to investors and it is my intention, given acceptable market conditions, to create some further securities during the course of 1979.</P>
      <P>The various savings schemes operated through the Post Office and the trustee savings banks will continue to be reviewed regularly with a view to improving them where practicable.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Foreign borrowing</i>
      </P>
      <P>As regards foreign borrowing, it remains the Government's intention, subject to what I have to say about EMS resource transfers, to keep our reliance on external funds as low as possible.  The volume of such borrowing will be decided from time to time having regard to the Exchequer's financing needs and the necessity of maintaining the official external reserves at an adequate level. The information available to me indicates that foreign funds are readily available if needed and that Ireland is regarded as a first-class borrower on the international capital market.</P>
      <P>
        <i>EMS resource transfers</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Foreign borrowing includes borrowing from the Community institutions, notably the European Investment Bank. Sums raised by the public sector from the bank have averaged £55 million a year over the last three years.  The position will change greatly as a result of the resource transfers negotiated in connection with Ireland's entry into the European Monetary System.  The loan capital available from the European Investment <Col N="677" /> Bank and the new financial instrument known as the Ortoli Facility, as well as loans under the separate bilateral arrangements, will facilitate the expansion of the Public Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>I have made no allowance in my budget estimate of resources for the capitalised interest subsidies payable in accordance with the resource transfer arrangements.  The Government have decided that these resources should not be allocated until the European Monetary System gets under way and the flow of funds commences.  There will then be a clearer view of suitable areas for their application in the light of actual participation in the system.</P>
    <P>PUBLIC SERVICE REFORM</P>
    <P>Given the massive expenditure on the administration of public business, the public service in a changing economy such as ours must be continuously adapted to ensure the successful carrying out of the Government's programme. The Government have fully accepted the recommendations on the most urgent areas for change identified by the Public Service Advisory Council.  The work of the Department of the Public Service in relation to organisational change has been concentrated on these areas.  In a budgetary context, two features of this work are particulary relevant to the need to get full value for money spent.</P>
    <P>First of all, the organisation and systems employed must be appropriate to the task to be performed and represent the most efficient way of getting the job done.  All energies are, therefore, being directed towards the early reorganisation of line Departments so as to bring about the application of at least the basic elements of the recommendations of the Public Service Organisation Review Group.  A continuous process of structural and systems development thereafter should ensure that Departments are constantly adapting to the needs of a changing environment.</P>
    <P>Structural change of itself will not secure the results expected unless the best people are available to the organisation. Apart from the general matter of personnel development, which is receiving <Col N="678" /> special attention, I believe that the successful adaptation of our public service depends in large measure on the freedom for individuals of talent to move through the public service to the positions in which they can make the greatest contribution to national development.  For this reason, I favour the greatest possible degree of mobility of staff in the public service and I hope I can receive the co-operation of the organised staff interests in achieving this objective.</P>
    <P>PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REVIEW</P>
    <P>As I announced last year, a system of reviews, complementary to the normal Estimates review, was initiated in 1978 in order to ensure that schemes of expenditure, which had achieved their original purpose or which changing times and circumstances had rendered obsolete, should be brought to an end.  The first results of these reviews are already reflected in the 1979 Estimates; this work will continue so that over a short period of years the entire field of Government expenditure will have been subjected to a systematic reappraisal. This will assist in reaching the Government's objective as expressed in the White Paper on National Development of ensuring that all expenditures will make an effective contribution to achieving national development.</P>
    <P>The past year has seen a growing recognition in all Departments of the need to develop a capacity for critical examination of their activities so that both on-going services and new proposals can be systematically reviewed and analysed.  Several Departments have already organised special sections with trained staff to carry out this function.  It is my intention to support and encourage this development. My Department will continue to foster the use of techniques such as in-depth analysis and management accounting.</P>
    <P>CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>In deciding on our basic budgetary strategy last year, two courses were open to us.  We could either tackle unemployment and inflation immediately or set about remedying the instability in <Col N="679" /> the public finances&mdash;an instability which was not of our making.  For reasons both social and economic, the attack on unemployment and inflation had to take priority.  Striking progress has been made in reducing inflation and, while we have a long way to go yet to banish involuntary unemployment from our society, it is very heartening to note that never in the history of this State have so many people been put to work in so short a time as under this Government. We are clearly showing by the performance of the last 18 months that the problem can be defeated.  The White Paper on National Development provides a clear statement of our aims and strategies.</P>
    <P>We achieved growth combined with a fall in the rate of inflation last year.  We want to go on doing just that this year&mdash;to hold the growth rate at the high level reached in 1978 and to get inflation down.  The danger as regards winning against unemployment and inflation by instalments is that partial success could encourage a presumption as to ultimate success and a slackening of the will to defeat these evils.  Only unremitting effort, combined with rejection of individual selfishness and excessive sectional self-interest, will prevail against them.</P>
    <P>The different proposals and decisions in this budget, looked at as a totality, present a common basic feature: they are very much a matter of striking a balance between social equity and fiscal equity, between investment needs and the resources available, between public sector action and private response, between getting rid of inflation and unemployment with all possible speed and the exercise of financial responsibility.</P>
    <P>Specifically, we are running a calculated risk in the fight against inflation by adopting certain expenditure decisions, for example in regard to subsidies. The same risk attaches to our decision to use a moderate increase in indirect taxes to facilitate income redistribution and to protect the interests of the weaker sections of the community, the unemployed and the lower paid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> There is a danger that the net effect on prices of the various decisions, which are clearly in the best interests of the community as a whole and the weaker sections in particular, may be seized on to support wage demands.  I hope that that proposition will not emerge, if not for reasons of community concern then in recognition of the direct financial benefits which this budget will confer on wage earners themselves.</P>
    <P>The Government do not ask for plaudits for observing their self-imposed discipline of reducing public borrowing to 10½ per cent of GNP this year.  They see it as a necessary part of responsible financial policy.  The pursuit of such a policy is also apparent from the reduction in the deficit on current account by 27 per cent and in the increase in public capital investment by 22 per cent as compared with last year.  Within this reduced borrowing requirement there is a marked shift in favour of investment, both in absolute and in proportionate terms.  Forty-nine per cent of last year's borrowing was for current purposes.  The proportion has fallen to 37 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>It might well be argued that borrowing equal to 10½ per cent of GNP is still too high.  I would agree, but the reduction already achieved is a solid indication of the Government's determination to adhere to their objectives.  It is my intention, with the full support of my colleagues in Government, to repeat the process of reduction next year.  That process may not be unduly difficult seeing that tax buoyancy will progressively reflect growing prosperity in the years ahead.  We already have a foretaste of that prosperity in the buoyancy of tax revenue today.  We could have made further reductions in expenditure, or we could have imposed more taxation, or we could have decided not to invest so much in the Public Capital Programme. In any of these various ways we could have reduced borrowing below the target of 10½ per cent.  We did none of these things because of the conviction that to have done so would have run an unwarranted risk of generating a deflationary tendency in the economy.</P>
    <P>I would not be content even with a <Col N="681" /> neutral budget.  The needs of the situation were for a budget which would be stimulatory but not excessively so, for a budget whose incentives would coincide with the full emergence of the response of the private sector to last year's fiscal stimulus.</P>
    <P>I have not allowed myself to be influenced unduly by the doubtful help of recent cautious-to-pessimistic economic comment.  That comment shared two general defects&mdash;first, of being framed in the absence of up-to-date budget data and without access to the knowledge of the fiscal opportunities which that data opened up and, second, of largely ignoring the fact that this Government are pursuing an integrated and well-documented economic strategy.  That strategy was first outlined by us when <Col N="682" /> we were in Opposition in the autumn of 1976.</P>

It has been fleshed out further and brought up-to-date in the White Papers issued by the Government.  It has been signally successful and, as this budget shows, we are not allowing ourselves to be deflected from our course either by the faint-hearted and over-cautious or by those pressing for the soft option.  The Government are doing their part.  They look to the private sector to do theirs and to the social partners for their full support in this great national effort.</P>

      <P>We were told constantly by the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and other Ministers that they were convinced they could get a rate of inflation of 5 per cent this year. Today the Minister for Finance has blown that.  He said his level of borrowing of £779 million is in line with the Government's target of 10½ per cent of GNP.  That means he expects GNP for next year to be £7,400 million.  That is an increase of 17½ per cent on last year. <Col N="700" /> If the figure is 6½ per cent, which the Government practically alone anticipated, that means the inflation rate for next year, on the Government's own internal counting, will be in the region of 10 per cent.</P>

That, in itself, is a backward step, but far more important from the point of view of the national interest is the fact that representatives of farmers' organisations and the Minister for Agriculture have been resisting the attempts of the EEC Commission in Brussels to impose a resource tax on farmers in the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is.  What else is it?  This is the second budget we have had this year.  Of course there was no reference to that today except in passing by the Minister when he talked about the allowances for old age pensioners. A further £22 million tax was imposed on 1 January of this year.  The total amount of tax imposed in that budget and in this budget amounts to nearly £80 million.  Reduced taxes and allowances have been given amounting to £37 million, which means that the gross extra tax imposed this month is in the region of over £40 million.  That is in addition to the £364 million increased taxation the Government say they are expecting in the Estimates for Receipts and Expenditure for 1979.  The levels of <Col N="701" /> customs, excise, income tax and valueadded tax have been increased today. They were increased by £365 million in the Book of Estimates published last Saturday and a further £20 million is going on them today, making a total of £384 million extra taxation imposed by this Government this month.  This is a 22 per cent increase in tax revenue.</P>
      <P>The Book of Estimates includes an item for an income tax increase of 37 per cent for 1979.  It appears that every tax-payer will be expected to pay extra taxation in the coming year under the income tax code.  There is nothing in today's budget to make me think that is not so. Early in his speech the Minister stressed the necessity for moderate wage claims in the coming 12 months for the achievement of growth, the expansion of exports and the maintenance of competitiveness. The Minister did not refer to the vital role played by Córas Tráchtála in exports. The amount of money being allocated to them this year over 1978 does not even match inflation.  Therefore they will not be able to pay the increased wages demanded from them.</P>
      <P>When last year's budget was introduced, the Minister used virtually the same language as he used today in saying that if wages went beyond a certain level the Government would find it necessary to do something about that. Virtually the same paragraph is included in today's financial statement.  I pointed out to the Minister at the time, and in many other debates last year, that because of the Government's stance, and because of the abolition of the wealth tax and the virtual abolition of capital gains tax, he could not expect ordinary workers to be moderate in their pay demands. I said he could not expect that the 5 per cent he was then advocating would be adhered to through 1978.  I said the result would be seen first in the private sector and would then overflow into the public sector.  I regret to say I was proved correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time the Minister used very aggressive language about what the attitude of the Government would be if the 5 per cent was exceeded.  During the past 12 months everybody on the benches opposite was mesmerised and hypnotised <Col N="702" /> while the country was being torn asunder by strikes.  They did absolutely nothing to improve our image abroad, or to come to grips with the industrial relations situation which is by far the most serious problem facing us.  I hope the Minister is not again using language just for the sake of putting something into his budget speech.  When he says he will tackle the problems imposed on the country by excessive wage demands, as he sees them, I hope he means there will be action and not just words.  In the past 12 months we have had a surfeit of speeches, seminars, admonitions and threats from all the Ministers&mdash; everything but action.  I hope that will not be the case in the coming 12 months.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that not one of the four Ministers who are supposed to be looking after industry and manufacturing has the slightest conception of what it means to work or to employ.  The Taoiseach is a lawyer.  The Minister for Finance is a lawyer.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is a lawyer.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development is a professor. Not one of them has the slightest experience or knowledge of what it means to employ anybody or to be employed, if we exclude the Minister for Economic Planning and Development who boasts that when he was a student he worked in Walls' ice cream factory in London.  I do not think that gave him real experience of work.</P>

      <P>I want to deal briefly with the reliefs in this budget.  Old age pensions have been increased by 16.1 per cent, which is welcome, but it does no more than keep them in line with the increase in earnings over the last two years.  We must remember that the increase given last year by this Government was 10 per cent and by April it will prove to be inadequate.  As well as that, there was no increase in October for social welfare beneficiaries and there will not be an increase for them next October. Contrast the 16 per cent given to old age pensioners with the complaints of those who are being charged tax on interest.  There was a £2,000 limit which has been increased by 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>I said that this budget was antifeminine, in spite of protestations from the Government. It is wrong to reduce reliefs for families with more than two children.  The benefit to parents with three or more children will be a farthing per week for the third, fourth and fifth child.  This budget is biased against large families.  The pre-1968 widows' allowances were increased by the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy R. Ryan, from a half to two-thirds.  They have now been increased to five-sixths but the Minister should have gone the full distance by giving them an extra increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will income tax payers think of the abolition of the lower band of 20 per cent?  What was the point in doing this? The people in that bracket are on low incomes and are barely into the tax system yet they are being asked to pay an increase of 5 per cent.  The £50 benefit received by a single man will be clawed back by 25 per cent.  The increase of £224 for a married man with three children is only a 10.1 per cent increase inclusive of the clawback.  There is no change in the bands with the exception of the abolition of the 20 per cent band which was of benefit to those who were less well-off.  If the Minister had been trying to keep in line with inflation he would have inflation-proofed the band. This contrasts strangely with the Capital Gains Tax Bill when inflation-proofing <Col N="704" /> was written into legislation.  People who make capital gains are inflation-proofed but the ordinary taxpayer is not to be inflation-proofed.  The lowest band of tax is now to be eliminated.  This is hardly the act of a Government with a desire to protect the lower paid worker and a desire to get a moderate pay settlement for 1979.  Whatever applause the Minister may get from his backbenchers, he will not receive any applause when the small print of this budget is examined outside the House.  The Minister should have concerned himself with trying to relieve the lot of the taxpayer instead of engaging in this cosmetic exercise.  If bands can be indexed for capital gains, which are a form of income enjoyed by the well-off, why not index them for the PAYE taxpayers who contribute more to the Exchequer than any other sector. To achieve a 4 per cent growth in real income in 1979, a man with two children would have to receive a 14 per cent increase in 1979.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the farming community.  The multiplier has been increased by 39 per cent which is more than twice the level forecasted last year by the Department of Agriculture.  It is almost four times the level of increase in farm incomes predicted by the ESRI for 1979.  All farmers will have to pay an increased amount.  The resource tax affects 85 to 90 per cent of commodities produced by farmers.  This tax will affect all our small farmers.  It could be argued that farmers will produce less as a result of the resource tax.  I do not understand how the Minister can say that it will not affect domestic prices. This 2 per cent will become part of the CPI and will be reflected in this year's inflation rate.  An increase in the inflation rate will affect this year's pay negotiations. If it was, as he claims, his intention to introduce a budget which would assist in achieving a moderate wage claim in 1979, he has failed miserably.  The lime transport subsidy, the beef cattle incentive scheme, the sheep headage grants, the small farm incentive bonus scheme, the poultry and egg scheme and the miscellaneous equipment grants have all been drastically reduced.  All these extra charges will be on the farming community for the next 12 months and they <Col N="705" /> will be reflected in consumer prices.</P>
    <P>A pay-related scheme will be introduced in April.  At this stage the Minister knows the level at which it will be set.  This will be a further imposition on employers and workers.  This is a further tax.  It could be set at 5 per cent perhaps so the man earning £100 a week, which is not unknown in most factories, will be paying £5 a week, an increase of £1.50 on what he is paying currently.  Why did the Minister not announce this today?  He will tell me it is not customary, that this is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare who will announce it later.  But, in fairness, it is one of the points that the trade unions will want to know about before they negotiate a new wage agreement&mdash;what is the level of the stamp going to be in April after the pay-related scheme comes in?</P>

      <P>It is a further tax being imposed later this year and, of course, a further increase in CIE fares or a cutback in services will also come later in the year because in the Book of Estimates there is provided extraordinarily £2.5 million less than was spent by CIE in 1978.  A subsidy of £37.5 million was given to CIE in 1978 and this is being reduced in 1979 to £35 million. The workers can expect an increase in bus and train fares apart from the 2 per cent imposed already by the budget on the consumer price index this month&mdash;less than 1 per cent early in January and a further 1 per cent here to-day in the increase in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Government that is now <Col N="706" /> claiming they will have 5 per cent inflation at the end of the year while they have within 30 days at the beginning of the year, imposed 2 per cent themselves. If you annualise that, it is 24 per cent. That is not very possible but I think it is obvious from the amount of the Minister's borrowing and his assessment of what the GNP will be for 1979 that even he does not believe his own figures, that he knows the inflation rate will be 10 per cent this year and is budgeting for it.</P>
    <P>How are we to judge this budget?  The Minister says he wants it to be seen as something that will assist the economy to further growth in the coming years. He wants it to assist in achieving moderate wage settlements and help in looking after the less well-off in our society.  As I pointed out, the lower tax band has been withdrawn, the 20 per cent band.  There is no indexation which is what the ordinary PAYE worker wants.  He wants increased allowances but he wants the bands indexed because he sees that this is the point where extra taxation comes in when he moves from the 25 to the 35 and so on.  This is not included in this budget although we looked for it in last year's budget.  We looked for it in the Finance Bill.  It was refused on that occasion by the Minister.  Yet indexation of bands was included in the Capital Tax Bill.  It is not included this year.  It will be seen as a budget that will add to the consumer price index because of the imposition of duties and because of the taxes imposed earlier in January by the removal of the food subsidies and the threat that further food subsidies may be removed at the end of the year. It will be seen as a budget that is very anti-farmer.  In spite of all the promises given in the manifesto of the Fianna Fáil Party before the last election and despite the most specific promises given on doorsteps by Fianna Fáil canvassers, farmers now find that they are more and more being dragged into the tax net at a very much higher multiplier and, on top of that, there will be a resource tax of 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>This budget is inflationary.  It will harm the economy: it will not achieve the moderate wage settlements that I <Col N="707" /> agree with the Minister are a very important part of what should be Government strategy for the coming year.  It will be seen as a failure outside the country&mdash;which is equally important&mdash;because it will be seen to be based on false figures.  The Minister referred to that when speaking and said the budget would also be examined outside the country.  When it is so examined I think it will be seen to be based on false figures.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the budget to encourage wage earners to moderate their demands, nothing to encourage taxpayers with large families to think that they were even being considered by the Government; nothing to make the social welfare classes feel that they will be kept in line with the earnings of other sections of the community.  There is nothing in it that would make farmers feel that what they were putting in for the last year was being appreciated and recognised by having no further impositions on them. What is in the budget is the opening of the door to introduce a tax on products&mdash;whatever they call it in the Commission&mdash;on all farmers in the country.  That is not in the national interest. If this budget with its inconsistencies, with an inflation rate double what is being forcast by the Minister is being examined closely in Brussels as I believe it will be, or wherever the EMS headquarters are, I believe the constraints imposed on this country will be far more severe than would be the case if the Minister had adopted a level-headed, forward-looking policy to ensure that the weaker sections of the community were looked after and had played fair with the taxpayer who will now see himself as being codded by the juggling of figures in the budget.  This budget will not be a success as it is anti-family, anti-farmer and not in the national interest.</P>

      <P>In making an assessment of this budget and whether it may have some positive contribution to make to the improvement of industrial relations&mdash;which need improvement on the record of recent months&mdash;the answer must be that if the main contribution <Col N="708" /> of the budget is towards alleviating the position of the PAYE worker it cannot be said that the position of such workers has been improved significantly as a result of today's measures.  It cannot be said that the sense of grievance felt by the majority of PAYE earners has been in any way mitigated by today's actions on the part of the Minister for Finance in his budget. The budget may gain the applause of some of the backbench Fianna Fáil people today, but it will require further close examination to uncover some of the rather unfair features of it.  Behind the headlines of the benefits it is supposed to be conferring lie a good many problems that have not been squared up to.  The total cost of income tax concessions in 1979 will amount to only £27.7 million. Prior to this budget the Minister met a representative group of trade unionists and they sought concessions that would amount to a minimum of £100 million. For their pains they receive for the remainder of this year concessions for PAYE earners amounting in all to 27.7 million.  Therefore, if this budget is to be assessed by the contribution it would possibly make to improving industrial relations, it has failed that test and cannot be said to take the tension which undoubtedly exists in industrial relations amongst PAYE earners.  PAYE earners at present are working under a very heavy tax burden and find that the only area in which they can seek to remedy that situation is in the wage contract itself.  Thus we have as good an explanation as any of why so many groups of workers in secure employment have been engaged in militant activity over recent months.  The tax position of the PAYE earner is basically responsible and this budget does little to remedy the grievance felt by PAYE earners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In saying this one must congratulate the Minister on his masterly sense of public relations.  This budget is a masterly exercise in public relations and the congratulations are all the more deserved when you consider that the Taoiseach has been complaining of late that he has not himself been having a good reception from the media.  This will not be the case with the Minister.  I understand <Col N="709" /> he is going on television tonight.  Last year it was the Minister for Economic Planning and Development who was on television, but this year the Minister will be there in person.  The budget he has presented today is constructed to gain maximum public approval. It will bear closer examination as to the benefits.  The Minister has taken prudent care to ensure that this budget is seen in the best light.  He ensured that other members of the Cabinet would announce the bad news earlier this month. The strategy that underlies today's exposition by the Minister is that there were cuts in public expenditure amounting to £57.7 million prior to the budget.  These include things like food subsidies, cuts in smallholders' dole assistance, and reducing the subsidies to CIE.  In time, of course, there will be increased bus fares but the Government will not be responsible for them&mdash;it will be &ldquo;Mac the Knife&rdquo;, someone who disappeared around the corner.  Bus fares go up through nobody's fault really, they just happen, though of course the reduced subsidy to CIE will be a contributory factor.</P>
    <P>Then there are the cuts in social welfare spending itself.  The Minister makes no provision in the Estimates published recently for public sector pay increases, so that has been remedied to-day. The Minister has made it clear in the figures given that he thinks that £75 million will settle increases in the public sector after the expiry of the national wage agreement.  One wonders whether that is a realistic expectation.  The Minister has expressed confidence that he has dismissed the pessimism of those who think that other counsels might prevail in that area, but he has nailed his colours to the mast.  He thinks that such wage expectations as there are in the public sector will be settled by a figure of £75 million in the latter part of the year. Of course he has dramatically understated the likely rate of inflation in 1979.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Estimate has been worked in a particular way.  He has pared his spending to the bone and he assumes the most generous forecast on the revenue side next year.  Therefore, his deficit is rather narrow as he comes here <Col N="710" /> today, and he can receive the applause of his backbenchers.  It is on this that one must essentially congratulate him. But the foundations on which this applause are based are relatively flimsy. Lots of things may go wrong and&mdash;dare one say it?  &mdash;the figures for the likely out-turn for next year may not be all that correct.  But the Minister has covered all contingencies in his contribution here this afternoon.  Near the end of his peroration he referred to the critics, the people about whom the Taoiseach has been complaining recently for not having given him publicity.  The critics, those lurking socialists in the Central Bank and the ESRI, those dangerous subversives, have dared not to believe and to criticise the figures on which the Minister rests the entire shaky gazebo of the direction of the economy for next year.

      <P>It was a masterly exercise in public relations.  I am a little sceptical as to whether the foundations on which these figures are so gaily paraded by the Minister this afternoon are secure and reliable.  I am citing certain institutions who have dared to question them, such as the ESRI and the Central Bank.  As I was saying, last Sunday the Minister for Economic Planning and Development dealt with those critics <Col N="711" /> when he said that of course they did not know what the Government knew.  He said they could not know either that the Government were pursuing a moderate wages policy over the coming year.  Certainly we could not know until today what the Government were doing, but it is open to anyone with eyes in his head to observe what was happening.</P>
      <P>Therefore, this budget cannot be seen in isolation from earlier events and earlier actions taken by members of the self-same Government.  Cuts in public expenditure have already occured. There has been a reduction in the food subsidies of £22 million and more reductions are to follow.  There has been the reduction of £9 million in the disease eradication programme now to be paid for by the farmers.  The small farmer's dole assistance is to be cut.  Cuts in social welfare are estimated at £15 million to make greater by contrast the kind of generosity announced here today and, of course, there was the cut in the CIE subsidy.</P>
      <P>When today's revelries are over there will be substantial increases in the social welfare contributions from next April. Of course they will not be referred to at this time, but undoubtedly they will bite deeply into the pockets of those who must pay for them.  While no Minister may be around to declare authorship of the cut in the CIE subsidy, they will result in higher fares at a later stage. They may be delayed until a later stage but they must come one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These kind of figures have led some people to believe that there is a likelihood of more budgetary action later this year.  That may well happen and some people believe it is possible.  A budget should be judged on its possible contribution to improve industrial relations, and I believe the biggest failure of this budget has been the manner in which it has dealt with the plight of the PAYE people.  They had been led to expect that in a period when the economy was growing as it has been last year&mdash;I am not entering into an argument about what level of growth may be achieved this year; there are many questions and <Col N="712" /> doubts about that&mdash;their situation would be dealt with more fundamentally than it has been in this budget with a total cost of alteration of allowances of £27 million when the trade union movement had asked for £100 million.  This is not a serious attempt to meet demands which have their origin in a deep sense of grievance felt by the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>The Government have primed the revenue side and have pruned the spending side so that there is a relatively small rise in the cost of the public service as we have gone into this budget.  The gap between spending and revenue has been narrowed by estimating a very sharp increase in revenue, particularly from taxation.  Tax revenue is expected to rise by 21.1 per cent and the yield from income tax&mdash;and this puts into perspective the kind of allowances that have been announced here today with such obvious approval from the Fianna Fáil back benches&mdash;is expected to rise by 37 per cent in the coming year.</P>
    <P>These are the figures.  There were the unpopular actions of the Government some weeks ago.  They permit the Government to announce the kind of budgetary strategy put forward by the Minister for Finance.  They permit them to give relatively good news to some on a foundation of continued high borrowing. The borrowing figure, which the Minister was pleased to see reduced to 10½ per cent, will be affected in the coming year by whether the expectation of the kind of growth in GNP is likely to be achieved.  On the basis of present policies there are people who doubt that it will be achieved.</P>
    <P>Therefore, one may doubt whether these figures are reliable and whether the kind of strategy announced today may be sustained in the coming year.  It is a fair point that the Government's revenue expectations may turn out to be false. Even if the employment increase occurs, which the Government say is projected, it is hard to see revenue buoyancy of the scale anticipated by the Minister resulting in 1979.  All of the figures produced by the Minister must interconnect during 1979.  If the employment figures are not achieved it will have adverse results for the tax revenue, and if <Col N="713" /> growth is not achieved other repercussions will follow.  Growth, employment, tax yield, as well as expected wage and salary levels are all interconnected and interrelated.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister wise in setting aside a figure of £75 million for the public service on the basis of present claims?  Is that a realistic expectation?  The Minister explained that the Government were pursuing a comprehensive and equitable incomes policy.  I do not know if they are.  Only the most enthusiastic member in the Cabinet could believe that.  After all we have heard today, the Government's approach to incomes and salaries in 1979 remains as deeply ambiguous as ever.  I would say that, having regard to the kind of claims being negotiated in the public service at the moment, the Minister's estimate of what he thinks may be realistic and acceptable figures in 1979 may turn out to be well off the mark.</P>
    <P>The Government appear to be facing both ways.  They are assuming a much lower rate of inflation applying to their spending and have a totally different approach to the question of their revenue yield.  Cut the spending and expand the revenue appears to be the kind of equation that is being followed by the Minister.  Remove the subsidies beforehand and distance the bad news from what would appear to be the relatively good news announced here this afternoon.  That is why I call this budget a triumph in a public relations exercise.  The increases in social welfare take place against a position, as revealed in the Book of Estimates, in which there was a cutback even in money terms.  Yet the Minister comes here today posing as the friend of the poor.</P>
    <P>We consider the increase of 12 per cent in respect of social welfare unsatisfactory. We would have looked for increases in the middle twenties on average rather than what we have got here today.  In the period February 1978, to February 1979 the consumer price index showed an increase of 10 per cent. Over the same period food prices rose at a higher level.  That means that the 10 per cent increase in social welfare last year was entirely taken up by inflation. We know that average incomes in 1978 <Col N="714" /> rose by almost 9 per cent in real terms. That means that those on social welfare lost by about 9 per cent as compared with those on average earnings. Therefore, there was a compensation of 9 per cent needed for the falling behind that occurred in 1978: there was an increase of 10 per cent needed to compensate for expected inflation in 1979: and there was also an increase needed to allow social welfare recipients to share in the growth in the economy that the Government are so confident of obtaining this year.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the relief given in the budget to income tax payers. It falls very far short of what was required. Before the budget the ICTU requested the Minister to provide for a figure of £100 million.  So far as we can make out, the cost of the changes will be £30 million in 1979 and £47 million in a full year.  The amount granted has come nowhere near what was sought.  That sense of grievance felt by so many PAYE people is a potent source of friction in industrial relations at present.</P>
    <P>The very least that we might have expected of a budget occurring in a period of very high conflict in industrial relations was a contribution towards lessening the tension by meeting the problems of PAYE earners.  It should not be forgotten by those who applauded the Minister's announcements this afternoon that, on the basis of Government revenue estimates for 1979, PAYE earners will pay an additional £194 million in 1979 at current tax levels.  Income tax reliefs amounting to £47 million in a full year and £30 million in 1979 will mean that the Government will get back far in excess of the very small allowances given to PAYE earners this year.</P>
    <P>Other members of my party will tackle this budget in a more comprehensive manner tomorrow.  Broadly speaking, my case is that the budget has done very little for the PAYE section of the population.  I cannot see the pressure on them being lifted by any of the allowances announced by the Minister. The Minister referred to children's allowances but when we turn to page 43 of the budget we note that the children's allowance <Col N="715" /> in the income tax code will be reduced.  One is inclined to overlook that fact.  The Minister is to be complimented on his masterly presentation.  There will be an element of claw-back in the new children's allowances.  In a quick assessment of the effects of the combination of income tax and the changes in the children's allowances we find that the married couple on an income of £5,000 per annum, without children, will save something like £2.12 per week or £110 a year and that the married couple on the same income with three children will save £1.67 per week.  When children's allowances are added to this their net saving as a result of this budget will be only £2.42 per week.  Their position as against that of a married couple without children is that they will be only 30p better off, that is 10p per child.  There are probably other examples of other anomalies which do not reflect any great concern in this budget for families with children.  On closer examination the changes do not appear to be as beneficial as one might think at first glance, and the Minister is unlikely to help the Opposition by pointing out these little flaws.</P>
    <P>The trade unions, as well as I, subjected the budget to an examination as to how it might contribute to improving industrial relations.  It has failed the test. The judgement of trade unions is that the budget has not altered appreciably the position of the PAYE earners and cannot be said to have helped in removing the tension which exists in industrial relations.  The PAYE earner's sense of grievance that he has to pay very heavy taxation is likely to continue.</P>
    <P>The estimate of growth can be questioned.  The figures of wages and salaries in the public sector can be questioned.  It cannot be claimed that the disimprovement in the living standards of low income families that occured as a result of the food subsidies being removed has been adequately met today in the terms announced by the Minister. A sociological examination has shown that a very high proportion of the income of low income families is spent on food.  We must remember the very bad effects of the removal of food subsidies <Col N="716" /> on low income families in considering anything we might say in praise or in qualified approval of the budget.</P>
    <P>All in all this budget does not merit the support of the working people and I am afraid it will not receive that support. At first glance the budget seems to give some improvement but on closer inspection it will be seen that the Government are still as insensitive as ever to what should be the redistributive role of a Government in a period of economic growth.  This budget will not assist the Government in getting the sort of wage agreement that is vital in 1979 if any of the figures, and the strategies behind them, on which the Minister based his case today are to be sustained.</P>

      <P>We are opposing this because the increases in the allowances are inadequate and these have been further diluted by the abolition of the 20 per cent band and by the children's allowance being reduced, not having been increased at all last year, and also because of increased taxes on farmers.</P>

      <P>We are opposing this resolution as well.  Could the Minister give us a more elaborate explanation of the rationale behind his reduction of the childrens' allowance from £240 to £218?  It seems to be a bit of a dutch auction, to say the least, in the context of the Minister granting some £27 million of income tax relief. He has indulged in a juggling exercise. The more one examines this the more apparent it becomes that there is a great need for an explanation by the Minister as to why he dropped the 20 per cent band and did not leave the child allowance of £240 alone.  One could have argued that the Minister should have substantially increased that allowance. The Minister should elaborate further on this decision.  The reaction of most people will be that £27 million in the context of £800 million for income tax is peanuts.  I find it impossible to understand why the Minister indulged in a kind of bring and buy sale.  It is difficult to understand the <i>rationale</i> of Cabinet thinking behind this move.  We should have comment from the Minister because there is a great deal of public confusion in relation to this.  Public assessment is that the effort at redistribution is very marginal and of very little consequence in terms of any impact on the people's expectations for PAYE relief.</P>

      <P>An allowance of £240 for a child is ridiculous when one considers the steady decline in the value of money over the years.  The figure has not been changed in recent budgets.  It is surprising that the change in the budget <Col N="720" /> is not upwards instead of downwards. We are all aware that a teenager at school or at college would cost his or her parents in the neighbourhood of £1,000 annually, with the exception of those who receive a State subsidy.  The Minister should have increased the allowance in respect of children just as he increased the allowance for married people. An allowance of £218 per annum is completely out of place for any child. This proposal is most disappointing. What is the value of a pound today compared with its value when the allowance was set at £240 per child?  In my view its value has declined substantially.  I must protest at this reduction.  We should have double the figure of £240.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Deputy Barry was correct in describing this as an anti-family budget and that is the reason we are voting against this measure.  Fianna Fáil are conscious of the effects of this measure.  They are trying to cloud their treatment of children in last year's and this year's budgets by reducing the allowance for children under the income tax code.  No increase was granted in the children's allowances under the social welfare code last year and the child allowance for income tax purposes was not increased either.  This year they have made a big thing out of their decision to give some increases under the social welfare code in respect of children but, for the second year in succession, they have failed to increase the income tax allowance in respect of children.  In fact, they have reduced that allowance.  It is a long time since the allowance in respect of children was increased under the social welfare or income tax codes.</P>
      <P>The cost of caring for children has increased substantially in recent years. For example, the cost of providing proper medical care for children has increased substantially as has the cost of keeping children at school.  It is unworthy of a Government who came to power to, according to themselves, administer equity to set the precedent of reducing the allowance under the income tax code in respect of children.  I must protest in the strongest possible manner against that move.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This reduction in child allowance will prove a sizeable blow to families with three or more children.  The Minister will no doubt tell the House of the increase he has given in children's allowances but I should like to tell him that while the increase in respect of the first child amounts to approximately 28 per cent this reduces to approximately 13 per cent for the third and subsequent children.  The two changes together will have serious repercussions on families with three or more children.  I cannot understand the thinking behind this move. The increase in the allowance for married people of £500 is infinitesimal for families with four or five children.  There is no logical explanation for this decrease in the allowance.  The Minister should have given a sizeable increase. This move is being introduced at a time when families are under considerable pressure because of increases in food prices and the withdrawal of subsidies.</P>

      <P>Briefly at this stage I would like to draw the attention of the House to the section of the Minister's statement in relation to personal income tax, the allowances, the rates and the bands.  The Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy O'Leary, has already referred with some force to the inadequacy of many of the measures contained in this budget but there are aspects of this section which need to be emphasised.  I am sorry not to have had, but perhaps we will get it later, a more detailed costing by the Minister of the separate items in the various concessions he has announced, because until we get this information it is a little difficult to estimate with any degree of accuracy whether any real transfer of resources has taken place.</P>

It is my belief that the estimated 40,000 people who will be <Col N="722" /> removed from the income tax net completely as a result of the removal of this lower band have in many cases been paying very little tax&mdash;on his own figures a maximum of about £100 each a year&mdash;and the cost of this concession to the Government, compared to what will be taken from these people by way of food subsidies and similar factors, will show very clearly that the supposedly generous act of taking 40,000 people out of the income tax net is purely surface dressing on a budget that does nothing substantial to redistribute income in the way the Government have claimed to be doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not conveniently have the figures that Deputy Horgan is looking for, although I have given the global consequences of the different steps.  As he said perhaps at a later stage the precise details can be furnished.  As regards the operation of this, the tables issued show how it works in different cases.  From what has been said by Deputies from the Fine Gael and Labour parties, I think what is concerning them here is the principle involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be utterly dishonest of anybody to talk in terms of reducing the child tax allowance and to suppress all reference to what is happening at the same time in regard to children's allowances, social welfare children's allowances, cash allowances and so on.  Of course one cannot treat one separately from the other.  Of course the two are tied together, of course the reasoning is that by doing what we did we have been enabled to give more money in cash to people receiving children's allowances but at the same time ensuring that the full benefit goes to those who are worst off, those who are paying no income tax, and that includes the people who are being taken out of the tax net that Deputy Horgan referred to.  By taking them out of the tax net one of the consequences for them, apart from others, is that if they qualify for payment of the social welfare children's allowances they get <Col N="723" /> them in full.  There is no clawback of any kind.  Similarly by doing this we are ensuring that the people on the lowest tax band are getting the maximum benefit as compared with those on the highest tax band who are getting the least benefit.  That is why that is done. That is why the combination of these two things, the increase in the actual cash allowance and the reduction in the child income tax allowance, enables us to give more to the lower paid, to those who are so badly off that they are not liable to income tax, for instance people on social welfare, and at the same time restrict the benefits of that to the higher paid.</P>
    <P>I noted with considerable interest that Fine Gael and Labour Deputies have gone on record in discussing this financial resolution as being opposed to that principle; so be it, and they are going to vote against it; so be it, and the people will note that with interest.</P>

      <P>Under the Minister's proposal a person with a taxable income of £1,500, which is not a very high figure, will have to pay an extra £65 in tax, an increase, from £350 to £415.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy some information but not all that he has asked me for.  The duty on a packet of 20 cigarettes of a popular priced brand before this resolution is 23.07p for excise duty, the payment to the trade would be 17.84p and the VAT would be 4.09p making a total of 45p.  After this resolution it will be 28.5p for excise duty; 17.86p would go to the trade and 4.64p for VAT making a total of 51p.</P>

      <P>On one ounce of tobacco the pre-budget duty would be 27.54p the trade would get 21.1p and VAT would be 4.86p, making a total of 53.5p. The post budget duty would be 32.58p, the trade will get 21.1p and VAT would be 5.36p making a total of 59p.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are the figures I have just given.  It will be 59p an ounce. On flake tobacco the pre-budget price was 64p and the post budget price will be 71p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On examination of these figures as given to us by the Minister we now find that a person buying 20 cigarettes of a popular brand is handing over directly to the State, through the shopkeeper, 28.5p.  An ounce of plug tobacco is 32.58p.  Mention was made prior to the budget that these old reliables were likely to be taxed. I was very doubtful that that would happen.  The smoking public here are already making their contribution to the Exchequer and despite what the Minister for Health and Social Welfare and others say about the adverse effects of smoking some people like to have a smoke and many of those people are elderly citizens.  The old men&mdash;or in some isolated cases the old women&mdash; buying an ounce of tobacco or a plug of tobacco will now pay about 6p extra for that product.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is not but I want to say that so far as the tax assessment on tobacco products is concerned it is grossly unfair to ask the smoking public to make such a contribution as this budget asks them to make&mdash;28.5p for 20 cigarettes and tobacco prices varying from 64p to 71p per ounce is a lot to ask.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I do not smoke but I would like to say briefly that presumably the argument in favour of this will be that <Col N="730" /> smoking is injurious to health and that is one way of reducing the number of people who will smoke.  It looks to me to be extremely harsh to impose about 6p on hard-pressed tobacco and plug tobacco, which I have not heard being described as being injurious to health.  Pipe smoking is usually enjoyed by elderly people on low incomes, and if this increase in duty is aimed at discouraging people from smoking cigarettes and thus improving their health, some distinction should have been made between cigarettes and hard-pressed tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise as a pipe smoker, like the Taoiseach and other Deputies, but I support the case made by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  The Minister for Health has frequently stated that cigarette smoking is seriously injurious to health, but I have not heard any pronouncement from him or any other authority that pipe smoking is injurious to health.  If the Minister for Finance has been taking into account the need to discourage cigarette smoking and to transfer the attention of cigarette smokers to the pipe, the increase in the price of pipe tobacco will not achieve that purpose.  We know that many elderly people in our institutions and outside them enjoy the comfort of pipe tobacco and this increase will impose a severe hardship on them.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I appeal to the Minister now, and I will do so again on the Finance Bill, to reconsider his decision in regard to pipe tobacco.  I have no objection to the increase in the duty on cigarettes but I have to the increase on pipe tobacco not because I am a pipe smoker but for other reasons: the necessity to attract people away from cigarettes, through which they inhale nicotine, and to the pipe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am touched by this concern for smokers.  The increases proposed now amount to something in the region of 10 per cent in the price of tobacco.  The duty was not <Col N="732" /> increased last year and I suggest it is fair to say that a 10 per cent increase in a two-year period is by no means unreasonable, taking into account general inflation in recent times.  Whatever about the merits or demerits of particular forms of smoking, I would be surprised if Deputies wished to argue that smoking as a form of consumption should be encouraged by comparison with other forms of spending.  For that reason I do not see the force of the argument for preferential treatment for tobacco users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance today told us that the product of these increases will be so many million pounds and he is assuming that smoking will remain at the same level and that he will have extra revenue from smokers to balance his budget.  Is it not fair to say that the tax was not put on to deter people from smoking but to get money for the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Any effect on reducing consumption has already been allowed for in calculations for additional revenue.  The fact that it is expected to take in more by way of revenue does not mean one assumes unchanged consumption. There would be some modest reduction in consumption as a result of these price increases.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister tell me what is the existing rate of duty on a glass of whiskey and what will the new rate be on a glass of spirits? What is the existing rate of duty on imported brandy and what will the new rate of duty be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing rate of duty on a glass of spirits is as follows: the duty element is 28.51p per glass, the VAT content is 7.09p making a total of 35.6p.  The trade margin is 42.4p bringing it up to a total retail price of 78p.  The effect of the budget increase will be to leave the trade margin unchanged at 42.4p.  The duty element will go up to 33.96p, the VAT element will go up to 7.64p, making a total tax content of 41.6p, an increase of 6p on the overall retail price from 78p to 84p.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Minister is increasing the excise duty on a glass of spirits, whiskey or gin, from 35.6p to 41.6p.  That is an increase of 6p.  What is the figure relating to brandies?  Take Hennessy, for example, what is the excise duty on a glass of Hennessy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know, the duty is the same.  The price is different because the price of brandy, exclusive of taxation, differs from the price of whiskey or other spirits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a difference formerly in the make up of duty on Irish produced brandy.  We can ascertain if there is any change or discrepancy during the course of the Finance Bill because I appreciate that the Minister is only standing in for the Tánaiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dependent on our smokers and drinkers for tax revenue.  We were not satisfied this morning that a person drinking a glass of spirits and contributing 35.6p to the Exchequer was making a reasonable contribution.  When this vote is taken, we will be putting an additional load of 6p on him by bringing the price up to 41.6p.  This is a savage increase bearing in mind that, for many people, drinking spirits is not a luxury. Many people, pensioners and so on, rely to a great extent on a drop of punch, whiskey or brandy.  The publican is now a tax gatherer but he does not get much pay for the job.  Publicans are now collecting this money but it is not their own money they are contributing, it is the drinking public.  We are leaning too heavily on them.  It is all very well to say you do not have to pay this tax if you do not drink.  Supposing that that admonition were taken seriously and we all decided not to drink any more spirits or beer, where would the country be, where would tax revenue be, where would the many people employed in the drink industry be? It is unfair to take advantage <Col N="737" /> of this budgetary proposal to add again to the burden of those who take a drink, particularly the elderly and those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>People living in rural areas often go along to the local pub, particularly on winter evenings, to have a chat with their neighbours.  Going to the pub and having a few drinks is their main form of social life.  The Minister is now, by this callous increase, depriving these people of that luxury.  Many workmen after a long day's work will feel like having a drink. There is nothing wrong with this.  It is an Irish tradition.  The Minister is now proposing in Resolution No. 4 to increase the price of spirits and in Resolution No. 5 to increase beer tax.</P>

      <P>I have a query in connection with the market which we have secured on the Continent, in the United States and Canada for Irish whiskey.  I make particular reference to &ldquo;Irish Mist&rdquo; and to the variety of attractive whiskies which are manufactured by distillers in my own constituency who give very good employment.  I am anxious to know whether this increase, as a result of the budget, will in any way affect the export price of whiskey particularly because of the competition between Irish whiskey and Scotch whiskey.  I cannot speak from experience but many of my acquaintances are reasonably good judges of whiskey.  Irish whiskey, particularly that which is exported, is very highly spoken of.  Those engaged in the production of this product have been the recipients of congratulations because of the very fine product which is exported to the United States, Canada, the EEC and to other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, Does the Minister see any danger that the increase which has been so unreasonably imposed in this budget will affect our export market?  Has his colleague, <Col N="738" /> the Minister for Finance, gone into this very fully and ensured that there will not be a falling off in orders from the Continent and in other orders for Irish whiskey which are the result of a big effort by Córas Tráchtála and those promoting the sale of Irish whiskey abroad.  I am sure the Ceann Comhairle sees the point I am anxious to make.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;my grave concern to the Minister for Finance about the effects of this resolution on Irish Mist and other high quality spirits manufactured and produced in my constituency. I hope this increase will not in any way affect the orders which have been coming in.  For that reason I would very much appreciate a guarantee from the Minister that the increase will not affect the export market and the valuable and useful work which has been put into the promotion of the sale of Irish whiskey abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This Financial Resolution must be opposed as we opposed Resolution No. 3 and will oppose Resolution No. 5.  The Minister for Finance said:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy will make an announcement shortly about price increases on some of these commodities which have been recommended by the National Prices Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An increase of 6p in the price of a glass of spirits is sizeable, with a further increase in the pipeline to be announced shortly.  This will have serious repercussions at many different levels.  The licensed vintners will be very much affected by this resolution and they will be very much opposed to it and to the increase in the price of beer and tobacco. <Col N="739" /> Trade will be hit.  On a previous occasion when there were sizeable increases, trade was hit and it took a long time for it to recover.</P>
    <P>Those resolutions will have serious repercussions and implications for the tourist industry.  The consumer price index is being increased by 1.1 per cent and that will mean an increase in the cost of holidays.  Many people partake in social drinking during the holiday period.  Everybody in the tourist industry will be worried about that.  To bring in a total of £37.7 million from these items is far too much.  The Minister said it was a 10 per cent increase over a two-year period, but the full effect is now being felt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made the point.  It is not usual to make speeches at this stage.  An opportunity to do so will arise more than once before the debate is concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I feel that an increase of 6p is a sizeable one.  It will affect employment opportunities in the licenced vintners' trade and will have serious repercussions right down the line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1.1 per cent is the combined effect of all the proposed tax changes.  The 1.1 per cent on the CPI relates to tobacco, beer and spirits.  It is not confined to spirits alone, which I understood Deputy Mitchell to suggest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no changes in the margins.  These are specific proposals to increase the total taxation on these items and, therefore, to increase the retail prices by the amount of the tax increases only.  There are no changes in trade margins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister assuring the House that there will not be an application for an increase in price next month or the month after?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What the Minister for Finance specifically said in his speech was that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy would deal with the question of any applications for price rises originating from the trade.  He said the Minister would make an announcement shortly in relation to applications before the National Prices Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to anticipate future events.  The issue before the House is whether additional taxation should be levied on these items in order to assist in financing Exchequer requirements.  Of course there are the possibilities of future price rises, not alone on spirits and tobacco but on many other items, because of cost increases throughout the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am trying to raise.  What is the gross effect of this move on the CPI?  The direct effect on the CPI is 1.1 per cent and that does not take account of demands, which inevitably follow budget increases, from brewers, distillers and publicans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of allowing additional trade increases because of additional budgetary adjustments.  The only way in which additional price increases would be granted to the trade would be for legitimate trade costs such as increases in wages, raw materials, or any other legitimate expense <Col N="741" /> which they might incur.  What we have before us is a proposal to increase the retail prices of these items specifically for increased taxation only.  There are no consequential effects on trade.</P>
      <P>In so far as I am aware, let me assure Deputy Flanagan that it should not have any adverse effect on export marketing of Irish spirits because there are no duties of any kind levied on export items. I cannot resist the slightly humorous aside that, as we get glowing tributes to the quality and merits of Irish spirits, we should encourage greater consumption of them abroad.  Let me assure the Deputy that there is no adverse effect on the export marketing of these goods.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to Deputy Murphy's concern with what he described as these &ldquo;savage increases&rdquo;. At the present time, that is, before the increase is imposed, the total tax content on the retail price of a glass of spirits is under 46 per cent of the total.  If he is really concerned with savage increases in taxation affecting the price of them, he should look at the behaviour of the Coalition Government which he supported. They were the ones who increased the total taxation content on spirits to a high point of something over 54 per cent.  Indeed, even at the end of 1976, the last point at which they were involved in it, the taxation was still of the order of 49 per cent.  Even when this increase is imposed tonight it will still have the effect of only increasing the total taxation content to something of the order of 49 per cent.  So, at no stage will we be imposing taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Forty nine per cent of a much higher figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>But incomes <Col N="742" /> have increased over the same period and so have prices in general.  I return to a point which I made earlier in relation to the tobacco taxation, namely, that there was no taxation increase last year, that the increase proposed here is again of the order this time of less than 10 per cent.  Six pence on 78p is just under 8 per cent and an 8 per cent increase in price over a two year period must be considered relatively moderate in the context of price and cost movements generally in the economy.  Therefore, I must totally reject the notion that this could be regarded as a &ldquo;savage increase&rdquo;. If there were to be any criticism of it I should have thought it would be for its being too light rather than too heavy.</P>

    <P>(3)  That the drawback on beer provided for in paragraph 7 (3) of the Order of 1975 shall, as on and from the 8th day of February, 1979, be calculated according to the original specific gravity of the beer at the rate of £67.976 on every 36 gallons of beer of which the original specific gravity was 1,055 degrees in lieu of the rate mentioned in section 46 of the Finance Act, 1977 (No. 18 of 1977).</P>

      <P>It is a mistake at this time to increase taxation on beer and stout.  At least 90 per cent of beer and stout is home-produced and this creates a great amount of employment here. This taxation will have implications for the tourist industry in that it will make holidays here so much more expensive. It is quite likely that the publicans will be suffering in that their trade will be affected adversely by such an increase.  We should have left the price of beer and stout alone.  It would be much wiser to have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do.  It would have been wiser not to have increased the price of this commodity.  The Minister should have left a wider gap between the price <Col N="746" /> of spirits and the price of beer because the vast majority of ordinary working people drink beer.  There should be some attraction towards the drinking of beer rather than the drinking of spirits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The duty element pre-budget is 14.92p per pint of stout, the VAT element 3.91p, making a total of 18.83p out of a retail price of 43p.  The proposed increase of 2p would be distributed as follows: the duty element would rise to 16.74p, the VAT element to 4.09p, making a total of 20.83p an increase of 2p on the retail price from 43p to 45p per pint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no harm for people who drink beer or spirits to know what they pay to the State when they order drinks.  Their contribution of 18.83p is quite adequate.  As Deputy Enright pointed out, beer and stout drinking is mainly confined to those in the lower income group, the non-professional people.  It is most inappropriate for the Government to impose this additional tax of 2p on beer at a time when we are trying to get co-operation from all sectors with regard to wage agreements and with regard to formulating policies that would be generally advantageous.  I do not think there was any need for this tax.  When this resolution is passed, if a man buys two pints of <Col N="747" /> beer it will cost him almost £1.  We are leaning too heavily on this kind of tax and I am sure many people will be quite indignant about it.  The Minister thinks that in two or three months it will be forgotten.</P>
      <P>I want to tell those people who drink that, according to the Minister's own figures, when this resolution is passed the State will be collecting 20.83p on every pint of beer.  It is as though they handed it over directly to the Exchequer. The cost of collection is negligible because the publicans and the breweries look after that aspect.  People are handing over 41.6p in respect of tobacco and the tax in respect of a glass of spirits will be 42.4p.  The figures for cigarettes, beer and tobacco&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The State is imposing too heavy a burden.  The well-to-do will not have any difficulty in paying the extra tax but we must think of the ordinary man and woman.  They will be paying additional taxation that I, as a public representative for quite a number of years, do not consider is justified.  I was in agreement with the Licensed Vintners' Association when they made a strong appeal to the Minister for Finance not to impose additional taxation on beer or whiskey.</P>
      <P>It may be that there will be a reduction in comsumption, something not foreseen by the Minister for Finance.  I would say that would be highly desirable but it will not have the effect the Minister hopes it will have, namely, to increase the revenue.  Many people depend on this industry for their livelihood and the State depends on it to keep the wheels rolling.  I protest vehemently against the increase in the price of beer and stout.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I should like to give my reasons for voting against the proposal to increase the price of beer.  Recently the Taoiseach appealed to the country <Col N="748" /> for restraint and, in particular, he appealed to the workforce to exercise restraint in wage demands.  I did not hear him but I understand the Minister for Economic Planning and Development was on the radio last Sunday and that he gave the general impression that the Government's job-creation target could be achieved if we were a nation of archangels and if everyone behaved perfectly and acted as he thought they should act.  This budget is an invitation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Resolution No. 8 is a general resolution and the Deputy may speak on it for as long as he wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I shall speak on that also. However, I am now speaking on the resolution proposing an increase in the price of beer.  This proposal is yet another invitation to the working man to be what the Minister for Economic Planning and Development would regard as unreasonable.  The food subsidies have been removed.  The price of food has increased; the price of cigarettes has increased as has the price of beer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The increase in the price of beer in addition to the other increases that have been trotted out in this budget, as well as the increases that have occurred between Christmas and New Year's Day, are an invitation to the workforce to take measures to indemnify themselves against the actions of the Government.  It is particularly unfortunate that the Government who profess to have a target of job creation should be <Col N="749" /> so unreasonable in their proposals in the budget.  No reasonable Member of this House should support the increase in the price of beer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a different view to express on this.  We have a high percentage of people on the verge of becoming alcoholics and our mental hospitals are crammed with alcoholics. In view of this and the seriousness of the problem would the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in consultation with the Minister for Finance agree to devote completely the money that will be collected as a result of this resolution, together with that which will be collected as a result of the resolution already passed in relation to spirits, to the provision of centres throughout the country for the treatment of alcoholics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not <Col N="750" /> relevant to the resolution.  It is a question of imposing excise revenue on beer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that whatever additional duty is collected as a result of this resolution will be spent to bring about an improvement or a cure in a vast number of alcoholics, rather than have it devoted to the usual State purposes.  If we take in money as a result of tax on beer we should employ it to cure alcoholics.  The State has not provided adequate finance to treat this disastrous disease which is brought about through the consumption of alcohol, and they have a duty if they take money from the people who drink beer and spirits to devote it to providing suitable homes and centres for the treatment of alcoholics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge it is not customary to refer to duty on cider or perry by the glass.  In the case of cider it is usually done by the flagon.  In this case the pre-budget position is a duty of 1.19p and a VAT content of 5.09, making a total of 6.28p per flagon of 38 fluid ounces.  The post-budget position would be that the duty would go up to 7.12p and the VAT element to 5.68p, making a total of 12.8p per flagon.  That would mean that the overall price of a flagon would rise from 56p to 62.5p.</P>
