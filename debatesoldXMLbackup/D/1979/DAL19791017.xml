    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> I have on numerous occasions, both here in the Dáil and outside, elaborated on Government policy in relation to Northern Ireland.  The most recent occasion was that of my address to the Airlie House Conference on European Community/American relations in Waterville on 22 September last.  The main principles of our policy are as follows.</P>
    <P>We recognise that within Ireland as a whole, and especially within Northern Ireland, there are two distinct political traditions, which have been sustained by the history of the last 70 years and given a fresh and sharper shape by the events of the last ten years.  We also recognise <Col N="3" /> that these divisions co-exist with large areas of common heritage, common interest, close social and commercial relations, co-operation and friendship at the individual, local, corporate and national levels.</P>
    <P>Our policy supports and aims to foster reconciliation between these two traditions.  We reject the domination of one tradition or another and seek rather to bring about arrangements which accommodate the full richness, vigour and diversity of both traditions.  We aim to build on what we have in common and to eliminate sources of division and rancour.</P>
    <P>We believe that, ultimately, the way to do this and to create permanent peace and stability in Ireland lies in the free and voluntary coming together of the people of Ireland under agreed political structures.  To this end we favour a process of discussion and negotiation between all parties involved which would ensure that appropriate structures rested on a wide measure of consent among the people of both traditions.  We offer no threat to the unionist section of the community in Northern Ireland.  We would be prepared to meet any reasonable request of theirs and to give such guarantees of their position as a minority in Ireland as a whole as would be necessary.  We are not at this stage advocating any particular structures of Government.  We believe that the process we propose would be promoted, without any question of imposing a solution, by a declaration by the British Government of their readiness to encourage the unity of Ireland, by agreement, in independence and in a harmonious relationship between the two islands.</P>
    <P>We utterly and unreservedly reject violence as a method of bringing about political change.  We have been and remain fully resolved to prevent use of our jurisdiction as a base for attacks on Northern Ireland or for the deeds which are repudiated and abhorred by the overwhelming majority of the Irish people. Here, I want to underline my strong conviction that not more than about two people out of 100 in this jurisdiction support <Col N="4" /> the violence of the Provisional IRA or the aims which distinguish them from all democratic parties in this House and to repudiate any suggestion to the contrary based on what I believe to be faulty methods and analysis on that particular aspect of the recent ESRI report.  We will continue our major effort, with a corresponding commitment of resources, to combat terrorism in every effective way possible within the rule of law.</P>
    <P>An approach based on security alone cannot succeed.  It is essential to promote change by peaceful and political means and to end the political vacuum and stalemate in Northern Ireland.  The immediate priority is, therefore, to establish in Northern Ireland a system of devolved administration which the majority of people in both sections of the community can support and sustain; because without such a system there can be no acceptance by both sections of the community of the institutions of government, no trust between the two sections of the community, and therefore no peace.  Indeed, I note that the recent survey by the Economic and Social Research Institute indicates the support of 78 per cent of the people here for such a settlement.  A similar poll carried out by the Opinion Research Centre for Independent Television News in Northern Ireland last July indicated a similar measure of support there for a form of government which would encourage both sections of the community to work together.  The major responsibility for devising the form and substance of such a system rests with the British Government but a solution will require the co-operation of the two Governments and of both parts of the community in the North.  Political progress must be away from any approach based on an increasing degree of integration of the Northern administration with that of Britain, to which the Government would be firmly opposed and which would have the most adverse consequences.</P>
    <P>Finally, we aim to encourage every development which brings Irish men and women of both major traditions closer together and enables them to get to know one another better and which <Col N="5" /> fosters contact and mutual respect.  We support all efforts to build on the great deal we all have in common and to promote co-operation in areas where mutual benefit is to be derived, whether it is in the joint advancement of areas of common interest in the European Community, cross-Border economic co-operation or co-operation in the arts, in the world of commerce or finance, or in social life.  In promoting the development of this Irish dimension of life on this island, we are not, at this stage, committed to any particular institutional expression of the undeniable reality.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the principles of the Government's policy, principles which I believe command overwhelming support among Deputies and Members of all parties in this House and among the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that his approach to Northern Ireland as expressed by him in an interview on RTE on 2 September, when he said that he sought a power sharing administration in the North without any insistence on an all-Ireland dimension is incompatible and totally contradictory to the 1975 Fianna Fáil policy on Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject entirely that suggestion.  On the occasion of the interview referred to I said that the establishment of institutions of administration to which all people in the North, certainly both traditions, could give their support and could sustain was a first priority and that did not abandon in any sense the all-Ireland dimension.</P>
      <P>I come to the statement of policy to which the Deputy has just referred.  Having enunciated the major principles of both encouraging the unity of Ireland and the withdrawal from involvement in the Six Counties on the part of the United Kingdom, the next part of that statement reads that we would promote in the interim the development of political institutions which will ensure civil rights and so on.  There is perfect consistency between that statement and what I have been saying since then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, for myself and my party, endorse everything in the Taoiseach's reply as representing agreed policy.  But is the Taoiseach aware of the widespread concern at the repeated allegations by Members of his own parliamentary party, repeated as late as last night, that in fact Fianna Fáil policy involves seeking a commitment by Britain to withdraw from Northern Ireland, a matter to which the Taoiseach made no reference either in his original reply or on the supplementary?  Is he aware that these repeated statements within his own party are disturbing public opinion and giving heart and encouragement to men of violence here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I state categorically that at the recent meeting&mdash;at which there was an attendance of almost 100 per cent&mdash;my party endorsed fully what I have said in my statement and endorsed fully the policy I have been pursuing on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  There is no question about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night on television statements were made by members of the Taoiseach's party that this commitment to withdraw is Fianna Fáil policy, was agreed at that meeting and, they alleged, was even contained in the communique.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's intention or would it be possible in the very near future to have some hours set aside for discussion on the statement the Taoiseach has just given the House as to <Col N="7" /> his considered opinion in regard to policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach abandoned the idea of seeking a declaration of intent to withdraw by the British and does he believe that devolved government can come into being, all the evidence being to the contrary?  Do these statements and suggestions he has made, with which very few could disagree, really mean anything other than continuing on as we have been without getting anywhere and not dealing with the cause but rather with the effect?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to take up the Deputy's questions because he is arguing and making statements.  I should like to answer his questions if he puts them specifically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not.  What I have been saying since in no way conflicts with what I have said or with the policy statement of 1975 which was referred to.  I do not want to repeat what I said in reply to the first supplementary question by Deputy Cluskey.  If Deputy Blaney will read it he will see that what I said is perfectly consistent with our overall policy and remains so.</P>

Can I take it that it is Fianna Fáil policy to seek in co-operation with the British Government a power-sharing devolved Government in Northern Ireland as a first priority and not to seek a commitment to withdraw in advance of such a political solution?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on his discussions with the British Prime Minister and subsequent discussions in London in which the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Justice participated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, these meetings took place against the background of the horrific events of 27 August which resulted in the death of Earl Mountbatten of Burma and three other members of his boating party together with the deaths of 18 members of the British Army at Warrenpoint and a civilian who was shot dead south of the Border.  The massive sense of revulsion which these deeds have generated has been well articulated by Government, Opposition and religious leaders, by representatives of various groups in our <Col N="10" /> society and by the media.  I have already stated publicly that the Provisional IRA were relentlessly and insidiously proving to be the real enemies of Ireland.  I think it is fair comment to say that the feeling of revulsion among Irish people generally at this recent spate of murders cannot be exaggerated.</P>
    <P>When I met the British Prime Minister on 10 May last we had a brief discussion on Northern Ireland and agreed that a further meeting would be held to discuss matters of common interest.  Pursuant to this, I had inquiries made in London on 26 August about a meeting in Dublin this month.  In the event, I received an invitation to attend the funeral of Earl Mountbatten and subsequently the Prime Minister contacted me, asking if I would take advantage of the occasion to meet her afterwards.  I accepted this invitation and, accompanied by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, met the Prime Minister, who, in turn, was accompanied by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Lord Privy Seal, in Downing Street, on 5 September.  Our meeting covered Northern Ireland and European Community issues.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the joint communique, the Prime Minister and I were both agreed that the existing extensive co-operation between the authorities in our two countries must be improved to the fullest possible extent to stamp out terrorism.  A number of suggestions in this context were put forward by both sides and progress in the development of these proposals was reviewed at the ministerial meeting on 5 October.  It was decided by both Governments that it was in the public interest that details of these security measures would not be made public.  For that reason it is not possible for me to give any information in this regard additional to that conveyed in the communiques.  I can say, however, that the question of so-called &ldquo;hot pursuit&rdquo; was not raised at these meetings.</P>
    <P>On the political front, the Prime Minister and I exchanged views about the prospect for political movement in <Col N="11" /> Northern Ireland.  Both at that meeting and the ministerial meeting on 5 October the importance of an early initiative leading to acceptable political institutions which both sections of the community in Northern Ireland could support and sustain was stressed by the Irish side.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland indicated that he was engaged in private talks with the Northern Ireland political parties and that he hoped before long to be in a position to bring forward positive proposals. We, for our part, indicated that provided the object of the British Government was to get back to a situation in which the political leaders could work together in the Government of the area we would support the endeavours of the Secretary of State.</P>
    <P>The current state of North/South economic co-operation was also discussed at the ministerial meeting and both sides expressed their agreement to continue such co-operation.  A number of Community matters which are likely to be on the agenda of the forthcoming European Council meeting in Dublin were also discussed at the meeting on 5 September.  These included Britain's contribution to the Community budget, convergence of the economies of the Community in a wider context, energy matters and the question of possible British membership of the European Monetary System.</P>
    <P>In conclusion it was agreed at both meetings that our respective Governments should maintain regular contact at all levels to review developments.</P>
    <P>I am arranging to have a copy of the joint communiques issued after the meetings laid before the House.</P>

      <P>All of you should be very happy over there, according to the leader of the Opposition.  He is claiming all of you at the moment from what I heard him say on the radio yesterday, but that is only by the way.  Will the Taoiseach state if consideration is and will be given to the concern, the interests and the impact on the people along the Border counties, south of the Border, in addition to the difficulties of the two communities within the Six Counties?  Secondly, arising from the Taoiseach's reply to several questions he answered just now, it appears that the agreement reached between him and the British Prime Minister had to do with two things mainly; one was seeking some sort of agreed government in the Six Counties&mdash;although it will never be a government&mdash;and the second was an agreement to stamp out terrorism.  Will the Taoiseach state if that is the sum and substance of what has taken place and will he also state whether the rumours that have been much peddled in the media regarding an air corridor come into part of this?  Will he also state if aiding and assisting the occupiers of one's country is collaboration in its worst form?  It is costing us <Col N="14" /> £1,500,000 per day which we could usefully use elsewhere.  If we are to co-operate with the British in security matters, to use the Taoiseach's words, at the cost of £1,500,000 per day, should we not send the bill to where it belongs?  Let them pay for it.</P>

He was asked by the press and apparently he told them&mdash;he did not tell the press a lie&mdash;that it was indicated to Deputy de Valera from a very high source in the party that the speech should not be delivered, that it was not in conformity in all aspects with Government policy.  It was only when the Government Press Secretary came back to me again saying that he was being pressed by the news media as to whether such a meeting took place that I said then that he could say to the press that such a meeting took place.

      <P>In relation to civil divorce, how much longer do the Government propose to wait before an Irish citizen brings them before the European Court of Human Rights on our failure to introduce statutory recognition of the situation where certain marriages terminate?  Is the Taoiseach aware that there is a considerable body of legal opinion that notwithstanding the constitutional provision Ireland in certain circumstances may yet again be dragged before the European Court of Human Rights because under Article 8 we have failed to introduce necessary legislation and that once again we will be denounced by the European Court, to our intense embarrassment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Attorney General on my instructions referred the matter of nullity of marriages to the Law Reform Commission. It has also been suggested to the commission that other aspects of the field of matrimonial causes and proceedings should be considered, namely the degrees of relationship and the law relating to the extent which jurisdiction here and abroad might be compatible.  As a first measure the commission decided to proceed on examining any change in the law of nullity and issued a report or a statement which invited comment from interested bodies. They apparently have not completed <Col N="19" /> that process or at least they are still considering replies that they got from interested bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the prospect that there may be an easement in relation to nullity, such is the structure particularly of Article 8 of the Convention of Human Rights that in relation to divorce this country may be found in breach of it in certain circumstances in the event of a citizen taking his case to the Court of Human Rights.  In that context, has the Taoiseach asked the Law Reform Commission at least to include within their ambit an examination of the general question of divorce before we find ourselves looking ridiculous again in the world?</P>

      <P>It is probable that the agenda for the European Council in Dublin in November will include an item on the economic situation which will permit discussion of employment, including the issue of work-sharing.  However, the present situation is that no formal proposals relevant to work-sharing have been made by the Commission.  It is expected that certain proposals from the Commission which will deal with excessive overtime and &ldquo;alternative training&rdquo; will be forthcoming shortly and that such proposals will come before the Council of Social Affairs Ministers during the Irish Presidency.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is satisfied with the analysis provided by the Central Statistics Office in relation to the discrepancy regarding the census figures between 1971 and 1979 and if there has been a net immigration to this State of 107,000 people in those years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is no discrepancy attaching to the Census of Population figures for 1971 and 1979.  What happened was that the pre-census estimates of population prepared on an on-going basis for 1972 to 1978 were too low because the level of net immigration in that period was underestimated.  The estimating process being used had given reasonably satisfactory results in the immediately preceding intercensal periods which were characterised by substantial net outward movement.  The change to a net inward movement in more recent years has affected the suitability of the method of estimation but this development could not be determined until a further census had been taken.  The 1972-78 estimates have now been revised in the light of the 1979 Census results.</P>
      <P>The actual population increase between 1971 and 1979 was 387,000.  In the same period the natural increase, births less deaths, was 280,000.  The difference of 107,000 measures the extent of net immigration, excess of inward over outward migration, in the eight year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister of State's reply, but in view of this enormous discrepancy from what had previously been the accepted method of measuring inward and outward migration could he tell us if the Central Statistics Office now propose to change <Col N="25" /> in any way their method of assessing such migration so that this kind of discrepancy, which I still question, does not occur in the next five years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The short answer is yes. Having a census like the recent census gives the corroboration required.  So far as future estimates of population are concerned, a number of relevant indicators will be utilised&mdash;numbers on the register of electors, number of children's allowances paid for children up to 15 years of age, natural increase and net passenger movements.  They will however continue to be estimates and will be subject to revision in the light of subsequent censuses.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office have already issued a press statement to that effect.  I can read the figures for the Deputy at this stage or circulate them later.  The Deputy will appreciate that part of the difficulty arose from the <Col N="26" /> lack of a 1976 Census and the fact that there will be a further census in 1981, which means that the information will be particularly good on a census basis in the future.  The figures for 1971 are 2.978 million; 1972, 3.024 million; 1973, 3.072 million; 1974, 3.123 million; 1975, 3.176 million; 1976, 3.226 million; 1977, 3.269 million; 1978, 3.311 million and 1979, 3.365 million.

      <P>Nothing that those estimates would indicate net immigration of the order of 70,000 during the previous National Coalition, could I ask the Minister if he could reconsider the question of the 1971 Census figures, noting the fact that at the time they were published there was discussion about their validity because the method by which the census was taken was not as effective as on other occasions.  At the time economists took the view that the figures were understand and failure to revise them would lead to a distortion in all demographic data in respect of these intercensal periods.  For these reasons, would the Minister of State suggest to the Central Statistics Office that they apply the new additional criteria to be used in the future retrospectively for the whole period 1966-79 with a view to seeing what revision of the 1971 figures would result?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 19, 20 and 21 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>VAT is charged on a very wide range of goods and services and I regret that I cannot make an exception in this case.  I am also influenced in reaching this conclusion by the very serious administrative difficulties which would be involved in confining any VAT relief to educational purchases and by the availability of State-financed schemes for assisting in the purchase of <Col N="30" /> schoolbooks in the case of students from low-income families.</P>
    <P>VAT is payable on schoolbooks in all but one other EEC country and on educational requisites in all EEC countries. As I have stated previously in this connection, the Deputies' suggestions would be affected by the constraints of EEC obligations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall that in reply to similar questions some months ago he clearly indicated that the primary reason for taking no action in this general context was an EEC directive? Could he say, if it is essential that there be some rate of VAT on schoolbooks, whether he would be willing to review the present rate and reduce it to a purely nominal charge consistent with having some rate on them just above zero?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in referring to the EEC constraints which prohibit additional zero-rated goods. One of the problems of introducing a nominal rate as suggested by the Deputy is that this is a further rate to be operated by traders.  Already we are assured that the number of rates involved is the maximum they can handle, that they could not handle another rate. There are other problems involved but from an administrative point of view this would present very serious difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the central issue the attitude of the Government to the price of schoolbooks in a situation where education is compulsory up to certain limits and whether or not the Minister will take the suggestion implicit in these questions as being just a small step to reduce the cost regardless of administrative difficulties?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate as I have indicated that in all of the other EEC countries except one VAT applies to schoolbooks.

I <Col N="31" /> can assure him that the problems involved are not easy to overcome.</P>

      <i>Notes:</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  Table 1 gives particulars of the type and value of all property which was assessed to wealth tax in the period from the inception of the tax in 1975 up to 5 April 1978.  The values shown represent the sum of the values for the three valuation dates when the tax was operative, i.e., 5 April 1975.  5 April 1976 and 5 April 1977.  Because of the manner in which statistics are kept, it is not possible to furnish particulars for each valuation date separately.  Information concerning cases assessed after 5 April 1978 is not yet available.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The values shown in Table 1 are net market values after deduction of debts, incumbrances and reliefs.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The value at (a) in Table 1 refers to property of every description situate outside the State; the values at (b), (c) and (d) refer together to property of every description situate in the State.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The land referred to at (b) in Table 1 is land of individuals only; land in the hands of discretionary trusts and private non-trading companies is included in the property at (d).</P>
    <P>(v)  Table 2 gives particulars of the numbers of persons assessed to tax on the property in Table 1.  The numbers shown represent the sum of the numbers for the three valuation <Col N="34" /> dates and where a person was assessed to tax for more than one valuation date that person is included more than once in Table 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the reply is lengthy and includes a tabular statement I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to circulate a copy with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the reply:</P>
      <P>Common customs tariff duties are not chargeable on the importation into Ireland of goods which originate in or are otherwise in free circulation in any member state of the EEC.</P>
      <P>Ireland, as a member of the European Communities, is a party to a number of preferential trading agreements and other arrangements which the EEC has entered into with certain third countries, under which certain goods imported from those countries may be admitted at nil or other rates of customs duty less than those shown in the common customs tariff of the EEC.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;preference&rdquo; countries fall broadly into four groups&mdash;</P>
      <P>The EFTA countries (Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland).</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Mediterranean&rdquo; group of countries.</P>
      <P>The ACP/OCT countries, comprising mainly the bulk of the African countries.</P>
      <P>The GSP countries, a world-wide group of developing countries and other territories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> The ACP, OCT and GSP countries largely comprise the Third World countries.</P>
    <P>Goods of the kind mentioned could attract preferential customs treatment, depending on the precise description of goods and the particular third country of origin concerned.  Footwear and household utensils would be likely to attract nil rates of customs duty except where imported from Spain.  Textiles generally would be likely to attract nil rates except where imported from Spain or Portugal.  The full rates of duty applicable to third countries outside of the preferential rates are set out in the Schedule of Duties to the Customs and Excise Tariff of Ireland.  Two copies of the current edition of this tariff as amended are available for examination in the Dáil Library.  The preferential rates applicable are also detailed in the various annexes in this tariff.</P>
    <P>The CCT rates of duty on the goods in question are set out in the following table:</P>

    <P>In addition to the aforementioned customs duties anti-dumping duties apply to certain goods in the categories mentioned.

Blouses, blouse shirts, shirts and similar articles wholly or mainly of synthetic textile fibres which are wholly or substantially produced in the Republic of South Korea are liable to an anti-dumping duty of 40 per cent <i>ad valorem.</i></P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst the responsibility for making claims to relief must ultimately rest with the taxpayer upon whom it is placed by Statute, THE GENERAL ATTITUDE OF THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE ONE OF READINESS TO ASSIST THE <Col N="37" /> TAXPAYER IN EVERY REASONABLE WAY.  Accordingly, the Commissioners desire that their officers should at all times, as far as may be practicable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  draw the attention of taxpayers to any reliefs to which they appear clearly entitled but which they may have omitted to claim, and</P>
    <P>(2)  respond freely to any requests that may be made by taxpayers for advice as to their rights and liabilities or for guidance in formulating claims to relief.</P>

      <P>Deputies may be aware that it was the original intention to introduce a single Bill to regulate both occasional and roadside trading but it has been found necessary to proceed on the basis of two Bills.  Legislation in this general area affects the rights of individuals and great care has had to be taken to ensure that the constitutional rights of persons are not infringed.  Very complex problems which could not be solved quickly were encountered when the question of regulating roadside trading was examined. In particular, in the case of outdoor trading which is carried on at public markets and fairs by virtue of Royal Charters and letters patent granted in previous centuries it was felt that it would take a considerable time, in view of constitutional difficulties, to arrive at an acceptable method of modifying, or perhaps even extinguishing, these rights and making suitable alternative provision for such classes of street trading as are deemed not to be contrary to the public interest.  Trading in livestock is one class of roadside trading for which adequate provision must be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> It was in these circumstances that it was decided to proceed with two Bills rather than one.  However, a draft of a Bill to regulate roadside trading is being examined and I hope to have it ready for circulation to Deputies at an early date.  I am not in a position to say exactly when but the intention is to avoid unnecessary delay.</P>
    <P>For some years past representations have been made by and on behalf of established traders, their staffs and their customers about the activities of traders who move into hotels, dancehalls, vacant shop premises or other places for a short time&mdash;sometimes a day or two, sometimes several weeks&mdash;for the purpose of retail selling.  These traders frequently advertise these activities as &ldquo;Monster Sales&rdquo; or &ldquo;Auctions&rdquo;. Provided these traders take out hawkers' licences and provided their use of premises as shops is not in contravention of the Planning Acts, they are not committing any offence.  A hawkers' licence costs only £20 and, therefore, this requirement is not a significant burden on occasional traders.  As regards the Planning Acts, it will often happen that premises are occupied and vacated before anyone has a chance of challenging the statutory right to use the premises as a shop.  Quite often it will be obvious from previous use of the premises as a shop that no contravention of the Planning Acts arises and, at times, the position of premises under the Planning Acts can be quite obscure.  The overall situation is that if a person takes out a hawkers' licence he or she has little if anything to fear from the law.</P>
    <P>Occasional trading was studied by the Restrictive Practices Commission at the request of the Minister in 1976 and their report was published.  All of the submissions made to the commission and all the representations made to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy have been critical of occasional traders.  No one has made a submission supporting them.  Those who made submissions to the commission and to the Department included the Irish Union of Distributive Workers and Clerks, trade associations, <Col N="108" /> individual traders, chambers of commerce, local development associations and local authorities.</P>
    <P>Occasional trading was described by the Irish Union of Distributive Workers and Clerks as a form of piracy which took a considerable amount of trade out of a town, affected sales in particular goods for a considerable time ahead and threatened employment in the distributive sector.  All bodies which made submissions to the Restrictive Practices Commission agreed in saying that occasional trading was unfair because the organisers of such trading were in a privileged position since they did not incur the expenses of overheads, taxes and other commitments which local traders have to meet.  Selling at dumped prices was also alleged.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the Minister for Finance included a provision in this year's Finance Act for the collection of VAT at the point of importation from traders who have no permanent place of business in the State.  Furthermore, I am assured that the Revenue Commissioners have taken steps to collect the appropriate taxes from occasional traders.  However, it is clear that, even if these traders pay their full taxes, they do enjoy a competitive advantage over established traders and on account of their mobility, it is frequently difficult for consumers to get any sort of after-sales service from them.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission were urged by the Irish Union of Distributive Workers and Clerks and other bodies to recommend prohibition of occasional trading.  I think it is a fair summation of the Restrictive Practices Commission report to say that, in several respects, the complaint about occasional traders was found to be over-stated. Nevertheless the commission accepted that there were particular risks to the consumers in occasional sales and that such sales can have a severe if temporary effect on local traders in the goods concerned.  The commission did not consider the total prohibition of occasional trading to be feasible.  They pointed out that manufacturers and wholesalers regularly rent rooms in <Col N="109" /> hotels for the display of their goods and their sale to traders.  But the commission recommended that where a person engages in retail trading for a brief period in a place where he does not usually reside or carry on business he should require a permit from the local authority in respect of each day's trading.</P>
    <P>This recommendation has, basically, been accepted but it has been decided that the permits to engage in occasional trading should be granted by the Minister rather than the local authority.</P>
    <P>The Occasional Trading Bill proposes in section 2 to define occasional trading as retailing at a premises or place&mdash;other than a public road or other place to which the public has access as of right&mdash;of which the person so selling has been in continuous occupation for less than three months.  A very limited range of selling activities which are deemed not to be contrary to the public interest are excluded from the definition. Sections 3 and 4 provide that persons proposing to engage in trading to which the Bill applies will be required to apply in writing to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy for a permit which will cost £50 plus £25 for every day or part of a day on which he proposes to trade at the one place.  This application for a permit will have to be made 30 days before trading commences. The Minister may attach conditions to the permit.  A person who proposes to trade at the one place for longer than three months&mdash;that is to say a person who proposes to be a permanent or established trader at the one place&mdash;need not take out a permit if he makes a statutory declaration of his intention and gives the statement to the Minister.  Section 5 provides that a person engaging in occasional trading will be required to display his occasional trading permit at or near the place where the trading takes place.  Section 7 requires an advertisement relating to occasional trading to contain the number of the trading permit and the name and address of the person to whom it was issued.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the <Col N="110" /> proposed legislation.  A person intending to engage in occasional trading will have to give reasonable notice of his intentions; he will have to make a reasonable contribution to the Exchequer which, while it may seem large to some people, is unlikely to go further than meeting the cost of administering the Act; and an occasional trader will have to let his customers and other interested parties verify that he has paid for a permit and make a note of his name and permanent address in case they have any reason for wanting to get in touch with him at a later date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I am glad to see that an effort is being made to come to grips with this very real and grave problem which besets many communities, in particular those involved in trading.  However, I wish to express my disappointment at the fact that after such a long time we are now left with&mdash;the Minister will recognise the Irish word&mdash;the orcán, the weak piglet in the litter, the weakling of the species. <Col N="111" /> The main problems arise out of roadside and street trading.</P>
    <P>Approximately one-fifth of the Minister's speech is devoted to an apology for not being in a position to provide legislation for this main difficulty, roadside and street trading.  She has mentioned that it is a very complex area producing many problems that cannot be solved quickly, maintaining that it would take a considerable time, in view of constitutional difficulties, to arrive at an acceptable method of modifying the law in regard to these types of activities. This follows repeated assurances from the Minister present and her colleague in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy Burke, that legislation concerned specifically with these areas would be forthcoming.  Indeed, promises were made 18 months ago that it would be produced before Christmas 1978.  After this long delay we have now a Bill presented to us which concerns a specific area of activity, which is a problem area.  Let me put it to the Minister&mdash;and this emerges also from the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission&mdash;that this would seem to constitute the smallest problem area of the three mentioned, namely, the area of trading from temporary retail outlets.</P>
    <P>The inherent problem is that casual traders have always been with us.  As the Minister correctly stated, there are certain legal problems which may prove difficult but which are surely not beyond the capacity of the Minister or the Department to solve.  Representations and recommendations have been made, as have suggestions, by various parties.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of these and has taken cognisance of them. There is no point in making a long apology for the inability of the Department to come to grips with these problems when interested parties are looking to that very source of authority for the solution to these problems.</P>
    <P>Temporary retail outlets and the people who operate from them are causing grave concern to established traders.  As was reported by the commission&mdash;and, indeed, since 1976 the problem has <Col N="112" /> become more acute&mdash;their activities upset the trading outlets of local established traders and undermine price structures. In fact they do worse; they affect the consumer very much, something about which I shall have a few words to say later.  They operate from a position of advantage over the established trader in that they are not subject to the normal rents, rates, taxes or other overheads that the average trader must face.  In addition, in many cases, they are also avoiding the payment of VAT, social insurance and of wages which should be paid at union level.  The conditions under which they rent a premises must also be questioned from the hygienic and planning points of view.  Change of usage, fire hazard and so on are incorporated in the amended Planning Act of 1976.</P>
    <P>From my reading of the Bill&mdash;and the Minister will appreciate that because of the short time available it has not been possible to go into it in great depth&mdash;it would appear that there remain loopholes, with which hopefully we will deal on Committee Stage, concerned particularly with the planning aspect of the premises rented by such people for short periods.</P>
    <P>There is also the real problem of enforcement of the law, and in this respect I appreciate the Minister's difficulty.  I am not making excuses for him; there is no excuse for such a long delay.  The problem would seem to lie in the reluctance or inability of someone somewhere to implement the law.  The only restriction at present concerns the Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938, administered by the Minister's Department. It is clear, even from the submission of the Restrictive Practices Commission, that the terms of that Act are not being implemented.  I do not know what is the difficulty but there appears to be absolute freedom on the part of these traders to contravene the provisions of that Act.  This was stated in the commission's report by parties who made submissions to the Minister.</P>
    <P>On the broader issue of sales and trading of this type, while one may meet the odd person who will contend that they provide a service and fulfil a <Col N="113" /> need&mdash;which is undoubtedly true in a very narrow and shortsighted sense &mdash;nevertheless, in the absence of very little consumer legislation in this country to date, these people constitute a definite hazard to the consumer.  In many cases they sell goods of inferior quality.  In all cases the purchaser has no redress whatever, no guarantee, no warranty and, even if he had the bird would have flown, the trader being no longer at his location of trading if the purchaser is unhappy with any article purchased.  There is no after sales service.</P>
    <P>To put it in a nutshell, we are speaking about consumer exploitation, the philosophy of the quick buck.  It is as simple as that.  This Bill, while restricting to some degree the activities of these people&mdash;ensuring at least that the Minister will know if and when this type of trader is operating in a particular location because of the necessity to obtain a licence&mdash;will not resolve the problem of their exploitation of the consumer. I would hope that the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill, when it reaches the Statute Book, will help resolve that problem on behalf of the consumer.  But, as of now, while the provisions of this Bill control the granting of licences, the inspection of licensees, their bona fides and so on, they do not go much further than that.</P>
    <P>Because of the speed with which the Bill was published and has come to Second Stage, I have not had much time to deal with it in detail.  One point which comes to mind and which is more a matter for Committee Stage is in relation to section 2 (2) (f) which refers to &ldquo;selling of ice-cream, sweets, chocolate, confectionery, cooked foods (other than those cooked at the place of sale)....&rdquo;  I do not want to be facetious but does that exclusion include the provision of chips which are cooked in the place of sale?  This is one item of food very commonly sold at such locations but which should not be excluded.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out to regulate this kind of trading, taking in its entity.  It does its job, in the sense that it controls the licensing of such traders and provides for <Col N="114" /> penalties for breaches of the law under its provisions.  I hope that it will be successful in that, if implemented.  The Bill just scratches at the surface of this problem.  The major areas of activity in casual trading are the roadside and the streets of our cities and towns.  From what the Minister said it would seem that because of all the complex difficulties raised it will be a long time before this problem is met head on and any effort made to resolve it.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom, mar fhocal scoir, a rá go bhfáiltím roimh an mBille seo arís, go bhfuil díomá orm nach dtugann sé aghaidh ar na fadhbanna a bhaineann le trádálaí eile ar thaobh an bhóthair, ar shráideanna agus i sráidbhailte na tíre seo.  Ní dheineann sé tada futhu siúd agus tá faitíos orm go mbeidh tamall fada le fanacht againn sula dtabharfar aghaidh ar an fhadhb sin.</P>
    <P>In the context of consumer protection, could the Minister indicate when that protection might be forthcoming in the form of the sale of goods as applied to this Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome this Bill and fully support the speedy enactment of the legislation.  We certainly hope that the President will sign it before Christmas because the next spate of major occasional trading of this nature will occur in the immediate run into the Christmas shopping period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned that it has taken so long to introduce the Bill but appreciate that there are constitutional and legislative difficulties in framing legislation of this nature.  Nevertheless, it has taken many years to bring about the introduction of this Bill, limited as it is in terms of what one might call occasional indoor trading.  There is a need for other urgent legislation not only in relation to roadside trading but also in relation to the aspects of pyramid selling where so many have been conned out of their money or their hopes of obtaining easy money and were, as the phrase goes, &ldquo;ripped off&rdquo; very rapidly by some very slick operators.  On that basis, we welcome this limited application of further consumer protection and would <Col N="115" /> like to see it introduced as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill underlines the need for extensive consumer education in relation to such practices.  Every Deputy in the House rarely ceases to be amazed at the dreadful gullibility of a large segment of the consumer public who are prepared to buy apparently cheap goods in these occasionally rented or obtained premises and find themselves without guarantees, without redress.  Many Deputies receive pathetic representations from individual constituents who have been conned, or who have simply bought what would, in the commercial sense, be called seconds. These are not just in relation to the odd bit of carpeting, or the odd pillow or bedspread.  The more expensive the commodities in the general range of consumer goods, the more easily people are conned.</P>
    <P>There have been instances of people buying refrigerators of that nature, washing machines, a wide range of electrical goods&mdash;all allegedly at half price, but invariably of dubious origin and dumped secondhand goods doing the rounds.  It is not unusual to see container loads of such consumer equipment being &ldquo;flogged&rdquo; from one major town to the other or from suburb to suburb in the urban areas.  Admittedly, it is not as widespread as one would be led to believe, but it exists and has to be curbed very drastically by the State in the best interests of consumers.  We must, as legislators say, to consumers that the hope of getting something on the cheap, or of making a quick few pounds, allegedly saving, as well as people's selfishness, lack of thought, foresight and care very often leads them into purchases which they subsequently regret.  On that basis alone, we certainly favour the introduction of this Bill.  There is a great and absolute need for consumer appreciation also, because there is a distinct limit to the extent to which legislation can help somebody who wants to buy something on the nod.</P>
    <P>This legislation will lead to a reduction in the sale of what can only be described as dubious goods.  There are a fair few <Col N="116" /> goods floating around this country and one does not have to be a politician to appreciate the allegations made about goods the origins of which one can only surmise and which are flogged in quick sales to unsuspecting customers.  Very often on examination the goods are found to be perfect but the perfection of their origins is often a matter of the gravest suspicion.  Where goods are quie perfect in their manufacture and are under a well-known brand name and yet are being sold at, say, 50 per cent below normal retail or wholesale price, then somebody somewhere has obtained these goods in circumstances which can be quite dubious.  Many a story is told about wholesalers and storage proprietors in Northern Ireland who have received offers that they could not refuse and whose goods were subsequently brought south of the Border.</P>
    <P>This legislation will undoubtedly be of considerable assistance to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is ironic that at a time when the Government are issuing licences for occasional trading these are issued without any general application. The Government's de-licensing aspect of motor vehicle driving will mean that a fellow who has never done a driving test may be driving a motor car around the country loaded with goods which he is going to flog, having obtained a license for them from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks as though this Bill will be of considerable benefit, nevertheless, in assisting the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that the evasion of VAT and of the normal payment of company tax and trading taxes by <Col N="117" /> such individuals is mitigated substantially. On that basis I welcome the legislation strongly.  I hope the records of the Department will be made available to the Revenue Commissioners because undoubtedly evasion is taking place.  There is enough evasion in relation to normal wholesaling and retailing without this problem of surveillance providing great difficulty for the Revenue Commissioners as well.</P>
      <P>I want to raise something which the Minister of State referred to in her contribution. She pointed out that the commission had indicated to the Government that manufacturers and wholesalers regularly rent rooms in hotels for the display of their goods and for sale to traders.  I ask the Minister to clarify the procedure in relation to the obtaining of a licence, if this is necessary.  It is apparently not necessary. A great number of such sales are held particularly by commercial travellers who, on behalf of wholesalers and manufacturers, travel around the country and are obliged to rent rooms on a thoroughly reputable basis for the display of their goods, samples and so on and the taking of orders.  I hope this Bill will not inhibit their operations in any way.  Further, not only do such manufacturers and wholesalers travel around the country but their employees do a great deal of travelling on their behalf.  One has to make a sharp distinction between them and the other traders doing up to three months' trading who would be obliged to pay £50 plus £25 for every day or part thereof for their permit. Perhaps an additional reassurance could be given by the Minister in relation to the Bill.  I would welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only query I have in relation to the various sections of the Bill. We wish it a speedy enactment and we look forward to the rigorous implementation and enforcement of this legislation. I have had a number of approaches about such activities from trading organisations, the IUDWC and other trade unions concerned.  We members of Dublin County Council have on occasion been plagued by efforts on our part either to seek injunctions against such <Col N="118" /> traders for contravention of our development plan or for changes of use which were never applied for, and they have been a thorn in the side of our planning officers.  On that basis also as a member of the local authority I welcome the legislation and I am quite sure that every member of every local authority around the country will welcome its introduction. I approve of the decision of the Minister and the Government that licences and permits will be issued by the Department rather than by the local authority concerned.  On that basis we can have national uniformity and a higher degree of objectivity in dealing with such applications, and the taxing authorities at departmental level will have greater access to the data on all such activities on the part of occasional traders.</P>
    <P>We support this Bill and commend the Minister for its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Occasional Trading Bill which is necessary at present when operators can very easily set up temporary premises for auctions and sales of a type which have a fascination for people.  In country districts, and especially in tourist areas this attraction is noticeable.  If such sales are properly operated they can add colour to an area and can give good scope for development on the part of craft workers.  However, a recent development here is that outsiders are coming in&mdash;and this is far from being a tourist attraction&mdash;to Dublin and to many rural areas, and groups are running auctions which in many cases are a type of confidence trick.  These operators can very handily find accommodation in halls and hotels, and they are sheltering behind a weakness in our laws.  It is necessary that this legislation be brought in so that people will not be exploited.  Each and every one of us has a human weakness for a bargain and sometimes too late we find that we get nothing for nothing.  It is only an illusion to think that one can get bargains at these sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the possibility of getting a bargain which brings people in large numbers to <Col N="119" /> those places.  It very often turns out that they have been exploited because the articles have not been catalogued and they are not guaranteed for after-sale service. People purchase items and they find that their life span is very short.  When they need parts for those goods they find they are not available and the people from whom they purchased the goods are no longer in the area.  Great efforts are being made at the moment through the EEC to give greater consumer protection. The established manufacturers are going to considerable expense to meet the various measures which are being introduced in the consumer protection field.</P>
    <P>It is a backward step to allow unauthorised selling by the fly-by-night operators.  If those people are permitted to trade the consumer will be given much less protection.  We have often been told that we are behind other member states of the EEC in providing consumer protection.  If we fail to control the abuses of occasional trading, which this Bill is aimed at, it will be a backward step.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 relate to permits.  A genuine man who is selling goods will not have anything to fear.  All those people can now apply for their permits and consumers can return to those traders if articles they buy are not satisfactory. We very often have genuine traders complaining about the way their business is affected by occasional trading.  Those genuine traders pay their rates and taxes and are giving good employment.  They carry lines which are slow-moving but which are essential to the housewife and to the community in general.  Those people have a lot of money invested in slow-moving lines.  The occasional traders come in with fast-moving lines and the trading of the genuine traders is affected.</P>
    <P>There is more involved in consumer protection than price.  It is only after people have brought home articles which they have purchased from those occasional traders that they realise they have been conned and that they are unable to secure parts when they are required. Reference has been made to <Col N="120" /> VAT.  It would be very hard for any Department or any officials to keep tabs on occasional traders.  I welcome this Bill because it will benefit the consumer.  I congratulate the Minister on its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment on what is not in the Bill rather than what is in it.  We have the regular type of trader who operates under the local authority by-laws.  It is important to identify those people and to have a proper register of the amount of this type of trading.  I come from an area where at marts and markets a considerable number of people sell fruit, vegetables, fish, secondhand clothing, and the consumer is not hoodwinked by those people.  Most people who buy fish, vegetables and clothing know what they are buying.</P>
      <P>A commission was set up in 1956 to examine the problem of roadside trading. We are now approaching 1980 but we still have not legislation to deal fully with the problem.  In Cork County Council we have deputation after deputation complaining about the problems created by roadside traders.  I have no doubt, as Deputy Barry Desmond pointed out, that the origin of their wares is very suspect.  I was told a story about a person who bought a coloured television set from one of those roadside traders and when the television broke down after a few nights this man brought an expert to look at the set who found some wrist watches inside it.  The consumers are not judges in relation to television sets and wrists watches.  It is important to have some control over this type of trading. We are dealing with a group, who seem to be far outside the law, who cannot be touched.  On one of the national primary routes in my county one can see carpets, televisions and wrist watches being sold. There are queues of people examining the wares and other people complaining about the traffic hazards caused by this type of trading but still they cannot be touched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is not sufficient to deal with that type of trading.  I know this is a complex matter.  If we are to have a second Bill to deal with the matter I hope <Col N="121" /> the Minister will introduce it soon because we cannot allow such trading to continue.  The regular traders, who pay rates and taxes, are trying to compete with those other people who do not pay any rates or taxes.  I hope this Bill has a speedy enactment and I ask the Minister to bring in the second Bill without delay so that this problem can be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I have probably seen more of this type of trading in my area than Deputies representing other parts of the country.  I have seen it along the Border where goods come from either side.  It would be impossible for the Revenue Commissioners or anybody else to properly supervise this type of trading.  I believe that roadside trading has increased substantially because of VAT.  It is no secret that these roadside traders evade value-added tax and when one has regard also to their evading personal income tax and to the fact that they do not pay rates and that they do not incur heating or lighting costs, one must appreciate that they are in a position to undercut any registered trader, regardless of how efficient he might be.  That is an unfair situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that in this Bill the problem is approached fairly in that there are exclusions.  I am sure it would not be the wish of anyone that a man who, for instance, had been selling fish on a town street for a number of years, should be prevented from continuing to engage in such activity.  Likewise, it is right that there should be an exclusion in the case of a person selling ice cream occasionally on the street.  However, the question is very different when we are talking in terms of someone selling television sets, carpets, and electrical goods of all kinds that are highly valuable.  If such a person operates as a roadside trader he is able to evade all the various taxes that the rest of us must pay.  Obviously, such a situation must be regularised.  Another factor is the question of protection for the consumer because in most cases the name of a street trader would not be known to the people who purchased goods from him.  In such a situation there is no redress for the consumer who <Col N="122" /> finds that the goods he has bought are faulty.  When this legislation is enacted these street traders will need to be registered in order to carry on business. Consequently, they will have had to furnish details of their places of abode. They will be known, then, to the Garda and to the Revenue Commissioners.  As one who, like the majority of people, pays his income tax, I welcome these roadside traders being brought into the tax net.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the traders concerned will say that a licence fee of £25 per day is substantial, but having regard to the ordinary profit and loss account of any retail business the overheads for a day in terms of rates, light, heating and repairs to buildings, even for a small business, would probably amount to that figure. So far as the roadside trader is concerned the sky is his roof and he has all the light he needs from the sun.  The Bill is long overdue, but I am very glad that it is before us now and that it has been presented in such a fair and balanced way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> In her speech the Minister of State dealt with the question of occasional or casual trading and also roadside trading, but this Bill deals only with occasional or short-term trading.  This occasional trading is something that has been with us only for a comparatively short time.  It has become common only in the past few years for traders to move in and lease a hall or a vacant shop from which to sell their merchandise, but it is only right that this type of trading be regulated particularly from the point of view of the consumer because, as has been said already, these traders move into an area, lease accommodation for a very short period and then move out leaving the consumer without redress in the event of complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that it will be necessary for the Minister to make regulations regarding the granting of permits and licences and I trust that at that time he will specify that the type of traders we are talking of must give details of permanent places of abode before being granted <Col N="123" /> licences.  I trust also that the Minister will be empowered to revoke a licence in circumstances in which such action is considered necessary, when, for instance, complaints made by consumers are not dealt with properly by the traders.</P>
    <P>In some cases these occasional traders provide a service that some people seek, particularly poorer people.  If the traders are giving value people will buy from them and that is all right so long as the situation is controlled.  It is because the Bill seeks to bring about such control that I welcome it.  Hopefully, the Bill will have the effect of ensuring that when complaints are received they are investigated and that, where necessary, action is taken against those concerned. The most effective action would be to refuse to grant a licence subsequent to complaints being sustained.</P>
    <P>The other brand of trading concerned is roadside or street trading, a type of trading that has been practised for a very long time.  For at least 25 years past various local authorities have attempted to control this kind of trading.  The Association of Municipal Authorities must have passed resolutions year after year demanding that street trading be regularised.  It is a type of trading that has a number of objectionable aspects. First, there is the type of complaint that is common also to the occasional trader, that is, that they appear on the scene, sell their goods and then disappear.  In addition they seem to have the right to move into a town in great numbers and to cause obstruction on the streets, making it impossible for people who are licensed properly to drive&mdash;and from now on some who will be driving without being licensed properly&mdash;to use the streets.  I am disappointed that street trading and roadside trading are not being dealt with in the Bill.  It may be said that when we were in Government we failed to deal with the situation, but the Minister's party have had the opportunity of dealing with it on many occasions and have only seen fit to tackle the matter now.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to implement <Col N="124" /> the promise she has given, albeit in vague terms, that a Bill is to be introduced to deal with this type of trading.  Apparently she is not in a position to tell us when we may expect the appropriate legislation.  I do not know whether there are constitutional or other legal difficulties in this area but it is a sorry state of affairs that a local authority are not in a position to control the streets in their area or that the Government are not in a position to pass legislation to control trading in the streets.  If a Bill designed to bring about such control were to be unconstitutional, I should find difficulty in comprehending how the Planning Acts would stand up in terms of the Constitution.  But we know that the Planning Acts are constitutional. I do not foresee any difficulty in relation to legislation to control street trading.  I am not saying that street traders should be prohibited entirely from selling goods in towns.  Some of these people are providing a service that is appreciated by some, but we must have control by regulation so that the consumer is protected.  These traders should be controlled also in that they should not be permitted to continue to be a law unto themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  This matter has occupied the minds and activities of people elected to local authorities, urban councillors, town commissioners and members of county councils, over a long period.  People in public life have been pressed by <Col N="125" /> legitimate traders to have some measure introduced which would prevent this type of trading, which is illegitimate in their eyes and prevents them from making a living.</P>
      <P>We have to segregate the types of trading which we hope this Bill will deal with.  I should hate to restrict people who are resident in any county, and who are established at our traditional fairs and marts, and who are recognised as being honest and upright dealers, giving good service particularly in the west of Ireland to people with modest means who were pushed out into the Atlantic for centuries and had to remain there, unable to enjoy the normal standards of living available to people in the better-off areas.  In the olden days the traders I refer to sold harness and certain types of clothes.  We have now moved into a more affluent society.</P>
      <P>We should have a register of established street traders who are ratepayers in and residents of different counties and who have moved around those counties for 25 to 50 years.  They should be allowed to retain their established rights.  The provision is £50 for a permit, plus £25 for each day's trading at one place.  That is rather high for a day's trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no compassion whatsoever for those itinerant or nomadic people who come from outside the State, or from our own State across the Border, or what we hope will be our own State at some future time&mdash;people with very doubtful backgrounds and with goods from very doubtful sources.  I should like to see a clean sweep made of that type of trader. He should no longer be allowed to disfigure our main roadways.  I refer particularly to the area of Shannon-Limerick-Ennis Road, where convoys of caravans are resident over the holiday period, not adorning our countryside but disfiguring what could be a very scenic area.  Those people have been coming there for years.  They are harmful to our trade and to our traders.  I would show no mercy to fly-by-night and fly-by-day boys who go into hotels and ballrooms to make a quick buck on goods which are not up to standard.  When people go <Col N="126" /> home they find out that they have been had, that they have been sold goods of inferior quality for a very good price.</P>
    <P>For too long our legislators have failed to tackle this problem and deal with it effectively.  I am glad the Minister of State, a lady of good judgment, has introduced a Bill which will please people. I welcome the Bill.  There are many difficulties.  This report by the Restrictive Practices Commission which was requested in 1975, or thereabouts, has set down the guidelines for this legislation.  It is long overdue, but it will smooth the way for established traders in our towns. I am sure the Minister of State will meet with no obstacle from any side of the House in enacting this Bill which is necessary and welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed in this Bill, not because of what is in it but because of what is not in it.  On that basis I should like to add my voice to the voices of those who indicated their disappointment at the Government's inaction in dealing with a real problem affecting the country today in this area.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with occasional &ldquo;monster auctions&rdquo;.  These are but the tip of the iceberg.  They are the edge of the problem only.  The real problem is roadside trading.  The Minister referred to the difficulties in framing legislation dealing with roadside trading and suggested they could be overcome by introducing two Bills, one to deal with the &ldquo;monster auctions&rdquo;, the main item in this Bill, and the other to deal with roadside trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why are the two Bills not circulated now?  The report of the Restrictive Practices Commission was produced in 1976, three years ago.  Great hardship has been suffered by many people, traders and consumers in local communities, because of the activities of fly-by-night traders operating mainly on the roadside. I have to criticise the Government for their delay in tackling the main problem, and merely touching the tip of the iceberg by producing this Bill.  The difficulties which have arisen in this area from the point of view of traders and consumers will not be tackled until the <Col N="127" /> second Bill is introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Legislation in this general area affects the rights of individuals and great care has had to be taken to ensure that the constitutional rights of persons are not infringed.</P>
    <P>That could be said about any Bill.  I am sure the parliamentary draftsmen have to advise on the constitutional implications of all Bills and, indeed, great care should be taken in the preparation and drafting of any Bill.  Surely after three years this urgent problem should have been dealt with by the Government. Promises were made that it would be dealt with.  Promises were made that the matter would be dealt with and a further promise was made today.  All I can do at this stage is to voice my disappointment that the main problem seems to have been put on the long finger and to urge the Minister to take steps in this area as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In this whole area of occasional and roadside trading there are problems which affect both traders and consumers. The traders are affected because of loss of business to fly-by-night traders, and consumers are affected because in very many cases what appears to be a bargain turns out to be a dead loss.  There is no protection for the consumer.  If any difficulties arise in connection with merchandise, if any redress is to be sought, or if any court proceedings are to be served, the person responsible has gone.  The consumer will continue to be in an exposed situation until control is exercised by way of legislation over this type of selling activity.</P>
    <P>I exclude entirely from my remarks the selling of fish, fruit and so on by long-established traders.  These traders are operating on a traditional and regular basis.  The people I have in mind are the people who come into an area for a few days and then go, often selling goods of questionable origin and doubtful quality.  In that situation, therefore, lies my disappointment.  The real problem has not been tackled.  Until such time as the Minister and the <Col N="128" /> Government do this, the promises that have been made to the electorate cannot be seen to be kept, the problem cannot be dealt with and there will be a continuing difficulty for traders and consumers.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of good in the Bill. Although I have criticised the Bill for non-coverage of roadside trading, it is an acceptable one.  It deals with an area which has been causing problems. However, it is only a small part of the problem but we must be thankful for small mercies.  There has to be control over occasional monster auctions.  In fairness to the Minister, I think she is going the right way about this matter and from that point of view I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>A small point occurs to me in relation to the section dealing with exclusions.  I see that the selling of fish is excluded and that the selling of cooked foods is excluded unless they are cooked at the place of sale.  The selling of agricultural products is excluded but that seems to relate more to livestock.  One of the general amenities at open-air functions is the selling of fish and chips.  If the Minister is satisfied that this item is excluded, as I think it should be, I feel that the Bill can meet with the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the many Deputies who contributed to the debate and to say that there is nobody more disappointed than myself that both types of trading&mdash;street and roadside&mdash;could not have been dealt with in one Bill.  Most of the Deputies appreciated that constitutional problems arose which had to be looked at very carefully, particularly in regard to roadside and street trading.  The decision was taken to separate the Bill into two Bills so that we could at least deal with one of the types of trading which was causing concern among traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of his speech, Deputy O'Keeffe rightly said that he was delighted to see that at least we were moving in the right direction.  It was a good decision and one which we should <Col N="129" /> have made sooner.</P>
    <P>In my speech I said that a draft Bill dealing with roadside and street trading was being examined in the Department and I hope that a Bill dealing with these matters will be published in the near future.  I cannot say when it will be published but it is my intention that no unnecessary delays will take place in my Department.</P>
    <P>Occasional trading is not the small problem that many people seem to think it is.  I come from a county which has more than its fair share of these traders. I have found that the occasional trader is more sophisticated in his methods of trading than the roadside trader.  Most of us have had the experience of finding leaflets advertising monster sales on the windshields of our parked cars or of having them pushed through our letter boxes.  It would seem that the occasional traders have sophisticated methods and have many agents working on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole said that there could be loopholes in the Bill.  I shall be delighted to plug any loopholes that arise.  On Committee Stage we shall have an opportunity of seeing if there are any loopholes.  Any loopholes that can be dealt with by my Department will be dealt with.  Any amendments that may be necessary to the Planning Acts will be a matter for the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to chips as being one of the cooked foods which might be on sale.  Chips are excluded except for occasional trading.  Chip shops are normally established businesses and are outside the scope of the Bill. However, I will look into this matter between now and Committee Stage when we can decide whether chips are included or excluded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond referred to a point which I made in my speech when I talked about manufacturers and wholesalers who hold trade shows.  This type of trading is excluded from the Bill under section 2 (2) (b) because sales at these shows are to genuine retailers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick asked if the Minister would have the power to revoke <Col N="130" /> a licence.  The Minister will have power to revoke a licence under section 4 (5).</P>
    <P>The point was made that consumers are often exploited by this type of trader. It is a pity that so many Irish consumers and consumers everywhere are so gullible that they buy from disreputable traders.  They very often find, having purchased goods from such traders, that they have no redress afterwards if anything goes wrong.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Director of Consumer Affairs will move in the direction of providing this very badly needed consumer education to educate people all over the country so that they will not be conned by this type of fly-by-night trader.</P>
    <P>In regard to the exploitation of consumers it is very important that the permit should carry the name and permanent address of the occasional trader or the person to whom the licence or permit issues so that he may be pursued if necessary.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank all of the Deputies who took part in the debate on this Bill.  I am thankful to both Opposition spokesmen, Deputies Desmond and O'Toole, for agreeing to accept the Bill, for recognising the urgency for it.  As Deputy Desmond said, it is when we run into Christmas that we find a lot of these traders operating.  Therefore, I look forward to its speedy passage in this House and in the Seanad.</P>

It is not likely that a sentence of imprisonment would be imposed lightly by the courts and a person who did not attract the Probation Act or a fine but who was adjudged by the courts to have offended society to the extent that he or she is committed to prison would seem not to be a suitable person for membership of the council.  Terms of imprisonment up to six months could be given for a wide variety of fairly serious offences.  For example, for such crimes as corruption of youth, fraud and so on, sentences falling short of six months could be imposed. Therefore, I do not see the justification for the amendment.  We have already in the Údarás na Gaeltachta Act of 1979 a precedent for the disqualification section. On the other hand, there is no precedent for allowing a term of imprisonment up to six months to be discounted and for those reasons the amendment is not acceptable.</P>

      <P>The objective of the amendment was to establish quite clearly that minor misdemeanours would not count for the purposes of section 7. Subsection (e) states:</P>
      <P>within the immediately preceding period of five years he has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment by a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>What happens in the case of a person who is sentenced to imprisonment for one month but whose sentence is suspended? Does that count as a sentence of imprisonment or would the fact that it was suspended mean that it would not count for the purposes of this section?</P>

      <P>I think that is a particularly harsh interpretation of it.  I appreciate the Minister has no responsibility for interpreting the law but he is responsible for ensuring clarity in the Bill.  If what the Minister says is true then quite a number of people are being excluded who may be guilty of technical charges and who may have received a sentence of seven days imprisonment or a fine of £10 and obviously the fine of £10 would be paid.  That is unfortunate in this Bill.  However, if the Minister persists in being stubborn I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 75:</P>
      <P>In page 6, after line 14, to insert the following new paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f)  he or she is certified insane,</P>
      <P>(g)  he or she fails to attend six consecutive meetings of the Council without adequate reason being given by the member or his or her representative for such absences.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I added these two paragraphs for the sake of clarity.  I would have thought it would be a normal part of the Bill that a person certified as being insane should not be a member of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter is more important.  If a member of the council fails to attend six or seven consecutive meetings of the council then his or her membership of the council automatically ceases.  It is important that people who are appointed to councils and committees in public life should be seen to attend to meetings and participate.  It is for that reason that I have inserted this amendment.  I think this provision in relation to attendance is in the VEC Act and it is also in the Harbour Board Authorities Act.  That is a good provision.  It leads to an awareness by a person serving on a council that he or she should and must participate in the <Col N="133" /> deliberations of that council.  I do not think the Minister could see anything wrong with it and I would recommend it to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of amendment No. 75 deals with the question of insanity.  I realise the importance of having sane people on the council but I do not think it is necessary to stipulate by way of a section in the Bill that those who have been certified insane should be excluded.  I take the Deputy's point that it is necessary to see to it that people appointed to the council are sane, and the Minister and the Government would be relying on the members of the council to notify them if insanity developed during membership, the person being sane when appointed.  The Minister has power under section 8 (5) to recommend to the Government that a member be removed, and there is adequate protection in that provision.</P>
      <P>I should like to endorse the Deputy's remarks about the importance of attendance at meetings.  Again I would rely on section 8 (5) under which the Minister has power to remove from the council any member who is so negligent as to be absent for six consecutive meetings or possibly less.  I agree that it is one of the disappointments that people sometimes do not regularly attend meetings of important committees.  They sometimes attend and are registered as present but they do not remain for the full meeting. However, I do not think it is necessary to have a section dealing with that, having regard to the Minister's power to take action under section 8 (5).</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the director or chairman of the council might be loath to inform the Minister that a certain person was not a regular attender?  It would be rather petty if the Minister had to examine such minor matters.  I am suggesting that a more reasonable mechanism would be as I have suggested, whereby a person who does not attend meetings automatically drops out.  A Minister might be personally embarrassed if he had to make a decision about a person's membership of <Col N="134" /> the council.  For that reason I suggest automatic suspension such as exists under the VEC Act and the Harbour Board Act.  It is a fair and reasonable mechanism.</P>

That it is regarded as very serious is also to be deduced from the fact that it is the Minister who advises the Government on the matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 76:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), to delete lines 15 to 26 and insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  (a) Subject to subsections (2), (3), (5) and (6) of this section, the members of the first Council shall be appointed for a period of five years.</P>
      <P>(b)  The Government shall not attach restrictive terms or conditions to the appointment of any member of the Council.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to delete subsection (1) of section 8 and specifies that members of the first council shall be appointed for a period of five years as opposed to any other period.  The most important aspect is that the Government <Col N="135" /> should not attach restrictive terms or conditions to the appointment of any member of the council.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (1) (b) of the Bill states:</P>
    <P>Subject to paragraph (a) of this subsection and subsections (2), (4), (5) and (6) of this section, a member of the Council shall hold his office on such terms and conditions as the Government shall, at the time of the appointment and on the recommendation of the Minister, determine.</P>
    <P>I find that subsection odious.  It smacks of political power or abuse thereof; it is negative where it should be positive.  The Government have no right whatsoever to attach conditions or lay down terms for membership of the council by any person. If a person of standing is to be appointed it must be assumed that he or she will serve on the council for the betterment and advancement of the council and of education generally.  The wording in the Bill is odious and I cannot accept it.  I am at a loss to understand why the Government or a particular Minister should insert such a clause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As is clear to the House, subsections (1) and (2) of section 8 provide for a five-year term of office for chairman and members and eligibility for renewal of the term of office for a further five years.  This continuity of membership up to ten years is important and highly desirable, particularly during the initial stage of the council's work. We have a proviso that after 10 years there should be no further membership without at least a two-year break.  This is to deal with the possibility of people going stale or, metaphorically speaking, developing hardened arteries with regard to the activities of the council.  This is the best way to deal with the twin problems of continuity and people not being quite so sharp or the desirability of another point of view after a period of ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the second part of his amendment which states that the Government shall not attach restrictive terms or conditions to the appointment <Col N="136" /> of any member of the council.  He mentioned the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; which has a very wide philosophic and practical meaning, though I do not know exactly what he means by it.  Surely the Deputy is not suggesting that a Government would set up a council without having any conditions or terms of appointment? That would be impossible. That is the business of this House and the Government to which the House gives power.  I submit that the terms and conditions applying in the case of the council are necessary for the sound organisation of the NCEA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that if a person is appointed to the council he will receive a letter on the following lines: &ldquo;You are hereby appointed in accordance with section 8 of the NCEA Act, 1979, for a period of five years and we trust you will further the NCEA in its objectives.  Yours sincerely, Minister&rdquo;. That does not need the words, &ldquo;on such terms and conditions as the Government shall determine&rdquo;.  I suggest that in paragraph (b) the Government and the Minister are taking on overbearing powers.  It would be quite detrimental to people who would like to serve on the council if the terms and conditions attached to their appointment were restrictive in any way.  That is the point I am making and I think it is valid.  I am fairly sure that the present Minister would not impose restrictive terms or conditions but I must point out that I do not like the words in the paragraph.  They smack of bad administration at the political end.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 89:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (5), line 42, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;when he or she is so requested by the Council upon the passing of a special resolution of the Council.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the provision whereby the chairman of the council and any other member thereof may be removed from the council by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister.  This section is rather high-handed in that it gives the Minister and the Government exceptionally independent powers in relation to the removal of members of the council.  I am suggesting that the removal of the person from the council should be dependent upon the council passing a resolution on the matter.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to section 6 (5) which states:</P>
      <P>The chairman of the Council may, on the recommendation of the Minister, be removed from the office of chairman by the Government.</P>
      <P>Why is there a need to repeat in section 8 (5) the provision regarding the removal of the chairman when it is already laid down in section 6 (5)?  This is repetition and is unnecessary.  The words &ldquo;the chairman of the council and&rdquo; should be deleted if we are to have proper parliamentary draftsmanship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I wish to make is that the removal of a member should be dependent upon the council wishing that a member be removed.  A few moments ago in relation to the question of the attendance of members of the council, the Minister stated that he would be advised by the council and by the chief executive on the matter and that he would make a decision.  There the Minister is establishing the principle of the council advising him in relation to their own functions. I suggest that where the question <Col N="138" /> of the possible removal of a member arises, the council should first consider the matter and report to the Minister. The reason for my amendment is quite clear.  It removes to a certain extent the independence of the Minister and the Government who may decide&mdash;I am not saying that the present Minister would be a party to it&mdash;in a moment of political pique or peevishness that a certain person should not be on the council.  The initial move to remove a member should come from the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 (5) empowers the Government, on the recommendation of the Minister, to remove the chairman of the council from office.  That is related to the member as chairman.  In the section we are dealing with now, we are talking of the chairman as a member of the council.  There is a distinction to be made: he could be removed as chairman but he might not necessarily be removed as a member of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 (6) caters for that.  It is the same thing.  The subsection states:</P>
      <P>Where a person ceases to hold the office of chairman of the Council, he shall at the same time cease to be a member of the Council.</P>
      <P>It is only a drafting amendment and I am not putting any political intent into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be an argument that he ceases to be a member of the council as chairman.  I will have a look at the matter before Report Stage and see if it is necessary to put it in. Draftsmen are very careful about putting in things; they are not wont to put in things unnecessarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amendment which asks for a resolution of the council before a member of the council can be removed, I submit that the appointment to membership in the first place is made by the Government and it is an old principle that he who hires should have the power to fire.  The right of removal should remain with the Government.  It could be more embarrassing to the <Col N="139" /> council than to the Government to have to remove someone who they knew was not fit to remain in membership of the board.  It could be argued that there might be a possibility that people would not be willing to serve on the council if they felt that the power resided in the council to have them removed from office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to the method whereby a member of the council shall resign.  The position in relation to the resignation of a chairman is dealt with in section 6 (4).  I <Col N="140" /> am using the same logical procedure in relation to ordinary members of the council who wish to resign.  A person may resign in a fit of pique or because of a trivial argument.  Section 8 (7) states:</P>
    <P>A member of the Council, other than the chairman or the Director, may resign his office by letter addressed to the Minister, and the resignation shall take effect as on and from the date on which the letter is received.</P>
    <P>That is too final.  At the time of the resignation of a person there should be a certain time lapse to give him an opportunity to reflect on his decision and to withdraw his letter of resignation.  For that reason I used the words in section 6 (4) which states:</P>
    <P>the resignation shall...take effect at the commencement of the meeting of the Council held next after the Council has been informed by the Minister of the resignation.</P>
    <P>I am trying to establish a mechanism whereby a certain amount of time is afforded to the member to reflect on his resignation and to give him an opportunity to withdraw his resignation.  Subsection (7) seems rather harsh in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides that a resignation should take effect as and from the date on which the letter of resignation is received.  This is a psychological kind of amendment.  It is unlikely that somebody who will serve on the National Council for Educational Awards would resign in a fit of pique and actually write and post a letter and then regret it afterwards.  In a sense, it would be a reflection on the Minister, who recommended the person for membership of the Council in the first place, if he chose a person who lacked the balance necessary to reflect seriously on his resignation from an important council such as the NCEA is to be.  If a member resigns it could be some time before the next meeting of the council and the position would be that a person who was dissatisfied with the workings of the <Col N="141" /> council or who challenged the council's actions, would still be a member over a period, until the next meeting took place. For that reason the amendment cannot be accepted.</P>

      <P>The amendment is designed to exclude extern examiners from committees and boards established by the council.

      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 9, after &ldquo;direct&rdquo; to add &ldquo;The Council should ensure that the Regional Technical Colleges are adequately represented.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are always in some difficulty when drafting amendments to a Bill like this because the Bill goes into such detail that it invites amendments which will add further to the amount of detail involved. I sometimes wish that Acts, especially education Acts could be written in English, so that we would not have to worry so much about amendments. However, I suppose it provides employment for the lawyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically the aim of my amendment is to provide that the council shall ensure that the regional technical colleges shall be adequately represented on any body established by the council.  In putting down this amendment I was struck by the danger, with which I think the Minister will agree, of academic escalation: the possibility that the whole technological education sector as administered, controlled and validated under the structure we are talking about here will tend towards the upper end of the spectrum, towards the national institutes of higher education and, in some way, towards the universities; that it will tend to ignore the specific experience and values of the regional technical colleges which are unique institutions, not in that they combine second and third level education, because you could argue that there are other institutions which do this to some degree, but because of the degree to which they combine these two, and in view of the fact that they are trying to make new advances in the field of <Col N="143" /> education.  Their attempts to take genuine educational initiatives will be put at risk unless they are guaranteed adequate representation at all levels, and particularly at the level of any board or structure the National Council for Educational Awards may set up.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared to assure us that he would propose to appoint to the council persons who would have this kind of aim in view, I would not press the amendment.  Even though we know that what is said on the floor of this House is not of any particular guidance or help when it comes to interpreting legislation, it would be of some assistance if the Minister were, here and now, to give some indication that he would like to ensure that the regional technical colleges do not fall a victim to the academic escalation I mentioned by being unnecessarily excluded from, or their participation downgraded on, any institutions or committees the council might set up.</P>

By naming regional technical colleges he is excluding Bolton Street College of Technology and other colleges which may have a right to be appointed to boards of studies. Therefore, in my view it is better not to name regional technical colleges.  To date the working of an NCEA in establishing academic standards has been very good. I cannot criticise them.  They are setting very high standards.  It would be better if regional technical colleges were not named, although I agree with the spirit of what the Deputy is trying to achieve.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Horgan says with regard to the dangers of academic escalation or a tendency towards the upper echelons of the sector is something we will have to try to avoid. When the RTCs were established the main thrust of their activity was to be the provision of technicians and equipping technicians to go further into either NIHE's or another college of technology.  I accept it is important that <Col N="144" /> RTCs should be represented in all the representative areas.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Collins said. As of now, the NCEA is working satisfactorily.  There is a large input at the national certificates stage.  After the two years national certificate a number of people work in industry, many of them finding very fulfilling and rewarding work.  I do not think there is any degree of difference between Deputy Horgan and Deputy Collins in this in that the NIHE and colleges of technology are in the same field.  That is the field where the emphasis will be laid for all representation on council or board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If a board of studies are appointed by the council to look into a matter, they have an obligation to make a report.  I do not think they should have the decision not to make a report.  In line 30 the words &ldquo;In deciding whether or not to make recommendations to the Council&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;In making recommendations&rdquo;. That is more positive and gives the board responsibility to make a recommendation.  It would also remove from the responsibility of the board of studies a mechanism whereby pressure might be brought on them, under the present wording of the Bill, not to make a report because it might embarrass somebody or because somebody might be hard done by if they did not make a report but stayed silent on a particular matter.  We can exclude that possibility by changing &ldquo;In deciding whether or not to make recommendations&rdquo; to &ldquo;In making recommendations&rdquo;.  In other words, the board of studies will have the responsibility for making a list of recommendations in the framework of a report to the council.  That is more positive, simpler and puts an obligation on the board of studies to make a report and thus <Col N="145" /> eliminate the possibility of somebody bringing pressure on the board to stay silent about any matter.  We should protect the boards from such pressures.</P>

      <P>I do not see the point of the amendment.  Under subsection (3) &ldquo;The Council may request a board of studies to make...recommendations&rdquo;. Under subsection (4), as drafted, the board of studies may decide to make recommendations to the council whether or not the council have requested those recommendations.  I do not think there would be any question of embarrassment or anything like the Deputy mentioned. It is not a substantive matter.  The drafting seems to cover any eventuality&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the point I am making.  Where a board of studies has been established to examine the matter there should be an obligation on it to make a report to the council.  Here the power is given to the board to decide itself whether to make recommendations to the council.  I do not think they should have that power.  They are primarily being instructed by the council to do a certain job and they should not decide within themselves whether to make a recommendation.  They should be obliged to do so.  By obliging them to make recommendations you are removing a potential source of pressure that could be brought on the board of studies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 98:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 47 and 48, to delete paragraph (f).</P>
      <P>I must admit that here I was thinking primarily in terms of regional colleges where the present system of admission is sound and should be preserved.  The minimum academic standard is leaving certificate with, I suppose, a pass standard in five subjects, an interview&mdash;a system to which the universities could have due regard&mdash;and a type of aptitude test.  Those three components of the admissions policy of the regional colleges are worth consideration by other institutions of education and worth preserving. It is primarily a pass leaving certificate, an interview by members of the staff who will be involved with the students in college life and an aptitude test.  This system has worked over the past few years in regional colleges.  It is successful because of the high degree of employment, to which the Minister has referred, which has been achieved by graduates of regional colleges.  One of the reasons for the success of RTC graduates may well be the system used at the entrance point where one tries to look at the students not only academically but as human persons. The present admissions policy should be preserved.</P>
      <P>In this Bill the board of studies is given a right to recommend to the council the standard required for admission to courses and therefore the standard may change on the recommendation of the board of studies.  That is wrong.  It is a very thorny question; it is a complex question.  The universities are independent and have their own methods for assessing entrance standards and setting entrance standards themselves.  They have a points system which I have openly criticised on a number of occasions and I shall continue to do so until the universities change that system.  In the case of regional colleges the entrance standards were set down by the RTCs themselves and should be preserved and should not be taken away as is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of admissions policy and <Col N="147" /> standards is not really a function of the NCEA; it is primarily a function of the colleges themselves to pursue and develop as they see fit.  By removing the right to set standards of admission you are taking away from the regional colleges a certain amount of independence. That is wrong and I am disappointed that the Minister should come up with this suggestion that the NCEA in effect should lay down standards of admission. Slowly but surely, with pressure on places in third level colleges, the NCEA will pick up the university system and will bring in a system based on academic standards only, academic achievement in the leaving certificate alone, which I do not agree with.  It should be replaced by the system I mentioned earlier which is presently used in regional colleges.  I would not like to see the independence of regional colleges and of other colleges in the non-university sector taken away from them. It would be a mistake; it is unnecessary and it may be the first step towards basing entrance qualifications solely on academic achievement in the leaving certificate or the intermediate certificate. That would be a grave error and I would ask the Minister to remove this provision for setting standards of admission from the NCEA and leave it with the colleges involved in this sector of education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has misread or misinterpreted that part of the section.  It is not related to the council at all; it lays down certain things which the board of studies shall have particular regard to.  Let us suppose there is a course proposed in chemical engineering for a regional college where such a course does not already exist.  The board of studies will be composed of people who have expertise in, say, chemical engineering.  What is really being said here is not what the standard of admission to the RTC&mdash;to take that example&mdash;will be but what it is necessary for a student to have to be allowed to enter the course, what equipment he will have to have so that he can follow that course.  This would be the ordinary function <Col N="148" /> of the board of studies and the board will report back to the college, whether an RTC or the National Institute for Higher Education.</P>
      <P>To my mind that seems to be one of the essentials and would be in aid more of the students than of the institution or the Council for Educational Awards because a student would like to know if this is the field he wants to choose and if he has built up enough muscle to enter the course and avail of it.  It is in that context and not in the context of admission, though that will be looked at by the authority in the institution which is developing the course, that it must be read.  It is not interfering with the right of a college to admit students.  Very properly it will say to the college that it is only wasting a student's time if it takes him in and he does not know anything about, for example, chemistry.</P>

      <P>Staff of the regional technical colleges are very capable and are well qualified and have it within their competence to monitor standards necessary for any courses.  There would be no need for them to feel hamstrung by dictates emanating from the NCEA by admission policies.  Admission policy should rest solely with the college authority.  If the NCEA recommend or suggest standards of entry for courses, then it is taking from the colleges a slice of independence that would be objected to by members of the boards of management and by the academic staff in the colleges who are handling the situation quite well at present.  It would be unfortunate if the council were to become involved in admission policy.</P>

      <P>I wish to repeat that in this section of the Bill we are talking about the duties of a board of studies, having been asked to do so by the council, to prepare a particular educational package covering certificate, diploma and possibly degree.  All the board of studies is asked to do&mdash;it has nothing to do with admissions, it could be <i>in vacuo</i> and unrelated to an individual college or institution in the State&mdash;is to prepare this in such a way that the person entering the course would know the kind of equipment he or she wanted, the number of years to be spent at it and so on. There is no question of the individual RTC or national institutions being interfered with in any way.  It could be totally <i>in vacuo.</i>  The council could decide, by virtue of obligations on it, to construct a course, say what people will need to enter the course and what has to be covered for a two-year certificate, a three-year diploma or a four-year degree.  It has nothing to do with admission; it is purely in the realm of the council's function as an award giving body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 100:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 4 to 7, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in line 4 down to and including &ldquo;(if any)&rdquo; in line 7 and insert &ldquo;shall have regard to standards applying nationally and internationally and shall not recommend a standard which is lower.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Here we are talking about standards and the Minister is aware of the need to have acceptable standards laid down and adhered to under the NCEA.  Section 9 (4) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>. . . . shall have regard to any corresponding standard required by a university in the State and shall not <Col N="150" /> recommend a standard which is lower than such a standard (if any).</P>
    <P>The point is that there may be no direct comparision with an academic standard in the discipline under examination in a university because a course may not be on offer in any university in Ireland.  It is a narrow reference and is entirely unsuitable to the NCEA Bill.  I am trying to make it more general and insert the words &ldquo;shall have regard to standards applying nationally and internationally and shall not recommend a standard which is lower&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan's amendment covers something similar.  We have repeatedly tried to establish standards not solely by direct reference to universities as is suggested in this subsection although they may well be used by a board of studies.  We should not use university standards solely because we are embarking on the provision of technological and quasi-technological courses in a non-university sector which may not be comparable with courses being offered in universities.  We should use the wider phraseology that whoever is assessing or laying down standards in the board of studies or at council level should have regard to standards for the time being in force nationally or internationally within the confines of the relevant discipline under consideration.  That is a wider reference criteria and is more suitable to the Bill.  The reference to the university in the State is too narrow and restricting and I would ask the Minister to change it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any marked preference for my form of words over Deputy Collins' form.  They raise an issue which we should discuss in a context which is free of the earlier discussion we had about a related topic.  In the earlier discussion we spoke about the advisability of linking this into the university sector generally and the Minister quoted the original CNAA statute in Britain which replicates, in some sense of the word, parts of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to what is being discussed under this section, we need a wider basis. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility <Col N="151" /> that there will and may continue to be for some foreseeable time, perhaps indefinitely, duplication&mdash;despite the best efforts of the Departments of Finance and Education and of the Higher Education Authority&mdash;in certain areas between institutions that fall under the NCEA and the universities.  It is also possible that standards in the institutions and technological sector may differ from standards obtaining in institutions outside the technological sector in the universities. It is altogether possible&mdash;for all I know it may even be the case today&mdash;that in some areas for historical, personal or other reasons, standards in the technological colleges may be higher than those of the universities; they may have more modern equipment or better teachers.  That is not impossible.</P>
    <P>When we are calling upon the NCEA to establish certain standards we do not want to tie them to one of two standards because of the very distinct possibility that that standard may be the lower of the two standards available in the country. It is a simple thing to change this without any disrespect to the universities, without begging any of the questions involved and simply adopt a form of words which will make it possible for the council to go to where the best standard is to be found, in the universities or elsewhere, and not to be tied down by a formulation which, if the Bill and the council have anything to do with it, will rapidly be seen to be archaic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a full discussion on this earlier during the course of which I explained that the reference to &ldquo;university&rdquo; did not mean that we wanted an affiliation to the university as better understood in our society, unfortunately for too long.  I pointed out that I did not want any interference with the particular technological ethos from the university.  I stated then that it was deliberately set down in the Bill in that standards in a university are a forum in our society which are known to be internationally recognised.  It is purely in that context that the word is used.  I would exclude it <Col N="152" /> immediately if I thought any of the possibilities I have excluded were capable of realisation.  What we should pay attention to is the fact that our universities, unlike some of the continental universities, are a kind of hybrid in a sense, and there are strong technological areas in ours.  We have, often in the same university, what is the marriage of two distinct European types of university.</P>
      <P>The use of the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; in the Bill in relation to standards refers to something which is a known standard of excellence in our society.  I accept, as Deputy Horgan stated, that in many cases the standards may be higher in the technological institute for various reasons&mdash;one of those mentioned by the Deputy was that the equipment might be better in a particular field.  The reference to the university is purely in the general context.  The reference does not mean that the standards in any specific technological institution as of now are lower but is purely in the context of an internationally recognised forum in the field of education.  That may, in fact, in a short time become totally unnecessary if the activities of the NCEA continue to be successful.  I am sure that will happen. That was the theme of our earlier discussion. The word &ldquo;university&rdquo; is mentioned in the charter for the CNAA.  If one looks at the experience of the CNAA one will see that the mention of this in the charter did not affect the particular ethos of that body or the work they were doing in the technological field.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case the board of studies would be composed of people who would have expertise in the field. That is the function of the board of studies in the situations we have mentioned in the Bill.  That board of studies would decide on the course, the standards to be reached in order to enter on the course and the standards required at the end of it.  That question had to be <Col N="153" /> decided by all institutions breaking new ground, where they did not have any criteria or existing precedents to follow In fact, it proves the point I have been making about the use of the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; in this context, that it is not for specifics; it is to be understood in the general context of an internationally recognised standard.</P>

      <P>In page 8, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following new subsection after subsection (6):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting the power of the Council, apart from this section, to appoint committees.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason for the amendment is to ensure that there is no doubt that the council is empowered to appoint committees which might be appointed to investigate or advise the council on any particular matter relating to its functions, or to its internal structures, or on its procedures, or for any other purpose.  There was some concern about this.  There will always be matters which can be best investigated by advisory committees which would examine the most efficient methods by which the council could carry its various functions, <i>exempli gratia,</i> perhaps to organise a flow of statistical information, the form of accounting to be adopted and such matters. It is likely that such committees will most frequently be concerned with organisation and operation of future systems but they might also be concerned with advising the council on matters relating to its general and particular functions.  For example, the <i>ad hoc</i> council we have now has some committees working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Minister, this new subsection is not comprehensive enough.  While I accept the Minister has said that the committee will be looking into matters of organisation, <Col N="154" /> of course procedures and so on, it is not stated in the Bill.  The Minister should be more explicit in relation to the powers of the committees; who should be selected to serve on the committees, what powers the committees will have in requiring people to come before them or have documents presented to them?  For example, would the reports of the committees have to be considered by the council and what standing would the committees have in relation to the council? I do not like to see the word &ldquo;committees&rdquo; entering in without their powers and responsibilities being fully defined.</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious that if a committee is established it will be by the council.  In answer to the Deputy's question, of course it will be answerable to the council and report to the council. It is simply to make sure that the council will not be inhibited in its work by a doubt as to whether it has the power to set up committees for the various purposes I outlined when introducing the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 103:</P>
      <P>In page 8, after line 15, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  The Council shall establish appropriate procedures under which the relevant authorities in the institutions to which the Act applies shall be advised of any recommendations made to the Council by a Board of Studies in sufficient time to enable the authorities of those institutions (if they so wish) to prepare a case for the consideration of Council prior to a decision being made by the Council.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is self-explanatory.  It is designed to bring about a situation in which any institution which has submitted a course to the council for validation has at least the right to know in due course of the recommendation by a board of studies before any decision is taken on such a recommendation by the <Col N="155" /> council.  We are all aware that human communication is imperfect.  It is quite possible that a board of studies, no matter how diligent its research, how exhaustive its inquiries, may simply be under a major misapprehension about some material aspect of the course being submitted to it for validation.  Obviously this will not affect matters in cases in which they are recommending validation of the course by the council.  But it could happen that a serious injustice could be done inadvertently to an institution if mistakes have been made or indeed if the institution concerned feels that the board of studies has been unfair in its treatment of their proposal, or has made a decision not really justified on the basis of the information supplied.</P>
    <P>In the Bill as it stands at present there is absolutely no obligation on anybody to ensure that the institution concerned has sight of the recommendation of the board of studies before it goes to the council for ratification, validation or whatever.  From what little experience we have had we can build up a scenario of what is likely to happen under the present Bill.  What will happen is that the board of studies will make a recommendation, saying to disallow a certain course or not to recommend validation of such a course.  The council, naturally, unless there are very strong reasons tending in the opposite direction, will tend to ratify the decision of the board of studies as being the appropriate body which has informed itself and made a careful decision on the basis of the evidence available to it.  Then the institution concerned will explode with rage, indignation, shock and horror.  It will claim that its course was not fully understood; it may claim that there was political intervention; it may claim dark and evil influences from here, there and everywhere.  They will come into Dublin and camp on the Minister's doorstep in Marlborough Street urging him to force a reconsideration of the matter.</P>

      <P>When I am Minister I will be glad to take on that job.  And the Minister will be telling them for at least six months that he has no function whatsoever, that it is a matter for the council. Then, when pressure builds up to a point absolutely impossible to meet, he may say to somebody over a gin and tonic at some reception or other: In the name of God, can nothing be done about this? This will not constitute a direct intervention by the Minister in the affairs of the council but it may have the desired effect if the whole thing is reopened.  This circular process could take place many times in relation to many courses.  I do not want to exaggerate the possibilities involved but I believe there is a way of short-circuiting this kind of problem, that is, to ensure that there should be some kind of occasion for the institution concerned to have, if nothing else, a final right of reply to the recommendation of the board of studies, particularly if such a recommendation is unfavourable to the course.  It may be, for example, that the board of studies might come to the conclusion that with some changes in the course, some changes in the personnel, some changes perhaps even in the entry requirements&mdash;although that is a very sticky one&mdash;the course might be acceptable and the institution concerned might be prepared to make such changes.  But unless it is realistically given the option, this will not happen and the danger of this process will occur.</P>
      <P>We should build into the Bill a structure which will allow that to happen.  It is not dissimilar in a sense from the kind of structure that exists in relation to the awarding of certain higher degrees, certainly in continental universities where an important part of the award of the degree is that the scholar who has written the thesis has to defend it verbally before his examiners.  Indeed, this is also common practice in organisations and institutions like the OECD where the authors of specialist reports on national problems and national economies have to submit to a grilling by their peers before the report is finally authorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore I am suggesting, if only to encourage the Minister to remove from <Col N="157" /> other persons the temptation to make his job even more difficult, that he should insert this kind of section in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the dangers Deputy Horgan sees in the exclusion of the terms of this amendment.  I suppose, on the face of it, one would think that a council would tend to ratify the decision of a board of studies too easily.  But I would expect that the council will be the type of critical council that will have a very close look at recommendations from the board of studies.  I know that the procedure, as of now, is one which involves the maximum toing and froing both between the board of studies and the institution and the council and the institution before any decision is taken on a course.  This is highly desirable.  In a sense this does for the activities of the board of studies and the council what the defence of the doctrine of thesis does in the continental university system in that every possibility is examined.  Indeed where the council, as of now, and a specific board of studies in a particular case ask for more staff, different equipment, or more of the same equipment, this is arranged under the present system.</P>
      <P>Therefore I would think that under existing procedures, many of the fears the Deputy foresees&mdash;and he has a point in this&mdash;are groundless.  It is true also that the institution concerned has not reached the end of the road if the board of studies has rejected and the council has accepted the recommendation to reject a particular course for an institution because the institution can re-enter at any time and would have to take cognisance of the weaknesses pointed out by the board of studies council in the initial consideration. Substantively, the criticism I make of the proposal is that it is encouraging a subsidiary of the council to deal with an institution more or less behind the council's back, before reporting to the council. It is established as a board of studies to advise the National Council for Education Awards in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his altered phrasing with a passing sense of regret, because we could have diverted ourselves with this aspect of the section, let alone other aspects, for several hours.  It was, certainly, odd, in the first instance to put the person's name, where the person was not specifically identified as such.  Looking at my own suggested improvement, I can see that that is not very marvellous, because all sorts of dreadful things might happen between the passage of the amendment and the passing of the Act, other Padraig Uasal Mac Dermotts might turn up and claim precedence, or the existing director might contract a severe case of rabies on his continental holiday and die in the odour of sanctity. All sorts of unpleasant things might happen. <Col N="160" /> He might even lose the grace and favour of the Minister, which is a remote possibility.  The Minister's final version of this is quite adequate and I shall not move the amendment in my name.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 106:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (3), between lines 21 and 22, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  (a) The Director shall be responsible to the Council and shall implement its policy and decision.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most objectionable parts of any section of this Bill and my amendment is designed to point out the objectionable nature of some parts of the section and to put it on the record of the House and into the Bill that the function of the director of the National Council for Educational Awards should, first and foremost, be that of responding to the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to talk about this without talking about other aspects of the section, because it is clear from these aspects of the section that, despite the notional subservience of the director to the council, we have, in fact, a situation in which the director, whoever he is&mdash;and I have absolutely no personal animadversions to make&mdash;is being given virtually <i>carte blanche</i> to run the whole show.  He will be running around here and there, popping up like a leprechaun on every board of studies, on every subcommittee. His function in relation to the council will assume a quite disproportionate standing and, indeed, it is difficult to see, if he is a member of so many subcommittees and boards, where he will find time to do the basic thing he is required to do as director.  His basic functions as director, as contained in this amendment in my name, is that &ldquo;The Director shall be responsible to the Council and shall implement its policy and decision.&rdquo;  There is a misprint <Col N="161" /> here&mdash;&ldquo;decision&rdquo; should be &ldquo;decisions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that there is no such basic statement of the relationship between director and council in the section as drafted.  The whole function of a council is to ensure a spread of authority in this particularly important area.  The section, as drafted, effectively takes a great deal of authority away from the council and puts it in the hands of one man, the director, by giving him an existence to a degree independent of the council, which is totally unacceptable.  If we are going to appoint, in the language of the popular press, a Supremo to run technological education, let us appoint a Supremo.  Let us not dress him up with all the trappings and folderols of a council which has very little real weight compared with the administrative authority being given to a single individual.  This is a critical point.  We are all aware of the politics of administration.  We are all aware of the degree to which the person who is there acquires authority simply by virtue by the fact that he is in control of the situation.  He has all the files under his left elbow.  He has all the correspondence. He can look things up.  He can organise the agenda for meetings.</P>
    <P>One man can effectively control a committee very well if he is given the resources and especially if he is given such statutory backing as will enable him to do so.  We are in grave danger in this situation of creating the sort of council which will effectively become a one-man show.  It should not be a oneman show, it should be a council show, and this is the main function of this amendment.  I will refer later to other aspects of the problem, but I impress on the Minister my sense of concern about this trend in the administration generally, a trend which finds itself replicated and probably intensified in this Bill.  It is a trend towards a concentration of power rather than a diffusion of power and the improvement of the processes of participation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed in amendment No. 106 in the name of Deputy Horgan.  I have serious reservations about the wording <Col N="162" /> of section 10 (3).  I was critical of the fact that the director should be a member of the council at all.  He should not be a member of the council.  The council members should set down policy and the director under the instructions of the council should carry out that policy.  I saw a separation of interests and a separation of functions and responsibilities. Because of that I feel that the director should not be a member of the council.  He should be a director who carries out the policy and acts on the instructions of the council.  That is not to be.  The Minister favours the director with members of the council in the first instance and in subsection (3) of this section the wording is such as to lead many to believe that the director will have inordinate powers.  The wording is not clear as to what extent the director would have the powers.  It is to a large extent put under the cloak of being instructed by the council.  The wording is such as to lead to possible differences in interpretation of the whole Act.</P>
      <P>I disagree profoundly if it is the Minister's intention to give inordinate powers to the director.  I would be shocked and appalled that the director of the NCEA would have over-riding powers in relation to the functions which he would carry out <i>vis-à-vis</i> the council. I would like to think that that is not the intention of the Minister and that his intention is to ensure that it is the responsibility of the council clearly to set out policy and clearly to guide and instruct the director in his office.  Unless I have these assurances from the Minister I will certainly support Deputy Horgan's amendment.  Indeed, I attempted to look at the whole subsection in amendment No. 107, but we are dealing with amendment No. 106, and I would like a clarifying statement from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to what Deputy Horgan and Deputy Collins have said.  It is a very interesting rhetorical exercise to conjure up leprechauns and hobgoblins and various nefarious characters from the misty deep and then flay them.  It is an interesting exercise, especially when done with <Col N="163" /> finesse and polished language, but if the section of the Bill is read carefully both Deputies will see that the director's duties to the council are stated very clearly and there is no need at all for this fear that somehow or other this is, as Deputy Horgan said, going to be a oneman band.  The implication in what Deputy Horgan has said, and what Deputy Collins has more or less repeated, is that the council will be a council of puppets, a council without minds of their own, that they will suspend all the powers of their intellect and allow themselves to be pulled around any way the puppet master wants to pull them.  However, a careful examination of the section of the Bill will show that the Deputies' fears are groundless.  For example, I call the attention of the Deputies to the wording of section 10 (3) (a) which states:</P>
      <P>The Director shall, in accordance with any direction given to him in that behalf by the council,...</P>
      <P>
        <i>Verba clara</i>&mdash;quite clear words&mdash;the director will be directed by the council. There is no question of some kind of Supremo&mdash;the word Deputy Horgan used&mdash;there.  The direction is given by the council and he will control and direct the activities of the council in so far as he is directed to do so by the council.  It is clear to me from this section that that is the position.  We go on to section 10 (3) (b) which states:</P>
      <P>The Director may from time to time make such proposals regarding the functions of the Council as he shall consider appropriate.</P>
      <P>What is a proposal?  It is something that you propose.  To whom is he proposing it here?  He is proposing it to the council and the council accept or reject.  In what way can the director be exercising undue influence over the activities of a council? He is under the control of the council. Subsection (3) (c) states:</P>
      <P>The Council shall consider any proposal made to it by the Director under this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> Again, the council shall consider any proposal.  There is no implication that the council are in any way tied in their decision.  They may accept the proposal or they may reject the proposal but it is the council who do the accepting, it is the council who do the rejecting.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 7 of the First Schedule states:</P>
    <P>The Council may perform such of its functions as it may deem proper through the Director.</P>
    <P>Who deem it proper?  The council do and the director is unable to act unless the council so deem it proper.  To me the council are very properly in charge. While the imaginary dangers summoned from the deep were quite terrifying in the eloquent words presented by Deputy Horgan, a careful reading of the wording in the Bill will show that they are not of any substance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used a very interesting word in his defence of the wording of this section which is fine except that it does not appear in the Bill.  If it did appear in the Bill we might be having a different type of discussion.  In rejecting the arguments I have advanced, and I presume also the amendments I have advanced to support them, he referred specifically to section 10 (3) (a) which reads:</P>
      <P>The Director shall, in accordance with any direction given to him in that behalf by the Council control and direct the activities of the Council and the staff of the Council.</P>
      <P>The Minister put stress on the word &ldquo;direction&rdquo;.  I believe this can also be construed in a different way with the stress on the words &ldquo;in accordance&rdquo;. The effect of this sentence, which he is advancing to beat my argument and my amendment is that the director shall only exercise the various powers given to him so far as&mdash;that is the word the Minister used but it is not in the Bill&mdash;he is directed to do so by the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council will not be issuing directives morning, noon and night to the director.  It seems to me that there will <Col N="165" /> probably be substantial grey areas for which directions have not been issued by the council and in which the director will be free under this subsection to do virtually what he likes.  This could develop into what we used to be told during our school days was a bad habit.  The danger is that this particular section, unless we amend it appropriately, will encourage precisely those bad habits and bad thoughts on the part of anybody who may be so lucky or unlucky to be appointed a director.</P>
    <P>The Minister, somewhat to my surprise, also dragged in paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (3) in relation to proposals which may be made by the director.  I find those two paragraphs absolutely inexplicable because already in section 4 we read:</P>
    <P>The members of the Council shall be a chairman, the Director and twenty-three other members,</P>
    <P>The director is a member of the council. If the council shall not consider proposals from their own members who shall they consider proposals from?  It seems to me that the director, as a member of the council, has a right to make any proposals to the council.  I find it extraordinary at best and sinister at worst that he is here being given an extra function, an extra responsibility, an extra entitlement in relation to his activities on the council.  He is apparently not just a member of the council, he is a super member of the council.</P>
    <P>This is another aspect of the general tone of this section which seems to lay it down that the director is not a man among men.  He is something special, he is somebody who for some odd reason is being given a superior status as a council member to other members of the council. I feel we should resist this not just for the sake of democracy and of the participations I spoke of earlier, but simply in aid of the sanity of the person who is director and in aid of the self-respect of the other members of the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The director is a member of the council but he is something more, he is also the director.  There is no question <Col N="166" /> or doubt about that.  I am making two very strong points against Deputy Horgan's position.  The first one and the most stubborn one is the actual wording in the section.  The words are:</P>
      <P>.... in accordance with any direction given to him in that behalf by the Council....</P>
      <P>It is quite clear from those words where the direction is coming from.  There is absolutely no doubt about the meaning of the words.  I believe, for that reason, that Deputy Horgan is imagining dangers, powers and undemocratic positions which do not exist.  I used paragraphs (b) and (c), as the Deputy said, in section 10 (3) to indicate what the director is doing.  He will be in a special position for making proposals by virtue of the fact that he is a member of so many boards, that he is in fact charged with the direction of the council. He will make proposals.  The council will make decisions on those proposals.  It is important to remember that.  I also referred to what is in the Schedule.</P>
      <P>All the statements made by Deputy Horgan posit one thing, which he is not entitled to posit in my opinion, that is that we will have a council of dumb-bells, a council which can be manipulated.  The calibre of the council will see to it that the powers given to the council are exercised properly and will see to it that those powers in relation to the director will be exercised.</P>

      <P>I must reject the Minister's assumption that I am positing a council of dumb-bells.  The Minister has been around long enough and has been around a bit longer than I have to know that manipulation can arise in circumstances where the people being manipulated are not dummies in any degree.  Manipulation is facilitated by certain kinds of administrative structures and is impeded by other kinds of administrative and democratic structures. It is my simple statement in relation to this that the kind of administrative structures we are setting up here will facilitate manipulation rather than impede them, regardless of the intellectual calibre of the persons who may or may not be manipulated.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, in this debate we have not been talking enough about the amendment and this is partly my fault. What positive objection can the Minister have to the formulation in my amendment that the director shall be responsible to the council and shall implement the policy of the council and their decisions? It is two lines and is 30 per cent shorter than the Minister's formulation in section 10 (3) (a) of what he claims to be exactly the same thing but what I claim has a different administrative and perhaps even a different legal significance.</P>
      <P>It is very simple and is totally unambiguous. I urge the Minister to accept it and to delete subsection (3) (a).  With regard to the other point made by the Minister, the director being a special member of the council by virtue of the fact that he is the director of the council, everything he has said here only reinforces my fears about the role the director is being given in relation to the council.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, aware of the serious economic mismanagement of <Col N="168" /> the economy by the Government and of the major increase in inflation in 1979 which is now projected at 13 per cent for this year and further aware of even larger price increases in certain basic food commodities, emphatically calls on the Government to restore food subsidies, so that the living standards of those most affected by this regressive policy, namely, the poor, the elderly, the unemployed, the underprivileged and large families, are not further eroded.</P>
    <P>I understand that the motion and the amendment to it have been circulated.  In January last the Labour Party tabled a motion for Private Members' time, deploring the decision of the Government to phase out food subsidies, thus increasing the price of butter by 8p per pound, the price of milk by 2p per pint and the price of flour by 3p per kilo.  At that time we pointed out strongly that that type of policy inevitably would have an adverse inflationary impact on the living standards of the poor, the elderly, the unemployed, the underprivileged and on larger families in particular.  At that time we were experiencing an inflation rate of 7.6 per cent but today that figure has almost doubled.  This is at a time when, though we are not aware yet of the final decision on the part of the Government, there is a prospect in the next budget of the second stage in the phasing out of food subsidies.  It is logical to assume that if the policy to phase out food subsidies is to be continued, the final phase in this respect is imminent.  Therefore, we have tabled this motion so that the public, concerned social organisations, the trade union movement and in particular that large body of marginal Deputies, the Fianna Fáil backbenchers, might impress clearly on the Government the need to end this regressive policy.</P>
    <P>When we tabled the motion before the House now&mdash;that was during the summer recess&mdash;the annual rate of inflation for this year was projected at 13 per cent, but since then the best available forecast indicates a figure in the region <Col N="169" /> of 14 per cent.  In addition, there are increases in the pipeline.  For example, it is anticipated that there will be an increase in the price of electricity.  I understand there is a further recommendation before the Government for an increase in electricity of some 16 per cent plus a 2½ per cent fuel variation charge increase.  Such an increase would give a spurt to further inflation in respect of every household. Only this week the OECD stated that the Irish price level increased at an annualised rate of 15.5 per cent in the six months to August, 1979.  The average rate of inflation in the Community in the same period amounted to 11.4 per cent. Therefore, we can assess clearly the impact of imprudent domestic Government policy of which, in part, the withdrawal of food subsidies was an element.</P>
    <P>In our motion we refer to the serious mismanagement of the economy by the Government.  Apparently this year we shall have a budget deficit of some £500 million or almost twice the level projected by the Tánaiste in January last.  Even in the crisis days of 1973-74 when the price of crude oil quadrupled, I suggest that the previous Government exercised at least some prudent management of the State's finances or intended to do so in circumstances which were drastically more stringent and difficult than those facing the Government today.  It seems that our rate of borrowing will now be of the order of 13 or 13½ per cent of GNP. This situation, as we resume this Dáil session, emphasises the confetti money policies being followed and shows that our national Exchequer finances are in some disarray, if not in ruins, while Ministers seek to shift their responsibility to all and sundry.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, there has been a measure of improvement in the employment situation but the unemployment figure remains at 85,000.  To that extent one might say that the Fianna Fáil election targets have not been met even to the extent of half what was promised.  But then we had what can only be called the immortal words of my constituency colleague recently who, as reported in the newspapers, advised us not to be too obsessed with arithmetic.  Regrettably, <Col N="170" /> the arithmetic cannot be regarded as pleasant reading.  However, it is indicative of a situation that must be emphasised to the House on this our first day's meeting after a, presumably, not too exhausting three-and-a-half month's holidays, something which the rest of the population did not have the opportunity of enjoying.</P>
    <P>Regardless of what view one might have about the success or otherwise of the counter-inflationary policies attempted by the previous Administration, we at least introduced, as one of our counter-inflationary measures, what were then substantial subsidies on food. The subsidies applied to flour, bread, butter, milk and town gas.  In addition, in the budget of 1975, we removed value-added tax from food.  The effect of this was no less than 4 per cent on the consumer price index.  The subsidies were extended further in 1976-77.  At that time, despite raging inflation we took the unprecedented step of maintaining and improving the living standards of the unemployed, the elderly and other vulnerable groups.  Today we have an inflation rate of 14 per cent.  The FUE who are not known to give vent to exaggerated statements, estimate, on the basis of the best forecast available to them, that the inflation rate is 14 per cent.  Some commentators estimate the rate as being of the order of 16½ per cent.  The recent annualised rate from the OECD is of the order of 16.5 per cent. Whether or which, there is the inescapable conclusion that the 12 per cent which was given in weekly rates of short-term unemployment welfare payments, the 16 per cent increase given last January to long-term recipients and the rather miserly £1 increase given this month have been eroded by inflation.  In many instances, these moneys were received a month late by recipients.</P>
    <P>On top of that, we had the removal of the food subsidies throughout this year. One of the major beneficial effects of providing food subsidies is that they can be used to contain and reduce the rate of inflation, as the previous Administration did.  To mid-November 1978 the annual inflation rate was 7.9 per cent.  The <Col N="171" /> removal of the food subsidies contributed at least 1 per cent to the inflationary impetus, and 2½ to 3 per cent to the food price commodity group at that time.  To mid-August of this year the consumer price index shows an inflation rate of 13.6 per cent.  It is interesting to note that the UK based Reward Regional Surveys indicated an inflation rate in the Republic of 16.7 per cent at present, with Irish prices some 11 per cent higher than UK prices.</P>

      <P>Contributors or otherwise, they were net beneficiaries in the end from the propaganda of that exercise. It is quite clear that the impact to date of the part abolition of the food subsidies has created hardship for the lower income groups in our community, and has also been somewhat self-defeating in terms of public expenditure.  I would put it this way to the Government.  In <Col N="172" /> January 1979, at the time of the partial withdrawal of food subsidies, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and his colleagues were holding firmly to a suggested 5 per cent wage increase.  There was a general feeling that it would be very valuable if the national economy restrained itself to a 5 per cent proposed pay increase in 1979. It was hoped to carry that strategy forward into the early 1980s.</P>
      <P>That strategy was jettisoned and now, in the first phase of the national pay increase under the national understanding, we have paid out a figure of 9 per cent. An increase of 9.4 per cent is forecast for phase 2.  This has all been contingent on movements of the consumer price index up to 16 per cent.  I do not see the logic of abolishing food subsidies and jacking up the consumer price index even by miniscule amounts of 1 or 2 per cent, giving it an inflationary impetus and then having to pay for that under the national understanding.  Because the consumer price index has gone up, one has to give a further increase in national pay.</P>
      <P>The logic would have been to keep down the consumer price index by whatever means possible, even if that had meant a reversal of Government policy.  Then one would not have had to pay a massive second phase under the national understanding, as will probably happen.  The £22 million which was saved allegedly by the abolition of food subsidies will have to be handed back to the relatively better off sections of the working population, those who benefit predominantly from the national pay agreements.  I suggest, with respect, that this strategy is reminiscent of the fate of the bird which flew in every-decreasing circles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have asserted repeatedly that the partial abolition of the food subsidies would add less than 1 per cent to the consumer price index.  The figure which is of some importance is that relating to the food commodity group in the index. From mid-May 1978 to mid-May 1979 that figure increased by 16.4 per cent. There was a seasonal fall in the mid-August <Col N="173" /> sector due to good weather, but the food index group has been consistently higher in 1977 and 1978 in terms of inflationary increase than the overall index. That is an important factor in trying to reduce the level of inflation for less well-off persons.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil also maintained that the rich and poor benefit alike from the food subsidies.  We had this argument trotted out time and time again.  It is essential that we should analyse exactly what impact increased prices arising out of the abolition of food subsidies have had.  The latest available information was published within the past few weeks in the household budget survey.  I do not propose to go into that here, because I went into it before, but this survey gives the expenditure of households on most food items in relation to their incomes. The latest results are for 1977 and, therefore, they are slightly dated.  They give the distribution of expenditure among households and a breakdown by social groups, by income levels and size of households.</P>
    <P>The data show very clearly that expenditure on bread, milk and butter as a percentage of total expenditure on food is relatively low for the higher income groups, and relatively high for the social groups 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Data are also available in regard to income levels.  The lower income groups spend a much higher proportion of their food expenditure on bread, milk and butter than do the better off.  If you take an analysis of families of different sizes, the pattern emerges very clearly.  Apart from oneperson families, who are mainly the elderly living alone, the proportion of food expenditure devoted to bread, milk and butter rises steadily as family size in creases.</P>
    <P>The household budget survey, which is only a few weeks old, gives details of money spent on food in 1977.  People can take the data made available in the National Prices Commission material on grocery prices in 1976 and calculate the quantities of food items purchased by the various sized families.  It reinforces my assertion that the importance of bread, butter and milk in the diets of <Col N="174" /> some families is overwhelming.  The poor, the unemployed, those on quite low incomes, the elderly who live alone, people with large families spend a greater proportion of their food expenditure on bread, butter and milk than do the relatively well-off.</P>
    <P>The evidence is overwhelming and in no way supports the bland assertion by the Government right through this year that the rich and poor benefit alike from the food subsidies.  It is true that there is an element of benefit for everybody but the element is weighted emphatically on the side of those who are less well off. The approach of the Government in that regard is contradictory.  Only the other evening I was going through a file of data issued by Fianna Fáil during the last general election.  The Fianna Fáil canvassers' guide is a most remarkable document which will go down in electoral history.  Theses will be written on it in the year 2000 when it surfaces again in the consciences of political scientists. Page 77 of the guide contains the following question and answer for the party faithful on the doorstep: &ldquo;Will Fianna Fáil put VAT back on food?&rdquo;  The answer was &ldquo;No.  On the contrary, Fianna Fáil is in favour of food subsidies which reduce the price of everyday foods and we pressed the Coalition to introduce them for the best part of a year before they finally did so.&rdquo;  There is no suggestion that since Fianna Fáil came back into power they would abolish them.</P>

      <P>The overall social policy of the abolition is summed up by a very honourable body of men and women, namely, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Their general reaction to Government policy prior to the budget of 1979 was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thinking behind this submission runs counter to the apparent assumption underlying the Government's present policies that it is possible to distinguish clearly between economic and social issues and between the interests of the economically active and the rest of the population.  In the comments on the last Budget the Society expressed grave concern that its proposals gave least benefit to those <Col N="176" /> on low incomes and provided examples to support this view.  This trend has been continued with the partial withdrawal of subsidies on food which has hit families on lower incomes hardest because food is not simply one item but the major item of expenditure of all people on low incomes.  The Society shares the Government's wish to achieve full employment and recognises that in a period of economic difficulty the Government is faced with extremely difficult problems in deciding priorities. However, the Society maintains that the drive towards full employment should not and cannot be carried out regardless of the social consequences, particularly to those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>The Society recognises that the present economic difficulties requires sacrifices but it urges the Government to ensure that these sacrifices are made for the poor rather than by the poor.</P>
    <P>That quotation sums up my party's condemnation of current Government policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the amendment to the Labour Party motion.  I regret to say that the Minister for Finance has put down what I can only describe as a pathetic proposition.  The amendment of opposition to our motion states &ldquo;including its policy to fade out food subsidies in order to make additional funds available for productive investment while protecting the interests of...through the medium of increased social welfare payments.&rdquo;.  We should realise that we are debating the removal of £22 million food subsidies to those who are less well off in our community.  If we are that preoccupied about productive investment and scarce resources for productive investment why did the Government take the decision immediately they came into office to abolish car tax?  That cost about the same as the abolition of food subsidies.  Where is their egalitarianism? Where is their social justice relative to people in need?  How productive was the abolition of rates on all multiple domestic dwellings?  If one has a summer <Col N="177" /> home, an old cottage in Connemara, another old patio down in Wexford and a bit of a £60,000 house in Dublin, there is no problem as they are all exempt from rates.  In the next budget that will cost us a cool £100 million while the unfortunate person who is unemployed cannot get the benefit of a £22 million food subsidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is time for examination of conscience.  One has to examine more than one's conscience in the light of State finances at the moment. How job creative was the virtual abolition of capital taxation which for this year alone would at least be equivalent in terms of lost revenue to the abolition of food subsidies?  About £15 million went down the drain this year on the dismantling of all capital taxation.  That amount would have paid for the food subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today I got a reply from the Minister for Finance which makes fascinating reading.  I asked him in relation to assessments of wealth tax for the period ended 5 April 1977 how much was held in holdings outside the State.  His reply was £280 million held by about 5,000 people.  I would be interested to know how much has been repatriated as a result of the Government's decision.  We shall never know.  I suspect that a 1 per cent tax on that £280 million would not be missed by the people concerned.  Individually there were only 4,000 but there were 2,000 discretionary trusts and there were 2,800 private non-trading companies and some persons were in there three or four times; there were probably about 5,000 people in all. Would a 1 per cent tax on them to pay for food subsidies destroy productive investment <Col N="178" /> here?  There is not a chance of it.</P>
    <P>The amendment says that money must be made available, that food subsidies must be phased out in order to make additional funds available for productive investment.  Who do we really think we are fooling?  Contrast that £22 million with the £1,800 million IDA investment programme in fixed assets over the next five years.  Their target figure of expenditure is £1,800 million and that £22 million apparently is of such importance that it is going to make or break that investment programme.  Who do we think we are fooling in that regard?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the IDA who are going to spend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take it in the context of the current national budget. Our current expenditure at the moment is running at about £2,700 million a year.  The industry, commerce and energy sector alone is £163 million.  The public capital programme expenditure at the moment is £1,000 million.  But food subsidies must go because productive investment prospects would crumble.  If he wants to turn the argument around the other way the Taoiseach meets Mr. Helmut Schmidt, he throws a dinner for him in Iveagh House and stands up and says the Irish rate of investment, at nearly 27 per cent of GNP in 1978 and an estimated 29 per cent in 1979, is among the highest in Europe.  But we had to abolish food subsidies in order to have productive investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The placing of those funds and that money in any context highlights the paucity of the thought behind the so-called economic strategy in the amendment. I just do not accept it.  My party cannot accept that that is the way to run the State finances and to manage any country.  We have therefore again tabled this motion.  It would be interesting to hear from the Minister whether any further Government decision has been taken in relation to food subsidies for next year's budget.  I fully appreciate that <Col N="179" /> at the time of the last decision no decision was taken about when or if it might happen, but it was a policy to be implemented and if that policy is to be implemented on a logical basis it should be phased out over a period of years early on in the Government's strategy.  It would be quite interesting to hear whether that policy is still being pursued.</P>
    <P>One can only conclude that this Government are bankrupt not only in terms of resources to manage the economy on a day to day basis but also in terms of social strategy, in terms of providing the necessary resources for the economic and social development of the country.  I feel very strongly about the question of food subsidies.  I think it was a hallmark of the approach of the Government which was socially wrong; it was reflective of a philosophy that I just do not like and could not support and which in the long run will prove to be erroneous.  This is becoming more and more evident as we enter mid-term in the lifetime of this Government and I have no doubt that the error of that strategy will be self-evident to those who support the Labour Party motion and accordingly I move the motion in my own name and in the names of all the members of the Parliamentary Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;aware of&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the difficulties facing the economy both at the national and international levels, endorses the policies of the Government to promote social and economic progress, including its policy to phase out food subsidies in order to make additional funds available for productive investment while protecting the interests of the less-privileged through the medium of increased social welfare payments.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the third time in the space of about 12 months that we have had a discussion on food subsidies.  I find it extraordinary that here we are on this third <Col N="180" /> occasion and we again have spokesmen for the Labour Party not only continuing to repeat errors of fact but also continuing to pursue a policy line in this area which is against the interests of the less privileged groups in our community.</P>
    <P>The essential argument I want to make first is that any Government which have a certain amount of money available and have the choice of using that money either for general food subsidies or for specific improvements in social welfare benefits or other services available to the poorer groups will see that it is much better to use the money for specific improvements rather than apply it generally for food subsidies.  I will illustrate that argument.  I have done so before, but I must confess I find it extraordinary that I have never heard any response from the opposite side of the House to this argument.  I take it therefore that at this juncture it cannot be a simple oversight on their part but simply that they find it convenient to ignore an argument which they find impossible to refute.  It was interesting that two or three times Deputy Desmond was skating fairly close to the point where he might have to take up my argument but each time he saw the danger and retreated from the brink before he toppled over into the difficulty.  Let me make the point as quickly and as simply as I can.  Let us take the words of the Labour Party motion before the House. We are told about the projected inflation rate emphatically causing the Government to restore food subsidies so that the living standards of those most affected by this regressive policy&mdash;namely, the poor, the elderly, the unemployed, the underprivileged and large families&mdash;are not further eroded.</P>
    <P>Let us take the most recent change that has been made in this area by the Government.  From 1 October the Government have introduced an additional increase of £1 per week in all social welfare benefits.  That is in addition to the normal annual increase which took place in the spring.  This increase of £1 a week will, in a full year, cost about £19 million.  Had we chosen to use that money in the way which the Labour <Col N="181" /> Party would hold out to us, what benefit would it have provided for the very groups which they claim they want to help, the poor, the underprivileged and unemployed?  For a family earning £50 or less the average saving would be 19 pence.  That covers all the groups, virtually to the last person, mentioned in the Labour Party motion.  They would have us believe that the Government ought to have turned away from the opportunity of giving these underprivileged groups an increase of £1 weekly and instead should have introduced a policy which would have given them 19 pence a week.  Where would the rest of the money have gone? It would have been spent in subsidising food consumption for the better-off groups in the community.</P>
    <P>It was incredibly ironic that Deputy Barry Desmond had the flaming nerve to quote the President of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in saying that in our approach to policy what was needed was sacrifice for the poor rather than sacrifice by the poor.  Deputy Desmond tried to imply that their approach would achieve that result whereas the policy of the Government, we are supposed to believe, is the opposite; we are supposed to be inflicting sacrifice on the poor. The Government have chosen to do what I expect the Society of St. Vincent de Paul had in mind.  We are asking the other three-quarters or five-sixths of the population to make the relative sacrifice in favour of the poor.  We have chosen to use the money&mdash;in this instance, £19 million&mdash;by giving it all to the poor.  We have given all of it, not just one-sixth of it.  That is the essence of the argument. Any additional points under this heading will simply clarify that, embellish it and elaborate on it.  That is the central issue. If we have a certain amount of money available, should we give it in a general food subsidy to everybody, knowing that five-sixths of all the money will go to better-off groups, or should we concentrate whatever money we have and give it all to the poor?  The Government, in my view, have chosen correctly in deciding to turn away from the superficially more attractive policy but <Col N="182" /> fundamentally unsound arguments which underlie that approach, and have not been caught up in faulty semantics. They have identified the best way to help underprivileged groups in our community.</P>
    <P>In case anyone thinks I am being selective in taking the £1 increase agreed in the autumn of this year, I would make the point that taken in conjunction with the increases already agreed in the spring the total improvements in social welfare benefits for this year will range between 20 per cent and 24 per cent.  Without going into a debate on arithmetic and taking as the rate of inflation Deputy Desmond's figure of 14 per cent, that clearly demonstrates that there is a very substantial real improvement in the social welfare category, a much larger increase than took place in any previous year in the past decade, despite the fact that this is a year in which Deputy Desmond would have us believe the Government are mismanaging our economic affairs. We are so mismanaging affairs that we can still produce the best improvement in well over a decade.  I should like to hear Deputy Desmond trying to explain to the old, the unemployed and the poor that his version of mismanagement is a policy which brings about the fastest improvements in their situation.</P>
    <P>Numbers were cunningly and selectively brought into the argument on food prices.  There was reference to the fact that food prices had risen by 16 per cent in the year to the end of May.  I was waiting for the Deputy to deal with what has been happening in more recent months but he simply told us that there was the usual seasonal fall in food prices during the summer months.  We were not told what happened but the clear impression was conveyed to us that food prices had been rising and are rising more rapidly than non-food prices and that therefore the adverse effect of inflation on lower income groups who spend a greater fraction of their income on food was even more pronounced.  What has been happening?  According to the information I have, normal published statistics available to everybody, in the quarter from February to May of this <Col N="183" /> year food prices rose by two per cent, while non-food prices rose by 3.9 per cent.  In the quarter from mid-May to mid-August, food prices rose by 1.6 per cent and non-food prices rose by 5.2 per cent.  In other words, during that six-month period food prices rose by less than four per cent.  The latest indicators available suggest that this relatively modest rate of increase is continuing, so that it would be more accurate to say that for the best part of a year food prices are rising by about 8 per cent at a time when non-food prices are rising much more rapidly.</P>
    <P>No such information was put forward by Deputy Desmond, nor did he make any such inference.  We had an extraordinarily selective presentation.  Indeed, I think it is more accurate to say there was an extraordinary misrepresentation of the information under this heading.  If the Deputy wished to pursue the argument about a normal seasonal decline in prices during the summer months, why did he not tell us that there was a normal seasonal increase during the winter months.  The reason for the high figures during the earlier period is that much of the large increase in food prices last winter was associated with the exceptionally severe weather conditions which drove up the prices of vegetables, meat and a number of other items.</P>
    <P>That is the basic situation with regard to trends in food prices and movements in the income position of the social welfare groups.  There is no substance whatsoever in any argument which tries to allege that the policies of the Government have worsened their position.  On the contrary, as the information I have given to the House makes quite clear, the Government's approach has brought about the fastest improvement in more than a decade in the real living standards of the lower income categories.  This contrasts very sharply with the alleged concern demonstrated during the Coalition years.  Deputy Desmond was trying to have us believe that during the very difficult years in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis the Coalition Government had <Col N="184" /> managed to bring about a substantial improvement in the position of social welfare recipients.  That is not so.  Looking at the record for that four-year period one finds that the real improvement in the position of social welfare categories was somewhere in the region of 2 per cent per year.</P>
    <P>That contrasted very poorly with the real improvement of about 6 per cent per year that had taken place during the period 1969-73 of Fianna Fáil Government. It also contrasted very poorly with the 6 per cent improvement recorded in 1977-78 and, of course, it contrasts even more poorly with the approximate 8 per cent to 10 per cent improvement taking place this year.  There is the real record&mdash;a miserable 2 per cent improvement by the Coalition contrasting with past annual improvements of the order of 6 per cent during the period of office of Fianna Fáil and in this year, in the year of alleged mismanagement, a real improvement of from 8 per cent to 10 per cent under a Fianna Fáil Government. Hence my opening remark that I was astounded at the audacity of the Labour Party spokesman coming in here and trying to allege, as was evident from the wording of the motion and the tenor of their spokeman's remarks, that in some way the behaviour of the Government in this area had been against the interests of the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I should like to spend a few moments, just for the record, in pointing out some of the inaccuracies in Deputy Desmond's remarks.  I said that this was the third time that not only had we got the wrong argument but we had also got frequent misstatements of fact.  I almost ran out of space writing down the various inaccuracies.  When I have more time I may go through the official record and list all the inaccuracies as an interesting lesson in arithmetic but since I have not an obsession with arithmetic and believe in concentrating on the essentials, I shall just take a few examples that struck me while the Deputy was speaking.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Desmond was talking about improvements in social welfare <Col N="185" /> benefits this year he said &ldquo;All these increases have been eroded by inflation&rdquo;.  I have said that that is simply not so and I have given the information to demonstrate that it is not so.  I have not confined myself to innuendo, asides, ambiguous remarks or anything else.  I am quite happy to lay it clearly on the record of the House that the social welfare increases this year result in the best real improvement for more than a decade and that, therefore, they have not been eroded by inflation as alleged by Deputy Desmond.</P>
    <P>At another point Deputy Desmond referred to debating this subject earlier and, possibly in an attempt to justify coming back again today, he said that &ldquo;subsidies have been reduced throughout this year&rdquo;, implying that in some sense the Government had taken further action to reduce the subsidies since the specific changes agreed last January. The only major change I know of in the course of this year was in the completely opposite direction to the one Deputy Desmond had in mind.  The only change I could find quickly was that in July of this year as part of an EEC arrangement the subsidy on butter was increased so that the price was reduced by 5p per lb. If that is continuing to remove subsidies throughout the year, I can only say I am fascinated at the use of language&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If we are given the choice of availing of an EEC subsidy of course we will take it because there is a national benefit but that does not invalidate my basic argument that if it is the Irish Government spending Irish taxpayers' money and having a choice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is not the point at issue.  I am dealing with the specific point that Deputy Desmond was implying that subsidies had been reduced in the course of this year and I am quoting the only information I can find to show that the only change was in the opposite direction.</P>
      <P>The third interesting point he made&mdash;it takes us a little away from food subsidies but it bears on some of the other elements in the amendment proposed by the Government and perhaps it is not irrelevant&mdash;was that he thought this policy was self-defeating, that earlier in the year Ministers had been looking for a pay increase of 5 per cent and that subsequently they had to move away from that and accept the much higher settlement that emerged in the national understanding.  I do not recall anybody on the Government side of the House at any stage setting out a 5 per cent pay norm this year.  On a number of occasions I spoke about the size of the real improvement that could take place but I was very careful not to put a percentage figure on it.  I can recall the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste talking about the need to get pay increases this year down to single digits which, for most reasonable people, implies anything from 1 per cent to 9 per cent, not 10 per cent plus.  I do not recall any reference to 5 per cent.  I am not aware of the particular information Deputy Desmond had in mind.</P>
      <P>At another point he told us that food prices had risen consistently faster than non-food prices.  I think I have dealt with that in my earlier point about the actual rate of food price increases in the course of this year as against the course of non-food increases because for two quarters in a row they have risen more slowly and all the evidence available suggests that when the November figures are available they will confirm that pattern.  If the Deputy had wanted to make any statement for this year it would have been more accurate to say the opposite, that food prices have risen consistently at a slower rate than non-food prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fifth inaccuracy was the Deputy's statement that in pleading for reversal of <Col N="187" /> the Government's policy on subsidies and asking that they be restored he said that this was an item of expenditure, an element that was weighted emphatically in favour of the less well off.  Here was the Deputy again trying to put on the record what is simply not true because, as I made clear in my opening remarks, the policy of spending money on food subsidies does not favour the less well-off. Five-sixths of the money goes to the better-off and one-sixth goes to the less well-off.  He is five to one wrong on that matter.  I repeat that the way to favour the less well-off is to give any available funds directly to them.</P>
    <P>That is the essential argument about food subsidies but since there are one or two other topics that are touched on in the motion and in the amendment and since Deputy Desmond made a few passing references to them, perhaps I should deal with them as briefly as I can. Again, I shall have to correct an inaccuracy on his part.  He referred to this paltry sum of £22 million, asking what was this when the Government's budget is so large and when the IDA are going to spend £1,800 million on an investment programme.</P>
    <P>The IDA will not spend that money. That is the total investment in industry envisaged during that period.  On behalf of the Government, the IDA will spend a small fraction only of that sum by way of grants.  The bulk of the money will come from the investment capital and the various loans and so forth which these firms will undertake.  It is just an example of the liberal way in which numbers are tossed around without much regard for their accuracy or relevancy.</P>
    <P>In relation to the remarks about employment and helping the unemployed, there are a few points I would like to take up.  Although the live register is not an accurate indicator of the true level of unemployment, I cannot resist noting at this juncture, since we have had this debate so many times, that since the figure for unemployed is as Deputy Barry Desmond says, now standing at 85,000, it is a reduction of 23,000 in two <Col N="188" /> years and during that two year period it would seem that immigration has been of the order of 13,000 a year, say 26,000 or 27,000, to give a round figure of 50,000 for two years.  On the authority of the Leader of the Labour Party that is the figure that they should claim as the increase in employment in the past two years.  On a number of occasions when I sought to deal with what happened, with the relationship between increases in employment, the numbers on the live register, emigration movements and so forth, Deputy Cluskey consistently argued that there had been emigration last year and the year before of the order of 14,000 and that the fall in the live register was not due to any increase in employment, but to emigration, since the census figures demonstrate accurately that the reverse is the case, that there is an inflow of people rather than an outflow, the logic of the Labour Party argument as enunciated by their Leader should be that they accept that employment has increased more rapidly than the Government claim, by 50,000 in two years.  I will be delighted to hear their comments under that heading.</P>
    <P>When we previously debated this subject in March last I talked about the need to avoid looking at any of these policies in isolation, as it could be misleading and unhelpful to an overall grasp of the situation simply to look at what was happening to food subsidies or any one item. The Government's view was that if we were to make satisfactory progress in tackling our economic and social problems we needed a more comprehensive approach which would bring together policies dealing with employment, taxation, improvements in social welfare services and other elements relevant to securing economic and social advance. I am happy that in the intervening months we have been successful in developing that approach.  I refer to the fact that an agreement has been arrived at in the form of a national understanding with employers and trade unions which sets out to secure an agreement between all three parties to an overall programme designed to promote increased employment, to ensure that <Col N="189" /> taxation policies are in harmony with this and to bring about the fastest rate of social progress.  Under the terms of that understanding a number of changes have already taken place.  In addition to the improvement in social welfare benefits there has been an improvement in health eligibility limits and in the course of coming weeks there will be an income tax rebate to PAYE taxpayers as part of the specific proposals that have been arrived at under this more general framework.  It is in this more recent comprehensive approach to solving our economic and social problems that I see a greater hope for the future rather than in having the time of this House wasted in listening to material which is both inaccurate and out of date.</P>

      <P>The Minister's attitude in regard to this motion amazes me.  While we have had quite a long dissertation from the Minister in regard to food subsidies, employment and so on, in the election manifesto of 1977 Fianna Fáil spoke a lot about price control.  On page 11 of the manifesto it is stated:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will regard price control as an important matter and will therefore revert to the position where a member of the Government is responsible for it and for dealing with the underlying causes of inflation.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach designated either the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy or one of his Ministers of State as the person responsible for price control. I am therefore surprised that none of them is present in the House tonight. Without any disrespect to the Minister present, not he but the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy or one of his Ministers of State should be here because it is with them that the responsibility lies.  If a member of the Government is responsible for price control, the Government are failing with regard to this important matter.</P>

    <P>This motion is important throughout the country.  If we just touch briefly&mdash;because time does not permit a lengthy discourse&mdash;on the various <Col N="190" /> aspects of the mismanagement of the economy by the Government, or management as the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, would call it, we will show just what is happening.</P>
    <P>In the agricultural sector there has been a great deal of dispondency because of the Government's attitude to this section of the community.  There have been budget proposals and yet more proposals presented in this House which have affected the agricultural community.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your decision but feel the Chair in its wisdom is not correct when it prevents me from touching on those matters which deal with the economy.  Inflation has been dealt with.  In the three-month period to August the consumer price index rose by 4.1 per cent and up to mid-May it rose by 3.2 per cent.  If we recognise either of those increases, we could have a rate of inflation of 14, 15 or 16 per cent.  This is having a serious effect on prices and is causing serious problems for everyone.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of what arguments the Minister puts forward, the people are being seriously affected by inflation.  At the end of last year the Government decided to withdraw the subsidy of 8p per lb on butter, 2p per pint on milk and 2½p per kilogram on flour and wheatmeal.  This was a serious turn for the worst.  The less well-off sections of our community were most seriously affected.  If the Minister checks the figures in front of him he will see that until those subsidies were removed, the Government appeared to be making some progress in checking the rate of inflation, but from that point on, inflation started spiralling upwards and it appears to be continuing in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> When the Government withdrew the food subsidies that caused great alarm. Irrespective of how the Minister looks at it, the people most affected were those with large families and the less well off. The withdrawal of these subsidies was a grave blunder.  I ask the Minister to think over this matter in the quietness of his own home.  He said this was the third time this matter had been debated in this House, that he had heard the same argument and that he gave the same reply. Maybe we are wrong, but I honestly believe the Minister is wrong.  He is not listening to what is being said by the Opposition or by members of his own party because if he was he would accept this motion.</P>
    <P>I was amazed the Government decided to withdraw these subsidies and I am further amazed that the Government are refusing to restore them.  I want to touch briefly on a debate in this House on 18 February, 1975, when the present Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, then Deputy O'Malley, spoke on food subsidies.  At column 701 of the Official Report he said:</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most obvious of all the various steps open to the Government to take, which they are not taking at the moment, is the question of subsidies, and in particular subsidies on food.  In Britain, certain commodities such as butter, milk, and so on, which are paid for, for the most part, out of EEC funds, are subsidised.</P>
    <P>At that time the Minister for Industry and Commerce said we should have food subsidies.  At column 702, dealing with benefits the farming community were receiving when there was expansion in the economy and when farmers particularly were benefiting from the work of Deputy Mark Clinton in Europe, Deputy O'Malley said;</P>
    <P>Increases in the price to farmers for beef and milk were announced within the past week after an EEC decision. Inevitably, unless subsidies are introduced, there will be further increases, within the next couple of <Col N="193" /> weeks at the outside, to the consumer in the price of all these items.  Butter, milk, cheese and meat are fundamental basic necessities for everyday life. Their prices have been going up and up, and they will go up again.  With all the extra money which, happily, is coming into the country as a result of our entry into the EEC, and having regard to the good prices farmers are getting for beef and milk, surely it is possible for the Government to devote some of the extra money coming into the Exchequer to the subsidisation of these essential commodities as has been done in Britain very successfully.</P>
    <P>That was the view of the present Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in February 1975 when he wanted food subsidies brought in here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>For a man who quotes figures so freely I am surprised at him throwing out that remark.  Having asked for subsidies and spoken for them over long periods, you arrive in Government with these subsidies in existence and then decide to withdraw them.  That is a sad move for an Irish Government.  It is a grave mistake and even now the Government should realise it.  Even if a mistake is made people will be more sympathetic if the Government recognise it rather than compound it by continuing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should seriously consider restoring the food subsidies.  The subsidies that were made available and the efforts then made and made at different periods by us in Government helped to show that we were aware of increases in prices but we were prepared to deal with them.  In 1976 subsidies cost the Exchequer £39.82 million.  At column 988 of the Official Report of 8 <Col N="194" /> March 1977 the then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Bruton, said:</P>
    <P>Had these subsidies not been introduced the price of a lb. of butter would be 20 pence higher than it is today. The pint of milk would be twopence higher and the price of the standard loaf would be 5½ pence higher than it is today.  This year these subsidies will cost the Exchequer £48 million.</P>
    <P>The Government removed value-added tax from food in September, 1973.  That tax had been imposed on food by the Fianna Fáil Government. In July 1975, the Government removed value-added tax from clothes, footwear, electricity and heating fuels, all commodities upon which value-added tax had been imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>These food subsidies were introduced by us because we felt they would benefit sections of the community we felt we had a duty and obligation to assist and support.  A similar duty rests on the present Government.  They are not recognising it or standing up to it.  Now, when prices are escalating rapidly, when we see daily increases this is very important. The larger increases are normally held for late on Friday evening when most public representatives may not be available.  There was a particularly large number of price increases in July and August when this House was not meeting.  These were imposed on an unsuspecting public at a time when the Government felt something else would prevent them from getting the attention they deserved.</P>
    <P>Some of these price rises had a serious effect on the economy.  Many will have a spin-off affecting other sections of the community.  I see the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs arriving in the House. On 5 July 1979 he announced a 20 per cent increase in postal charges which directly or indirectly affected industry and business.  Another increase was announced in regard to CIE fares when bus and rail fares and freight charges rose by <Col N="195" /> up to 20 per cent.  This increase hit the poorer section of the community particularly hard, those without motor cars who use public transport to get to and from work.  A 20 per cent increase was certainly serious for them.  Prior to that we had a 19.5 per cent increase in ESB charges.  The Minister talks of 13 per cent and 14 per cent in different items but increases in these items really hit the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks we have seen the price rises that occurred and all of them are affecting the larger families, the people in the lower income group, people not in a position to meet them.  The Government must not be conscious of the serious effect these increases are having on such people.  As prices are going, the Minister should seriously consider doing something in regard to fuel and heating in the coming winter.  I had a telephone call yesterday morning from a doctor attending two people living together.  He is seriously concerned about their prospects of obtaining fuel for the winter because they may be unable to obtain solid fuel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter that I asked to raise was the chaotic state of the postal services and the telecommunication system.  In 1971 when we had a crisis in the country a then Fianna Fáil Minister raised the query: &ldquo;What crisis?&rdquo;  Six months ago when we had a very severe petrol shortage the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy O'Malley, re-echoed that query when he said: &ldquo;What crisis?&rdquo;  He said there was no problem whatsoever but that was not the case as we found out.  In recent months the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has been giving us the same type of answer to questions asked about what is being done about the postal services and the telecommunication system. He would prefer not to know that there <Col N="196" /> is a grave crisis and to dismiss the matter out of hand.  It is only as a result of repeated complaints and an outcry from the public at large that we had a response from the Minister in recent weeks from spokesmen at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>There has been a serious deterioration in the postal services in the last seven or eight months.  We had a strike which lasted 19 weeks.  When that strike ended in June we expected a quick return to normality.  Unfortunately that has not been the case.  We are entitled to ask the Minister when are things going to return to normal and why it has taken so long. What has the Minister done in the interim to ensure that normal conditions and a normal service are obtained?  We have been asking this for some months but have not got a definite reply.  We got the impression that the Minister was hedging.  We, the ordinary man on the street, the housewife, our business and industrial interest, would all like to know when matters will return to normal and when we can expect a dependable service.  The service has been quite chaotic.  Despite statements from spokesmen in the Minister's Department that things are improving evidence would suggest the contrary.  Matters have not improved.  Letters posted in Dublin are still taking up to two and three weeks to reach destinations in the country.</P>
      <P>The kernel of the problem seems to be centred in Dublin.  Letters to and from Dublin are extremely badly affected as are internal postal services in Dublin. The average length of delivery given by spokesmen from the Minister's Department, two days, is not taken seriously by people who are affected.  Experience shows that delays are, on average, much greater.  I am delighted and surprised when I get a letter from Dublin within two or three days.  It is the exception rather than the rule.  It is much more likely to be in the two-week category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industry and business concerns feel the brunt on occasions like this.  We had complaints from industrialists around the country that they cannot meet orders and some have threatened to close down. <Col N="197" /> To verify that fact I refer to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 9 October 1979, where it was reported that a Swedish businessman in Macroom, County Cork, Mr. Lars Edman of Prince August Moulds said that letters from Dublin were taking between five and 21 days to reach him while those from abroad took at least ten days.  The report states:</P>
    <P>Mr. Edman said he had lost over £20,000 during the postal strike earlier this year, and had no intention of sitting back and letting the same thing happen again.  He said he would relocate his factory outside Ireland if the service didn't soon improve.</P>
    <P>That is a general sentiment shared by businessmen particularly those from abroad who have set up here.  They are used to a comparatively efficient service. They were getting that up to recently. Now, however, things have deteriorated. Their business is affected and they are thinking of withdrawing.</P>
    <P>Ours was one of the world's best postal services.  Let us give credit where credit is due.  It was excellent and it is a sad state of affairs that this deterioration has taken place.  In an editorial in a national newspaper recently the question was raised: could the same thing happen here as happened in Britain after the catastrophic postal strike in 1971 where, as a result, things never really returned to normal in the British Post Office.  The ideal of having a letter delivered the day after it is posted has virtually disappeared in Britain and delays of up to five days are commonplace.  That position obtains in Ireland at present and even greater delays are being experienced.  I hope we do not have the same experience as Britain where things never got back to normal.  We hope the Minister will give us some direct answers because this is the first time we have had an opportunity of speaking to him in public and asking him to tell us what has happened and why these two services have virtually broken down.</P>
    <P>I and other politicians can ride fairly well this kind of situation where letters arrive late.  The people I feel sorry for, <Col N="198" /> who have been coming to me in droves and whom I have not been able to help as well as I would wish, are those on disability benefit&mdash;insured workers who are out of employment through illness. Generally these are married men with young families.  By the time their medical certificates reach the Department of Social Welfare, are dealt with by that Department and the cheque returned to the recipient, a month or six weeks can elapse causing great hardship to such people.  They must go to the local relieving officer and virtually beg money to exist in the meantime.  That person is severely hit.  Retired civil servants, school teachers and others on pension depending on the post to receive their remittances have been hit as well.  Most of these people are very proud and do not like running up bills or credit in shops.  Some of them have had extreme difficulty.</P>
    <P>In our opinion the Minister should have made an effort four months ago and not two weeks ago when criticism became severe.  The day the postal strike ended he should have made an effort to see that matters returned to normal within a few days.  That did not happen and people want to know the reason for the present situation and when matters will be rectified.  There are some obvious reasons and one is shortage of staff. While we know that making up the shortfall of staff will cost money, the first obligation of the Government must be to see that the staff is up to the proper proportion.  From reports in the papers this has not been the case.</P>
    <P>It is only in recent weeks that the shortfall in staff is being rectified and that the Department are advertising for extra staff.  The sorting offices in Dublin, particularly the one in Sheriff Street, seem to have been affected by a large drop in the number of sorters.  Many workers who left during the postal strike did not return when it was over because they found better jobs.  That is an indictment of the working conditions that existed before the strike.  If hundreds of those people could find employment offering better pay and conditions it is an indication that there is something wrong <Col N="199" /> in that Department.  I should like to know what the Minister intends doing about making up the shortage of staff that exists.</P>
    <P>In the course of their report the body which reviewed the postal services last May suggested that that service be separated from the Department and operated as a State-sponsored body.  The review body also suggested that executives from the private sector should be recruited to introduce business acumen in the running of the service.  As spokesman in this area for Fine Gael I publicly supported that view and the Government's commitment to implement it because in the long term the recommendation would prove an excellent solution to a problem that has bedevilled the postal and telecommunication service.  I should like to point out to the Minister that things did not improve following the settlement of the engineers' dispute earlier this year.  The Minister was remiss in this regard.  He should make a statement outlining to the House why the situation has not improved. The telephone system got worse since the dispute and callers are experiencing more frequent breakdowns. The chances of one getting through, whether on a long distance or local call, are very remote.</P>
    <P>A lot of things can happen to those fortunate enough to be in an area serviced by an automatic exchange.  One may not get any sound having dialled a number or, having got through, one may be cut off after one minute's conversation. The latter is the subject of many complaints.  Many other annoying things happen.  For instance, in Dublin on local calls the noise over the telephones would shatter one's eardrum.  Crossed lines are also a great nuisance.  Technicians employed in the telecommunications sector have alleged that they cannot get the most basic pieces of equipment from the P &amp; T stores.  It appears that that allegation is correct.  Technicians have told me that if they put in a requisition order for telephone instruments or other simple pieces of equipment it is likely they will be told that the equipment is not <Col N="200" /> available.  Obviously, the money is not being provided.  The Minister owes the public an explanation with regard to this matter.  There is a shortage of materials.</P>
    <P>Another cause for concern is the shortage of staff.  It is not possible, even with the best equipment, to give a proper service if there is a shortage of staff.  I believe that a big number of telephonists left the service during the strike but the Department have not engaged in an intensive campaign to recruit new staff. We are all aware that the delay in getting through to exchanges is great and that one can be hanging on for up to 15 minutes without getting a reply.  The obvious cause of that is lack of staff.  People would be better off forgetting about the telegram service because frequently they are told that they will not be delivered until the following day and even for three days.  That system is not functioning.</P>
    <P>On the question of the installation of telephones I should like to state that when Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien was Minister Fianna Fáil claimed that he was not doing his job in that Department because of his concern about Northern Ireland and foreign affairs.  Dr. O'Brien was concerned about other matters because he has a social conscience but he had an excuse if things were not going properly in his Department.  I should like to know if the Minister, or his Minister of State, have any excuse.  Dr. O'Brien did good work in other fields as well as looking after his Department.</P>

      <P>When history is written Dr. O'Brien will be remembered while the Deputy will not be mentioned.  It is my view that Dr. O'Brien will be mentioned in a favourable light.  If one was waiting two years for the installation of a telephone one was almost guaranteed <Col N="201" /> that the application would be dealt with within a matter of weeks but now technicians say that a wait of four and five years is not exceptional.  They have told me that there is no hope of an improvement for a considerable time.  At present there is a waiting list of 65,000 people and, according to the review body, that waiting list is likely to increase to 100,000 by 1981.  That is an example of how the situation has deteriorated.</P>
      <P>The Minister should tell the House the plans he has for rectifying that situation. Throughout the summer we read letters in the newspapers from irate members of the public complaining about the postal and telephone services.  A Sligo industrialist, Mr. Hanson, who employs 250 people criticised the telephone service and stated that when he met the Minister on 23 March he was told that a micro-wave system of direct dialling to 38 countries would be introduced shortly. He pointed out in the course of a letter to the Editor of <i>The Irish Press</i> that today he would be happy to have a line to Dublin.  We have all heard of similar complaints from around the country.  To cap it all on 9 October in <i>The Irish Times</i> the Department of Posts and Telegraphs outlined the latest dates for posting to ensure pre-Christmas delivery.  The deadline for parcels being sent surface mail to Australasia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malasia and the Philippines has already passed; it was yesterday.  What a wonderful way to run a service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>From my experience of the statements issued by Deputy Deasy about the postal service in recent times probably it would be too much for me to expect that he would make a positive or helpful contribution here this evening.  I would have thought, however, that the Deputy might have considered the effect of wild and ill-considered comments on the morale of the local post office <Col N="202" /> managements and staff who have been tackling the job of getting the postal service back to normal.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that the service has improved considerably and will continue to improve.  Checks by my Department indicate that at present a large part of the mail is being delivered on the day after posting, and the great bulk within two days.  I know it grieves the Deputies opposite to hear this, but this is a fact.</P>

      <P>The Deputies are very well aware of the facts.  That is why they were so anxious to rush in this evening on the Adjournment Debate because, if they left it any longer, they know that they would look absolutely ridiculous complaining about the situation.  This improvement was brought about as a result of the special measures adopted and the efforts of the Post Office management and staff.  I want to express my appreciation in the House for the efforts which have been and are being made by the staff.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the postal delivery service has been unsatisfactory recently for reasons which I will explain.  I should like to express regret to the public for the inconvenience they suffered as a result.  I might say in passing that I welcome constructive criticism.  Unfortunately, however, some criticism reported in the media was found, on inquiry, to be inaccurate and exaggerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I will in a minute.  The background to the recent difficulties is that, following the postal strike, the Department were faced with the processing and delivery of a massive backlog of mail which had accumulated in Britain and in other countries.  The first priority <Col N="203" /> was to dispose of this mail as quickly as possible so that the postal services could be resumed and new postings accepted. In order that that backlog be cleared quickly, one of the steps taken was that, with the agreement of the staff, all annual leave be postponed for a month after work had resumed.  Because of this it was possible to begin accepting new postings much earlier than had been expected. Postings, when services were restored, were abnormally large.  It is not recognised or understood by the public that, on average, over 1,250,000 letters are normally handled each day.  This level was considerably exceeded due to the posting of mail which was accumulated by users of the service during the strike, and postings after the service was resumed were regularly in excess of 2 million items a day.  The size of the task which faced the postal staff arising from such a very considerable volume of mail traffic alone will be readily appreciated. For my own part I have made it clear to the public at all times that the task which would arise in the aftermath of the strike would be formidable and that it would take time to get the service right.  The main reason for the postal delays has been an unavoidable shortage of staff.  A large number of vacancies resulted from the interruption of recruitment caused by the strike.  Absences on annual leave had been running at twice the normal maximum level because of the compression of the leave season due to the strike and the postponement of annual leave after the resumption of work.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what Deputy Deasy said here, losses of staff attributable to the strike itself were very small.  There are 1,800 workers in the central telephone exchange, of whom only 6 did not return after the strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Six or 600?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Six.  In the Dublin postal district where there are 2,500 workers only 23 did not return after the strike.  The Deputy should remember that that was one of the exaggerated statements he made and which he has <Col N="204" /> repeated here in this House.  For the reasons I have mentioned, among others, staff hours in many parts of the postal service have been running at 30 per cent below normal.</P>
      <P>Special measures were taken since work was resumed to rectify the situation and bring the service back to normal. Immediately after resumption all remaining successful candidates from the 1978 postman competition were offered employment.  The 1979 competition which was due to be held early in the year had to be deferred because of the strike.  This competition was advertised immediately the strike ended and the interviewing of candidates commenced within a few days of the closing date of applications.  The Civil Service Commission took special measures to have applicants interviewed and results made available as quickly as possible.  Candidates from the competition have already been offered appointments and many have been assigned.  Appointment procedures have been speeded up generally and further recruitment is being pressed ahead as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Various other special measures were taken.  Staff are working substantial levels of overtime.  Temporary staff have been employed in a number of areas.  I should add here that temporary staff do not necessarily constitute a full solution for all staff shortages because the scope for using untrained people is not unlimited. Exceptional mail circulation and other measures have been introduced, including the processing of mail normally dealt with in the central sorting office at various other Dublin offices and also at provincial offices.  The Department are pressing ahead with efforts to maintain the improvement and to get back to the full, traditional standards which I am glad to be able to say are very high by international standards.</P>

      <P>I repeat that I regret the problems and inconvenience caused by the recent postal delays.

      <P>We also had exaggerated statements from, and very much publicity was given to a gentleman who claimed that a batch of 300 circulars had taken more than 21 days to be delivered.  On inquiry my Department found not only that the letters had not been posted anything like 21 days before but that effectively the ground the complainant had for his statement was that only a small number of the people who <Col N="206" /> presumably had got the circular had turned up for the meeting advertised in the circular.  When he was pressed to know why he said 21 days, he said: Oh, I said to the reporter that a friend of mine in Clifden told me that it took 21 days for a letter to come from the Aran Islands to Clifden.  It had nothing at all to do with his meeting.  Yet it was used as hard news on radio and in the media generally and it has been used in leading articles in a variety of unjustified attacks on the Department and their staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the telephone service, most of the complaints received in my Department in recent months about the standard of the telecommunications service referred to difficulties in contacting the operator and failure rate on the STD calls.  As far as the delay in answering by the operator is concerned, the chief cause was the suspension of the recruitment and training of telephonists during the Post Office Workers Union strike and the subsequent need to compress the leave season into a shorter than usual period.  A number of measures have been taken to overcome this problem.  Recruitment and training is being pressed ahead as quickly as possible.  Overtime is being worked to the maximum extent practicable. There has been a gradual improvement in the position and this will continue.</P>
      <P>The STD service is not up to standard because on many trunk routes there is insufficient capacity for the volume of traffic, and that did not arise in the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <P>The Minister should conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case relief can be provided only by way of new equipment and additional trunk circuits. Many such schemes are in progress, and I shall mention one only&mdash;a major new trunk exchange will come into service in Dublin next year and this will provide an additional 8,000 trunk circuits.</P>
      <P>We all recognise the reality of the situation, that telephone problems cannot be solved quickly or easily.  That is the assessment of the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group which reported a few months ago.  A large amount of work has to be done at a massive cost. Already large numbers of new relief works are in progress or are at an advanced planning stage.  For example, next week in Letterkenny I will open a new automatic exchange, thereby paving the way for the extensive auto-conversion programme in County Donegal over the next few years.  I announced a £650 million investment programme over the next five years.  The programmes targets involve doubling the size of the existing network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> It is clear from all I have said here that the Government are unreservedly resolved to have the quality of the telecommunications service raised to a high level as quickly as possible.  Our present problems have arisen over a long period.  Never before has there been such Government determination to have them settled once and for all and within a relatively short time.</P>
    <P>May I end by saying that I do not think it is appreciated that in the post office service there are 28,000 people working in thousands of centres throughout the country serving in over 100 different grades.  In those circumstances it might be appreciated by all concerned&mdash;and particularly by those who are so quick to criticise&mdash;what are the problems and difficulties that face us. Nevertheless we are overcoming these problems and I am very glad once again to be able to tell the country that the postal service is coming very close to normal.</P>

      <P>Applications for aid from the European Regional Development Fund are based not on proposals submitted to my Department by local authorities but on information supplied by the Government Departments responsible for the implementation of the public capital programme.  In making their proposals Departments take fully into account all eligible projects, including those administered by the local authorities, and suitable projects are selected for submission for ERDF aid.  It is necessary to make such a selection because the total value of eligible projects greatly exceeds our quota of the fund.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the attached statement.  The disparity between the figures for receipts and those for allocations arises because there is normally a time-lag between the approval of grants and their date of payment, with the result that receipts from the Community to date have been less than the amount of grants approved.</P>

      <P>Since the establishment of the European Regional Development Fund in 1975, Ireland has taken up its full quota each year.  In addition, it has availed itself of the arrangement whereby commitment appropriations not taken up by member states at the end of any year can be allocated to another member state in that year and set off against the latter state's quota for the subsequent year.  Details of the position to date are set out in tabular form below.  Applications totalling a further £14.09 million are at present being considered by the Commission.</P>
      <P>In addition to the national quotas, there is a small non-quota section of the fund.  Discussions are taking place with the Commission to secure aid from this non-quota section for the economic development of the areas adjoining the Border with Northern Ireland.</P>

    <P>(a)  1979 Commitment figures cover the period January-September.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where a project does not proceed as planned, the member state concerned can request decommitment of ERDF aid for that project; the sum decommitted can then be reallocated to another project in the same member State.  The take-up of Ireland's quota can most accurately be seen by comparing the figures in columns (a) and (d).</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, County Mayo, for administrative purposes, falls within the board's Galway and Sligo districts.  Consequently, information relating to Mayo exclusively is not available.  However, Galway district, which covers most of County Galway and part of County Mayo, has approximately 450 applications on hands which are in various stages of processing.  The normal waiting period is approximately four months from date of application.</P>
      <P>Sligo district, which covers Counties Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and parts of Counties Roscommon, Cavan and Mayo, has approximately 500 applications on hands also with an average waiting period of four months.</P>
      <P>A waiting period of four months is not considered unreasonable by the board in that people are encouraged to apply for connection before house construction begins and applicants will generally have supply connected by the time the houses are ready for occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Castlebar area there is, unfortunately, a waiting period of about 12 months due to the large volume of work on hands.  Almost 200 houses were eligible for connection under the terms of the Electricity (Supply) Amendment Act, 1976, and about 85 remain to be connected. While the board are committed to supplying these houses as soon as possible and had originally hoped to have connections completed this year, the completion date is now April next.  The delays are primarily due to the fact that <Col N="80" /> many applicants are situated in the most isolated areas of County Mayo and connection involves the erection of a substantial supply network over extremely difficult terrain.  Particularly severe weather conditions last winter also adversely affected the connection schedule. However, the board advice me that they are gradually reducing the waiting period and it is expected to be in line with the rest of the country in the near future.</P>

            <entry>Ireland sought a derogation from the application of directive for five years</entry>
            <entry>This Directive was concerned with the structure and the basis of assessment of excise duty on tobacco and established a harmonised excise system based on a charge on the finished tobacco product.  Derogation was sought because of the difficulties involved for Irish industry in changing over from the former system, which was based on the changing of excise duty on the importers leaf tobacco, to one based on the finished product.</entry>

            <entry> Ireland requested in February, 1976 authorisation from the Commission to derogate from the rules on equal pay between men and women.  The reasons why authorisation to derogate was sought were stated to be the high rates of unemployment and inflation prevailing in Ireland and the serious economic situation in particular areas of the Irish economy so that the introduction of equal pay in these circumstances might, by imposing additional burdens on undertakings result in an increase in the level of unemployment or affect the financial viability of business.</entry>

    <P>Precise information about unclaimed amounts of approved grants in respect of years after 1976 is not available, as some claims for payments in respect of operations carried out in those years are still outstanding.  The preparation of payments claims is a matter in the first instance for the individual organisations responsible for carrying out the programme of operations for which Social Fund assistance has been approved. These organisations include bodies in both the public and the private sectors.  There is inevitably a time lag, which varies from case to case, between the date of completion of a programme and the submission of a claim for payment of Social Fund grant as the promoting body is required in each case to provide full information about the operations carried out and details of the expenditure incurred on those operations.</P>
    <P>The discrepancies between the amounts of Social Fund grants approved and eventually claimed arise principally because the amounts approved are maximum amounts based on programmes set out in applications for assistance submitted in advance whereas amounts claimed must be based on operations actually carried out and expenditure incurred. Thus, the full amounts of Social Fund assistance approved cannot be claimed where programmes are cancelled, postponed or reduced in scale. The extent to which approved grants can be claimed depends, therefore, on the ability of individual promoters to carry out the work for which grants have been approved.</P>

      <P>The workers in question were made redundant in April 1976 and received the statutory redundancy lump sums to which they were entitled.</P>
      <P>Representations were recently made to me to the effect that the workers in question should now get any differences between the statutory lump sums which they received in 1976 and those which they might have received were their lump sums calculated under the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1979. Improved lump sums are possible under the 1979 Act to the extent that the wage ceiling applied in the calculation of lump sums was increased from £2,500 to £5,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept that the workers in question were placed at a disadvantage. They received their statutory entitlements in accordance with the law in force at the date they were made redundant and in this respect they are in the <Col N="97" /> same position as all other workers made redundant before the 1979 Act came into force.  I feel I should add that they were one of the more fortunate groups of workers to secure re-employment almost at once&mdash;with a break of only a few days&mdash;in the same business under new ownership.</P>
